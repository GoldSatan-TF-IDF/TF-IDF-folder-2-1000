intrepid reporters at the exile bournes adventures in moscow and arkadins history in nizhny tagil would not have existed without their help gregg winter for turning me on to the logistics of transporting lng henry morrison for clutch ideating at all hours a note to my readers i try to be as factual as possible in my novels but this is after all a work of fiction in order to make the story as exciting as possible ive inevitably taken artistic license here and there with places objects and possibly even time i trust readers will overlook these small anomalies and enjoy the ride prologue high security prison colony nizhny tagil russia campione ditalia switzerland while the four inmates waited for borya maks to appear they lounged against filthy stone walls whose cold no longer affected them out in the prison yard where they smoked expensive blackmarket cigarettes made from harsh black turkish tobacco they talked among themselves as if they had nothing better to do than to suck the acrid smoke into their lungs expel it in puffs that seemed to harden in the freezing air above their heads was a cloudless sky whose glittering starlight turned it into a depthless enamel shell ursa major lynx canes venatici perseusthese same constellations burned the heavens above moscow six hundred miles to the southwest but how different life was here from the gaudy overheated clubs of trehgorny val and sadovnicheskaya street by day the inmates of colony manufactured parts for the t russia s formidable battle tank but at night what do men without conscience or emotion talk to one another about strangely family there was a stability to coming home to a wife and children that defined their previous lives like the massive walls of high security colony defined their present ones what they did to earn moneylie cheat steal extort blackmail torture and killwas all they knew that they did these things well was a given otherwise they would have been dead theirs was a life outside civilization as most people knew it returning to the warmth of a familiar woman to the homey smells of sweet beets boiled cabbage stewed meat the fire of peppery vodka was a comfort that made them all nostalgic the nostalgia bound them as securely as the tattoos of their shadowy profession a soft whistle cut through the frosty night air evaporated their reminiscences like turpentine on oil paint the night lost all its imagined color returned to blue and black as borya maks appeared maks was a big mana man who lifted weights for an hour followed by ninety minutes of skipping rope every single day hed been inside as a contract killer for kazanskaya a branch of the russian grupperovka trafficking in drugs and blackmarket cars he held a certain status among the fifteen hundred inmates of colony the guards feared and despised him his reputation preceded him like a shadow at sunset he was not unlike the eye of a hurricane around which swirled the howling winds of violence and death the latest being the fifth man in the group that was now four kazanskaya or no kazanskaya maks had to be punished otherwise all of them knew their days in colony were numbered they smiled at maks one of them offered him a cigarette another lit it for him as he bent forward cupping a hand to keep the tiny flame alive in the wind the other two men each grabbed one of makss steelbanded arms while the man who had offered the cigarette drove a makeshift knife hed painstakingly honed in the prison factory toward makss solar plexus at the last instant maks slapped it away with a superbly attuned flick of his hand immediately the man with the burned match delivered a vicious uppercut to the point of makss chin maks staggered back into the chests of the two men holding his arms but at the same time he stomped the heel of his left boot onto the instep of one of the men holding him shaking his left arm free he swung his body in a sharp arc driving his cocked elbow into the rib cage of the man holding his right arm free for the moment he put his back against the wall deep in shadow the four closed ranks moving in for the kill the one with the knife stepped to the fore another slipped a curved scrap of metal over his knuckles the fight began in earnest with grunts of pain and effort showers of sweat smears of blood maks was powerful and canny his reputation was well deserved but though he delivered as good as he got he was facing four determined enemies when maks drove one to his knees another would take his place so that there were always two of them beating at him while the others regrouped and repaired themselves as best they could the four had had no illusions about the task ahead of them they knew theyd never overcome maks at the first or even the second attack their plan was to wear him down in shifts while they took breaks they allowed him none and it appeared to be working bloody and bruised they continued their relentless assault until maks drove the edge of his hand into the throat of one of the fourthe one with the homemade knifecrushing his cricoid cartilage as the man staggered back into the arms of his compatriots gasping like a hooked fish maks grabbed the knife out of his hand then his eyes rolled up and he became a deadweight blinded by rage and bloodlust the remaining three charged maks their rush almost succeeded in getting inside makss defenses but he dealt with them calmly and efficiently muscles popped along his arms as he turned presenting his left side to them giving them a smaller target even as he used the knife in short flicking thrusts and stabs to inflict a picket line of wounds that though not deep produced a welter of blood this was deliberate makss counter to their tactic of trying to wear him out fatigue was one thing loss of blood quite another one of his assailants lunged forward slipped on his own blood and maks hammered him down this created an opening and the one with the makeshift knuckleduster moved in slamming the metal into the side of makss neck maks at once lost breath and strength the remaining men beat an unholy tattoo on him and were on the verge of plowing him under when a guard emerged out of the murk to drive them methodically back with a solid wood truncheon whose force was far more devastating than any piece of scrap metal could be a shoulder separated then cracked under the expertly wielded truncheon another man had the side of his skull staved in the third turning to flee was struck flush on his third sacral vertebra which shattered on impact breaking his back what are you doing maks said to the guard between attempts to regain control of his breathing i assumed these bastards bribed all the guards they did the guard grabbed makss elbow this way he indicated with the glistening end of the truncheon makss eyes narrowed thats not the way back to the cells do you want to get out of here or not the guard said maks nodded his conditional assent and the two men loped across the deserted yard the guard kept his body pressed against the wall and maks followed suit they moved at a deliberate pace he saw that kept them out of the beams of the roving spotlights he would have wondered who this guard was but there was no time besides in the back of his mind hed been expecting something like this he knew his boss the head of the kazanskaya wasnt going to let him rot in colony for the rest of his life if only because he was too valuable an asset to let rot who could possibly replace the great borya maks only one perhaps leonid arkadin but arkadinwhoever he was no one maks knew had ever met him or seen his facewouldnt work for kazanskaya or any of the families he was a freelancer the last of a dying breed if he existed at all which frankly maks doubted hed grown up with stories of bogeymen with all manner of unbelievable powersfor some perverse reason russians delighted in trying to scare their children but the fact was maks never believed in bogeymen was never scared he had no reason to be scared of the specter of leonid arkadin either by this time the guard had pulled open a door midway along the wall they ducked in just as a searchlight beam crawled across the stones against which moments before they had been pressed after several turnings he found himself in the corridor that led to the communal mens shower beyond which he knew was one of the two entries to the wing of the prison how this guard meant to get them through the checkpoints was anyones guess but maks wasted no energy trying to secondguess him up to now hed known just what to do and how to do it why should this be any different the man was clearly a professional hed researched the prison thoroughly he obviously had major juice behind him first to have gotten in here second to have the apparent run of the place that was makss boss all over as they moved down the corridor toward the opening to the showers maks said who are you my name is unimportant the guard said who sent me is not maks absorbed everything in the unnatural stillness of the prison night the guards russian was flawless but to makss practiced eye he didnt look russian or georgian chechen ukrainian or azerbaijani for that matter he was small by makss standards but then almost everyone was small by his standards his body was toned though its responses finely honed he possessed the preternatural stillness of properly harnessed energy he made no move unless he needed to and then used only the amount of energy required no more maks himself was like this so it was easy for him to spot the subtle signs others would miss the guards eyes were pale his expression grim almost detached like a surgeon in the or his light hair thick on top spiked in a style that would have been unfamiliar to maks had he not been an aficionado of international magazines and foreign films in fact if maks didnt know better hed say the guard was american but that was impossible makss boss didnt employ americans he coopted them so maslov sent you maks said dimitri maslov was the head of kazanskaya its about fucking time let me tell you fifteen months in this place feels like fifteen years at that moment as they came abreast of the showers the guard without turning fully around swung the truncheon into the side of makss head maks taken completely by surprise staggered onto the bare concrete floor of the shower room which reeked of mildew disinfectant and men lacking proper hygiene the guard came after him as nonchalantly as if he were out for the evening with a girl on his arm he swung the truncheon almost lazily he struck maks on his left biceps just hard enough to herd him backward toward the line of showerheads protruding from the moist rear wall but maks refused to be herded by this guard or by anyone else as the truncheon whistled down from the apex of its arc he stepped forward broke the trajectory of the blow with his tensed forearm now inside the guards line of defense he could go to work in the way that suited the situation best the homemade knife was in his left hand he thrust it pointfirst when the guard moved to block it he slashed upward ripping the edge of the blade against flesh hed aimed for the underside of the guards wrist the nexus of veins that if severed would render the hand useless the guards reflexes were as fast as his own though and instead the blade scored the arm of the leather jacket but it did not penetrate the leather as it should have maks only had time to register that the jacket must be lined with kevlar or some other impenetrable material before the callused edge of the guards hand struck the knife from his grip another blow sent him reeling back he tripped over one of the drain holes his heel sinking into it and the guard smashed the sole of his boot into the side of makss knee there was an awful sound the grinding of bone against bone as makss right leg collapsed as the guard closed in he said it wasnt dimitri maslov who sent me it was pyotr zilber maks struggled to extricate his heel which he could no longer feel from the drain hole i dont know who youre talking about the guard grabbed his shirtfront you killed his brother aleksei one shot to the back of the head they found him facedown in the moskva river it was business maks said just business yes well this is personal the guard said as he drove his knee into makss crotch maks doubled over when the guard bent to haul him upright he slammed the top of his head against the point of the guards chin blood spurted from between the guards lips as his teeth cut into his tongue maks used this advantage to drive his fist into the guards side just over his kidney the guards eyes opened widethe only indication that he felt painand he kicked makss ruined knee maks went down and stayed down agony flowed in a river through him as he struggled to compartmentalize it the guard kicked again he felt his ribs give way his cheek kissed the stinking concrete floor he lay dazed unable to rise the guard squatted down beside him seeing the grimace the guard made gave maks a measure of satisfaction but that was all he was destined to receive in the way of solace i have money maks gasped weakly its buried in a safe place where no one will find it if you get me out of here ill lead you to it you can have half thats over half a million american dollars this only made the guard angry he struck maks hard on his ear making sparks fly behind his eyes his head rang with a pain that in anyone else would have been unendurable do you think im like you that i have no loyalty he spat into makss face poor maks you made a grave error killing this boy people like pyotr zilber never forget and they have the means to move heaven and earth to get what they want all right maks whispered you can have it all more than a million dollars pyotr zilber wants you dead maks i came here to tell you that and to kill you his expression changed subtly but first he extended makss left arm trod on the wrist pinning it securely against the rough concrete he then produced a pair of thickbladed pruning shears this procedure roused maks from his paininduced lethargy what are you doing the guard grasped makss thumb on the back of which was a tattoo of a skull mirroring the larger one on his chest it was a symbol of makss exalted status in his murderous profession besides wanting you to know the identity of the man who ordered your death pyotr zilber requires proof of your demise maks the guard settled the shears at the base of makss thumb then he squeezed the handles together maks made a gurgling sound not unlike that of a baby as a butcher would the guard wrapped the thumb in a square of waxed paper snapped a rubber band around it then sealed it in a plastic bag who are you maks managed to get out my name is arkadin the guard said he opened his shirt revealing a pair of candlestick tattoos on his chest or in your case death with a movement full of grace arkadin broke makss neck crisp alpine sunlight lit up campione ditalia a tiny exquisite italian enclave of twothirds of a square mile nestled within the clockworkperfect setting of switzerland owing to its prime position on the eastern edge of lake lugano it was both stupendously picturesque and an excellent place to be domiciled like monaco it was a tax haven for wealthy individuals who owned magnificent villas and gambled away idle hours at the casino di campione money and valuables could be stored in swiss banks with their justly famous reputation for discreet service completely shielded from international law enforcements prying eyes it was this littleknown idyllic setting that pyotr zilber chose for the first facetoface meeting with leonid arkadin he had contacted arkadin through an intermediary for various security reasons opting not to contact the contract killer directly from an early age pyotr had learned that there was no such thing as being too securityminded there was a heavy burden of responsibility being born into a family with secrets from his lofty perch on the overlook just off via totone pyotr had a breathtaking panorama of the redbrown tile roofs of the chalets and apartment houses the palmlined squares of the town the cerulean waters of the lake the mountains their shoulders mantled with capes of mist the distant drone of powerboats leaving frothy scimitars of white wake came to him intermittently while he sat in his gray bmw in truth part of his mind was already on his imminent trip having gotten the stolen document he had sent it on the long journey along his network to its ultimate end being here excited him in the most extraordinary way his anticipation of what was to come of the accolades he would receive especially from his father sent an electric charge through him he was on the brink of an unimaginable victory arkadin had called him from the moscow airport to tell him that the operation had been successful that he had in his possession the physical proof pyotr required he had taken a risk going after maks but the man had murdered pyotrs brother was he supposed to turn his cheek and forget the affront he knew better than anyone his fathers stern dictum to keep to the shadows to remain hidden but he thought this one act of vengeance was worth the risk besides hed handled the matter via intermediaries the way he knew his father would have hearing the deep growl of a car engine he turned saw a dark blue mercedes come up the rise toward the overlook the only real risk he was taking was going to happen right now and that he knew couldnt be helped if leonid arkadin was able to infiltrate colony in nizhny tagil and kill borya maks he was the man for the next job pyotr had in mind one his father should have taken care of years ago now he had a chance to finish what his father was too timid to attempt to the bold belonged the spoils the document hed procured was proof positive that the time for caution was at an end the mercedes drew to a stop beside his bmw a man with light hair and even lighter eyes emerging with the fluidity of a tiger he was not a particularly large man he wasnt overmuscled like many of the russian grupperovka personnel nevertheless something inside him radiated a quiet menace pyotr found impressive from a very young age pyotr had been exposed to dangerous men at the age of eleven he had killed a man who had threatened his mother he hadnt hesitated in the slightest if he had his mother would have died that afternoon in the azerbaijani bazaar at the hands of the knifewielding assassin that assassin as well as others over the years had been sent by semion icoupov pyotrs fathers implacable nemesis the man who at this moment was safely ensconced in his villa on viale marco campione not a mile from where pyotr and leonid arkadin now stood the two men did not greet each other did not address each other by name arkadin took out the stainlesssteel briefcase pyotr had sent him pyotr reached for its twin inside the bmw the exchange was made on the hood of the mercedes the men put the cases down side by side unlocked them arkadins contained makss severed thumb wrapped and bagged pyotrs contained thirty thousand dollars in diamonds the only currency arkadin accepted as payment arkadin waited patiently as pyotr unwrapped the thumb he stared out at the lake perhaps wishing he were on one of the powerboats slicing a path away from land makss thumb had withered slightly on the journey from russia a certain odor emanated from it which was not unfamiliar to pyotr zilber hed buried his share of family and compatriots he turned so the sunlight struck the tattoo produced a small magnifying glass through which he peered at the marking at length he put the glass away did he prove difficult arkadin turned back to face him for a moment he stared implacably into pyotrs eyes not especially pyotr nodded he threw the thumb over the side of the overlook tossed the empty case after it arkadin taking this to be the conclusion of their deal reached for the packet filled with diamonds opening it he took out a jewelers loupe plucked a diamond at random examined it with an experts aplomb when he nodded satisfied as to the clarity and color pyotr said how would you like to make three times what i paid you for this assignment im a very busy man arkadin said revealing nothing pyotr inclined his head deferentially i have no doubt i only take assignments that interest me would semion icoupov interest you arkadin stood very still two sports cars passed heading up the road as if it were le mans in the echo of their throaty exhausts arkadin said how convenient that we happen to be in the tiny principality where semion icoupov lives you see pyotr grinned i know precisely how busy you are two hundred thousand arkadin said the usual terms pyotr who had anticipated arkadins fee nodded his agreement conditional on immediate delivery agreed pyotr popped the trunk of the bmw inside were two more cases from one he transferred a hundred thousand in diamonds to the case on the mercedess hood from the other he handed arkadin a packet of documents including a satellite map indicating the precise location of icoupovs villa a list of his bodyguards and a set of architectural blueprints of the villa including the electrical circuits the separate power supply and details of the security devices in place icoupov is in residence now pyotr said how you make your way inside is up to you ill be in touch after paging through the documents asking a question here and there arkadin placed them in the case on top of the diamonds snapped the lid shut slung the case into the passengers seat of the mercedes as easily as if it were filled with balloons tomorrow same time right here pyotr said as arkadin slid behind the wheel the mercedes started up its engine purring then arkadin put it in gear as he slid out onto the road pyotr turned to walk to the front of the bmw he heard the squeal of brakes the slewing of a car and turned to see the mercedes heading directly toward him he was paralyzed for a moment what the hell is he doing he asked himself belatedly he began to run but the mercedes was already on top of him its front grille slammed into him pinned him to the side of the bmw through a haze of agony he saw arkadin get out of his car walk toward him then something gave out inside him and he passed into oblivion he regained consciousness in a paneled study gleaming with polished brass fixtures lush with jeweltoned isfahan carpets a walnut desk and chair were within his field of vision as was an enormous window that looked out on the sparkling water of lake lugano and the veiled mountains behind it the sun was low in the west sending long shadows the color of a fresh bruise over the water up the whitewashed walls of campione ditalia he was bound to a plain wooden chair that seemed to be as out of place in the surroundings of wealth and power as he was he tried to take a deep breath winced with shocking pain looking down he saw bandages wrapped tightly around his chest realized that he must have at least one cracked rib at last you have returned from the land of the dead for a while there you had me worried it was painful for pyotr to turn his head every muscle in his body felt as if it were on fire but his curiosity would not be denied so he bit his lip kept turning his head until a man came into view he was rather small stoopshouldered glasses with round lenses were fitted over large watery eyes his bronzed scalp lined and furrowed as pastureland was without a single hair but as if to make up for his bald pate his eyebrows were astonishingly thick arching up over the skin above his eye sockets he looked like one of those wily turkish traders from the levant semion icoupov pyotr said he coughed his mouth felt stiff as if it were stuffed with cotton he could taste the saltcopper of his own blood and swallowed heavily icoupov could have moved so that pyotr didnt have to twist his neck so far in order to keep him in view but he didnt instead he dropped his gaze to the sheet of heavy paper hed unrolled you know these architectural plans of my villa are so complete im learning things about the building i never knew before for instance there is a subbasement below the cellar he ran his stubby forefinger along the surface of the plan i suppose it would take some doing to break into it now but who knows it might prove worthwhile his head snapped up and he fixed pyotr with his gaze for instance it would make a perfect place for your incarceration id be assured that not even my closest neighbor would hear you scream he smiled a cue for a terrible focusing of his energies and you will scream pyotr this i promise you his head swiveled the beacons of his eyes searching out someone else wont he leonid now arkadin came into pyotrs field of view at once he grabbed pyotrs head with one hand dug into the hinge of his jaw with the other pyotr had no choice but to open his mouth arkadin checked his teeth one by one pyotr knew that he was looking for a false tooth filled with liquid cyanide a death pill all his arkadin said as he let go of pyotr im curious icoupov said how in the world did you procure these plans pyotr pyotr waiting for the proverbial shoe to drop said nothing but all at once he began to shiver so violently his teeth chattered icoupov signaled to arkadin who swaddled pyotrs upper body in a thick blanket icoupov brought a carved cherry chair to a position facing pyotr sat down on it he continued just as if he hadnt expected an answer i must admit that shows a fair amount of initiative on your part so the clever boy has grown into a clever young man icoupov shrugged im hardly surprised but listen to me now i know who you really aredid you think you could fool me by continually changing your name the truth of the matter is youve prodded open a wasps nest so you shouldnt be surprised to get stung and stung and stung and stung he inclined his upper body toward pyotr however much your father and i despise each other we grew up together once we were as close as brothers so out of respect for him i wont lie to you pyotr this bold foray of yours wont end well in fact it was doomed from the start and dyou want to know why you neednt answer of course you do your earthly needs betrayed you pyotr that delicious girl youve been bedding for the past six months belongs to me i know youre thinking thats not possible i know you vetted her thoroughly thats your mo i anticipated all your inquiries i made certain you received the answers you needed to hear pyotr staring into icoupovs face found his teeth chattering again no matter how tightly he clamped his jaw tea please philippe icoupov said to an unseen person moments later a slender young man set an english silver tea service onto a low table at icoupovs right hand like a favorite uncle icoupov went about pouring and sugaring the tea he put the porcelain cup to pyotrs bluish lips said please drink pyotr its for your own good pyotr stared implacably at him until icoupov said ah yes i see he sipped the tea from the cup himself to assure pyotr it was only tea then offered it again the rim chattered against pyotrs teeth but eventually pyotr drank slowly at first then more avidly when the tea was drained icoupov set the cup back on its matching saucer by this time pyotrs shivering had subsided feeling better ill feel better pyotr said when i get out of here ah well im afraid that wont be for some time icoupov said if ever unless you tell me what i want to know he hitched his chair closer the benign uncles expression was now nowhere to be found you stole something that belongs to me he said i want it back it never belonged to you you stole it first pyotr replied with such venom that icoupov said you hate me as much as you love your father this is your basic problem pyotr you never learned that hate and love are essentially the same in that the person who loves is as easily manipulated as the person who hates pyotr screwed up his mouth as if icoupovs words left a bitter taste in his mouth anyway its too late the document is already on its way instantly there was a change in icoupovs demeanor his face became as closed as a fist a certain tension lent his entire small body the aspect of a weapon about to be launched where did you send it pyotr shrugged but said nothing more icoupovs face turned dark with momentary rage do you think i know nothing about the information and matйriel pipeline you have been refining for the past three years its how you send information you stole from me back to your father wherever he is for the first time since hed regained consciousness pyotr smiled if you knew anything important about the pipeline youd have rolled it up by now at this icoupov regained the icy control over his emotions i told you talking to him would be useless arkadin said from his position directly behind pyotrs chair nevertheless icoupov said there are certain protocols that must be acknowledged im not an animal pyotr snorted icoupov eyed his prisoner sitting back he fastidiously pulled up his trouser leg crossed one leg over the other laced his stubby fingers on his lower belly i give you one last chance to continue this conversation it was not until the silence was drawn out into an almost intolerable length that icoupov raised his gaze to arkadin pyotr why are you doing this to me he said with a resigned tone and then to arkadin begin though it cost him in pain and breath pyotr twisted as far as he was able but he couldnt see what arkadin was doing he heard the sound of implements on a metal cart being rolled across the carpet pyotr turned back you dont frighten me i dont mean to frighten you pyotr icoupov said i mean to hurt you very very badly with a painful convulsion pyotrs world contracted to the pinpoint of a star in the night sky he was locked within the confines of his mind but despite all his training all his courage he could not compartmentalize the pain there was a hood over his head drawn tight around his neck this confinement magnified the pain a hundredfold because despite his fearlessness pyotr was subject to claustrophobia for someone who never went into caves small spaces or even underwater the hood was the worst of all possible worlds his senses could tell him that in fact he wasnt confined at all but his mind wouldnt accept that inputit was in the full flight of panic the pain arkadin was inflicting on him was one thing its magnification was quite another pyotrs mind was spinning out of control he felt a wildness enter himthe wolf caught in a trap that begins to frantically gnaw its leg off but the mind was not a limb he couldnt gnaw it off dimly he heard someone asking him a question to which he knew the answer he didnt want to give the answer but he knew he would because the voice told him the hood would come off if he answered his crazed mind only knew it needed the hood off it could no longer distinguish right from wrong good from evil lies from truth it reacted to only one imperative the need to survive he tried to move his fingers but in bending over him his interrogator must have been pressing down on them with the heels of his hands pyotr couldnt hang on any longer he answered the question the hood didnt come off he howled in indignation and terror of course it didnt come off he thought in a tiny instant of lucidity if it did hed have no incentive to answer the next question and the next and the next and he would answer themall of them he knew this with a bonechilling certainty even though part of him suspected that the hood might never come off his trapped mind would take the chance it had no other choice but now that he could move his fingers there was another choice just before the whirlwind of panicked madness overtook him again pyotr made that choice there was one way out and saying a silent prayer to allah he took it icoupov and arkadin stood over pyotrs body pyotrs head lay on one side his lips were very blue and a faint but distinct foam emanated from his halfopen mouth icoupov bent down sniffed the scent of bitter almonds i didnt want him dead leonid i was very clear on the point icoupov was vexed how did he get hold of cyanide they used a variation ive never encountered arkadin did not look happy himself he was fitted with a false fingernail he would have talked of course he would have talked arkadin said hed already begun so he took it upon himself to shut his own mouth forever icoupov shook his head in distaste this will have significant fallout hes got dangerous friends ill find them arkadin said ill kill them icoupov shook his head even you cant kill them all in time i can contact mischa and risk losing everything no i understand your connection with himclosest friend mentor i understand the urge to talk to him to see him but you cant not until this is finished and mischa comes home thats final i understand icoupov walked over the window stood with his hand behind his back contemplating the fall of darkness lights sparkled along the edges of the lake up the hillside of campione ditalia there ensued a long silence while he contemplated the face of the altered landscape well have to move up the timetable thats all there is to it and youll take sevastopol as a starting point use the one name you got out of pyotr before he committed suicide he turned around to face arkadin everything now rides on you leonid this attack has been in the planning stages for three years it has been designed to cripple the american economy now there are barely two weeks left before it becomes a reality he walked noiselessly across the carpet philippe will provide you with money documents weaponry that will escape electronic detection anything you need find this man in sevastopol retrieve the document and when you do follow the pipeline back and shut it down so that it will never again be used to threaten our plans book one one who is david webb moira trevor standing in front of his desk at georgetown university asked the question so seriously that jason bourne felt obliged to answer strange he said no ones ever asked me that before david webb is a linguistics expert a man with two children who are living happily with their grandparentsmaries parentson a ranch in canada moira frowned dont you miss them i miss them terribly bourne said but the truth is theyre far better off where they are what kind of life could i offer them and then theres the constant danger from my bourne identity marie was kidnapped and threatened in order to force me to do something i had no intention of doing i wont make that mistake again but surely you see them from time to time as often as i can but its difficult i cant afford to have anyone following me back to them my heart goes out to you moira said meaning it she smiled i must say its odd seeing you here on a university campus behind a desk she laughed shall i buy you a pipe and a jacket with elbow patches bourne smiled im content here moira really i am im happy for you martins death was difficult for both of us my anodyne is going back to work fullbore yours is obviously here in a new life an old life really bourne looked around the office marie was happiest when i was teaching when she could count on me being home every night in time to have dinner with her and the kids what about you moira asked were you happiest here a cloud passed across bournes face i was happy being with marie he turned to her i cant imagine being able to say that to anyone else but you a rare compliment from you jason are my compliments so rare like martin youre a master at keeping secrets she said but i have doubts about how healthy that is im sure its not healthy at all bourne said but its the life we chose speaking of which she sat down on a chair opposite him i came early for our dinner date to talk to you about a work situation but now seeing how content you are here i dont know whether to continue bourne recalled the first time he had seen her a slim shapely figure in the mist dark hair swirling about her face she was standing at the parapet in the cloisters overlooking the hudson river the two of them had come there to say goodbye to their mutual friend martin lindros whom bourne had valiantly tried to save only to fail today moira was dressed in a wool suit a silk blouse open at the throat her face was strong with a prominent nose deep brown eyes wide apart intelligent curved slightly at their outer corners her hair fell to her shoulders in luxuriant waves there was an uncommon serenity about her a woman who knew what she was about who wouldnt be intimidated or bullied by anyone woman or man perhaps this last was what bourne liked best about her in that though in no other way she was like marie he had never pried into her relationship with martin but he assumed it had been romantic since martin had given bourne standing orders to send her a dozen red roses should he ever die this bourne had done with a sadness whose depth surprised even him settled in her chair one long shapely leg crossed over her knee she looked the model of a european businesswoman she had told him that she was half french half english but her genes still carried the imprint of ancient venetian and turkish ancestors she was proud of the fire in her mixed blood the result of wars invasions fierce love go on he leaned forward elbows on his desk i want to hear what you have to say she nodded all right as ive told you nextgen energy solutions has completed our new liquid natural gas terminal in long beach our first shipment is due in two weeks i had this idea which now seems utterly crazy but here goes id like you to head up the security procedures my bosses are worried the terminal would make an awfully tempting target for any terrorist group and i agree frankly i cant think of anyone whod make it more secure than you im flattered moira but i have obligations here as you know professor specter has installed me as the head of the comparative linguistics department i dont want to disappoint him i like dominic specter jason really i do youve made it clear that hes your mentor actually hes david webbs mentor right but its jason bourne i first met it feels like its jason bourne ive been coming to know these last few months who is jason bournes mentor bournes face darkened as it had at the mention of marie alex conklins dead moira shifted in her chair if you come work with me theres no baggage attached to it think about it its a chance to leave your past lives behindboth david webbs and jason bournes im flying to munich shortly because a key element of the terminal is being manufactured there i need an expert opinion on it when i check the specs moira there are any number of experts you can use but none whose opinion i trust as much as yours this is crucial stuff jason more than half the goods shipped into the united states come through the port at long beach so our security measures have to be something special the us government has already shown it has neither the time nor the inclination to secure commercial traffic so were forced to police it ourselves the danger to this terminal is real and its serious i know how expert you are at bypassing even the most arcane security systems youre the perfect candidate to put nonconventional measures into place bourne stood moira listen to me marie was david webbs biggest cheerleader since her death ive let go of him completely but hes not dead hes not an invalid he lives on inside me when i fall asleep i dream of his life as if it was someone elses and i wake up in a sweat i feel as if a part of me has been sliced off i dont want to feel that way anymore its time to give david webb his due veronica harts step was light and virtually carefree as she was admitted past checkpoint after checkpoint on her way into the bunker that was the west wing of the white house the job she was about to be handeddirector of central intelligencewas a formidable one especially in the aftermath of last years twin debacles of murder and gross breach of security nevertheless she had never been happier having a sense of purpose was vital to her being singled out for daunting responsibility was the ultimate validation of all the arduous work setbacks and threats shed had to endure because of her gender there was also the matter of her age at fortysix she was the youngest dci in recent memory being the youngest at something was nothing new to her her astonishing intelligence combined with her fierce determination to ensure that she was the youngest to graduate from her college youngest to be appointed to military intelligence to central army command to a highly lucrative black river private intelligence position in afghanistan and the horn of africa where to this day not even the heads of the seven directorates within ci knew precisely where she had been posted whom she commanded or what her mission had been now at last she was steps away from the apex the top of the intelligence heap shed successfully leapt all the hurdles sidestepped every trap negotiated every maze learned who to befriend and who to show her back to she had endured relentless sexual innuendo rumors of conduct unbecoming stories of her reliance on her male inferiors who supposedly did her thinking for her in each case she had triumphed emphatically putting a stake through the heart of the lies and in some instances taking down their instigators she was at this stage of her life a force to be reckoned with a fact in which she justifiably reveled so it was with a light heart that she approached her meeting with the president in her briefcase was a thick file detailing the changes she proposed to make in ci to clean up the unholy mess left behind by karim aljamil and the subsequent murder of her predecessor not surprisingly ci was in total disarray morale had never been lower and of course there was resentment across the board from the allmale directorate heads each of whom felt he should have been elevated to dci the chaos and low morale were about to change and she had a raft of initiatives to ensure it she was absolutely certain that the president would be delighted not only with her plans but also with the speed with which she would implement them an intelligence organization as important and vital as ci could not long endure the despair into which it had sunk only the antiterrorist black ops typhon brainchild of martin lindros was running normally and for that she had its new director soraya moore to thank sorayas assumption of command had been seamless her operatives loved her would follow her into the fires of hades should she ask it of them as for the rest of ci it was for herself to heal energize and give a refocused sense of purpose she was surprisedperhaps shocked wasnt too strong a wordto find the oval office occupied not only by the president but also by luther lavalle the pentagons intelligence czar and his deputy general richard p kendall ignoring the others she walked across the plush american blue carpet to shake the presidents hand she was tall longnecked and slender her ashblond hair was cut in a stylish fashion that fell short of being masculine but lent her a businesslike air she wore a midnightblue suit lowheeled pumps small gold earrings and a minimum of makeup her nails were cut square across please have a seat veronica the president said you know luther lavalle and general kendall yes veronica inclined her head fractionally gentlemen a pleasure to see you though nothing could be farther from the truth she hated lavalle in many ways he was the most dangerous man in american intelligence not the least because he was backed by the immensely powerful e r bud halliday the secretary of defense lavalle was a powerhungry egotist who believed that he and his people should be running american intelligence period he fed on war the way other people fed on meat and potatoes and though she had never been able to prove it she suspected that he was behind several of the more lurid rumors that had circulated about her he enjoyed ruining other peoples reputations savored standing impudently on the skulls of his enemies ever since afghanistan and subsequently iraq lavalle had seized the initiativeunder the typically wideranging and murky pentagon rubric of preparing the battlefield for the troops to cometo expand the purview of the pentagons intelligencegathering initiatives until now they encroached uncomfortably on those of ci it was an open secret within american intelligence circles that he coveted cis operatives and its longestablished international networks now with the old man and his anointed successor dead it would fit lavalles mo to try to make a land grab in the most aggressive manner possible this was why his presence and that of his lapdog set off the most serious warning bells inside veronicas mind there were three chairs ranged in a rough semicircle in front of the presidents desk two of them were of course filled veronica took the third chair acutely aware that she was flanked by the two men doubtless by design she laughed inwardly if these two thought to intimidate her by making her feel surrounded they were sorely mistaken but then as the president began to talk she hoped to god her laugh wouldnt echo hollowly in her mind an hour from now dominic specter hurried around the corner as bourne was locking the door to his office the deep frown that creased his high forehead vanished the moment he saw bourne david im so glad i caught you before you left he said with great enthusiasm then turning his charm on bournes companion he added and with the magnificent moira no less as always the perfect gentleman he bowed to her in the old world european fashion he returned his attention to bourne he was a short man full of unbridled energy despite his seventyodd years his head seemed perfectly round surmounted by a halo of hair that wound from ear to ear his eyes were dark and inquisitive his skin a deep bronze his generous mouth made him look vaguely and amusingly like a frog about to spring from one lily pad to another a matter of some concern has come up and i need your opinion he smiled i see that this evening is out of the question would dinner tomorrow be inconvenient bourne discerned something behind specters smile that gave him pause something was troubling his old mentor why dont we meet for breakfast are you certain im not putting you out david but he couldnt hide the relief that flooded his face actually breakfast is better for me bourne lied to make things easier for specter eight oclock splendid i look forward to it with a nod in moiras direction he was off a firecracker moira said if only id had professors like him bourne looked at her your college years mustve been hell she laughed not quite as bad as all that but then i only had two years of it before i fled to berlin if youd had professors like dominic specter your experience would have been far different believe me they sidestepped several knots of students gathered to gossip or to trade questions about their last classes they strode along the corridor out the doors descended the steps to the quad he and moira walked briskly across campus in the direction of the restaurant where they would have dinner students streamed past them hurrying down the paths between trees and lawns somewhere a band was playing in the stolid almost plodding rhythm endemic to colleges and universities the sky was steeped in clouds scudding overhead like clipper ships on the high seas a dank winter wind came streaming in off the potomac there was a time when i was plunged deep in depression i knew it but i wouldnt accept ityou know what i mean professor specter was the one who connected with me who was able to crack the shell i was using to protect myself to this day i have no idea how he did it or even why he persevered he said he saw something of himself in me in any event he wanted to help they passed the ivycovered building where specter who was now the president of the school of international studies at georgetown had his office men in tweed coats and corduroy jackets passed in and out of the doors frowns of deep concentration on their faces professor specter gave me a job teaching linguistics it was like a life preserver to a drowning man what i needed most then was a sense of order and stability i honestly dont know what would have happened to me if not for him he alone understood that immersing myself in language makes me happy no matter who ive been the one constant is my proficiency with languages learning languages is like learning history from the inside out it encompasses the battles of ethnicity religion compromise politics so much can be learned from language because its been shaped by history by this time they had left campus and were walking down th street nw toward a favorite restaurant of moiras which was housed in a federal town house when they arrived they were shown to a window table on the second floor in a dim paneled oldfashioned room with candles burning brightly on tables set with fine china and sparkling stemware they sat down facing each other and ordered drinks bourne leaned across the table said in a low voicelisten to me moira because im going to tell you something very few people know the bourne identity continues to haunt me marie used to worry that the decisions i was forced to make the actions i had to take as jason bourne would eventually drain me of all feeling that one day id come back to her and david webb would be gone for good i cant let that happen jason you and i have spent quite a bit of time with each other since we met to scatter martins ashes ive never seen a hint that youve lost any part of your humanity both sat back silent as the waiter set the drinks in front of them handed them menus as soon as he left bourne said thats reassuring believe me in the short time ive known you ive come to value your opinions youre not like anyone else ive ever met moira took a sip of her drink set it down all without taking her eyes from his thank you coming from you thats quite a compliment particularly because i know how special marie was to you bourne stared down at his drink moira reached across the starched white linen for his hand im sorry now youre drifting away he glanced at her hand over his but didnt pull away when he looked up he said i relied on her for many things but i find now that those things are slipping away from me is that a bad thing or a good thing thats just it he said i dont know moira saw the anguish in his face and her heart went out to him it was only months ago that shed seen him standing by the parapet in the cloisters he was clutching the bronze urn holding martins ashes as if he never wanted to let it go shed known then even if martin hadnt told her what theyd meant to each other martin was your friend she said now you put yourself in terrible jeopardy to save him dont tell me you didnt feel anything for him besides by your own admission youre not jason bourne now youre david webb he smiled you have me there her face clouded over i want to ask you a question but i dont know whether i have the right at once he responded to the seriousness of her expression of course you can ask moira go on she took a deep breath let it go jason i know youve said that youre content at the university and if thats so fine but i also know you blame yourself for not being able to save martin you must understand though if you couldnt save him no one could you did your best he knew that im sure and now i find myself wondering if you believe you failed himthat youre not up to being jason bourne anymore i wonder if youve ever considered the idea that you accepted professor specters offer at the university in order to turn away from jason bournes life of course ive considered it after martins death hed once again decided to turn his back on jason bournes life on the running the deaths a river that seemed to have as many bodies as the ganges always for him memories lurked the sad ones he remembered the others the shadowed ones that filled the halls of his mind seemed to have shape until he neared them when they flowed away like a tide at ebb and what was left behind were the bleached bones of all those hed killed or had been killed because of who he was but he knew just as surely that as long as he drew breath the bourne identity wouldnt die there was a tormented look in his eyes you have to understand how difficult it is having two personalities always at war with each other i wish with every fiber of my being that i could cut one of them out of me moira said which one would it be thats the damnable part bourne said every time i think i know i realize that i dont two luther lavalle was as telegenic as the president and twothirds his age he had strawcolored hair slicked back like a movie idol of the s or s and restless hands by contrast general kendall was squarejawed and beadyeyed the very essence of a ramrod officer he was big and beefy perhaps hed been a fullback at wisconsin or ohio state he looked to lavalle the way a running back looks to his quarterback for instructions luther the president said seeing as how you requested this meeting i think it appropriate that you begin lavalle nodded as if the president deferring to him was a fait accompli after the recent debacle of ci being infiltrated at its highest level culminating with the murder of the former dci firmer security and controls need to be set in place only the pentagon can do that veronica felt compelled to jump in before lavalle got too much of a head start i beg to differ sir she said aiming her remarks at the president human intelligence gathering has always been the province of ci our ontheground networks are unparalleled as are our armies of contacts who have been cultivated for decades the pentagons expertise has always been in electronic surveillance the two are separate requiring altogether different methodologies and mindsets lavalle smiled as winningly as he did when appearing on fox tv or larry king live id be remiss if i didnt point out that the landscape of intelligence has changed radically since were at war in my opinion this state of affairs is likely to last indefinitely which is why the pentagon has recently expanded its field of expertise creating teams of clandestine dia personnel and specialops forces who are conducting successful counterintelligence ops in iraq and afghanistan with all due respect mr lavalle and his military machine are eager to fill any perceived vacuum or create one if necessary mr lavalle and general kendall need us to believe that were in a perpetual state of war whether or not its the truth from her briefcase veronica produced a file which she opened and read from as this evidence makes clear they have systematically directed the expansion of their human intelligencegathering squads outside of afghanistan and iraq into other territoriescis territoriesoften with disastrous results theyve corrupted informers and in at least one instance theyve jeopardized an ongoing ci deepcover operation after the president glanced at the pages veronica handed him he said while this is compelling veronica congress seems to be on luthers side it has provided him with twentyfive million dollars a year to pay informants on the ground and to recruit mercenaries thats part of the problem not the solution veronica said emphatically theirs is a failed methodology the same one theyve used all the way back to the oss in berlin after world war two our paid informants have had a history of turning on usworking for the other side feeding us disinformation as for the mercenaries we recruitedlike the taliban or various other muslim insurgent groupsthey to a man eventually turned against us to become our implacable enemies shes got a point the president said the past is the past general kendall said angrily his face had been darkening with every word veronica had said theres no evidence whatsoever that either our new informants or our mercenaries both of which are vital to our victory in the middle east would ever turn on us on the contrary the intel theyve provided has been of great help to our men on the field of battle mercenaries by definition owe their allegiance to whoever pays them the most veronica said centuries of history from roman times forward have proved this point over and over all this backandforth is of little moment lavalle shifted in his seat uncomfortably clearly he hadnt counted on such a spirited defense kendall handed him a dossier which he presented to the president general kendall and i have spent the better part of two weeks putting together this proposal for how to restructure ci going forward the pentagon is prepared to implement this plan the moment we get your approval mr president to veronicas horror the president looked over the proposal then turned it over to her what do you say to this veronica felt suffused with rage she was already being undermined on the other hand she observed this was a good object lesson for her trust no one not even seeming allies up until this moment shed thought she had the full support of the president the fact that lavalle who was after all basically the mouthpiece for defense secretary halliday had the muscle to call this meeting shouldnt have surprised her but that the president was asking her to consider a takeover from the pentagon was outrageous and quite frankly frightening without even glancing at the toxic papers she squared her shoulders sir this proposal is irrelevant at best i resent mr lavalles flagrant attempt to expand his intelligence empire at cis expense for one thing as ive detailed the pentagon is ill suited to direct let alone win the trust of our vast array of agents in the field for another this coup would set a dangerous precedent for the entire intelligence community being under the control of the armed forces will not benefit our intelligencegathering potential on the contrary the pentagons history of flagrant disregard for human life its legacy of illegal operations combined with welldocumented fiscal profligacy makes it an extremely poor candidate to poach on anyone elses territory especially cis only the presence of the president forced lavalle to keep his ire in check sir ci is in total disarray it needs to be turned around asap as i said our plan can be implemented today veronica drew out the thick file detailing her plans for ci she rose placed it in the presidents hands sir i feel dutybound to reiterate one of the main points of our last discussion though ive served in the military i come from the private sector ci is in need not only of a clean sweep but of a fresh perspective untainted by the monolithic thinking that got us into this insupportable situation in the first place jason bourne smiled to be honest tonight i dont know who i am he leaned forward and said very softly listen to me i want you to take your cell phone out of your handbag without anyone seeing i want you to call me can you do that moira kept her eyes on his as she found her cell in her handbag hit the appropriate speeddial key his cell phone chimed he sat back answered the call he spoke into the phone as if someone was on the other end of the line then he closed the phone said i have to go its an emergency im sorry she continued to stare at him could you act even the least bit upset she whispered his mouth turned down do you really have to go she said in a normal tone of voice now now bourne threw some bills on the table ill be in touch she nodded a bit quizzically wondering what hed seen or heard bourne went down the stairs and out of the restaurant immediately he turned right walked a quarter block then entered a store selling handmade ceramics positioning himself so that he had a view of the street through the plateglass window he pretended to look at bowls and serving dishes outside people passed bya young couple an elderly man with a cane three young women laughing but the man whod been seated in the back corner of their room precisely ninety seconds after they sat down did not appear bourne had marked him the moment hed come in and when hed asked for a table in back facing them hed had no doubt someone was following him all of a sudden hed felt that old anxiety that had roiled him when marie and martin had been threatened hed lost martin he wasnt about to lose moira as well bourne whose interior radar had swept the secondfloor dining room every few minutes or so hadnt picked up anyone else of a suspicious nature so he waited now inside the ceramics shop for the tail to amble by when this didnt occur after five minutes bourne went out the door and immediately strode across the street using streetlights and the reflective surfaces of windows and car mirrors he spent another few minutes scrutinizing the area for any sign of the man at the table in back after ascertaining he was nowhere to be found bourne returned to the restaurant he went up the stairs to the second floor but paused in the dark hallway between the staircase and the dining room there was the man at his rear table to any casual observer he seemed to be reading the current issue of the washingtonian like any good tourist but every once in a while his gaze flicked upward for a fraction of a second focused on moira bourne felt a little chill go through him this man wasnt following him he was following moira as veronica hart emerged through the outermost checkpoint to the west wing luther lavalle emerged from the shadows fell into step beside her nicely done he said icily next time ill be better prepared there wont be a next time veronica said secretary halliday is confident there will be so am i they had reached the hushed vestibule with its dome and columns busy presidential aides strode purposefully past them in either direction like surgeons they exuded an air of supreme confidence and exclusivity as if theirs was a club you desperately wanted to belong to but never would wheres your personal pit bull veronica asked sniffing out crotches i shouldnt wonder youre terribly flip for someone whose job is hanging by a thread its foolishnot to mention dangerous mr lavalleto confuse confidence with being flip they pushed through the doors went down the steps to the grounds proper floodlights pushed back the darkness to the edges of the premises beyond streetlights glittered of course youre right lavalle said i apologize veronica eyed him with no little skepticism lavalle gave her a small smile i sincerely regret that weve gotten off on the wrong foot what he really regrets veronica thought is my pulling him and kendall to pieces in front of the presidentunderstandable really as she buttoned her coat he said perhaps both of us have been coming at this situation from the wrong angle veronica knotted her scarf at her throat outside her collar what situation the collapse of ci in the near distance beyond the flotilla of heavy reinforced concrete antiterrorist barriers tourists strolled by chatting animatedly paused briefly to take snapshots then went on to their dinners at mcdonalds or burger king it seems to me that more can be gained by us joining forces than by being antagonists veronica turned to him listen buddy you take care of your shop and ill take care of mine ive been given a job to do and im going to do it without interference from you or secretary halliday personally im sick and tired of you people extending the line in the sand farther and farther so your empire can grow bigger ci is off limits to you now and forever got it lavalle made a face as if he were about to whistle then he said very quietly id be a bit more careful if i were you youre walking across a knifeedge one false step one hesitation and when you fall no ones going to be there to catch you her voice turned steely ive had my fill of your threats too mr lavalle he turned up his collar against the wind when you get to know me better veronica youll realize i dont make threats i make predictions three the violence of the black sea fit leonid arkadin down to his steeltipped shoes in a tumultuous rain he drove into sevastopol from belbek aerodrome sevastopol inhabited a coveted bit of territory on the southwestern edge of the crimean peninsula of ukraine because the area was blessed with subtropical weather its seas never froze from the time of its founding by greek traders as chersonesus in bc sevastopol was a vital commercial and military outpost for fishing fleets and naval armadas alike following the decline of chersonesuspeninsula in greekthe area fell into ruin until the modernday sevastopol was founded in as a naval base and fortress on the southern boundaries of the russian empire most of the citys history was linked to its military glorythe name sevastopol translated from greek means august glorious the name seemed justified the city survived two bloody sieges during the crimean war of and world war two when it withstood axis bombing for days although the city was destroyed on two different occasions it had risen from the ashes both times as a result the inhabitants were tough nononsense people they despised the cold war era dating to roughly when because of its naval base the ussr ordered sevastopol off limits to visitors of all kinds in the russians agreed to return the city to the ukrainians who opened it again it was late afternoon when arkadin arrived on primorskiy boulevard the sky was black except for a thin red line along the western horizon the port bulged with roundhulled fishing ships and sleek steelhulled naval vessels an angry sea lashed the monument to scuttled ships commemorating the lastditch defense of the city against the combined forces of the british french turks and sardinians it rose from a bed of rough granite blocks in a corinthian column three yards high crowned by an eagle with wings spread wide its proud head bent a laurel wreath gripped in its beak facing it embedded in the thick seawall were the anchors of the russian ships that were deliberately sunk to block the harbor from the invading enemy arkadin checked into the hotel oblast where everything including the walls seemed to be made of paper the furniture was covered in fabric of hideous patterns whose colors clashed like enemies on a battlefield the place seemed a likely candidate to go up like a torch he made a mental note not to smoke in bed downstairs in the space that passed for a lobby he asked the rodentlike clerk for a recommendation for a hot meal then requested a telephone book taking it he retired to an understuffed upholstered chair by a window that overlooked admiral nakhimov square and there he was on a magnificent plinth the hero of the first defense of sevastopol staring stonily at arkadin as if aware of what was to come this was a city like so many in the former soviet union filled with monuments to the past with a last glance at slopeshouldered pedestrians hurrying through the driving rain arkadin turned his attention to the phone book the name that pyotr zilber had given up just before hed committed suicide was oleg shumenko arkadin dearly would have loved to have gotten more out of zilber now arkadin had to page through the phone book looking for shumenko assuming the man had a landline which was always problematic outside moscow or st petersburg he made note of the five oleg shumenkos listed handed the book back to the clerk and went out into the windy false dusk the first three oleg shumenkos were of no help arkadin posing as a close friend of pyotr zilbers told each of them that he had a message from pyotr so urgent it had to be transmitted in person they looked at him blankly shook their heads he could see in their eyes they had no idea who pyotr zilber was the fourth shumenko worked at yugreftransflot which maintained the largest fleet of refrigerated ships in ukraine since yugreftransflot was a public corporation it took arkadin some time just to get in to see shumenko who was a transport manager like everywhere in the former ussr the red tape was enough to grind all work to a near halt how anything got done in the public sector was beyond arkadin at length shumenko appeared led arkadin to his tiny office apologizing for the delay he was a small man with very dark hair and the small ears and low forehead of a neanderthal when arkadin introduced himself shumenko said obviously you have the wrong man i dont know a pyotr zilber arkadin consulted his list i only have one more oleg shumenko left let me see shumenko consulted the list pity you didnt come to me first these three are my cousins and the fifth the one you havent seen yet wont be of any use to you hes dead fishing accident six months ago he handed back the list but all isnt lost theres one other oleg shumenko though were not related people are always getting us confused because we have the same patronymic ivanovich he doesnt have a landline which is why im constantly getting his calls do you know where i can find him oleg ivanovich shumenko checked his watch at this hour yes hed be at work hes a winemaker you see champagne i understand the french say youre not allowed to use that term for any wine not produced in their champagne region he chuckled still the sevastopol winery turns out quite a fine champagne he led arkadin from his office out through dull corridors into the enormous main vestibule are you familiar with the city gospadin arkadin sevastopol is divided into five districts were in the gagarinskiy district named after the worlds first astronaut yuri alexeevich gagarin this is the western section of the city to the north is the nakhimovskiy district which is where the mammoth dry docks are perhaps youve heard of them no no matter in the eastern section away from the water is the rural area of the citypasturelands and vineyards magnificent even at this time of the year he crossed the marble floor to a long banc behind which sat half a dozen functionaries looking as if theyd had little to do in the past year from one of them shumenko received a city map which he drew on then he handed it to arkadin pointing at a star hed marked theres the winery he glanced outside the skys clearing who knows by the time you get there you may even see some sun bourne walked the streets of georgetown securely hidden within the crowds of college and university kids prowling the cobbles looking for beer girls and guys he was discreetly shadowing the man in the restaurant who was in turn following moira once he had determined that the man was her tail hed backed away and returned to the street where hed called moira can you think of anyone who wants to keep tabs on you i guess several she said my own company for one i told you theyve become paranoid ever since we started to build the lng station in long beach nohold energy might be another theyve been waving a vice presidents job at me for six months i could see them wanting to know more about me so they can sweeten their offer other than those two no hed told her what he wanted her to do and now in the georgetown night she was doing it they always had habits these watchers in the shadows little peculiarities built up from all the boring hours spent at their lonely jobs this one liked to be on the inside of the sidewalk so he could duck quickly into a doorway if need be once he had the shadows idiosyncracies down it was time to take him out but as bourne worked his way through the crowds moving closer to the shadow he saw something else the man wasnt alone a second tail had taken up a parallel position on the opposite side of the street which made sense if moira decided to cross the street in this throng the first shadow might run into some difficulty keeping her in sight these people whoever they were were leaving little to chance bourne melted back matching his pace to that of the crowds at the same time he called moira shed put in her bluetooth earpiece so she could take his call without being conspicuous bourne gave her detailed instructions then broke off following her shadows moira the back of her neck tingling as if she were in the crosshairs of an assassins rifle crossed the street walked over to m street the main thing for her to keep in mind jason said was to move at a normal pace neither fast nor slow jason had alarmed her with the news that she was being followed she had merely maintained the illusion of being calm there were many people from both present and past who might be following hera number of whom she hadnt mentioned when jason had asked still so close to the opening of the lng terminal it was an ominous sign she had desperately wanted to share with jason the intel that had come to her today about the possibility of the terminal being a terrorist target not in theory but in reality however she couldntnot unless he was an employee of the company she was bound by her ironclad contract not to tell anyone outside the firm any confidential information at st street nw she turned south walking toward the canal towpath a third of the way down the block on her side was a discreet plaque on which the word jewel was etched she opened the rubycolored door entered the highpriced new restaurant this was the kind of place where dishes were accessorized with kaffir lime foam freezedried ginger and ruby grapefruit pearls smiling sweetly at the manager she told him that she was looking for a friend before he could check his reservation book she said her friend was with a man whose name she didnt know shed been here several times once with jason so she knew the layout at the rear of the second room was a short corridor against the righthand wall were two unisex bathrooms if you kept on going which she did you came to the kitchen all bright lights stainlesssteel pans copper pots huge stovetops raging at high heat young men and women moved around the room in what seemed to her like military precisionsouschefs line cooks expediters the pastry chef and her staff all performing under the stern commands of the chef de cuisine they were all too concentrated on their respective tasks to give moira much notice by the time her figure did register shed already disappeared out the rear door in a back alley filled with dumpsters a white top cab was waiting its engine purring she climbed in and the cab took off arkadin drove through the hills of rural nakhimovskiy district lush even in winter he passed checkered farmland bounded by low forested areas the sky was lightening the dark rainladen clouds already disappearing replaced by high cumulus that glowed like embers in the sunlight that broke through everywhere a golden sheen covered the acres of vineyards as he approached the sevastopol winery at this time of year there were no leaves or fruit of course but the twisted stunted boles like the trunks of elephants bore a life of their own that gave the vineyard a certain mystery a mythic aspect as if these sleeping vines needed only the spell of a wizard to come awake a burly woman named yetnikova introduced herself as oleg ivanovich shumenkos immediate supervisorthere was apparently no end to the tiers of supervisors in the winery she had shoulders as wide as arkadins a red round vodka face with features as curiously small as those of a doll she wore her hair tied up in a peasant babushka but she was all bristling business when she demanded to know arkadins business he whipped out one of many false credentials he carried this one identified him as a colonel in the sbu the security service of ukraine upon seeing the sbu card yetnikova wilted like an unwatered plant and showed him where to find shumenko arkadin following her direction went down corridor after corridor he opened each door he came to peering inside offices utility closets storerooms and the like apologizing to the occupants as he did so shumenko was working in the fermentation room when arkadin found him he was a reedthin man much younger than arkadin had imaginedno more than thirty or so he had thick hair the color of goldenrod that stood up from his scalp like a series of cockscombs music spilled out from a portable playera british band the cure arkadin had heard the song many times in moscow clubs but it seemed startling here in the hind end of the crimea shumenko stood on a catwalk four yards in the air bent over a stainlesssteel apparatus as large as a blue whale he seemed to be sniffing something possibly the latest batch of champagne he was concocting rather than turn down the music shumenko gestured for arkadin to join him without hesitation arkadin mounted the vertical ladder climbed swiftly up to the catwalk the yeasty slightly sweet odors of fermentation tickled his nostrils causing him to rub the end of his nose vigorously to stave off a sneezing fit his practiced gaze swept the immediate vicinity taking in every last detail no matter how minute oleg ivanovich shumenko the reedy young man put aside a clipboard on which he was taking notes at your service he wore a badly fitting suit he placed the pen he had been using in his breast pocket where it joined a line of others and you would be a friend of pyotr zilbers never heard of him but his eyes had already betrayed him arkadin reached out turned up the music hes heard of you oleg ivanovich in fact youre quite important to him shumenko plastered a simulated smile on his face i have no idea what youre talking about there was a grave mistake made he needs the document back shumenko smiling still jammed his hands in his pockets once again i must tell you arkadin made a grab for him but shumenkos right hand reappeared gripping a gsh semiautomatic that was pointed at arkadins heart hmm the sights are acceptable at best arkadin said please dont move whoever you areand dont bother to give me a name that in any case will be falseyoure no friend of pyotrs he must be dead perhaps even by your hand but the trigger pull is relatively heavy arkadin continued as if he hadnt been listening so thatll give me an extra tenth of a second a tenth of a second is nothing its all i need shumenko backed up as arkadin wanted him to toward the curved side of a container to keep a safer distance even while i mourn pyotrs death i will defend our network with my life he backed up farther as arkadin took another step toward him its a long fall from here so i suggest you turn around climb back down the ladder and disappear into whatever sewer you crawled out of as shumenko retreated his right foot skidded on a bit of yeast paste arkadin had noted earlier shumenkos right knee went out from under him the hand holding the gsh raised in an instinctive gesture to help keep him from falling in one long stride arkadin was inside the perimeter of his defense he made a grab for the gun missed his fist struck shumenko on the right cheek sending the reedy man lurching back into the side of the container in the space between two protruding levers shumenko slashed his arm in a horizontal arc the sight on the barrel of the gsh raking across the bridge of arkadin s nose drawing blood arkadin made another lunge at the semiautomatic and bent back against the curved sheet of stainless steel the two men grappled shumenko was surprisingly strong for a thin man and he was proficient in handtohand combat he had the proper counter for every attack arkadin threw at him they were very close now not a hands span separating them their limbs worked quickly hands elbows forearms even shoulders used to produce pain or in blocking minimize it gradually arkadin seemed to be getting the better of his adversary but with a double feint shumenko managed to get the butt of the gsh lodged against arkadins throat he pressed in using leverage in an attempt to crush arkadins windpipe one of arkadins hands was trapped between their bodies with the other he pounded shumenkos side but he lacked shumenkos leverage and his blows did no damage when he tried for shumenkos kidney the other man twisted his hips away so his hand glanced off the hip bone shumenko pressed his advantage bending arkadin over the railing trying with the butt of his gun and his upper body to shove arkadin off the catwalk ribbons of darkness flowed across arkadins vision a sign that his brain was becoming oxygenstarved he had underestimated shumenko and now he was about to pay the price he coughed then gagged trying to breathe then he moved his free hand up against the front of shumenkos jacket it would seem to shumenkoconcentrating on killing the interloperas if arkadin was making one last futile attempt to free his trapped hand he was taken completely off guard when arkadin slipped a pen out of his breast pocket stabbed it into his left eye immediately shumenko reared back arkadin caught the gsh as it dropped from the stricken mans nerveless hand as shumenko slid to the catwalk arkadin grabbed him by the shirtfront knelt to be on the same level with him the document he said and when shumenkos head began to loll oleg ivanovich listen to me where is the document the mans good eye glistened running with tears his mouth worked arkadin shook him until he moaned with pain where gone arkadin had to bend his head to hear shumenkos whisper over the loud music the cure had been replaced by siouxsie and the banshees what dyou mean gone down the pipeline shumenkos mouth curled in the semblance of a smile not what you wanted to hear friend of pyotr zilber is it he blinked tears out of his good eye since this is the end of the line for you bend closer and ill tell you a secret he licked his lips as arkadin complied then lunged forward and bit into the lobe of arkadins right ear arkadin reacted without thinking he jammed the muzzle of the gsh into shumenkos mouth pulled the trigger almost at the same instant he realized his mistake said shit in six different languages four bourne sunk deep into the shadows opposite the restaurant jewel saw the two men emerge by the annoyed expressions on their faces he knew theyd lost moira he kept them in sight as they moved off together one of them began to speak into a cell phone he paused for a moment to ask his colleague a question then returned to his conversation on the phone by this time the two had reached m street nw finished with his call the man put his cell phone away they waited on the corner watching the nubile young girls slipping by they didnt slouch bourne noted but stood ramrodstraight their hands in view at their sides it appeared that they were waiting to be picked up a good call on a night like this when parking was at a premium and traffic on m street as thick as molasses bourne without a vehicle looked around saw a bicyclist coming up st street nw from the towpath he was cycling along the gutter to avoid the traffic bourne walked smartly toward him and stepped in front of him the cyclist stopped short uttering a sharp exclamation i need your bike bourne said well you bloody well cant have it mate the cyclist said with a heavy british accent at the corner of st and m a black gmc suv was pulling into the curb in front of the two men bourne pressed four hundred dollars into the cyclists hand like i said right now the young man stared down at the money for a moment then he swung off said be my guest as bourne mounted up he handed over his helmet youll be wanting this mate the two men had already vanished into the gmcs interior the suv was pulling out into the thick traffic flow bourne took off leaving the cyclist to shrug behind him as he climbed onto the sidewalk reaching the corner bourne turned right onto m street the gmc was three cars ahead of him bourne wove his way around the traffic moving into position to keep up with the suv at th street nw they all hit a red light bourne was forced to put one foot down which was why he got a late start when the gmc jumped the light just before it turned green the suv roared ahead of the other vehicles and bourne launched himself forward a white toyota was coming from th into the intersection heading right for him at a ninetydegree angle bourne put on a burst of speed swerved up onto the corner sidewalk backing a clutch of pedestrians into those behind them to a round of curses the toyota horn blaring angrily just missed him as it jounced across m street bourne was able to make good headway as the gmc had been slowed by the sludgy traffic up ahead splitting off where m street and pennsylvania avenue nw intersected at th street just as he neared the light he saw the gmc take off and knew he had been spotted the problem with a bicycle especially one that had caused a minor uproar lunging through a red light was that the cyclist became conspicuous exactly the opposite of what was intended making the best of a worsening situation bourne threw caution to the wind following the accelerating gmc into the fork as it took pennsylvania avenue the good news was that the congestion prevented the gmc from keeping up speed more good news another red light loomed this time bourne was ready for the gmc to plow right through swerving in and out between vehicles he put on another burst of speed running the red light with the big suv but just as he was coming abreast of the far crosswalk a gaggle of drunk teenagers stumbled off the curb on their way across the avenue they closed off the lane behind the gmc and were so raucous they either didnt hear bournes warning shout or didnt care he was forced to swerve sharply to the right his front tire struck the curb the bike lifted up people scattered out of its way as it became in effect a missile bourne was able to keep it going after it landed but there was simply nowhere for him to steer it without plowing into another group of kids he applied the brakes without enough effect leaning to the right he forced the bike down on its side ripping his right trouser leg as it skidded along the cement are you all right what were you trying to do didnt you see the red light you could have killed yourselfor someone else a welter of voices as pedestrians surrounded him trying to help him out from under the bicycle bourne thanked them as he scrambled to his feet he ran several hundred yards down the avenue but as he feared the gmc was long gone expelling a string of bawdily colorful curses arkadin rummaged through the pockets of oleg ivanovich shumenko who lay twitching in the bloodstained catwalk deep inside the sevastopol winery as he did so he wondered how he could have been such a fool hed done precisely what shumenko had wanted him to do which was to kill him hed rather have died than divulge the name of the next man in pyotr zilbers network still there was a chance that something he had on his person would lead arkadin farther along arkadin had already made a small pile of coins bills toothpicks and the like he unfolded each scrap of paper he came across but none of them contained either a name or an address just lists of chemicals presumably those the winery required for fermentation or the periodic cleaning of its vats shumenkos wallet was a sad affairsliverthin containing a faded photo of an older couple smiling into the sun and the camera arkadin took to be shumenkos parents a condom in a worn foil pouch a drivers license car registration id badge for a sailing club an iou chit for ten thousand hryvniajust under two thousand american dollarstwo receipts one for a restaurant the other for a nightclub an old photo of a young girl smiling into the camera in pocketing the receipts the only reasonable leads hed found he inadvertently flipped over the iou on the reverse was the name devra written in a sharp spiky feminine hand arkadin wanted to look for more but he heard an electronic squawk then the bawl of yetnikovas voice he looked around saw an oldfashioned walkietalkie hanging by its strap from the railing stuffing the papers into his pocket he hurried along the catwalk slid down the ladder made his way out of the champagne fermentation room shumenkos boss yetnikova marched toward him down the labyrinthine corridors as if she were in the forefront of the red army entering warsaw even at this distance he could see the scowl on her face unlike his russian credentials his ukrainian ones were paperthin theyd pass a cursory test but after any kind of checking hed be busted i called the sbu office in kiev they did some digging on you colonel yetnikovas voice had turned from servile to hostile or whoever you are she puffed herself up like a porcupine about to do battle they never heard of she gave a little squeak as he jammed one hand over her mouth while he punched her hard in the solar plexus she collapsed into his arms like a rag doll and he dragged her along the corridor until he came to the utility closet opening the door he shoved her in went in after her sprawled on the floor yetnikova slowly came to her senses immediately she began her blustercursing and promising dire consequences for the outrages perpetrated on her person arkadin didnt hear her he didnt even see her he attempted to block out the past but as always the memories flattened him they took possession of him taking him out of himself producing like a drug a dreamlike state that over the years had become as familiar as a twin brother kneeling over yetnikova he dodged her kicks the snapping of her jaws he withdrew a switchblade from a sheath strapped to the side of his right calf when he snikked open its long thin blade fear finally twisted yetnikovas face her eyes opened wide and she gasped raising her hands instinctively why are you doing this she cried why because of what youve done what what did i do i dont even know you but i know you slapping her hands aside arkadin went to work on her when moments later he was done his vision came back into focus he took a long shuddering breath as if shaking off the effects of an anesthetic he stared down at the headless corpse then remembering he kicked the head into a corner filled with filthy rags for a moment it rocked like a ship on the ocean the eyes seemed to him gray with age but they were only filmed with dust and the release he sought eluded him once again who were they moira asked thats the difficulty bourne told her i wasnt able to find out it would help if you could tell me why theyre following you moira frowned i have to assume it has something to do with the security on the lng terminal they were sitting side by side in moiras living room a small cozy space in a georgetown town house of redbrown brick on cambridge place nw near dumbarton oaks a fire was crackling and licking in the brick hearth espresso and brandy sat on the coffee table in front of them the chenillecovered sofa was deep enough for moira to curl up on it had big roll arms and a neckhigh back one thing i can tell you bourne said these people are professionals makes sense she said any rival of my firm would hire the best people available that doesnt necessarily mean im in any danger nevertheless bourne felt another sharp pang at the loss of marie then carefully almost reverently put the feeling aside more espresso moira asked please bourne handed her his cup as she bent forward the light vneck sweater revealed the tops of her firm breasts at that moment she raised her gaze to his there was a mischievous glint in her eyes what are you thinking about probably the same thing you are he rose looked around for his coat i think id better go jason he paused lamplight gave her face a golden glow dont she said stay please he shook his head you and i both know thats not a good idea just for tonight i dont want to be alone not after what you discovered she gave a little shiver i was being brave before but im not you being followed gives me the willies she offered the cup of espresso if it makes you feel any better id prefer you sleep out here this sofas quite comfortable bourne looked around at the warm chestnut walls the dark wooden blinds the jeweltoned accents here and there in the form of vases and bowls of flowers an agate box with gold legs sat on a mahogany sideboard a small brass ships clock ticked away beside it the photos of the french countryside in summer and autumn made him feel both mournful and nostalgic for precisely what he couldnt say though his mind fished for memories none surfaced his past was a lake of black ice yes it is he took the cup sat down beside her she pulled a pillow against her breast shall we talk about what weve been avoiding saying all evening im not big on talking her wide lips curved in a smile which one of you isnt big on talking david webb or jason bourne bourne laughed sipped his espresso what if i said both of us id have to call you a liar we cant have that can we it wouldnt be my choice she rested one cheek on her hand waiting when he said nothing further she continued please jason just talk to me the old fear of getting close to someone reared its head again but at the same time he felt a kind of melting inside him as if his frozen heart were beginning to thaw for some years hed made it an ironclad rule to keep his distance from other people alex conklin had been murdered marie had died martin lindros hadnt made it out of miran shah all gone his only friends and first love with a start he realized that he hadnt felt attracted to anyone except marie he hadnt allowed himself to feel but now he couldnt help himself was that a function of the david webb personality or of moira herself she was strong selfassured in her he recognized a kindred spirit someone who viewed the world as he didas an outsider he looked into her face said what was in his mind everyone i get close to dies she sighed put a hand briefly over his im not going to die her dark brown eyes glimmered in the lamplight anyway its not your job to protect me this was another reason he was drawn to her she was fierce a warrior in her own way tell me the truth then are you really happy at the university bourne thought a moment the conflict inside him becoming an unholy din i think i am after a slight pause he added i thought i was thered been a golden glow to his life with marie but marie was gone that life was in the past with her gone he was forced to confront the terrifying question what was david webb without her he was no longer a family man hed been able to raise his children he saw now only with her love and help and for the first time he realized what his retreat into the university really meant hed been trying to regain that golden life hed had with marie it wasnt only professor specter he didnt want to disappoint it was marie what are you thinking moira said softly nothing he said nothing at all she studied him for a moment then she nodded all right then she rose leaned over kissed him on the cheek ill make up the sofa thats all right just tell me where the linen closet is she pointed over there he nodded good night jason see you in the morning but early ive got i know breakfast with dominic specter bourne lay on his back one arm behind his head he was tired he was sure hed fall asleep immediately but an hour after hed turned off the lights sleep seemed a thousand miles away now and again the redandblack remnants of the fire snapped and softly fell in on themselves he stared at the stripes of light seeping in through the wide wooden blinds hoping theyd take him to faroff places which in his case meant his past in some ways he was like an amputee who still felt his arm even though it had been sawed off the sense of memories just beyond his ability to recall was maddening an itch he couldnt scratch he often wished he would remember nothing at all which was one reason moiras offer was so compelling the thought of starting fresh without the baggage of sadness and loss was a powerful draw this conflict was always with him a major part of his life whether he was david webb or jason bourne and yet whether he liked it or not his past was there waiting for him like a wolf at night if only he could reach through the mysterious barrier his brain had raised not for the first time he wondered what other terrible traumas had befallen him in the past to cause his mind to protect itself from it the fact that the answer lurked within his own mind turned his blood cold because it represented his own personal demon jason the door to moiras bedroom was open despite the dimness his keen eyes could make out her form moving slowly toward him on bare feet i couldnt sleep she said in a throaty voice she stopped several paces from where he lay she was wearing a silk paisley bathrobe belted at the waist the lush curves of her body were unmistakable for a moment they remained in silence i lied to you before she said quietly i dont want you to sleep out here bourne rose on one elbow i lied too i was thinking about what i once had and how ive been desperate to hang on to it but its gone moira all gone forever he drew up one leg i dont want to lose you she moved minutely and a bar of light picked out the glitter of tears in her eyes you wont jason i promise another silence engulfed them this one so profound they seemed to be the only two people left in the world at last he held out his hand and she came toward him he rose from the sofa took her in his arms she smelled of lime and geranium he ran his hands through her thick hair grabbed it her face tilted up to him and their lips came together and his heart shivered off another coating of ice after a long time he felt her hands at her waist and he stepped back she undid the belt and the robe parted slid off her shoulders her naked flesh shone a dusky gold she had wide hips and a deep navel there seemed nothing about her body he didnt love now it was she who took his hand leading him to her bed where they fell upon each other like halfstarved animals bourne dreamed he was standing at the window of moiras bedroom peering through the wooden blinds the streetlight fell across the sidewalk and street casting long oblique shadows as he watched one of the shadows rose up from the cobbles walked directly toward him as if it were alive and could somehow see him through the wide wooden slats bourne opened his eyes the demarcation between sleep and consciousness instantaneous and complete his mind was filled with the dream he could feel his heart working in his chest harder than it should have been at this moment moiras arm was draped over his hip he moved it to her side rolled silently out of bed naked he padded into the living room ashes lay in a cold gray heap in the hearth the ships clock ticked toward the fourth hour of the night he went straight toward the bars of streetlight peered out just as he had in his dream as in his dream the light cast oblique shadows across the sidewalk and street no traffic passed all was quiet and still it took a minute or two but he found the movement minute fleeting as if someone standing had begun to shift from one foot to the other then changed his mind he waited to see if the movement would continue instead a small puff of exhaled breath flared into the light then almost immediately vanished he dressed quickly bypassing both the front and rear doors he slipped out of the house via a side window it was very cold he held his breath so it wouldnt steam up and betray his presence as it had the watcher he stopped just before he reached the corner of the building peered cautiously around the brick wall he could see the curve of a shoulder but it was at the wrong height so low bourne might have taken the watcher for a child in any event he hadnt moved melting back into the shadows he went down th street nw turned left onto dent place which paralleled cambridge place when he reached the end of the block he turned left onto cambridge on moiras block now he could see just where the watcher was situated crouched between two parked cars almost directly across the street from moiras house a gust of humid wind caused the watcher to huddle down sink his head between his shoulders like a turtle bourne seized the moment to cross the street to the watchers side without pausing he advanced down the block swiftly and silently the watcher became aware of him far too late he was still turning his head when bourne grabbed him by the back of his jacket slammed him back across the hood of the parked car this threw him into the light bourne saw his black face recognized the features all in a split second at once he hauled the young man up hustled him back into the shadows where he was certain they wouldnt be seen by other prying eyes jesus christ tyrone he said what the hell are you doing here cant say tyrone was sullen possibly from having been discovered what dyou mean you cant say i signed a confidentiality agreement is why bourne frowned deron wouldnt make you sign something like that deron was the art forger bourne used for all his documents and sometimes unique new technologies or weapons deron was experimenting with doan work fo deron no more who made you sign the agreement tyrone bourne grabbed him by his jacket front who are you working for i dont have time to play games with you answer me cant tyrone could be damn stubborn when he wanted to be a byproduct of growing up on the streets of the northeast washington slums but okay i guess i can take yo where yo can see fo yoself he led bourne around to the unnamed alley behind moiras house stopped at an anonymouslooking black chevy leaving bourne he used his knuckle to knock on the drivers window the window lowered as he bent down to speak to whoever was inside bourne came up pulled him aside so he could look in what he saw astonished even him the person sitting behind the wheel was soraya moore five weve been surveilling her for close to ten days now soraya said ci bourne said why they were sitting in the chevy soraya had turned on the engine to get some heat up shed sent tyrone home even though it was clear he wanted to be her protector according to soraya he was now working for her in a strictly offtherecord capacitya kind of personal blackops unit of one you know i cant tell you that no tyrone cant tell me you can bourne had worked with soraya when hed put together his mission to rescue martin lindros the founder and director of typhon she was one of the few people with whom hed worked in the field both times in odessa i suppose i could soraya admitted but i wont because it appears that you and moira trevor are intimate she sat staring out the window at the blank sheen of the street her large deep blue eyes and her aggressive nose were the centerpieces of a bold arabian face the color of cinnamon when she turned back bourne could see that she wasnt happy at being forced to reveal ci intel theres a new sheriff in town soraya said her name is veronica hart you ever hear of her no and neither have any of the others she shrugged im quite sure that was the point she comes from the private sector black river the president decided on a new broom to sweep out the hash wed all made of the events leading up to the old mans murder whats she like too soon to tell but one thing im willing to bet on shes going to be a whole helluva lot better than the alternative which is secretary of defense halliday has been trying to expand his domain for years now hes moving through luther lavalle the pentagons intel czar rumor has it that lavalle tried to pry away the dci job from veronica hart and she won bourne nodded that says something about her soraya produced a packet of lambert amp butler cigarettes knocked one out lit up when did that begin bourne said soraya rolled down her window partway blew the smoke into the waning night the day i was promoted to director of typhon congratulations he sat back impressed but now we have even more of a mystery why is the director of typhon on a surveillance team at four in the morning i wouldve thought that would be a job for someone farther down the ci food chain it would be in other circumstances soraya inhaled blew smoke out the window again what was left of the cigarette followed then she turned her body toward bourne my new boss told me to handle this myself thats what im doing what does all this clandestine work have to do with moira shes a civilian maybe she is soraya said and maybe she isnt her large eyes studied bournes for a reaction ive been digging through the masses of interoffice emails and cell phone records going back over the last two years i came upon some irregularities and handed them over to the new dci she paused for a moment as if unsure whether to continue the thing is the irregularities concern martins private communications with moira you mean he told her ci classified secrets frankly were not sure the communications werent intact they had to be pieced together and enhanced electronically some words were garbled others were out of order it was clear however that they were collaborating on something that bypassed the normal ci channels she sighed its possible he was merely helping her with security issues for nextgen energy solutions but especially after the multiple security breaches ci recently suffered hart has make it clear that we cant afford to overlook the possibility that shes working clandestinely for some other entity martin knew nothing about you mean she was milking him for intel i find that hard to believe right now you know why i didnt want to tell you about it id like to see these communications for myself for that youll have to see the dci which quite honestly i wouldnt recommend there are still highlevel operatives in ci who blame you for the old mans death thats absurd bourne said i had nothing to do with his death soraya ran a hand through her thick hair it was you who brought karim aljamil back to ci thinking he was martin lindros he looked exactly like martin spoke exactly like him you vouched for him so did a phalanx of ci shrinks youre an easy target around ci rob batt whos just been promoted to deputy director is the ringleader of a group who are convinced youre a schizophrenic unreliable rogue agent im just saying bourne closed his eyes for a moment hed heard these allegations leveled against him time and again youve left off another reason why im an easy target im a legacy left over from the alex conklin era he had the old mans confidence but hardly anyone elses mainly because no one knew what he was doing especially with the program that created me all the more reason for you to stay in the shadows bourne glanced out the window ive got an early breakfast meeting as he was about to get out of the car soraya put a hand on his arm stay out of this jason thats my advice and i appreciate the concern he leaned toward her kissed her lightly on the cheek then he was crossing the street a moment later hed vanished into shadow as soon as he was out of her sight bourne flipped open the cell phone hed lifted from her when hed leaned in to kiss her quickly he scrolled through to veronica harts number connected with it he wondered if hed be pulling her out of sleep but when she answered she sounded wide awake hows the surveillance going she had a rich mellow voice thats what i want to talk with you about there was the briefest of silences before she answered who is this jason bourne where is soraya moore soraya is fine director i simply needed a way to contact you once id broken the surveillance and i was quite certain soraya wouldnt give it to me willingly so you stole her phone i want to meet with you bourne said he didnt have much time at any moment soraya might reach for her phone would know hed hijacked it and come after him i want to see the evidence that led you to order the surveillance on moira trevor i dont take kindly to being told what to do especially by a rogue agent but you will meet with me director because im the only one with access to moira im your fast track to finding out if shes really rotten or whether youre on a wild goose chase i think ill stick to the proven way veronica hart sitting in her new office with rob batt mouthed the words jason bourne to her ddci but you cant bourne said in her ear now that ive broken the surveillance i can ensure that moira vanishes off your grid hart stood up i also dont respond well to threats i have no need to threaten you director im simply telling you the facts batt studied her expression as well as her responses trying to get a reading of the conversation they had been working nonstop since shed returned from her meeting with the president he was exhausted on the point of leaving but this call interested him intensely look bourne said martin was my friend he was a hero i dont want his reputation tarnished all right hart said come to my office later this morning say around eleven im not setting foot inside ci headquarters bourne said well meet this evening at five at the entrance to the freer gallery what if i but bourne had already severed the connection moira was up clad in her paisley robe when bourne returned she was in the kitchen making fresh coffee she glanced at him without comment she had more sense than to ask about his comings and goings bourne took off his coat just checking the area for tails she paused and did you find any quiet as the grave he didnt believe that moira had been pumping martin for ci intel but the inordinate sense of securityof secretivenessinstilled in him by conklin warned him not to tell her the truth she relaxed visibly thats a relief setting the pot on the flame she said do we have time for a cup together gray light filtered through the blinds brightening by the minute an engine coughed traffic started up on the street voices rose briefly and a dog barked the morning had begun they stood side by side in the kitchen between them on the wall was a kitcat klock its raffish kitty eyes and tail moving back and forth as time passed jason tell me it wasnt just mutual loneliness and sorrow that motivated us when he took her in his arms he felt a tiny shiver work its way through her onenight stands are not in my vocabulary moira she put her head against his chest he pulled her hair back from her cheek i dont feel like coffee right now she moved against him neither do i professor dominic specter was stirring sugar into the strong turkish tea he always carried with him when david webb walked into the wonderlake diner on th street nw the place was lined with wooden boards the tables reclaimed wooden slabs the mismatched chairs found objects photographs of loggers and pacific northwest vistas were ranged around the walls interspersed with real logging tools peaveys cant hooks pulp hooks and timberjacks the place was a perennial student favorite because of its hours the inexpensive food and the inescapable associations with monty pythons the lumberjack song bourne ordered coffee as soon as he sat down good morning david specter cocked his head like a bird on a wire you look like you havent slept the coffee was just the way bourne liked it strong black sugarless i had a lot to think about specter cocked his head david what is it anything i can help with my door is always open i appreciate that i always have i can see somethings troubling you whatever it is together we can work it out the waiter dressed in redchecked flannel shirt jeans and timberland boots set the menus down on the table and left its about my job is it wrong for you the professor spread his hands you miss teaching i imagine all right well put you back in the classroom im afraid its more serious than that when he didnt continue professor specter cleared his throat ive noticed a certain restlessness in you over the past few weeks could it have anything to do with that bourne nodded ive think ive been trying to recapture something that cant be caught are you worried about disappointing me my boy specter rubbed his chin you know years ago when you told me about the bourne identity i counseled you to seek professional help such a serious mental schism inevitably builds up pressure in the individual ive had help before so i know how to handle the pressure im not questioning that david specter paused or should i be calling you jason bourne continued to sip his coffee said nothing id love you to stay jason but only if its the right thing for you specters cell phone buzzed but he ignored it understand i only want whats best for you but your lifes been in upheaval first maries death then the demise of your best friends his phone buzzed again i thought you needed sanctuary which you always have here but if youve made up your mind to leave he looked at the number lit up on his phone excuse me a moment he took the call listening the deal cant be closed without it he nodded held the phone away from his ear said to bourne i need to get something from my car please order for me scrambled eggs and dark toast he rose went out of the restaurant his honda was parked directly across th street he was in the middle of the street when two men came out of nowhere one grabbed him while the other struck him several times about the head as a black cadillac screeched to a halt beside the three men bourne was up and running the man struck specter again yanked open the rear door of the car bourne grabbed a pulp hook off the wall sprinted out of the restaurant the man bundled specter into the backseat of the cadillac and jumped in beside him while the first man ducked into the front passengers seat the cadillac took off just as bourne reached it he barely had time to swing the pulp hook into the car before he was jerked off his feet hed been aiming for the roof but the cadillacs sudden acceleration had caused it to pierce the rear window instead the pointed end managed to embed itself in the top of the backseat bourne swung his trailing legs onto the trunk the rear pane of safety glass was completely crazed but the thin film of plastic sandwiched between the glass layers kept it basically intact as the car began to swerve insanely back and forth the driver trying to dislodge him chips of the safety glass came away giving bourne an increasingly tenuous hold on the cadillac the car accelerated ever more dangerously through building traffic then so abruptly it took his breath away it whipped around a corner and he slid off the trunk his body now banging against the driversside fender his shoes struck the tarmac with such force one of them was ripped off sock and skin were flayed off his heel before he could regain a semblance of balance using the fulcrum of the pulp hooks turned wooden handle he levered his legs back up onto the trunk only to have the driver slew the cadillac so that he was almost thrown completely clear of the car his feet struck a trash can sending it barreling down the sidewalk as shocked pedestrians scattered helterskelter pain shot through him and he might have been finished but the driver could not keep the cadillac in its spin any longer traffic forced him to straighten out the cars trajectory bourne took advantage to swing himself back up onto the trunk his right fist plunged through the shattered rear window seeking a second more secure hold the car was accelerating again as it bypassed the last of the bunchedup local traffic gained the ramp onto whitehurst freeway bourne tucked his legs up under him braced on his knees as they passed into shadow beneath the francis scott key bridge the man who had shoved specter into the backseat thrust a taurus pt through the gap in the broken glass the handguns muzzle turned toward bourne as the man prepared to fire bourne let go with his right hand gripped the mans wrist and jerked hard bringing the entire forearm into the open air the motion pushed back the sleeve of the mans coat and shirt he saw a peculiar tattoo on the inside of the forearm three horses heads joined by a central skull he slammed his right knee into the inside of the mans elbow at the same time pushed it back against the frame of the car with a satisfying crack it broke the hand opened the taurus fell away bourne made a grab for it but missed the cadillac swerved into the left lane and the pulp hook ripping through the fabric of the backseat was forced out of bournes hand he gripped the gunmans broken arm with both hands used it to lever himself through the ruined rear window feetfirst he landed between the man with the broken arm and specter who was huddled against the lefthand door the man in the front passengers seat was kneeling on the seat turned toward him he also had a taurus which he aimed at bourne bourne grabbed the body of the man beside him shifted him so that the shot plowed into the mans chest killing him instantly at once bourne heaved the corpse against the gunman in the front bench seat the gunman swiped the corpse in the shoulder in an attempt to move him away but this only brought the corpse in contact with the driver who had put on a burst of speed and who seemed to be focused solely on weaving in and out of the traffic bourne punched the gunman in the nose blood spattered as the gunman was thrown off his knees jolted back against the dashboard as bourne moved to follow up his advantage the gunman aimed the taurus at specter get back he shouted or ill kill him bourne judged the moment if the men had wanted to kill specter theyd have gunned him down in the street since they grabbed him they must need him alive all right unseen by the gunman his right hand scraped along the cushion of the backseat as he raised his hands he flicked a palmful of glass chips into the gunmans face as the mans hands instinctively went up bourne chopped him twice with the edge of his hand the gunman drew out a push dagger the wickedlooking blade protruding from between his second and third knuckles he jabbed it directly at bournes face bourne ducked the blade followed him moving closer until bourne slammed his fist into the side of the gunmans head which snapped back against the rear doorpost bourne heard the crack as his neck broke the gunmans eyes rolled up and he slumped against the door bourne locked his crooked arm around the drivers neck pulled back hard the driver began to choke he whipped his head back and forth trying to free himself as he did so the car swerved from one lane to another the car began to swerve dangerously as he lost consciousness bourne climbed over the seat pushing the driver off down into the passengersside foot well so that he could slide behind the wheel the trouble was though bourne could steer the drivers body was blocking the pedals the cadillac was now out of control it hit a car in the left lane bounced off to the right instead of fighting against the resulting spin bourne turned into it at the same time he shifted the car into neutral instantly the transmission disengaged the engine was no longer being fed gas now its immediate momentum was the issue bourne struggling to gain control found his foot blocked from the brake by part of a leg he steered right jouncing over the divider and into an enormous parking lot that lay between the freeway and the potomac the cadillac sideswiped a parked suv careened farther to the right toward the water bourne kicked the unconscious drivers inert body with his bare left foot at last finding the brake pedal the car finally slowed but not enoughthey were still heading toward the potomac whipping the wheel hard to the right caused the cadillacs tires to shriek as bourne tried to turn the car away from the low barrier that separated the lot from the water as the front end of the cadillac went up over the barrier bourne jammed the brake pedal to the floor and the car came to a halt partway over the side it teetered precariously back and forth specter still huddled in the backseat behind bourne moaned a little the right sleeve of his harris tweed jacket spattered with blood from his captors broken nose bourne trying to keep the cadillac out of the potomac sensed that the front wheels were still on the top of the barrier he threw the car into reverse the cadillac shot backward slamming into another parked car before bourne had a chance to shift back into neutral from far away he could hear the seesaw wail of sirens professor are you all right specter groaned but at least his voice was more distinct we have to get out of here bourne was freeing the pedals from the strangled mans legs that tattoo i saw on the gunmans arm no police specter managed to croak theres a place we can go ill tell you bourne got out of the caddy then helped specter out limping over to another car bourne smashed the window with his elbow the police sirens were coming closer bourne got in hotwired the ignition and the cars engine coughed to life he unlocked the doors the instant the professor slid into the passengers seat bourne took off heading east on the freeway as quickly as he could he moved into the lefthand lane then he turned abruptly to his left the car jumped the central divider and he accelerated heading west now in the opposite direction the sirens were coming from six arkadin took his evening meal at tractir on bolshaya morsekay halfway up the steep hill a typically unlovely place with roughly varnished wooden tables and chairs almost one entire wall was taken up by a painting of threemasted ships in sevastopol harbor circa the food was unremarkable but that wasnt why arkadin was here tractir was the restaurant whose name hed found in oleg ivanovich shumenkos wallet no one here knew anyone named devra so after the borscht and the blini he moved on along the coast was a section called omega filled with cafйs and restaurants as the hub of the citys nightlife culture it featured every variety of club one could want calla was a club a short stroll from the openair car park the night was clear and brisk pinpoints dotted the black sea as well as the sky making for a dizzying vista sea and sky seemed to be virtually interchangeable calla was several steps down from the sidewalk a place filled with the sweet scent of marijuana and an unearthly din a roughly square room was divided between a jampacked dance floor and a raised section filled with minuscule round tables and metal cafй chairs a grid of colored lights pulsed in time with the house music the strawthin female dj was spinning she stood behind a small stand on which was set an ipod hooked up to a number of digital mixing machines the dance floor was packed with men and women bumping hips and elbows was part of the scene arkadin picked his way over to the bar which ran along the front of the right wall twice he was intercepted by young busty blondes who wanted his attention and he assumed his money he brushed past them made a beeline for the harried bartender three tiers of glass shelves filled with liquor bottles were attached to a mirror on the wall behind the bar so patrons could check out the action or admire themselves while getting polluted arkadin was obliged to wade through a phalanx of revelers before he could order a stoli on the rocks when some time later the bartender returned with his drink arkadin asked him if he knew a devra yah sure over there he said nodding in the direction of the strawthin dj it was am before devra took a break there were other people waiting for her to finishfans arkadin presumed he intended to get to her first he used the force of his personality rather than his false credentials not that the rabble here would challenge them but after the incident at the winery he didnt want to leave any trail for the real sbu to follow the state police alias hed used there was now dangerous to him devra was blond almost as tall as he was he couldnt believe how thin her arms were they had no definition at all her hips were no wider than a young boys and he could see the bones of her scapulae when she moved she had large eyes and deadwhite skin as if she rarely saw the light of day her black jumpsuit with its white skull and crossbones across the stomach was drenched in sweat perhaps because of her djing her hands were in constant motion even if the rest of her stayed relatively still she eyed him up and down while he introduced himself you dont look like a friend of olegs she said but when he dangled the iou in front of her face her skepticism evaporated thus is it ever arkadin thought as she led him backstage the venality of the human race cannot be overestimated the green room where she relaxed between sets was better off left to the wharf rats that were no doubt shuttered behind the walls but right now that couldnt be helped he tried not to think of the rats he wouldnt be here long anyway there were no windows the walls and ceiling were painted black no doubt to cover up a multitude of sins devra turned on a lamp with a mean fortywatt bulb and sat down on a wooden chair damaged by knife scars and cigarette burns the difference between the green room and an interrogation cell was negligible there were no other chairs or furniture save for a narrow wooden table against one wall on which was a jumble of makeup cds cigarettes matches gloves and other piles of debris arkadin didnt bother to identify devra leaned back lit a cigarette she nimbly swiped from the table without offering him one so youre here to pay off olegs debt in a sense her eyes narrowed making her look a lot like a stoat arkadin had once shot outside st petersburg meaning what exactly arkadin produced the bills i have the money he owes you right here as she reached out for it he pulled it away in return id like some information devra laughed what do i look like the phone operator arkadin hit her hard with the back of his hand so that she crashed into the table tubes of lipstick and mascara went rolling and tumbling devra put a hand out to steady herself fingers clutching through the morass when she pulled out a small handgun arkadin was ready his fist hammered her delicate wrist and he plucked the handgun from her numb fingers now he said setting her back on the chair are you ready to continue devra looked at him sullenly i knew this was too good to be true she spat shit no good deed goes unpunished arkadin took a moment to process what she was really saying then he said why did shumenko need the ten thousand hryvnia so i was right youre not a friend of his does it matter arkadin emptied the handgun broke it down without taking his eyes off her tossed the pieces onto the table this is between you and me now i think not a deep male voice said from behind him filya devra breathed what took you so long arkadin did not turn around hed heard the click of the switchblade knew what he was up against he eyeballed the mess on the table and when he saw the double halfmoon grips of scissors peeping out from under a small pyramid of cd cases he fixed their location in his mind then turned around as if startled by the big man with heavily pocked cheeks and new hair plugs he retreated up against the edge of the table who the hellre you this is a private discussion arkadin spoke more to distract filya from his left hand moving behind him along the tabletop devra is mine filya brandished the long cruel blade of the handmade switchblade no one talks to her without my permission arkadin smiled thinly i wasnt talking to her so much as threatening her the idea was to antagonize filya to the point that hed do something precipitous and therefore stupid and arkadin succeeded admirably with a growl filya rushed him knife blade extended tilted slightly upward with only one shot at a surprise maneuver arkadin had to make the most of it the fingers of his left hand had gripped the scissors they were small which was just as well he had no intention of again killing someone who might provide useful information he lifted them calculating their weight then as he brought the scissors around the side of his body he flicked his wrist a deceptively small gesture that was nevertheless all power released from his grip the scissors flew through the air embedding in the soft spot just below filyas sternum filyas eyes opened wide as his headlong rush faltered two paces from arkadin then he resumed his advance brandishing the knife arkadin ducked away from the sweeping arc of the blade he grappled with filya wanting only to wear him out let the wound in his chest sap his strength but filya wasnt having any being stabbed had only enraged him with superhuman strength he broke arkadins grip on the wrist that held the switchblade swung it from a low point upward breaking through arkadins defense the point of the blade blurred toward arkadins face too late to stop the attack arkadin reacted instinctively managing to deflect the stab at the last instant so that the point drove through filyas own throat an arcing veil of blood caused devra to scream as she stumbled backward arkadin reached for her clamping one hand over her mouth he shook his head her ashen cheeks and forehead were spattered with blood arkadin supported filya in the crook of one arm the man was dying arkadin had never meant this to happen first shumenko now filya if he had believed in such things he would have said that the assignment was cursed filya he slapped the man whose eyes had turned glassy blood leaked out of the side of filyas slack mouth the package where is it for a moment filyas eyes focused on him when arkadin repeated his question a curious smile took filya down into death arkadin held him for a moment more before propping him up against a wall as he returned his attention to devra he saw a rat glowering from a corner and his gorge rose it took all his willpower not to abandon the girl to go after it rip it limb from limb now he said its just you and me making certain he wasnt being followed rob batt pulled into the parking lot adjacent to the tysons corner baptist church he sat waiting in his car from time to time he checked his watch under the late dci he had been chief of operations the most influential of cis seven directorate heads he was of the beltway old school with connections that ran directly back to yales legendary skull amp bones club of which hed been an officer during his college days just how many skull amp bones men had been recruited into americas clandestine services was one of those secrets its keepers would kill to protect suffice it to say it was many and batt was one of them it was particularly galling for him to play second fiddle to an outsiderand a female at that the old man would never have tolerated such an outrage but the old man was gone murdered in his own home reportedly by his traitorous assistant anne held though battand others of his brethrenhad his doubts about that what a difference three months made had the old man still been alive hed never have considered even consenting to this meet batt was a loyal man but his loyalty he realized extended to the man who had reached out to him in grad school recruited him to ci those were the old days though the new order was in place and it wasnt fair he hadnt been part of the problem caused by martin lindros and jason bournehed been part of the solution hed even been suspicious of the man whod turned out to be an impostor he would have exposed him had bourne not interfered that coup batt knew would have scored him the inside track with the old man but with the old man gone his lobbying for the directorship had been to no avail instead the president had opted for veronica hart god alone knew why it was such a colossal mistake shed just run ci into the ground a woman wasnt constructed to make the kinds of decisions necessary to captain the ci ship the priorities and ways of approaching problems were different with women the hounds of the nsa were circling ci and he couldnt bear watching this woman turn them all the entire company into carrion for the feast at least batt could join the people who would inevitably take over when hart fucked up even so it pained him to be here to embark upon this unknown sea at am the doors to the church swung open the parishioners came down the stairs stood in the wan sunshine turning their heads up like sunflowers at dawn the ministers appeared walking side by side with luther lavalle lavalle was accompanied by his wife and teenage son the two men stood chatting while the family grouped loosely around lavalles wife seemed interested in the conversation but the son was busy ogling a girl more or less his age who was prancing down the stairs she was a beauty batt had to admit then with a start he realized that she was one of general kendalls three daughters because here kendall was with his arm around his stubby wife how the two of them could have produced a trio of such handsome girls was anyones guess even darwin couldnt have figured it out batt thought the two familiesthe lavalles and the kendallsgathered in a loose huddle as if they were a football team then the kids went their own ways some in cars others on bicycles because the church wasnt far from their homes the two wives chastely kissed their husbands piled into a cadillac escalade and took off that left the two men who stood for a moment in front of the church before coming around to the parking lot not a word had been exchanged between them batt heard a heavyweight engine cough to life a long black armored limousine came cruising down the aisle like a sleek shark it stopped briefly while lavalle and kendall climbed inside its engine idling sent small puffs of exhaust into the cool crisp air batt counted to thirty and as hed been instructed got out of his car as he did so the rear door of the limo popped open ducking his head he climbed into the dim plush interior the door closed behind him gentlemen he said folding himself onto the bench seat opposite them the two men sat side by side in the limos backseat luther lavalle the pentagons intel czar and his second general richard p kendall so kind of you to join us lavalle said kindness had nothing to do with it batt thought a convergence of objectives did the pleasures all mine gentlemen im flattered and if i may be frank grateful that you reached out to me were here general kendall said to speak frankly weve opposed the appointment of veronica hart from the start lavalle said the secretary of defense made his opinion quite clear to the president however others including the national security adviser and the secretary of statewho as you know is a personal friend of the presidentboth lobbied for an outsider from the private security sector bad enough batt said and a woman precisely general kendall nodded its madness lavalle stirred its the clearest sign yet of the deterioration of our defense grid that secretary halliday has been warning against for several years now when we start listening to congress and the people of the country all hope is lost kendall said a mulligan stew of amateurs all with petty axes to grind and absolutely no idea of how to maintain security or run the intelligence services lavalle gave off an icy smile thats why the secretary of defense has labored mightily to keep the workings clandestine the more they know the less they understand general kendall said and the more inclined they are to interfere by means of their congressional hearings and threats of budgets cuts oversight is a bitch lavalle agreed which is why areas of the pentagon under my control are working without it he paused for a moment studying batt how does that sound to you deputy director like manna from heaven oleg had screwed up big time devra said arkadin took a stab he got in over his head with loan sharks she shook her head that was last year it had to do with pyotr zilber arkadins ears pricked up what about him i dont know her eyes opened wide as arkadin raised his fist i swear it but youre part of zilbers network she turned her head away from him as if she couldnt stand herself a minor part i shuffle things from here to there within the past week shumenko gave you a document he gave me a package i dont know what was in it devra said it was sealed compartmentalization what she looked up at him blood beads on her face looked like freckles tears had caused her mascara to run giving her dark half circles under her eyes the first principle of putting together a cadre arkadin nodded go on she shrugged thats all i know what about the package i passed it on as i was instructed to do arkadin bent over her who did you give it to she glanced at the crumpled form on the floor i gave it to filya lavalle had paused a moment to reflect we never knew each other at yale you were two years ahead of me batt said but in skull and bones you were notorious lavalle laughed now you flatter me hardly batt unbuttoned his overcoat the stories i heard lavalle frowned are never to be repeated general kendall let loose with a guffaw that filled the compartment should i leave you two girls alone better not one of you could wind up pregnant the comment was meant as a joke of course but there was a nasty undercurrent to it did the military man resent his exclusion from the elite club or the connection the other two had through skull amp bones possibly it was a bit of both in any event batt noted the seconds tone of voice tucked the possible implications into a place where he could examine them later what dyou have in mind mr lavalle im looking for a way to convince the president that his more immoderate advisers made a mistake in recommending veronica hart for dci lavalle pursed his lips any ideas off the top of my head plenty batt said whats in it for me as if on cue lavalle produced another smile were going to require a new dci when we can harts ass out of the district who would be your first choice the current deputy director seems the logical one batt said that would be me lavalle nodded our thought precisely batt tapped his fingertips against his knee if you two are serious we are i assure you batts mind worked furiously it seems to me unwise at this early juncture to have attacked hart directly how about you dont tell us our business kendall said lavalle held up a hand lets hear what the man has to say richard to batt he added however let me make something crystal clear we want hart out as soon as possible we all do but you dont want suspicion thrown back at youor at the defense secretary lavalle and general kendall exchanged a quick and knowing look they were like twins able to communicate with each other without uttering a word indeed not lavalle said she told me how you ambushed her at that meeting with the presidentand the threats you made to her outside the white house women are more easily intimidated than men kendall pointed out its a wellknown fact batt ignored the military man you put her on notice she took your threats very personally she had a killers rep in black river i checked through my sources lavalle seemed thoughtful how would you have handled her i would have made nice welcomed her to the fold let her know youre there for her whenever she needs your help shed never have bought it lavalle said she knows my agenda it doesnt matter the idea is not to antagonize her you dont want her knives out when you come for her lavalle nodded as if he saw the wisdom in this approach so how do you suggest we proceed from here give me some time batt said harts just getting started at ci and because im her deputy i know everything she does every decision she makes but when shes out of the office shadow her see where she goes who she meets using parabolic mikes you can listen in to her conversations between us well have her covered twentyfourseven sounds pretty vanilla to me kendall said skeptically keep it simple especially when theres so much at stake thats my advice batt said what if she cottons on to the surveillance kendall said batt smiled so much the better itll only bolster the ci mantra that the nsa is run by incompetents lavalle laughed batt i like the way you think batt nodded acknowledging the compliment coming from the private sector harts not used to government procedure she doesnt have the leeway she enjoyed at black river i can already see that to her rules and regs are meant to be bent sidestepped even on occasion broken mark my words sooner rather than later director hart is going to give us the ammunition we need to kick her butt out of ci seven how is your foot jason bourne looked up at professor specter whose face was swollen and discolored his left eye was half closed dark as a storm cloud yes specter said after what just happened im compelled to call you by what seems like your rightful name my heel is fine bourne said its me who should be asking about you specter put fingertips gingerly against his cheek in my life ive endured worse beatings the two men were seated in a highceilinged library filled with a large magnificent isfahan carpet oxblood leather furniture three walls were fitted floortoceiling with books neatly arrayed on mahogany shelves the fourth wall was pierced by a large leadedglass window overlooking stands of stately firs on a knoll which sloped down to a pond guarded by a weeping willow shivering in the wind specters personal physician had been summoned but the professor had insisted the doctor tend to bournes flayed heel first im sure we can find you a pair of shoes somewhere specter said sending one of the half a dozen men in residence scurrying off with bournes remaining shoe this rather large stoneandslate house deep in the virginia countryside to which specter had directed bourne was a far cry from the modest apartment the professor maintained near the university bourne had been to the apartment numerous times over the years but never here then there was the matter of the staff which bourne noted with interest as well as surprise i imagine youre wondering about all this specter said as if reading bournes mind all in good time my friend he smiled first i must thank you for rescuing me who were those men bourne said why did they try to kidnap you the doctor applied an antibiotic ointment placed a gauze pad over the heel taped it in place then he wrapped the heel in cohesive bandage its a long story specter said the doctor finished with bourne now rose to examine the professor one i propose to tell you over the breakfast we were unable to enjoy earlier he winced as the doctor palpated areas of his body contusions bruises the doctor intoned colorlessly but no broken bones or fractures he was a small swarthy man with a mustache and dark slickedback hair bourne made him as turkish in fact all the staff seemed of turkish origin he gave specter a small packet you may need these painkillers but only for the next fortyeight hours hed already left a tube of the antibiotic cream along with instructions for bourne while specter was being examined bourne used his cell phone to call deron the art forger whom he used for all his travel documents bourne recited the license tag of the black cadillac hed commandeered from the professors wouldbe kidnappers i need a registration report asap you okay jason deron said in his sonorous londonaccented voice deron had been bournes backup through many hairraising missions he always asked the same question im fine bourne said but thats more than i can say for the cars original occupants brilliant bourne pictured him in his lab in the northeast section of dc a tall vibrant black man with the mind of a conjuror when the doctor departed bourne and specter were left alone i already know who came after me specter said i dont like loose ends bourne replied the cadillacs registration will tell us something perhaps something even you dont know the professor nodded clearly impressed bourne sat on the leather sofa with his leg up on the coffee table specter eased himself into a facing chair clouds chased each other across the windblown sky setting patterns shifting across the persian carpet bourne saw a different kind of shadow pass across specters face professor what is it specter shook his head i owe you a most sincere and abject apology jason im afraid i had an ulterior motive in asking you to return to university life his eyes were filled with regret i thought it would be good for you yes thats true enough absolutely but also i wanted you near me because he waved a hand as if to clear the air of deceit because i was fearful that what happened this morning would happen now because of my selfishness im very much afraid that ive put your life in jeopardy turkish tea strong and intensely aromatic was served along with eggs smoked fish coarse bread butter deep yellow and fragrant bourne and specter sat at a long table covered with a white handfinished linen cloth the china and silverware were of the highest quality again an oddity in an academics household they remained mute while a young man slim and sleek served their perfectly cooked elegantly presented breakfast when bourne began to ask a question specter cut him off first we must fill our stomachs regain our strength ensure our minds are working at full capacity the two men did not speak again until they were finished the plates and cutlery were cleared and a fresh pot of tea had been poured a small bowl of gigantic medjool dates and halved fresh pomegranates lay between them when they were again alone in the dining room specter said without preamble the night before last i received word that a former student of mine whose father was a close friend was dead murdered in a most despicable fashion this young man pyotr zilber was special besides being a former student he ran an information network that spanned several countries after a number of difficult and perilous months of subterfuge and negotiation he had managed to obtain for me a vital document he was found out with the inevitable consequences this is the incident ive been dreading it may sound melodramatic but i assure you its the truth the war ive been engaged in for close to twenty years has reached its final stage what sort of a war professor bourne said against whom ill get to that in a moment specter leaned forward i imagine youre curious shocked even that a university professor should be involved in matters that are more the province of jason bourne he lifted both arms briefly to encompass the house but as youve no doubt noted there is more to me than meets the eye he smiled rather sadly this makes two of us yes as someone who also leads a double life i understand you better than most others i need one personality when i step onto campus but here im someone else entirely he tapped a stubby forefinger against the side of his nose i pay attention i saw something familiar in you the moment i met youhow your eyes took in every detail of the people and things around you bournes cell buzzed he flipped it open listened to what deron had to say then put the phone away the cadillac was reported stolen a hour before it appeared in front of the restaurant that is entirely unsurprising who tried to kidnap you professor i know youre impatient for the facts jason i would be too in your place but i promise they wont have meaning without some background first when i said theres more to me than meets the eye this is what i meant im a terrorist hunter for many years from the camouflage and sanctuary my position at the university affords me i have built up a network of people who gather intelligence just like your own ci however the intelligence that interests me is highly specific there are people who took my wife from me in the dead of night while i was away they snatched her from our house tortured her killed her then dumped her on my doorstep as a warning you see bourne felt a prickling at the back of his neck he knew what it felt like to be driven by revenge when martin died all bourne could think about was destroying the men whod tortured him he felt a new more intimate connection with specter even as the bourne identity rose inside him riding a cresting wave of pure adrenaline all at once the idea of him working at the university struck him as absurd moira was right he was already chafing at the confinement how would he feel after months of the academic life bereft of adventure stripped of the adrenaline rush for which bourne lived my father was taken because he was plotting to overthrow the head of an organization they call themselves the eastern brotherhood doesnt the eb espouse a peaceful integration of muslims into western society thats their public stance certainly and their literature would have you believe its so specter put down his cup in fact nothing could be farther from the truth i know them as the black legion then the black legion has finally decided to come after you if only it were as simple as that he halted at a discreet knock on the door enter the young man hed sent on the errand strode in carrying a shoe box which he set down in front of bourne specter gestured please taking his foot off the table bourne opened the box inside were a pair of very fine italian loafers along with a pair of socks the left one is half a size larger to accommodate the pad that will protect your heel the young man said in german bourne pulled on the socks slipped on the loafers they fit perfectly seeing this specter nodded to the young man who turned and without another word left the room does he speak english bourne asked oh yes whenever the need arises specters face was wreathed in a mischievous smile and now my dear jason youre asking yourself why hes speaking german if hes a turk i assume its because your network spans many countries including germany which is like england a hotbed of muslim terrorist activity specters smile deepened youre like a rock i can always count on you he raised a forefinger but there is yet another reason it has to do with the black legion come ive something to show you filya petrovich pyotrs sevastopol courier lived in an anonymous block of crumbling housing left over from the days the soviets had reshaped the city into a vast barracks housing its largest naval contingent the apartment frozen in time since the s had all the charm of a meat locker arkadin opened the door with the key hed found on filya he pushed devra over the threshold stepped in turning on the lights he closed the door behind him she hadnt wanted to come but she had no say in the matter just as shed had no say in helping him drag filyas corpse out the nightclubs back door they set him down at the end of the filthy alley propped up against a wall damp with unknown fluids arkadin poured the contents of a halfempty bottle of cheap vodka over him then pressed the mans fingers around the bottles neck filya became one drunk among many other drunks in the city his death would be swept away on an inefficient and overworked bureaucratic tide whatre you looking for devra stood in the middle of the living room watching arkadins methodical search what dyou think youll find the document her laugh was a kind of shrill catcall its gone arkadin glanced up from the mess his switchblade had made of the sofa cushions where far out of your reach thats for sure closing his knife arkadin crossed the space between the two of them in one long stride do you think this is a joke or a game were playing here devras upper lip curled are you going to hurt me now believe me nothing you could do would be worse than whats already been done to me arkadin the blood pounding in his veins held himself in check to consider her words what she said was probably the truth under the soviet boot god had forsaken many ukrainians especially the young attractive females he needed to take another tack entirely im not going to hurt you even though youre with the wrong people he turned on his heel sat down on a woodframed chair leaning back he ran his fingers through his hair ive seen a lot of shitive done two stints in prison i can imagine the systematic brutalization youve been through me and my mother god rest her soul the headlights of passing cars shone briefly through the windows then dwindled away a dog barked in an alleyway its melancholy voice echoing a couple passing by outside argued vehemently inside the shabby apartment the patchy light cast by the lamps their shades either torn or askew caused devra to look terribly vulnerable like a wisp of a child arkadin rose stretched mightily strolled over to the window looked out onto the street his eyes picked out every bit of shadow every flare of light no matter how brief or tiny sooner or later pyotrs people were going to come after him it was an inevitability that he and icoupov had discussed before he left the villa icoupov had offered to send a couple of hard men to lie low in sevastopol in the event they were needed but arkadin refused saying he preferred to work alone having assured himself that the street was for the moment clear he turned away from the window back to the room my mother died badly he said she was murdered brutally beaten left in a closet for the rats to gnaw on at least thats what the coroner told me where was your father arkadin shrugged who knows by that time the sonovabitch couldve been in shanghai or he couldve been dead my mother told me he was a merchant marine but i seriously doubt it she was ashamed of having been knocked up by a perfect stranger devra who had sat down on the rippedapart arm of the sofa during this recitation said it sucks not knowing where you came from doesnt it like always being adrift at sea youll never recognize home even if you come upon it home arkadin said heavily i never think of it devra caught something in his tone but youd like to wouldnt you his expression went sour he checked the street again with his usual thoroughness what would be the point because knowing where we come from allows us know who we are she beat softly at her chest with a fist our past is part of us arkadin felt as if shed pricked him with a needle venom squirted through his veins my past is an island ive sailed away from long ago nevertheless its still with you even if youre not aware of it she said with the force of having mulled the question over and over in her own mind we cant outrun our past no matter how hard we try unlike him she seemed eager to talk about her past he found this curious did she think this subject was common ground if so he needed to stay with it to keep the connection with her going what about your father i was born here grew up here she stared down at her hands my father was a naval engineer he was thrown out of the shipyards when the russians took it over then one night they came for him said he was spying on them delivering technical information on their ships to the americans i never saw him again but the russian security officer in charge took a liking to my mother when hed used her up he started on me arkadin could just imagine how did it end an american killed him she looked up at him fucking ironic because this american was a spy sent to photograph the russian fleet when the american had completed his assignment he shouldve gone back home instead he stayed he took care of me nursed me back to health naturally you fell in love with him she laughed if i was a character in a novel sure but he was so kind to me i was like a daughter to him i cried when he left arkadin found that he was embarrassed by her confession to distract himself he looked around the ruined apartment one more time devra watched him warily hey im dying for something to eat arkadin laughed arent we all his hawklike gaze took in the street once more this time the hairs on the back of his neck stirred as he stepped to the side of the window a car hed heard approaching had pulled up in front of the building devra alerted by the sudden tension in his body moved to the window behind him what caught his attention was that though its engine was still running all its lights had been extinguished three men exited the car headed for the building entrance it was past time to leave he turned away from the window were going now pyotrs people it was inevitable theyd find us much to arkadins surprise she made no protest when he hustled her out of the apartment the hallway was already reverberating with the tribal beat of heavy shoes on the concrete floor bourne found walking unpleasant but hardly intolerable hed put up with a lot worse than a flayed heel in his time as he followed the professor down a metal staircase into the basement he reflected that this was proof again that there were no absolutes when it came to people he had assumed that specters life was neat tidy dull and quiet restricted by the dimensions of the university campus nothing could be farther from the truth halfway down the staircase changed to stone treads worn by decades of use their way was guided by plenty of light from below they entered a finished basement made up of movable walls that separated what looked like office cubicles outfitted with laptop computers attached to highspeed modems all of them were staffed specter stopped at the last cubicle where a young man appeared to be decoding text that scrolled across his computer screen the young man becoming aware of specter pulled a sheet of paper out of the printer hopper handed it to him as soon as the professor read it a change came over his demeanor though he kept his expression neutral a certain tension stiffened his frame good work he gave the young man a nod before he led bourne into a room that appeared to be a small library specter crossed to one section of the shelves touched the spine of a compilation of haiku by the master poet matsuo bashoї a square section of the books opened to reveal a set of drawers from one of these specter pulled out what looked like a photo album all the pages were old each one wrapped in archival plastic to preserve them he showed one of them to bourne at the top was the familiar war eagle gripping a swastika in its beak the symbol of germanys third reich the text was in german just below was the word ostlegionen accompanied by a color photo of a woven oval obviously a uniform insignia of a swastika encircled by laurel leaves around the central symbol were the words treu tapir gehorsam which bourne translated as loyal brave steadfast below that was another color photo of a woven rampant wolfs head under which was the designation ostmanische ssdivision bourne noted the date on the page december i never heard of the eastern legions bourne said who were they specter turned the page and there pinned to it was a square of olive fabric on it had been sewn a blue shield with a black border across the top was the word bergkaukasiencaucasus mountains directly beneath it in bright yellow was the emblem of three horses heads joined to what bourne now knew was a deaths head the symbol of the nazi schutzstaffel the protective squadron known colloquially as the ss it was exactly the same as the tattoo on the gunmans arm not were are specters eyes glittered theyre the people who tried to kidnap me jason they want to interrogate me and kill me now that theyve become aware of you theyll want to do the same to you eight the roof or the basement arkadin said the roof she said at once theres only one way in and out of the basement itself they ran as fast as they could to the stairway then took the steps two at a time arkadins heart pounded his blood raced the adrenaline pumped into him with every leap upward he could hear his pursuers laboring up below him the noose was tightening around him racing to the far end of the narrow hallway he reached up with his right hand pulled down the metal ladder that led to the roof soviet structures of this era were notorious for their flimsy doors he knew hed have no trouble breaking out onto the roof from there it was a short jump to the next building and the next then down to the streets where it would be easy to elude the enemy boosting devras body through the square hole in the ceiling he clambered up behind him the shouted calls of the three men filyas apartment had been searched all of them were coming after him gaining the tiny landing he now faced the door to the roof but when he tried to push against the horizontal metal bar nothing happened he pushed harder with the same result fishing a ring of slender metal picks out of his pocket he inserted one after another into the lock fiddling it up and down getting nowhere looking more closely he could see why the interior of the cheap lock was rusted shut it wouldnt open he turned back staring down the ladder here came his pursuers he had nowhere to go on june germany invaded soviet russia professor specter said as they did so they came upon thousands upon thousands of enemy soldiers who either surrendered without a fight or were flatout deserting by august of that year the invading army had interned half a million soviet prisoners of war many of them were muslimstatars from the caucasus turks azerbaijani uzbek kazakhs others from the tribes in the ural mountains turkestan crimea the one thing all these muslims had in common was their hatred of the soviets stalin in particular to make a very long story short these muslims taken as prisoners of war offered their services to the nazis to fight alongside them on the eastern front where they could do the most damage both by infiltration and by decoding soviet intelligence transmissions the fьhrer was elated the ostlegionen became the particular interest of reichsfьhrer ss heinrich himmler who saw islam as a masculine warlike religion that featured certain key qualities in common with his ss philosophy mainly blind obedience the willingness for selfsacrifice a total lack of compassion for the enemy bourne was absorbing every word every detail of the photos didnt his embrace of islam fly in the face of the nazi racial order you know humans better than most jason they have an infinite capacity for rationalizing reality to fit their personal ideas so it was with himmler who had convinced himself that the slavs and the jews were subhuman the asian element in the russian nation made those people who were descended from the great warriors attila genghis khan tamerlane fit his criteria of superiority himmler embraced the muslims from that area descendants of the mongols these men became the core of the nazi ostlegionen but the cream of the crop himmler reserved for himself training them in secret with his best ss leaders honing their skills not simply as soldiers but as the elite warriors spies and assassins it was widely known hed yearned to command he called this unit the black legion you see ive made an exhaustive study of the nazis and their ostlegionen specter pointed to the shield of three horses heads joined by the deaths head this is their emblem from on it became more feared than even the sss own twin lightning bolts or the symbol of its adjunct the gestapo its a little late in the day for nazis to be a serious threat bourne said dont you think the black legions nazi affiliation has long since vanished its now the most powerful and influential islamic terrorist network no one has heard of its anonymity is deliberate it is funded through the legitimate front the eastern brotherhood specter took out another album this one was filled with newspaper clippings of terrorist attacks all over the world london madrid karachi fallujah afghanistan russia as bourne paged through the album the list grew as you can see other known terrorist networks claimed responsibility for some of these attacks for others no claim was made no terrorists were ever linked to them but i know through my sources that all were perpetrated by the black legion specter said and now theyre planning their biggest most spectacular attack jason we think that theyre targeting new york i told you pyotr zilber the young man the black legion murdered was special he was a magician hed somehow managed to steal the plans for the target of the legions attack normally of course the planning would all be oral but apparently the target of this attack is so complex the black legion had to obtain the actual plans of the structure thats why i believe it to be a large building in a major metropolitan area its absolutely imperative that we find that document its the only way well know where the black legion intends to strike arkadin sat on the floor of the small landing his legs on either side of the opening down to the top residential floor shout to them he whispered now that he was situated on the high ground so to speak he wanted to draw them to him go on let them know where you are devra screamed now arkadin heard the hollow ring of someone climbing the metal ladder when a head popped up along with a hand holding a gun arkadin slammed his ankles into the mans ears as his eyes began to roll up arkadin snatched the gun from his hand braced himself and broke the mans neck the moment he let go the man vanished clattering back down the ladder predictably a hail of gunfire shot through the square opening the bullets embedding themselves in the ceiling the moment that abated arkadin shoved devra through the opening followed her sliding down with the insides of his shoes against the outside of the ladder as arkadin had hoped the remaining two men were stunned by the fall of their compatriot and held their fire arkadin shot one through the right eye the other retreated around a corner as arkadin fired at him arkadin gathered the girl bruised but otherwise fine ran to the first door and pounded on it hearing a querulous mans voice raised in protest he pounded on the opposite door no answer firing his gun at the lock he crashed open the door the apartment was unoccupied and from the looks of the piles of dust and filth no one had been in residence in quite some time arkadin ran to the window as he did so he heard familiar squeals he stepped on a pile of rubbish and out leapt a rat then another and another they were all over the place arkadin shot the first one then got hold of himself and slid the window up as far as it would go icy rain struck him sluiced down the side of the building holding devra in front of him he straddled the sash at that moment he heard the third man calling for reinforcements and fired three shots through the ruined door he manhandled her out onto the narrow fire escape and edged them to his left toward the vertical ladder bolted to the concrete that led to the roof save for one or two security lights the sevastopol night was darker than hades itself the rain slanted in needled sheets beating against his face and arms he was close enough to reach out for the ladder when the wroughtiron slats on which he was walking gave way devra shrieked as the two of them plummeted landing against the railing of the fire escape below almost immediately this rickety affair gave way beneath their weight and they toppled over the end arkadin reached out grabbed a rung of the ladder with his left hand he held on to devra with his right they dangled in the air the ground too far for him to risk letting go plus there was no convenient fully loaded dumpster to break their fall he began to lose his grip on her hand draw yourself up he said put your legs around me what he bellowed the command at her and flinching she did as he ordered now lock your ankles tight around my waist this time she didnt hesitate all right arkadin said now reach up you can just make the lowest rungno hold on to it with both hands the rain made the metal slippery and on the first attempt devra lost her grip again arkadin shouted and this time dont let go clearly terrified devra closed her fingers around the rung held on so tightly her knuckles turned white as for arkadin his left arm was being slowly dislocated from its socket if he didnt change his position soon hed be done for now what devra said once your grip on the rung is secure uncross your ankles and pull yourself up the ladder until you can stand on a rung i dont know if i have the strength he lifted himself up until hed wedged the rung in his right armpit his left arm was numb he worked his fingers and bolts of pain shot up into his throbbing shoulder go ahead he said pushing her up he couldnt let her see how much pain he was in his left arm was in agony but he kept pushing her finally she stood on the ladder above him she looked down now you his entire left side was numb the rest of him was on fire devra reached down toward him come on ive got nothing much to live for i died a long time ago screw you she crouched down so when she reached down again she grabbed onto his arm as she did so her foot slipped off the rung slid downward and against him with such force she almost dislodged them both christ im going to fall she screamed wrap your legs back around my waist he shouted thats right now let go of the ladder one hand at a time hold on to me instead when shed done as he said he commenced to climb up the ladder once he was high enough to get his shoes onto the rungs the going was easier he ignored the fire burning up his left shoulder he needed both hands to ascend they made the roof at last rolling over the stone parapet lying breathless on tar streaming with water that was when arkadin realized the rain was no longer hitting his face he looked up saw a manthe third of the triostanding over him a gun aimed at his face the man grinned time to die bastard professor specter put the albums away before he closed the drawer however he took out a pair of photos bourne studied the faces of two men the one in the first photo was approximately the same age as the professor glasses almost comically magnified large watery eyes above which lay remarkably thick eyebrows otherwise his head was bald semion icoupov specter said leader of the black legion he took bourne out of the basement library up the steps out the back of the house into the fresh air a formal english garden lay before them defined by low boxwood hedges the sky was an airy blue high and rich full of the promise of an early spring a bird fluttered between the bare branches of the willow unsure where to alight jason we need to stop the black legion the only way to do that is to kill semion icoupov ive already lost three good men to that end i need someone better i need you im not a contract killer jason please dont take offense i need your help to stop this attack icoupov knows where the plans are all right ill find him and the plans bourne shook his head but he doesnt have to be killed the professor shook his head sadly a noble sentiment but you dont know semion icoupov like i do if you dont kill him hell surely kill you believe me when i tell you ive tried to take him alive none of my men has returned from that assignment he stared out across the pond theres no one else i can turn to no one else who has the expertise to find icoupov and end this madness once and for all pyotrs murder signals the beginning of the endgame between me and the black legion either we stop them here or they will be successful in their attack on this target if what you say is true it is jason i swear to you where is icoupov we dont know for the last fortyeight hours weve been trying to track him but everythings turned up a blank he was in his villa in campione ditalia switzerland thats where we believe pyotr was killed but hes not there now bourne stared down at the two photos he held in his hand whos the younger man leonid danilovich arkadin up until a few days ago we believed he was an independent assassin for hire among the families of the russian grupperovka specter tapped a forefinger between arkadins eyes hes the man who brought pyotr to icoupov somehowwere still trying to establish howicoupov discovered that it was pyotr who had stolen his plans in any event it was arkadin who along with icoupov interrogated pyotr and killed him sounds as if youve got a traitor in your organization professor specter nodded ive reluctantly come to the same conclusion something that had been bothering bourne now rose to the surface of his mind professor who called you when we were having breakfast one of my people he needed verification of information i had it in my car why because it was that call that drew you out into the street just as the black cadillac came by that wasnt a coincidence a frown creased specters brow no i dont suppose it could have been give me his name and address bourne said and well find out for certain the man on the rooftop had a mole on his cheek black as sin arkadin concentrated on it as the man pulled devra off the tar away from arkadin did you tell him anything he said without taking his eyes off arkadin of course not devra shot back what dyou take me for a weak link moleman said i told pyotr not to use you now because of you filya is dead filya was an idiot moleman took his eyes off arkadin to sneer at devra he was your fucking responsibility bitch arkadin scissored his legs between molemans throwing him off balance arkadin quick as a cat leapt on him pummeling him moleman fought back as best he could arkadin tried not to show the pain in his left shoulder but it was already dislocated and it wouldnt work correctly seeing this moleman struck a blow as hard as he could flush into the shoulder all the breath went out of arkadin he sat back dazed almost blacked out with pain moleman scrabbled for his gun found arkadins instead and swung it up he was about to pull the trigger when devra shot him in the back of the head with his own gun without a word he pitched over onto his face she stood widelegged in the classic shooters stance one hand supporting the other around the grips arkadin on his knees for the moment paralyzed with agony watched her swing the gun around point it at him there was something in her eyes he couldnt identify let alone understand then all at once she let out the long breath shed been holding inside her arms relaxed and the gun came down why arkadin said why did you shoot him he was a fool fuck me i hate them all the rain beat down on them drummed against the rooftop the sky utterly dark muffled the world around them they could have been standing on a mountaintop on the roof of the world arkadin watched her approach him she put one foot in front of the other walking stifflegged she seemed like a wild animalangry bitter out of her element in the civilized world like him he was tied to her but he didnt understand her he couldnt trust her when she held out her hand to him he took it nine i have this recurring nightmare defense secretary ervin reynolds bud halliday said im sitting right here at aushak in bethesda when in comes jason bourne and in the style of the godfather part ii shoots me in the throat and then between my eyes halliday was seated at a table in the rear of the restaurant along with luther lavalle and rob batt aushak more or less midway between the national naval medical center and the chevy chase country club was a favorite meeting place of his because it was in bethesda and especially because it was afghani no one he knew or wanted to keep secrets from came here the defense secretary felt most comfortable in offthebeatenpath places he was a man who despised congress despised even more its oversight committees which were always mucking about in matters that didnt concern them and for which they had no understanding let alone expertise the three men had ordered the dish after which the restaurant was named sheets of pasta filled with scallions drenched in a savory meatinfused tomato sauce the whole crowned by rich middle eastern yogurt in which flowered tiny bits of mint the aushak they all agreed was a perfect winter meal well soon have that particular nightmare laid to rest sir lavalle said with the kind of obsequiousness that set batts teeth on edge isnt that so rob batt nodded emphatically quite right i have a plan thats virtually foolproof perhaps that wasnt the correct thing to say halliday frownedno plan is foolproof mr batt especially when it involves jason bourne i assure you no one knows that better than i do mr secretary batt as the seniormost of the seven directorate heads did not care for being contradicted he was a linebacker of a man with plenty of experience beating back pretenders to his crown still he was aware that he was treading terra incognita where a power struggle was raging the outcome unknown he pushed his plate away in dealing with these people he knew he was making a calculated gamble on the other hand he felt the spark that emanated from secretary halliday batt had entered the nations true power grid a place hed secretly longed to be and a powerful sense of elation shot through him because the plan revolves around dci hart batt said now my hope is that well be able to bring down two clay pigeons with one shot not another wordhalliday held up his handto either of us luther and i must maintain plausible deniability we cant afford this operation coming back to bite us on the ass is that clear mr batt perfectly clear sir this is my operation pure and simple halliday grinned son those words are music to these big ol texan ears he tugged at the lobe of his ear now i assume luther here told you about typhon batt looked from the secretary to lavalle and back again a frown formed on his face no sir he didnt an oversight lavalle said smoothly well no time like the present a smile continued to light hallidays expression we believe that one of cis problems is typhon lavalle said its become too much for the director to properly rehabilitate and manage ci and keep tabs on typhon as such responsibility for typhon will be taken off your shoulders that section will be controlled directly by me the entire topic had been handled smoothly but batt knew hed been deliberately sandbagged these people had wanted control of typhon from the beginning typhon is homegrown ci he said its martin lindross brainchild martin lindros is dead lavalle pointed out needlessly another female is the director of typhon now that needs to be addressed along with many other decisions that will affect typhons future you will also need to be making crucial decisions rob about all of ci you dont want more on your plate than you can handle do you it wasnt a question batt felt himself losing traction on a slippery slope typhon is part of ci he said as a last feeble attempt to win back control mr batt halliday interjected we have made our determination are you with us or shall we recruit someone else for dci the man whose call had drawn professor specter out into the street was mikhail tarkanian bourne suggested the national zoo as a place to meet and the professor had called tarkanian the professor then contacted his secretary at the university to tell her that he and professor webb were each taking a personal day they got in specters car which had been driven to the estate by one of his men and headed toward the zoo your problem jason is that you need an ideology specter said an ideology grounds you its the backbone of commitment bourne who was driving shook his head as far back as i can remember ive been manipulated by ideologues so far as i can tell all ideology does is give you tunnel vision everything that doesnt fit within your selfimposed limits is either ignored or destroyed now i know im truly speaking to jason bourne specter said because i tried my best to instill in david webb a sense of purpose he lost somewhere in his past when you came to me you werent just cast adrift you were severely maimed i sought to help heal you by helping you turn away from whatever it was that hurt you so deeply but now i see i was wrong you werent wrong professor no let me finish youre always quick to defend me to believe im always right dont think i dont appreciate how you feel about me i wouldnt want anything to change that but occasionally i do make mistakes and this was one of them i dont know what went into the making of the bourne identity and believe me when i tell you that i dont want to know what seems clear to me however is that however much you dont want to believe it something inside you something innate and connected with the bourne identity sets you apart from everyone else bourne felt troubled by the direction of the conversation do you mean that im jason bourne through and throughthat david webb would have become him no matter what no not at all but i do think from what youve shared with me that if there had been no intervention if there had been no bourne identity then david webb would have been a very unhappy man this idea was not a new one to bourne but hed always assumed the thought occurred to him because he knew so damnably little about who hed been david webb was more of an enigma to him than jason bourne that realization itself haunted bourne as if webb were a ghost a shadowing armature into which the bourne identity had been hung fleshed out given life by alex conklin bourne driving up connecticut avenue nw crossed cathedral avenue the entrance to the zoo appeared up ahead the truth is i dont think david webb would have lasted to the end of the school year then im pleased i decided to involve you in my real passion something seemed to have been settled inside specter its not often a man gets a chance to rectify his mistakes the day was mild enough that the gorilla family had been let out schoolchildren clustered noisily at the end of the area where the patriarch sat surrounded by his brood the silverback did his level best to ignore them but when their incessant chatter became too much for him he walked to the other end of the compound trailed by his family there he sat while the same annoyances spiraled out of control then he plodded back to the spot where bourne had first seen him mikhail tarkanian was waiting for them beside the silverback gorilla area he looked specter up and down clucking over his black eye then he took him in his arms kissed him on both cheeks allah is good my friend you are alive and well thanks to jason here he rescued me i owe him my life specter introduced the two men tarkanian kissed bourne on both cheeks thanking him effusively there came a shuffling of the gorilla family as some grooming got under way damn sad life tarkanian hooked his thumb at the silverback bourne noted that his english was heavily accented in the manner of the tough sokolniki slum of northeast moscow look at the poor bastard tarkanian said the gorillas expression was glumresigned rather than defiant specter said jasons here on a bit of a factfinding mission is he now tarkanian was fleshy in the way of exathletesneck like a bull wary eyes sunk in yellow flesh he kept his shoulders up around his ears as if to ward off an expected blow enough hard knocks in sokolniki to last a lifetime i want you to answer his questions specter said of course anything i can do i need your help bourne said tell me about pyotr zilber tarkanian appearing somewhat taken aback glanced at specter who had retreated a pace in order to center his mans full attention on bourne then he shrugged sure what dyou want to know how did you find out hed been killed the usual way through one of our contacts tarkanian shook his head i was devastated pyotr was a key man for us he was also a friend how dyou figure he was found out a gaggle of schoolgirls pranced by when they had passed out of earshot tarkanian said i wish i knew he wasnt easy to get to ill tell you that bourne said casually did pyotr have friends of course he had friends but none of them would betray him if thats what youre asking tarkanian pushed his lips out on the other hand his words trailed off bourne found his eyes held them pyotr was seeing this woman gala nematova he was headoverheels about her i assume she was properly vetted bourne said of course but well pyotr was a bit um headstrong when it came to women was that widely known i seriously doubt it tarkanian said that was a mistake bourne thought the habits and proclivities of the enemy were always for sale if you were clever and persistent enough tarkanian should have said i dont know possibly as neutral an answer as possible and closer to the truth women can be a weak link bourne thought briefly of moira and the cloud of uncertainty that hovered over her from the ci investigation the idea that martin could have been seduced into revealing ci secrets was a bitter pill to swallow he hoped when he read the communication between her and martin that soraya had unearthed he could lay the question to rest were all sick about pyotrs death tarkanian offered again the glance at specter no question bourne smiled rather vaguely murders a serious matter especially in this case im talking to everyone thats all of course i understand youve been extremely helpful bourne smiled shook tarkanians hand as he did so he said in a sharp tone of voice by the way how much did icoupovs people pay you to call the professors cell this morning instead of freezing tarkanian seemed to relax what the hell kind of question is that im loyal i always have been after a moment he tried to extricate his hand but bournes grip tightened tarkanians eyes met bournes held them behind them the silverback made a noise growing restive the sound was low like the sudden ripple of wind disturbing a field of wheat the message from the gorilla was so subtle bourne was the only one who picked up on it he registered movement at the extreme edge of his peripheral vision tracked for several seconds he leaned back to specter said in a low urgent voice leave now go straight through the small mammal house then turn left a hundred yards on will be a small food kiosk ask for help getting to your car go back to your house and stay there until you hear from me as the professor walked swiftly away bourne grabbed tarkanian pushed him in the opposite direction they joined a home sweet habitat scavenger hunt comprising a score of rowdy kids and their parents the two men bourne was tracking hurried toward them it was this pair and their rushed anxiety that had aroused the suspicion of the silverback alerting bourne where are we going tarkanian said why did you leave the professor unprotected a good question bournes decision had been instantaneous instinctdriven the men headed toward tarkanian not the professor now as the group moved down olmsted walk bourne dragged tarkanian into the reptile discovery center the lights were low here they hurried past glass cases that held dozing alligators sliteyed crocodiles lumbering tortoises evillooking vipers and pebbleskinned lizards of all sizes shapes and dispositions up ahead bourne could see the snake cases at one of them a handler opened a door prepared to set out a feast of rodents for the green tree pythons which in their hunger had emerged from their stupor slithering along the cases fake tree branches these snakes used infrared heat sensors to target their prey behind them the two men wove their way through the crowd of children they were swarthy but otherwise unremarkable in feature they had their hands plunged into the pockets of their wool overcoats surely gripping some form of weapon they werent hurrying now there was no point in alarming the visitors passing the european glass lizard bourne hauled tarkanian into the snake section it was at that moment that tarkanian chose to make a move twisting away as he lunged back toward the approaching men he dragged bourne for a step until bourne struck him a dizzying blow to the side of the head a workman knelt with his toolbox in front of an empty case he was fiddling with the ventilation grille at the base bourne swiped a short length of stiff wire from the box the cavalrys not going to save you today bourne said as he dragged tarkanian toward a door set flush in the wall between cases that led to the work area hidden from the public one of the pursuers was closing in when bourne jimmied the lock with the bit of wire he opened the door stepped through he slammed it shut behind him set the lock the door began to shudder on its hinges as the men pounded on it bourne found himself in a narrow utility corridor lit by long fluorescent tubes that ran behind the cases doors and in the cases of the venomous snakes feeding windows appeared at regular intervals along the righthand wall bourne heard a soft phutt and the lock popped out of the door the men were armed with smallcaliber handguns fitted with suppressors he pushed the stumbling tarkanian ahead of him as one of the men stepped through where was the other one bourne thought he knew and he turned his attention to the far end of the corridor where any moment now he expected the second man to appear tarkanian sensing bournes momentary shift of attention spun slamming the side of his body into bournes thrown off balance bourne skidded through the open doorway into the tree python case with a harsh bark of laughter tarkanian rushed on a herpetologist in the case to check on the python was already protesting bournes appearance bourne ignored him reached up unwound one of the hungry pythons from the branch nearest him as the snake sensing his heat wrapped itself around his outstretched arm bourne turned and burst out into the corridor just in time to drive a fist into the gunmans solar plexus when the man doubled over bourne slid his arm out of the pythons coils wrapped its body around the gunmans chest seeing the python the man screamed it began to tighten its coils around him bourne snatched the handgun with its suppressor from his hand took off after tarkanian the gun was a glock not a taurus as bourne suspected these two werent part of the same team that had abducted the professor who were they then members of the black legion sent to extract tarkanian but if that was the case how had they known hed been blown no time for answers the second man had appeared at the far end of the corridor he was in a crouch motioning to tarkanian who squeezed himself against the side of the corridor as the gunman took aim at him bourne covered his face with his folded forearms dived headfirst through one of the feeding windows glass shattered bourne looked up to see that he was facetoface with a gaboon viper the species with the longest fangs and highest venom yield of any snake it was black and ocher its ugly triangular head rose its tongue flicked out sensing trying to determine if the creature sprawled in front of it was a threat bourne lay still as stone the viper began to hiss a steady rhythm that flattened its head with each fierce exhalation the small horns beside its nostrils quivered bourne had definitely disturbed it having traveled extensively in africa he knew something of this creatures habits it was not prone to bite unless severely provoked on the other hand he couldnt risk moving his body at all at this point aware that he was vulnerable from behind as well as in front he slowly raised his left hand the hissings steady rhythm didnt change keeping his eyes on the snakes head he moved his hand until it was over the snake hed read about a technique meant to calm this kind of snake but had no idea whether it would work he touched the snake on the top of its head with a fingertip the hissing stopped it did work he grasped it at its neck letting go of the gun he supported the vipers body with his other hand the creature didnt struggle walking gingerly across the case to the far end he set it carefully down in a corner a group of kids were staring openmouthed from the other side of the glass bourne backed away from the viper never taking his eyes from it near the shattered feeding window he knelt down grasped the glock a voice behind him said leave the gun where it is and turn around slowly the damn things dislocated arkadin said devra stared at his deformed shoulder youll have to reset it for me drenched to the bone they were sitting in a latenight cafй on the other side of sevastopol warming themselves as best they could the gas heater in the cafй hissed and hiccupped alarmingly as if it were coming down with pneumonia glasses of steaming tea sat before them half empty it was barely an hour after their hairsbreadth escape and both of them were exhausted youre kidding she said absolutely you will he said i cant go to a proper doctor arkadin ordered food devra ate like an animal shoving dripping pieces of stew into her mouth with her fingertips she looked as if she hadnt eaten in days perhaps she hadnt seeing how she laid waste to the food arkadin ordered more he ate slowly and deliberately conscious of everything he put into his mouth killing did that to him all his senses were working overtime colors were brighter smells stronger everything tasted rich and complex he could hear the acrid political argument going on in the opposite corner between two old men his own fingertips on his cheek felt like sandpaper he was acutely aware of his own heartbeat the blood rushing behind his ears he was in short a walking talking exposed nerve he both loved and hated being in this state the feeling was a form of ecstasy he remembered coming across a dogeared paperback copy of the teachings of don juan by carlos castaneda had learned to read english from it a long torturous path the concept of ecstasy had never occurred to him before reading this book later in emulation of castaneda he thought of trying peyoteif he could find itbut the idea of a drug any drug set his teeth on edge he was already lost quite enough he held no desire to find a place from which he could never return meanwhile the ecstasy he was in was a burden as well as a revelation but he knew he couldnt long stand being that exposed nerve everything from a car backfiring to the chirrup of a cricket crashed against him as painful as if hed been turned inside out he studied devra with an almost obsessive concentration he noticed something he hadnt seen beforelikely with her gesticulating shed distracted him from noticing but now shed let down her guard perhaps she was just exhausted or had relaxed with him she had a tremor in her hands a nerve that had gone awry clandestinely he watched the tremor thinking it made her seem even more vulnerable i dont get you he told her now why have you turned against your own people you think pyotr zilber oleg shumenko and filya were my own people youre a cog in zilbers network what else would i think you heard how that pig talked to me up on the roof shit they were all like that she wiped grease off her lips and chin i never liked shumenko first it was gambling debts i had to bail him out of then it was drugs arkadins voice was offhand when he said you told me you didnt know what the last loan was for i lied did you tell pyotr youre joking pyotr was the worst of the lot talented little bugger though devra nodded so i thought when i was in his bed he got away with an awful lot of shit because he was the bossdrinking partying and jesus the girls sometimes two and three a night i got thoroughly sick of him and asked to be reassigned back home so shed been pyotrs squeeze for a short time arkadin thought the partying was part of his job though forging contacts ensuring they came back for more sure trouble was he liked it all too much and inevitably that attitude infected those who were close to him where dyou think shumenko learned to live like that from pyotr thats who and filya filya thought he owned me like chattel when wed go out together hed act as if he was my pimp i hated his guts why didnt you get rid of him he was the one supplying shumenko with coke quick as a cat arkadin leaned across the table looming listen lapochka i dont give a fuck who you like or dont like but lying to me thats another story what did you expect she said you blew in like a fucking whirlwind arkadin laughed then breaking a tension that was stretched to the breaking point this girl had a sense of humor which meant she was clever as well as smart his mind had made a connection between her and a woman whod once been important to him i still dont understand you he shook his head were on different sides of this conflict thats where youre wrong i was never part of this conflict i didnt like it i only pretended i did at first it was a goal i set for myself whether i could fool pyotr and then the others when i did it just seemed easier to keep going i got paid well i learned quicker than most i got perks i never would have gotten from being a dj you couldve left anytime could i she cocked her head they wouldve come after me like theyre coming after you but now youve made up your mind to leave them he cocked his head dont tell me its because of me why not i like sitting next to a whirlwind its comforting arkadin grunted embarrassed again besides the last straw came when i found out what theyre planning you thought of your american savior maybe you cant understand that one person can make a difference in your life oh but i can arkadin said thinking of semion icoupov in that you and i are the same she gestured you look so uncomfortable come on he said standing he led her back past the kitchen poked his head in for a moment then took her into the mens room get out he ordered a man at the sink he checked the stall to make sure they were alone ill tell you how to fix this damnable shoulder when he gave her the instructions she said is it going to hurt in answer he put the handle of the wooden spoon hed swiped from the kitchen between his teeth with great reluctance bourne turned his back on the gaboon viper many things flitted through his mind not the least of which was mikhail tarkanian he was the mole inside the professors organization who knew how much intel he had about specters network bourne couldnt afford to let him get away the man before him now was flatfaced his skin slightly greasy he had a twoday growth of beard and bad teeth his breath stank from cigarettes and rotting food he pointed his suppressed glock directly at bournes chest come out of there he said softly it wont matter whether or not i comply bourne answered the herpetologist down the corridor has surely phoned security were all about to be put into custody out now the man made a fatal error of gesturing with the glock bourne used his left forearm to knock the elongated barrel aside slamming the gunman back against the opposite wall of the corridor bourne drove a knee into his groin as the gunman gagged bourne chopped the gun out of his hand grabbed him by his overcoat flung him headlong into the gaboon vipers case with such force that he skidded along the floor toward the corner where the viper lay coiled bourne imitating the viper made a rhythmic hissing sound and the snake raised its head at the same moment it heard the hissing of a rival snake it sensed something living thrust into its territory it struck out at the terrified gunman bourne was already pounding down the corridor the door at the far end gaped open he burst out into daylight tarkanian was waiting for him in case he escaped the two gunmen he had no stomach to prolong the pursuit he drove a fist into bournes cheek followed that up with a vicious kick but bourne caught his shoe in his hands twisted his foot violently spinning him off his feet bourne could hear shouts the slap and squeak of cheap soles against concrete security was on its way though he couldnt see them yet tarkanian he said and coldcocked him tarkanian went down heavily bourne knelt beside him and was giving him mouthtomouth when three security guards rounded the corner came pounding up to him my friend collapsed just as we saw the men with the guns bourne gave an accurate description of the two gunmen pointed toward the open door to the reptile discovery center can you get help my friend is allergic to mustard i think there must have been some in the potato salad we had for lunch one of the security guards called while the other two guns drawn vanished into the doorway the guard stayed with bourne until the paramedics arrived they took tarkanians vitals loaded him onto the gurney bourne walked at tarkanians side as they made their way through the gawking crowds to the ambulance waiting on connecticut avenue he told them about tarkanians allergic reaction also that in this state he was hypersensitive to light he climbed into the back of the ambulance one of the paramedics closed the doors behind him while the other prepared the iv drip of phenothiazine the vehicle took off siren wailing tears streamed down arkadins face but he made no noise the pain was excruciating but at least the arm was back in its socket he could move the fingers of his left hand just barely the good news was that the numbness was giving way to a peculiar tingling as if his blood had turned to champagne devra held the wooden spoon in her hand shit you almost bit this in two it mustve hurt like a bitch arkadin dizzy and nauseous grimaced in pain i could never get food down now devra tossed aside the spoon as they left the mens room arkadin paid their check and they went out of the cafй the rain had stopped leaving the streets with that slick justwashed look so familiar to him from old american films from the s and s we can go to my place devra offered its not far from here arkadin shook his head i think not they walked seemingly aimlessly until they came to a small hotel arkadin booked a room the flyblown night clerk barely looked at them he was only interested in taking their money the room was mean barely furnished with a bed a hardbacked chair and a dresser with three legs and a pile of books propping up the fourth corner a circular threadbare carpet covered the center of the room it was stained pocked with cigarette burns what appeared to be a closet was the toilet the shower and sink were down the hall arkadin went to the window hed asked for a room in front knowing it would be noisier but would afford him a birdseye view of anyone coming the street was deserted not a car in sight sevastopol glowed in a slow cold pulse time he said turning back into the room to get some things straight now cant this wait devra was lying crosswise on the bed her feet still on the floor im dead on my feet arkadin considered a moment it was deep into the night he was exhausted but not yet ready for sleep he kicked off his shoes lay down on the bed devra had to sit up to make room for him but instead of lying down parallel to him she resumed her position head on his belly she closed her eyes i want to come with you she said softly almost as if in sleep he was instantly alert why he said why would you want to come with me she said nothing in reply she was asleep for a time he lay listening to her steady breathing he didnt know what to do with her but she was all he had left of this end of pyotrs network he spent some time digesting what she had told him about shumenko filya and pyotr looking for holes it seemed improbable to him that pyotr could be so undisciplined but then again hed been betrayed by his girlfriend of the moment who worked for icoupov that spoke of a man out of control whose habits could indeed filter down to his subordinates he had no idea if pyotr had daddy issues but given who his daddy was it certainly wasnt out of the question this girl was strange on the surface she was so much like other young girls hed come across hardedged cynical desperate and despairing but this one was different he could see beneath her armor plating to the little lost girl she once had been and perhaps still was he put his hand on the side of her neck felt the slow pulse of her life he could be wrong of course it could all be a performance put on for his benefit but for the life of him hed couldnt figure out what her angle might be and there was something else about her connected to her fragility her deliberate vulnerability she needed something he thought as in the end we all did even those who fooled themselves into thinking they didnt he knew what he needed it was simply that he chose not to think about it she needed a father that was clear enough he couldnt help suspecting there was something about her he was missing something she hadnt told him but wanted him to find the answer was already inside him dancing like a firefly but every time he reached out to capture it it just danced farther away the feeling was maddening as if hed had sex with a woman without reaching an orgasm and then she stirred and in stirring said his name it was like a bolt of lightning illuminating the room he was back on the rainy rooftop with moleman standing over him listening to the conversation between him and devra he was your responsibility moleman said referring to filya arkadins heart beat faster your responsibility why would moleman say that if filya was the courier in sevastopol as if of their own accord his fingertips stroked the velvet flesh of devras neck the crafty little bitch filya was a soldier a guard she was the courier in sevastopol shed handed the document off to the next link she knew where he had to go next holding her tightly arkadin at last let go of the night the room the present on a tide of elation he drifted into sleep into the bloodsoaked clutches of his past arkadin would have killed himself this was certain had it not been for the intervention of semion icoupov arkadins best and only friend mischa tarkanian concerned for his life had appealed to the man he worked for arkadin remembered with an eerie clarity the day icoupov had come to see him he had walked in and arkadin half crazed with a will to die had put a makarov pm to his headthe same gun he was going to use to blow his own brains out icoupov to his credit didnt make a move he stood in the ruins of arkadins moscow apartment not looking at arkadin at all arkadin in the grip of his sulfurous past was unable to make sense of anything much later he understood in the same way you didnt look a bear in the eye lest he charge you icoupov had kept his gaze focused on other thingsthe broken picture frames the smashed crystal the overturned chairs the ashes of the fetishistic fire arkadin had lit to burn his clothes mischa tells me youre having a difficult time mischa should keep his mouth shut icoupov spread his hands someone has to save your life what dyou know about it arkadin said harshly actually i know nothing about whats happened to you icoupov said arkadin digging the muzzle of the makarov into icoupovs temple stepped closer then shut the fuck up what i am concerned about is the here and now icoupov didnt blink an eye he didnt move a muscle either for fucks sake son look at you if you wont pull back from the brink for yourself do it for mischa who loves you better than any brother would arkadin let out a ragged breath as if he were expelling a dollop of poison he took the makarov from icoupovs head icoupov held out his hand when arkadin hesitated he said with great gentleness this isnt nizhny tagil there is no one here worth hurting leonid danilovich arkadin gave a curt nod let go of the gun icoupov called out handed it to one of two very large men who came down the hallway from the far end where they had been stationed not making a sound arkadin tensed angry at himself for not sensing them clearly they were bodyguards in his current condition they could have taken arkadin anytime he looked at icoupov who nodded and an unspoken connection sprang up between them there is only one path for you now icoupov said icoupov moved to sit on the sofa in arkadins trashed apartment then gestured and the bodyguard who had taken possession of arkadins makarov held it out to him here now you will have witnesses to your last spasm of nihilism if you wish it arkadin for once in his life ignored the gun stared implacably at icoupov no icoupov shrugged do you know what i think leonid danilovich i think it gives you a measure of comfort to believe that your life has no meaning most times you revel in this belief its what fuels you but there are times like now when it takes you by the throat and shakes you till your teeth rattle in your skull he was dressed in dark slacks an oystergray shirt a long black leather coat that made him look somewhat sinister like a german ssstьrmbannfьhrer but i believe to the contrary that you are searching for the meaning of your life his dark skin shone like polished bronze he gave the appearance of a man who knew what he was doing someone above all not to be trifled with what path arkadin said dully taking a seat on the sofa icoupov gestured with both hands encompassing the selfinflicted whirlwind that had torn apart the rooms the past for you is dead leonid danilovich do you not agree god has punished me god has abandoned me arkadin said regurgitating by rote a lament of his mothers icoupov smiled a perfectly innocent smile one that could not possibly be misinterpreted he had an uncanny ability to engage others oneonone and what god is that arkadin had no answer because this god he spoke of was his mothers god the god of his childhood the god that had remained an enigma to him a shadow a god of bile of rage of split bone and spilt blood but no he said god like heaven is a word on a page hell is the here and now icoupov shook his head you have never known god leonid danilovich put yourself in my hands with me you will find god and learn the future he has planned for you i cannot be alone arkadin realized that this was the truest thing hed ever said nor shall you be icoupov turned to accept a tray from one of the bodyguards while they had been talking hed made tea icoupov poured two glasses full added sugar handed one to arkadin drink with me now leonid danilovich he said as he lifted his steaming glass to your recovery to your health to the future which will be as bright for you as you wish to make it the two men sipped their tea which the bodyguard had astutely fortified with a considerable amount of vodka to never being alone again said leonid danilovich arkadin that was a long time ago at a way station on a river that had turned to blood was he much changed from the nearinsane man who had put the muzzle of a gun to semion icoupovs head who could say but on days of heavy rain ominous thunder and twilight at noon when the world looked as bleak as he knew it to be thoughts of his past surfaced like corpses in a river regurgitated by his memory and he would be alone again tarkanian was coming around but the phenothiazine that had been administered to him was doing its job sedating him mildly and impairing his mental functioning enough so that when bourne bent over him and said in russian bournes dead were in the process of extracting you tarkanian dazedly thought he was one of the men at the reptile house icoupov sent you tarkanian lifted a hand felt the bandage the paramedics had used to keep light out of his eyes why cant i see lie still bourne said softly there are civilians around paramedics thats how were extracting you youll be safe in the hospital for a few hours while we arrange the rest of your travel tarkanian nodded icoupov is on the move bourne whispered do you know where no he wants you to be most comfortable during your debriefing where should we take you moscow of course tarkanian licked his lips its been years since ive been home i have an apartment on the frunzenskaya embankment more and more he seemed to be speaking to himself from my living room window you can see the pedestrian bridge to gorky park such a peaceful setting i havent seen it in so long they arrived at the hospital before bourne had a chance to continue the interrogation then everything happened very quickly the doors banged open and the paramedic leapt into action getting the gurney down rushing it through the automatic glass doors into a corridor leading to the er the place was packed with patients one of the paramedics was talking to a harried overworked intern who directed him to a small room one of many off the corridor bourne saw that the other rooms were filled the two paramedics rolled tarkanian into the room checked the iv took his vitals again unhooked him hell come around in a minute one of them said someone will be in shortly to see to him he produced a practiced smile that was not unlikable dont worry your friends going to be fine after theyd left bourne went back to tarkanian said mikhail i know the frunzenskaya embankment well where exactly is your apartment hes not going to tell you bourne whirled just as the first gunmanthe one hed wrapped the python aroundthrew himself on top of him bourne staggered back bounced hard against the wall he struck at the gunmans face the gunman blocked it punched bourne hard on the point of his sternum bourne grunted and the gunman followed up with a short chop to bournes side down on one knee bourne saw him pull out a knife swipe the blade at him bourne shrank back the gunman attacked with the knife pointfirst bourne landed a hard right flush on his face heard the satisfying crack of the cheekbone fracturing enraged the gunman closed the blade swinging through bournes shirt bringing out an arc of blood like beads on a string bourne hit him so hard he staggered back struck the gurney on which tarkanian was stirring out of his drugged stupor the man took out his handgun with the suppressor bourne closed with him grabbing him tightly depriving him of space to aim the gun tarkanian ripped off the bandage the paramedics had used to keep light out of his eyes blinked heavily looking around what the hells going on he said drowsily to the gunman you told me bourne was dead the man was too busy fending off bournes attack to answer seeing his firearm was of no use to him he dropped it kicked it along the floor he tried to get the knife blade inside bournes defense but bourne broke the attacks not fooled by the feints the gunman used to distract him tarkanian sat up slid off the gurney he found it difficult to talk so he slipped to his knees crawled across the cool linoleum to where the gun lay the gunman one hand gripping bournes neck was working the knife free prepared to stab downward into bournes stomach move away from him tarkanian was aiming the gun at the two men ill have a clear shot the gunman heard him shoved the heel of his hand into bournes adams apple choking him then he moved his upper body to one side just as tarkanian was about to squeeze the trigger bourne rabbitpunched the gunman in the kidney he groaned and bourne hauled him between himself and tarkanian a coughing sound announced the bullet plowing into the gunmans chest tarkanian cursed moved to get bourne back in his sights as he did so bourne wrested the knife away from the gunmans limp hand threw it with deadly accuracy the force of it lifted tarkanian backward off his feet bourne pushed the gunman away from him crossed the room to where tarkanian lay in a pool of his own blood the knife was buried to the hilt in his chest by its position bourne knew it had pierced a lung within moments tarkanian would drown in his own blood tarkanian stared up at bourne he laughed even as he said now youre a dead man ten rob batt made his arrangements through general kendall lavalles second in command through him batt was able to access certain blackops assets in the nsa no congressional oversight no fuss no muss as far as the federal government was concerned these people didnt exist except as auxiliary staff seconded to the pentagon they were thought to be pushing papers in a windowless office somewhere in the bowels of the building now this is the way the clandestine services should run batt said to himself as he laid out the operation for the eight young men ranged in a semicircle in a pentagon briefing room kendall had provided for him no supervision no snooping congressional committees to report to the plan was simple as all his plans tended to be other people might like bells and whistles but not batt vanilla kendall had called it but the more that was involved the more that could go wrong was how he looked at it also no one fucked up simple plans they could be put together and executed in a matter of hours if need be even with new personnel but the fact was he liked these nsa agents perhaps because they were military men they were quick to catch on quicker even to learn he never had to repeat himself to a man they seemed to memorize everything as it was presented to them better still because of their military background they obeyed orders unquestioningly unlike agents in cisoraya moore a case in pointwho always thought they knew a better way to get things done plus these bad boys werent afraid of rendition they werent afraid to pull the trigger if given the appropriate order theyd kill a target without either question or regret batt felt a certain exhilaration at the knowledge that no one was looking over his shoulder that he wouldnt have to explain himself to anyonenot even the new dci hed entered an altogether different arena one all his own where he could make decisions of great moment devise field operations and carry them out with the confidence that he would be backed to the hilt that no operation would ever boomerang on him bring him facetoface with a congressional committee and disgrace as he wrapped up the premission briefing his cheeks were flushed his pulse accelerated there was a heat building inside him that could almost be called arousal he tried not to think of his conversation with the defense secretary tried not to think of luther lavalle heading up typhon while he looked helplessly on he desperately didnt want to give up control of such a powerful weapon against terrorism but halliday hadnt given him a choice one step at a time if there was a way to foil halliday and lavalle he was confident hed find it but for the moment he returned his attention to the job at hand no one was going to fuck up his plan to capture jason bourne he knew this absolutely within hours bourne would be in custody down so deep even a houdini like him would never get out soraya moore made her way to veronica harts office two men were emerging dick symes the chief of intelligence and rodney feir chief of field support symes was a short round man whose red face appeared to have been applied directly to his shoulders feir several years symess junior was fairhaired with an athletic body an expression as closed as a bank vault both men greeted her cordially but there was a repellent condescension to symess smile bearding the lioness in her den feir said is she in a bad mood soraya asked feir shrugged too soon to tell were waiting to see if she can carry the weight of the world on those delicate shoulders symes said just like with you director soraya forced a smile though her clenched jaws you gentlemen are too kind feir laughed ready willing and able to oblige maam soraya watched them leave two peas in a pod then she poked her head into the dcis inner sanctum unlike her predecessor veronica hart maintained an opendoor policy when it came to her upperechelon staff it engendered a sense of trust and camaraderie thatas shed told sorayahad been sorely lacking at ci in the past in fact from the vast amount of electronic data shed pored over the last couple of days it was becoming increasing clear to her that the previous dcis bunker mentality had led to an atmosphere of cynicism and alienation among the directorate heads the old man came from the school of letting the seven vie with one another complete with duplicity backstabbing and so far as she was concerned outright objectionable behavior hart was a product of a new era where the primary watchword was cooperation the events of had proved that when it came to the intelligence services competition was deadly so far as soraya was concerned that was all to the good how long have you been at this soraya asked hart glanced out the window its morning already i ordered rob home hours ago way past morning soraya smiled how about lunch you definitely need to get out of this office she spread her hands to indicate the queue of dossiers loaded onto her computer too much work it wont get done if you pass out from hunger and dehydration okay the canteen its such a fine day i was thinking of walking to a favorite restaurant of mine hearing a warning note in sorayas otherwise light voice hart looked up yes there was definitely something her director of typhon wanted to talk to her about outside the confines of the ci building hart nodded all right ill get my coat soraya took out her new cell which shed picked up at ci this morning shed found her old one in the gutter by her car at the moira trevor surveillance site had disposed of it at the office now she texted a message a moment later harts cell buzzed the text from soraya read van x st van across the street hart folded her cell away and launched into a long story at the end of which both women laughed then they talked about shoes versus boots leather versus suede and which jimmy choos theyd buy if they were ever paid enough both women kept an eye on the van without seeming to look at it soraya directed them down a side street where the van couldnt go for fear of becoming conspicuous they were moving out of the range of its electronics you came from the private sector soraya said what i dont understand is why youd give up that payday to become dci its such a thankless job why did you agree to be director of typhon hart asked it was a huge step up for me both in prestige and in pay but thats not really why you accepted it was it soraya shook her head no i felt a strong sense of obligation to martin lindros i was in at the beginning because im half arab martin sought out my input both in the creation of typhon and in its recruitment he meant typhon to be a very different intelligencegathering organization staffed with people who understood both the arab and the muslim mindset he feltand i wholeheartedly agreethat the only way to successfully combat the wide array of extremist terrorist cells was to understand what motivates them once you were in sync with their motivation you could begin to anticipate their actions hart nodded her long face in a neutral set as she sank deeper in thought my own motivations were similar to yours i grew sick of the cynical attitude of the private security firms all of them not just black river where i worked were focused on how much money they could milk out of the mess in the middle east in times of war the government is a mighty cash cow throwing newly minted money at every situation as if that alone will make a difference but the fact is everyone involved has a license to plunder and steal to their hearts content what happens in iraq stays in iraq no ones going prosecute them theyre indemnified against retribution for profiting from other peoples misery soraya took them into a clothes store where they made a pretense of checking out camisoles to cover the seriousness of the conversation i came to ci because i couldnt change black river but i felt i could make a difference here the president gave me a mandate to change an organization that was in disarray that long ago had lost its way they went out the back across the street hurrying now down the block turning left for a block then right for two blocks left again they went into a large restaurant boiling with people perfect the high level of ambient noise the multiple crosscurrents of conversations would make their own conversation undetectable at harts request they were seated at a table near the rear where they had excellent sight lines of the interior as well as the front door everyone who came in would be visually vetted by them well executed hart said when they were seated i see youve done this before there were timesespecially when i was working with jason bourne when i was obliged to lose a ci tail or two hart scanned the large menu do you think that was a ci van no hart looked at soraya over the menu neither do i they ordered brook trout caesar salads to start mineral water to drink they took turns checking out the people who came into the restaurant halfway through the salads soraya said weve intercepted some unconventional chatter in the last couple of days i dont think alarming would be a too strong a word hart put down her fork how so it seems possible that a new attack on american soil is in its final stages harts demeanor changed instantly she was clearly shaken what the hell are we doing here she said angrily why arent we in the office where i can mobilize the forces wait until you hear the whole story soraya said remember that the lines and frequencies typhon monitors are almost all overseas so unlike the chatter other intelligence agencies scan ours is more concentrated but from what ive seen its also far more accurate as you know theres always an enormous amount of disinformation in the regular chatter not so with the terrorists we keep an ear on of course were checking and rechecking the accuracy of this intel but until proven otherwise were going on the assumption that its real we have two problems however which is why mobilizing ci now isnt the wisest course three women came in chatting animatedly the manager greeted them like old friends showed them to a round table near the window where they settled in first we have an immediate time frame that is to say within a week ten days at the outside however we have almost nothing on the target except from the intercepts we know its large and complex so were thinking a building again because of our muslim expertise we believe it will be a structure of both economic and symbolic importance but no specific location east coast most probably new york nothings crossed my desk which means none of our sister agencies has a clue about this intel thats what im telling you soraya said this is ours alone typhons this is why we were created you havent yet told me why i shouldnt inform homeland security and mobilize ci because the source of this intel is entirely new do you seriously think hs or nsa would take our intel at its face value theyd need corroborationand a they wouldnt get it from their own sources and b their mucking about in the bush would jeopardize the inroads weve made youre right about that hart said theyre about as subtle as an elephant in manhattan soraya hunched forward the point is the group planning the attack is unknown to us that means we dont know their motivation their mindset their methodology two men came in one after the other they were dressed as civilians but their military bearing gave them away they were seated at separate tables on opposite sides of the restaurant nsa hart said soraya frowned why would nsa be shadowing us ill tell you in a minute lets continue with whats most immediately pressing you mean were dealing with a complete unknown an unaffiliated terrorist organization that is capable of planning a largescale attack that sounds farfetched imagine how itll sound to your directorate heads plus our operatives have determined that keeping our information secret is the only way to get more intel the moment this group catches wind of our mobilizing theyll postpone the operation for another time assuming the current time frame is correct could they abort or postpone at this late stage we couldnt thats for sure soraya gave her a sardonic smile but terrorist networks have no infrastructure or bureaucracy to slow them down so who knows part of the difficulty in locating them and taking them down is their infinite flexibility this superior methodology is what martin wanted for typhon thats my mandate the waiter took their halfeaten salads away a moment later their main courses arrived hart asked for another bottle of mineral water her mouth was dry now she had nsa on one side an offthegrid terrorist organization about to carry out an attack on a large east coast building on the other scylla and charybdis either one could wreck her career at ci before it even began she couldnt allow that to happen she wouldnt excuse me a moment she said getting up soraya scanned the restaurant but kept at least one of the agents in her peripheral vision she saw him tense when the dci went off to the ladies room he had risen and was making his way toward the rear when hart returned he reversed course sat back down when the dci had settled herself in her chair she looked soraya in the eye since you decided to deliver this intel here instead of the office i assume you have a specific idea as to how to proceed listen soraya said we have a redhot situation and we dont have enough intel to mobilize let alone act we have less than a week to find out everything on this terrorist organization based god only knows where with who knows how many members this isnt the time or place for the usual protocols theyre not going to avail us anything she glanced down at her fish as if it were the last thing she wanted to put in her mouth when her gaze rose again she said we need jason bourne to find this terrorist group well take care of the rest hart looked at her as if she were out of her mind out of the question given the urgency of the mission soraya said hes the only one who has a chance of finding them and stopping them i wouldnt last a day in the job once it got out that i was using jason bourne on the other hand soraya said if you dont follow through on this intel if this group executes their attack youll be out of ci before you can catch your breath hart sat back produced a short laugh you really are a piece of work you want me to authorize the use of a rogue agenta man whos unstable at best who many powerful people in this organization feel is dangerous to ci in particularfor a mission that could have dire consequences for this country for the continuation of ci as you and i know it a jolt of anxiety ran down sorayas spine wait a minute back that up what do you mean the continuation of ci as we know it hart glanced from one of the nsa agents to the other then she expelled a deep breath and told soraya everything that had happened from the moment shed been summoned into the oval office to meet with the president and had found herself confronting luther lavalle and general kendall after i managed to prevail with the president lavalle accosted me outside for a chat hart concluded he told me that if i didnt play nice with him hed come after me with everything he has he wants to take over ci soraya wants it as part of his everenlarging intelligence services domain but it isnt just lavalle were fighting its his boss the secretary of defense the plan is bud hallidays through and through black river had some dealings with him when i was there none of them pleasant if he succeeds in bringing ci into the pentagon fold you can be sure the military will come in ruin everything with their usual warlike mentality then theres even more reason to let me bring jason in for this sorayas voice had taken on added urgency hell get the job done where a company of agents cant believe me ive worked with him in the field twice whatevers said about him within ci is totally false sure lifers like rob batt hate his guts why wouldnt they bournes got a freedom they wish they had plus hes got abilities they never dreamed of soraya its been implied in several evaluations that you once had an affair with bourne please tell me the truthi need to know if youre being swayed by anything other than what you think will be best for the country and for ci soraya knew this was coming and was prepared i thought martin had laid that office scuttlebutt to rest theres absolutely no truth to it we became friends when i was chief of station in odessa that was a long time ago he doesnt remember when he came back last year to rescue martin he had no idea who i was last year you were in the field with him again we work well together thats all soraya said firmly hart was still clandestinely watching the nsa agents even if i thought what you were proposing would work hed never consent from everything ive read and heard since coming to ci he hates the organization true enough soraya said but once he understands the nature of the threat i think i can convince him to sign on one more time hart shook her head i dont know even talking to him is a damn huge gamble one im not sure im willing to take director if you dont seize this opportunity youll never be able to itll be too late still hart was unsure which direction to take the tried and true or the unorthodox no she thought not unorthodox insane i think this place has outlived its usefulness she said abruptly she signaled the waiter soraya i believe you have to powder your nose and while youre there please call the metro dc police use the pay phone its in working order i checked tell metro that there are two armed men at this restaurant then come right back to the table and be ready to move quickly soraya gave her a small conspiratorial smile then rose threading her way back to the ladies room the waiter approached the table frowning is there something wrong with the brook trout maam its fine hart said as the waiter gathered up the plates hart took out five twentydollar bills slipped them in his pocket you see that man over there the one with the wide face and football players shoulders yes maam how about you trip when you get to his table if i do that the waiter said im liable to dump these brook trouts in his lap precisely hart said with a winning smile but it could mean my job dont worry hart took out her id showed it to him ill square things with your boss the waiter nodded turned away soraya reappeared made her way to the table hart threw some bills onto their table but didnt stand up until the waiter bumped into a busboy he staggered the plates tipped as the nsa shadow leapt up hart rose together she and soraya walked to the door the nsa shadow was berating the waiter who was brushing him down with several napkins everyone was looking gesticulating a couple of people closest to the accident were shouting their versions of what happened amid the escalating chaos the second nsa shadow had gotten up to come to his compatriots aid but when he saw his target heading toward him he changed his mind hart and soraya had reached the door were stepping out into the street the second nsa shadow began to follow them but a pair of burly metro cops burst into the restaurant detaining him hey what about them he shouted at the two women two more patrol cars screeched to a halt cops raced out hart and soraya already had their ids out the cops checked them were late for a meeting hart said briskly and authoritatively national security the phrase was like open sesame the cops waved them on sweet soraya said impressed hart nodded her head in acknowledgment but her expression was grim winning such a small skirmish meant nothing to her save a bit of immediate gratification it was the war she had her gaze set on when they were several blocks away and had determined that they were clean of lavalles tags soraya said at least let me set up a meet with bourne so we can pick his brain i very much doubt this will work jason trusts me hell do the right thing soraya said with absolute conviction he always does hart considered for some time scylla and charybdis still loomed large in her thought process death by water or fire which was it to be but even now she didnt regret taking the directors position if there was anything she was up for at this stage in her life it was a challenge she couldnt imagine a bigger one than this as you no doubt know she said bourne wants to see the files on the conversations between lindros and moira trevor she paused in order to judge sorayas reaction to the woman bourne was now linked with i agreed there wasnt even a tremor in sorayas face im meeting him this evening at five she said slowly as if still chewing the idea over then all at once she nodded decisively join me well hear his take on your intel then eleven splendidly done specter said to bourne i cant tell you how impressed i am with how you handled the situations at the zoo and at the hospital mikhail tarkanian is dead bourne said i never meant that to happen nevertheless it did specters black eye wasnt quite as swollen but it was beginning to turn lurid colors once again im deeply in your debt my dear jason tarkanian was quite clearly the traitor if not for you he would have been the instigator of my torture and eventual death youll pardon me if i dont grieve for him the professor clapped bourne on the back as the two men walked down to the weeping willow on specters property out of the corner of his eye bourne could see several young men armed with assault rifles flanking them following the events of today bourne didnt begrudge the professor his armed guards in fact they made him feel better about leaving specters side under the nebula of delicate yellow branches the two men gazed out at the pond its surface as perfectly flat as if it were a sheet of steel a brace of skittish grackles lifted up from the willow cawing angrily their feathers gleamed in brief rainbow hues as they banked away from the swiftly lowering sun how well do you know moscow specter asked bourne had told him what tarkanian had said and theyd agreed that bourne should start there in his search for pyotrs killer well enough ive been there several times still and all ill have a friend lev baronov meet you at sheremetyevo whatever you require hell provide including weapons i work alone bourne said i dont want or need a partner specter nodded understandingly lev will be there for support only i promise he wont be a hindrance the professor paused a moment what worries me jason is your relationship with ms trevor turning so that he faced away from the house he spoke more softly i have no intention of prying into your personal life but if youre going overseas we both are shes off to munich this evening bourne said i appreciate your concern but shes as tough a woman as ive come across she can take care of herself specter nodded clearly relieved all right then theres just the matter of the information on icoupov he drew out a packet in here are your plane tickets to moscow along with the documentation youll need theres money waiting for you lev has the details as to which bank the account number attached to the safedeposit box and a false identity the account has been established in that name not in yours this took some planning i had it done last night in the hope that youd agree to go specter said all that remains is for us to take a picture of you for the passport and if id said no someone else had already volunteered specter smiled but i had faith jason and my faith was rewarded they turned back and were heading for the house when the professor paused one more thing he said the situation in moscow visаvis the grupperovkathe criminal familiesis at one of its periodic boiling points the kazanskaya and the azeri are vying for sole control of the drug trade the stakes are extraordinarily highin the billions of dollars so dont get in their way if there is any contact with you i beg you not to engage them instead turn the other cheek its the only way to survive there ill remember that bourne said just as one of specters men came hurrying out of the back of the house a woman moira trevor is here to see mr bourne he said in germaninflected turkish specter turned to bourne his eyebrows raised in either surprise or concern if not both i had no other choice bourne said i need to see her before she leaves and after what happened today i wasnt about to leave you until the last moment specters face cleared i appreciate that jason indeed i do his hand swept up and away go see your lady friend and then well make our last preparations im on my way to the airport moira said when bourne met her in the hallway the plane takes off in two hours she gave him all the pertinent information im on another flight he said i have some work to do for the professor a flicker of disappointment crossed her face before vanishing in a smile you have to do what you think is best for you bourne heard the slight distance in her voice as if a glass partition had come down between them im out of the university you were right about that another bit of good news moira i dont want my decision to cause any problems between us that could never happen jason i promise you she kissed him on the cheek i have some interviews lined up when i get to munich security people ive been able to contact through back channelstwo germans an israeli and a german muslim who may be the most promising of the lot as two of specters young men came through the door bourne took moira into one of the two sitting rooms a ships brass clock on the marble mantel chimed the change in watch quite a grand palace for the head of a university the professor comes from money bourne lied but hes private about it my lips are sealed moira said by the way wheres he sending you moscow some friends of his have gotten into a bit of trouble the russian mob something like that best that she believe the simplest explanation bourne thought he watched the play of lamplight reveal her expression he was certainly no stranger to duplicity but his heart constricted at the thought that moira might be playing him as she was suspected of playing martin several times today he had considered bypassing the meet with the new dci but he had to admit to himself that seeing the questioned communication between her and martin had become important to him once he saw the evidence hed know how to proceed with moira he owed it to martin to discover the truth about his relationship with her besides it was no use fooling himself he now had a personal stake in the situation his newly revealed feelings for her complicated matters for everyone not the least himself why was there was a price to pay for every pleasure he wondered bitterly but now he stood committed there was no turning back either from moscow or from discovering who moira really was moira moving closer to him put a hand on his arm jason what is it you look so troubled bourne tried not to look alarmed like marie she had the uncanny ability to sense what he was feeling though with everyone else he was adept at keeping his expression neutral the important thing now was not to lie to her shed pick that up in a heartbeat the mission is extremely delicate professor specter has already warned me that im jumping into the middle of a blood feud between two moscow grupperovka families her grip on him tightened briefly your loyalty to the professor is admirable and after all your loyalty is what martin admired most about you she checked her watch ive got to go she lifted her face to his her lips soft as melting butter and they kissed for what seemed a long time she laughed softly dear jason dont worry im not one of those people who ask about when ill see you again then she turned and walking into the foyer saw herself out a moment later bourne heard the cough of a car starting up the crunch of its tires as it performed a quarter circle back down the gravel drive to the road arkadin awoke grimy and stiff his shirt was still damp with sweat from his nightmare gray light sifted in through the skewed blinds on the window stretching his neck by rolling his head in a circle he thought what he needed most was a good long soak but the hotel had only a shower in the hallway bathroom he rolled over to find that he was alone in the room devra had gone sitting up he slid out of the damp rumpled bed scrubbed his rough face with the heels of his hands his shoulder throbbed it was swollen and hot he was reaching for the doorknob when the door opened devra stood on the threshold a paper bag in one hand did you miss me she said with a sardonic smile i can see it in your face you thought id skipped out she came inside kicked the door shut her eyes unblinking met his she put her free arm up her hand squeezed his left shoulder gently but firmly enough to cause him pain i brought us coffee and fresh rolls she said evenly dont manhandle me arkadin glared at her for a moment the pain meant nothing to him but her defiance did he was right there was much more to her than what she presented on the surface he let go and so did she i know who you are he said filya wasnt pyotrs courier you are that sardonic smile returned i was wondering how long it would take you to figure it out she crossed to the dresser lined up the paper cups of coffee set the rolls on the flattened bag she took out a small bag of ice and tossed it to him theyre still warm she bit into one chewed thoughtfully arkadin placed the ice on his left shoulder sighed inwardly at the relief he wolfed down his roll in three bites then he poured the scalding coffee down his throat next i suppose youre going to hold your palm over an open flame devra shook her head men why are you still here arkadin said you couldve just run off and go where i shot one of pyotrs own men you must have friends none i can trust which implied she trusted him he had an instinct she wasnt lying about this shed washed off the heavy mascara that had run and smudged last night oddly this made her eyes seem even larger and her cheeks held a blush now that shed scrubbed off what had to be white theatrical makeup ill take you to turkey she said a small town called eskisёehir thats where i sent the document given what he knew turkeythe ancient gateway between east and westmade perfect sense the bag of ice slipped off as arkadin grabbed the front of her shirt crossed to the window threw it wide open though the action cost him in pain to his shoulder he hardly cared the earlymorning sounds of the street rose up to him like the smell of baking bread he bent her backward so her head and torso were out the window what did i tell you about lying to me you might as well kill me now she said in her littlegirl voice i wont tolerate your abuse anymore arkadin pulled her back inside the room let go of her what are you going to do he said with a smirk jump out the window no sooner had the words come out of his mouth than she walked calmly to the window and sat on the sash staring at him all the time then she tipped herself backward through the open window arkadin grabbed her around the legs and hauled her up from the brink they stood glaring at each other breathing fast hearts pumping with excess adrenaline yesterday while we were on the ladder told me that you had nothing much to live for devra said that pretty much goes for me too so here we both are brothers under the skin with nothing but each other how do i know the next link in the network is turkey she drew her hair back from her face im tired of lying to you she said its like lying to myself whats the point talk is cheap he said then ill prove it to you when we get to turkey ill take you to the document arkadin trying not to think too much about what she said nodded his acknowledgment of their uneasy truce i wont lay a hand on you again except to kill you he thought twelve the freer gallery of art stood on the south side of the mall bounded on the west by the washington monument and on the east by the reflecting pool gateway to the immense capitol building it was situated on the corner of jefferson drive and th street sw near the western edge of the mall the building a florentine renaissance palazzo faced with stony creek granite imported from connecticut had been commissioned by charles freer to house his enormous collection of near east and east asian art the main entrance on the north side of the building where the meet was to take place consisted of three arches accented by doric pilasters surrounding a central loggia because its architecture looked inward many critics felt it was a rather forbidding facade especially when compared with the nearby exuberance of the national gallery of art nevertheless the freer was the preeminent museum of its kind in the country and soraya loved it not only for the depth of art it housed but also for the elegant lines of the palazzo itself she especially loved the contained open space at its entrance and the fact that even as now when the mall was agitated with hordes of tourists heading to and from the smithsonian metro rail stop on th street the freer itself was an oasis of calm and tranquility when things boiled over in the office during the day it was to the freer she came to decompress ten minutes with sung dynasty jades and lacquers acted like a soothing balm to her soul approaching the north side of the mall she searched past the crowds outside the entrance to the freer and thought she sawamong the sturdy men with their hard clipped midwestern accents the scampering children and their laughing mothers the vacanteyed teenagers plugged into their ipodsveronica harts long elegant figure walking past the entrance then doubling back she stepped off the curb but the blare of a horn from an oncoming car startled her back onto the sidewalk it was at that moment that her cell phone buzzed what exactly do you think youre doing bourne said in her ear jason why are you coming to this meet foolishly she looked around shed never be able to spot him and she knew it hart invited me i need to talk to you the dci and i both do about what soraya took a deep breath typhons listening posts have picked up a series of disturbing communications pointing to an imminent terrorist attack on an east coast city the trouble is thats all we have worse the communications are between two cadres of a group about which we have no intel whatsoever it was my idea to recruit you to find them and stop the attack not much to go on bourne said doesnt matter the groups name is the black legion in grad school i studied the link between a branch of muslim extremism and the third reich but this cant be the same black legion they were either killed or disbanded when nazi germany fell it can and it is bourne said i dont know how it managed to survive but it did three of their members tried to kidnap professor specter this morning i saw their device tattooed on the gunmans arm the three horses heads joined by the deaths head yes bourne described the incident in detail check the body at the morgue ill do that soraya said but how could the black legion remain so far underground all this time without being detected they have a powerful international front bourne said the eastern brotherhood that sounds farfetched soraya said the eastern brotherhood is in the forefront of islamicwestern relations nevertheless my source is unimpeachable god in heaven whatve you been doing while youve been away from ci i was never in ci bourne said brusquely and heres just one reason why you say you want to talk with me but i doubt you need half a dozen agents to do that soraya froze agents she was on the mall itself now and she had to restrain herself from looking around again there are no ci agents here how dyou know that hart wouldve told me why should she tell you anything we go way back you and i thats true enough she kept walking but something happened earlier today that makes me believe the agents youve spotted are nsa she described the way she and hart had been shadowed from ci hq to the restaurant she told him about secretary halliday and luther lavalle both of whom were gunning to make ci a part of the pentagon clandestine service that might make sense bourne said if there were only two of them but six no theres another agenda one neither of us knows about such as the agents are vectored perfectly triangulated on the entrance to the freer bourne said this means that they must have had foreknowledge of the meet it also means the six werent sent to shadow veronica hart if they arent here for her they must have been sent for me this is harts doing soraya felt a chill crawl down her spine what if the dci was lying to her what if she meant all along to lead bourne into a trap it would make sense for one of her first official acts as dci to be the capture of jason bourne it certainly would put her in solidly with rob batt and the others who despised and feared bourne and who resented her plus capturing jason would score her big points with the president and prevent secretary halliday from building on his already considerable influence still why would hart have allowed soraya to possibly muck up her first field op by coming along no she had to believe this was an nsa initiative i dont believe that she said emphatically lets say youre right the other possibility is just as dire if hart didnt set the trap then theres someone highly placed in ci who did i went to hart directly with the request yes she said using my cell thank you very much did you find it youre on a new one now it was in the gutter where you tossed it then stop complaining bourne said not unkindly i cant imagine hart told too many people about this meet but one of them is working against her and if thats the case chances are hes been recruited by lavalle if bourne was right but of course he was youre the grand prize jason if lavalle can take you down when no one in ci could hell be a hero taking over ci will be a cakewalk for him after that soraya felt perspiration break out at her hairline under the circumstances she continued i think you ought to withdraw i need to see the correspondence between martin and moira and if hart is instigating this trap then shell never give me access to the files at another time ill have to take my chances but not until youre certain hart has the material soraya who was almost at the entrance expelled a long breath jason i found the conversations i can tell you whats in them do you think you could quote them to me verbatim he said anyway its not that simple karim aljamil doctored hundreds of files before he left i know the method he used to alter them i have to see them myself i see theres no way i can talk you out of this right bourne said when youve made sure the material is genuine beep my cell once then i need you to move hart into the loggia away from the entrance proper why she said thatll only make it more difficult for you tojason but bourne had already disconnected from his vantage point on the roof of the forrestal building on independence avenue bourne tracked his highpowered nightvision glasses from soraya as she moved toward the dci past clots of tourists hurrying about to the agents in place around the west end of the mall two lounged chatting at the northeast corner of the department of agriculture north building another hands in the pockets of his trench coat was crossing diagonally southwest from madison drive toward the smithsonian a fourth was behind the wheel of an illegally parked car on constitution avenue in fact he was the one whod given the game away bourne had spotted the car illegally parked just before a metro police cruiser stopped parallel to it windows were rolled down a conversation ensued id was briefly flashed by the driver of the illegally parked car the cruiser rolled on the fifth and sixth agents were east of the freer one approximately midway between madison and jefferson drives the other in front of the arts industries building he knew there had to be at least one more it was almost five oclock a short winter twilight had descended aided by the twinkling lights wound festively around lampposts with the location of each agent memorized bourne returned to the ground using the window ledges for hands and feet the moment he showed himself the agents would start moving estimating the distance they were from where the dci and soraya stood he calculated hed have no more than two minutes with hart to get the files hidden in shadows waiting for sorayas signal he strained to pick out the remaining agents they couldnt afford to leave independence avenue unguarded if hart didnt in fact have the files then hed do as soraya first suggested and get out of the area without being spotted he imagined her at the entrance to the freer talking with the dci there would be the first nervous moment of acknowledgment then soraya would have to direct the conversation around to the files shed have to find a way for hart to show them to her to make sure they were authentic his phone beeped once and was still the files were authentic he accessed the internet navigating to the dc metro site checked the uptotheminute transit schedules checking his options this procedure took longer than he would have liked the very real and immediate danger was that one of the six agents was in contact with home baseeither ci or the pentagonwhose sophisticated electronic telemetry could pinpoint his phone and worse spy on what he was pulling up from the net couldnt be helped however access had to be made on site and at the immediate moment in case of unforeseen transit delays he put the worry out of his head concentrated on what hed have to do the next five minutes were crucial time to go moments after soraya secretly contacted bourne she said to veronica hart im afraid we may have a problem the dcis head whipped around shed been scanning the area for any sign of bournes presence the crowds around the freer had thickened as many made their way to the smithsonian metro station around the corner returning to their hotels to prepare for dinner what kind of problem i think i saw one of the nsa shadows we picked up at lunch hell i dont want lavalle knowing im meeting with bourne hell have a fit go running to the president she turned i think we ought to leave before bourne gets here what about my intel soraya said what chance are we going to have without him i say lets stay and talk to him showing him the material will go a long way toward winning his trust the dci was clearly on edge i dont like any of this time is of the essence soraya took her by the elbow lets move back here she said indicating the loggia well be out of the shadows line of sight hart reluctantly walked into the open space the loggia was especially crowded with people milling about discussing the art theyd just seen their plans for dinner and the next day the gallery closed at five thirty so the building was starting to clear out where the hell is he anyway hart said testily hell be here soraya assured her he wants the material of course he wants it the material concerns his friend clearing martins name is extremely important to him i was speaking of moira trevor the dci said before soraya could form a reply a group of people spewed out of the front doors bourne was in the middle of them soraya could see him but he was shielded from anyone across the street here he is she muttered as bourne came quickly and silently up behind them he must have somehow gotten into the independence avenue entrance at the south side of the building closed to the public made his way through the galleries to the front the dci turned impaling bourne with a penetrating gaze so you came after all i said i would he didnt blink didnt move at all soraya thought that he was at his most terrifying then the sheer force of his will at its peak you have something for me i said you could read it the dci held out a small manila envelope bourne took it i regret i havent the time to do that here he whirled snaking through the crowd vanishing inside the freer wait hart cried wait but it was too late and in any event three nsa agents came walking rapidly through the entrance their progress was slowed by the people exiting the gallery but they pushed many of them aside they trotted past the dci and soraya as if they didnt exist a third agent appeared took up position just inside the loggia he stared at them and smiled thinly bourne moved as quickly as he thought prudent through the interior having memorized it from the visitors brochure and come through it once already he did not waste a step but one thing worried him he hadnt seen any agents on his way in that meant more than likely hed have to deal with them on the way out near the rear entrance a guard was checking galleries just before closing time bourne was obliged to detour around a corner with an outcropping of a fire call box and extinguisher he could hear the guards soft voice as he herded a family toward the exit in front bourne was about to slip out when he heard other voices sharper clipped moving into shadow he saw a pair of slim whitehaired chinese scholars in pinstriped suits and shiny brogues arguing the merits of a tang porcelain vase their voices faded along with their footsteps as they headed toward jefferson drive without losing another instant bourne checked the bypass hed made on the alarm system so far it showed everything as normal he pushed out the door night wind struck his face as he saw two agents sidearms drawn hurrying up the granite stairs he had just enough time to register the oddness of the guns before he ducked back inside went directly to the fire call box they came through the door the leading one got a face full of firesmothering foam bourne ducked a wild shot from the second agent there was virtually no noise but something pinged off the tennessee white marble wall near his shoulder then clattered to the floor he hurled the fire extinguisher at the shooter it struck him on the temple and he went down bourne broke the call boxs glass pulled hard on the red metal handle instantly the fire alarm sounded piercing every corner of the gallery out the door bourne ran diagonally down the steps heading west directly for th street sw he expected to find more agents at the southwest corner of the building but as he turned off independence avenue onto th street he encountered a flood of people drawn to the building by the alarm already the sirens of fire trucks could be heard floating through the rising chatter of the crowd he hurried along the street toward the entrance down to the smithsonian metro stop as he did so he accessed the internet through his cell it took longer than he would have liked but at last he pressed the favorites icon was returned to the metro site navigating to the smithsonian station he scrolled down to the hyperlink to the next train arrival which was refreshed every thirty seconds three minutes to the orange line train to viennafairfax quickly he composed a text mail fb sent it to a number hed prearranged with professor specter the metro entrance clogged with people stopped on the stairs to watch the unfolding scenario was a mere fifty yards away bourne heard police sirens now saw a number of unmarked cars heading down th street toward jefferson they turned east when they got to the junctionall except one which headed due south bourne tried to run but he was hampered by the press of people he broke free into a small area blessedly empty of the gigantic jostle when the drivers window of a cruising car slid down a burly man with a grim face and a nearly bald head aimed another one of those strangelooking handguns at him bourne twisted putting one of the metro entrance posts between himself and the gunman he heard nothing no sound at alljust as he hadnt back inside the freerand something bit into his left calf he looked down saw the metal of a mini dart lying on the street it had grazed him but that was all with a controlled swing bourne went around the post down the stairs pushing his way through the gawkers into the metro he had just under two minutes to make the orange to vienna the next train didnt leave for four minutes after thattoo much time in the platform waiting for the nsa agents to find him he had to make the first train he bought his ticket went through the crowds thinned and thickened like waves rushing to shore he began to sweat his left foot slipped rebalancing himself he guessed that whatever was in that mini dart must be having an effect despite only grazing him looking up at the electronic signs he had to work to focus in order to find the correct platform he kept pushing forward not trusting himself to rest though part of him seemed hellbent on doing just that sit down close your eyes sink into sleep turning to a vending machine he fished in his pockets for change bought every chocolate bar he could then he entered the line for the escalator partway down he stumbled missed the riser crashed into the couple ahead of him hed blacked out for an instant gaining the platform he felt both shaky and sluggish the concretepaneled ceiling arched overhead deadening the sounds of the hundreds crowding the platform less than a minute to go he could feel the vibration of the oncoming train the wind it pushed ahead of it hed gobbled down one chocolate bar and was starting on the second when the train pulled into the station he stepped in allowing the surge of the crowd to take him just as the doors were closing a tall man with broad shoulders and a black trench coat sprinted into the other end of bournes car the doors closed and the train lurched forward thirteen as he saw the man in the black trench making his way toward him from the end of the train car bourne felt an unpleasant form of claustrophobia until they reached the next station he was trapped in this finite space moreover despite the initial chocolate hit he was starting to feel a lassitude creeping up from his left leg as the serum entered his bloodstream he tore off the wrapping on another chocolate bar wolfed it down the faster he could get the sugar and the caffeine into his system the better able his body would be to fight off the effects of the drug but that effect would only be temporary and then his blood sugar would plummet draining the adrenaline out of him the train reached federal triangle and the doors slid open a mass of people got off another mass got on black trench used the brief slackening of passengers to make headway toward where bourne stood hands clasped around a chromium pole the doors closed the train accelerated black trench was blocked by a huge man with tattoos on the backs of his hands he tried to push by but the tattooed man glared at him refusing to budge black trench could have used his federal id to move people out of the way but he didnt no doubt so as not to cause a panic but whether he was nsa or ci was still a mystery bourne struggling to stop his mind from going in and out of focus stared into the face of his newest adversary looking for clues to his affiliation black trenchs face was blocky bland but with the particular dry cruelty the military demanded in its clandestine agents he must be nsa bourne decided through the fog in his brain he knew he had to deal with black trench before the rendezvous point at foggy bottom two children swung into bourne as the train lurched around a bend he held them upright returning them to their place beside their mother who smiled her thanks at him put a protecting arm around their narrow shoulders the train rolled into metro center bourne saw a brief glare of temporary spotlights where a work crew was busy fixing an escalator on the other side of him a young blonde with earbuds leading to an mp player pressed her shoulder against his took out a cheap plastic compact checked the state of her makeup pursing her lips she slid the compact back in her bag dug out flavored lip gloss while she was applying it bourne lifted the compact palming it immediately he replaced it with a twentydollar bill the doors opened and bourne stepped out within a small whirlwind of people black trench caught between doors rushed down the car made it onto the platform just in time weaving his way through the hurrying throngs he followed bourne toward the elevator the majority of people headed for the stairs bourne checked the position of the temporary spotlights he made for them but not at too fast a pace he wanted black trench to make up some of the distance between them he had to assume that black trench was also armed with a dart gun if a dart struck bourne anywhere even in an extremity it would mean the end caffeine or no caffeine hed pass out and nsa would have him there was a wall of elderly and disabled people some of them in wheelchairs waiting for the elevator the door opened bourne sprinted ahead as if making for the elevator but the moment he reached the glare of the spotlights he turned and aimed the mirror inside the compact at an angle that reflected the dazzle into black trenchs face momentarily blinded black trench halted put up his hand palmoutward bourne was at him in a heartbeat he drove his hand into the main nerve bundle beneath black trenchs right ear wrested the dart gun out of his hand fired it into his side as the man listed to one side staggering bourne caught him dragged him to a wall several people turned their heads to gape but no one stopped the pace of the crowd hurrying by barely flickered before returning to full force bourne left black trench there eeled his way through the almost solid curtain of people back to the orange line four minutes later hed eaten through two more chocolate bars another orange to vienna rolled in and with a last glance thrown over his shoulder he got on his head didnt feel any deeper in the mist but he knew what he needed most now was water as much as he could get down his throat to flush the chemical out of his system as quickly as possible two stops later he exited at foggy bottom he waited at the rear of the platform until no more passengers got off then he followed them up taking the stairs two at a time in an attempt to further clear his head his first breath of cool evening air was a deep and exhilarating one except for a slight nausea perhaps caused by a continuing vertigo he felt better as he emerged from the metro exit a nearby engine coughed to life the headlights of a dark blue audi came on he walked briskly to the car opened the passengersside door slid in how did it go professor specter nosed the audi out into the heavy traffic i got more than i bargained for bourne said leaning his head against the seat rest and theres been a change of plan people are sure to be looking for me at the airport im going with moira at least as far as munich a look of deep concern crossed the professors face do you think thats wise bourne turned his head stared out the window at the passing city it doesnt matter his thoughts were of martin and of moira i passed wise some time ago book two fourteen its amazing moira said bourne looked up from the files hed snatched from veronica hart whats amazing you sitting here opposite me in this opulent corporate jet moira was wearing a sleek black suit of nubbly wool shoes with sensible heels a thin gold chain was around her neck werent you supposed to be on your way to moscow tonight bourne drank water from the bottle on his side tray table closed the file he needed more time to ascertain whether karim aljamil had doctored these conversations but he had his suspicions he knew martin was far too canny to tell her anything that was classifiedwhich covered just about everything that happened at ci i couldnt stay away from you he watched a small smile curl moiras wide lips then he dropped the bomb also the nsa is after me it was as if a light went out in her face say again the nsa luther lavalle has decided to make me a target he waved a hand to forestall her questions its political if he can bag me when the ci hierarchy cant hell prove to the powers that be that his thesis that ci should come under his jurisdiction makes sense especially after the turmoil ci has been in since martins death moira pursed her lips so martin was right he was the only one left who believed in you bourne almost added sorayas name then thought better of it it doesnt matter now it matters to me she said fiercely because you loved him we both loved him her head tilted to one side wait a minute are you saying theres something wrong in that we live on the outskirts of society in a world of secrets he deliberately included her for people like us theres always a price to pay for loving someone like what weve spoken about it bourne said love is a weakness your enemies can exploit and ive said thats a horrid way to live ones life bourne turned to stare out the perspex window at the darkness rushing by its the only one i know i dont believe that moira leaned forward until their knees touched surely you see youre more than that jason you loved your wife you love your children what kind of a father can i be to them im a memory and im a danger to them soon enough ill be a ghost you can do something about that and what kind of friend were you to martin the best kind the only kind that matters she tried to get him to turn back to her sometimes im convinced youre looking for answers to questions that have none what does that mean that no matter what youve done in the past no matter what youll do in the future youll never lose your humanity she watched his eyes engage hers slowly enigmatically thats the one thing that frightens you isnt it whats the matter with you devra asked arkadin behind the wheel of a rental car they had picked up in istanbul grunted irritably whatre you talking about how long is it going to take you to fuck me there being no flights from sevastopol to turkey theyd spent a long night in a cramped cabin of the heroes of sevastopol being transported southwest across the black sea from ukraine to turkey why would i want to do that arkadin said as he headed off a lumbering truck on the highway every man i meet wants to fuck me why should you be any different devra ran her hands through her hair her raised arms lifted her small breasts invitingly like i said whats the matter with you a smirk played at the corners of her mouth maybe youre not a real man is that it arkadin laughed youre so transparent he glanced at her briefly whats your game why are you trying to provoke me i like to extract reactions in my men how else will i get to know them im not your man he growled now devra laughed she wrapped slender fingers around his arm rubbing back and forth if your shoulders bothering you ill drive he saw the familiar symbol on the inside of her wrist all the more fearsome for being tattooed on the porcelain skin when did you get that does it matter not really what matters is why you got it faced with open highway he put on speed how else will i get to know you she scratched the tattoo as if it had moved beneath her skin pyotr made me get it he said it was part of the initiation he said he wouldnt go to bed with me until i got it and you wanted to go to bed with him not as much as i want to go to bed with you she turned away then stared out the side window as if she was suddenly embarrassed by her confession perhaps she actually was arkadin thought as he signaled moving right through two lanes as a sign for a rest stop appeared he turned off the highway parked at the far end of the rest stop away from the two vehicles that occupied parking slots he got out walked to the edge and with his back to her took a long satisfying pee the day was bright and warmer than it had been in sevastopol the breeze coming off the water was laden with moisture that lay on his skin like sweat on the way back to the car he rolled up his sleeves his coat was slung with hers across the cars backseat wed better enjoy this warmth while we can devra said once we get onto the anatolian plateau the mountains will block this temperate weather itll be colder than a witchs teat it was as if shed never made the intimate statement but shed caught his attention all right it seemed to him now that he understood something important about heror more accurately about himself it went through gala as well now that he thought of it he seemed to have a certain power over women he knew gala loved him with every fiber of her being and she wasnt the first one now this slim tomboyish dyevochka hardbitten downright nasty when she needed to be had fallen under his spell which meant he had the handle on her he was searching for how many times have you been to eskisёehir he asked enough to know what to expect he sat back where did you learn to answer questions without revealing a thing if im bad i learned it at my mothers breast arkadin looked away he seemed to have trouble breathing without a word he opened the door bolted outside stalking in small circles like a lion in the zoo i cannot be alone arkadin had said to semion icoupov and icoupov had taken him at his word at icoupovs villa where arkadin was installed his host provided a young man but when a week later arkadin had beaten his companion nearly into a coma icoupov switched tactics he spent hours with arkadin trying to determine the root of his outbursts of fury this failed utterly as arkadin seemed at a loss to remember let alone explain these frightening episodes i dont know what to do with you icoupov said i dont want to incarcerate you but i need to protect myself i would never harm you arkadin said not knowingly perhaps the older man said ruminatively the following week a stoopshouldered man with a formal goatee and colorless lips spent every afternoon with arkadin he sat in a plush upholstered chair one leg crossed over the other writing in a neat crabbed hand in a tablet notebook he protected as if it were his child for his part arkadin lay on his hosts favorite chaise longue a roll pillow behind his head he answered questions he spoke at length about many things but the things that shadowed his mind he kept tucked away in a black corner of the deepest depths of his mind never to be spoken of that door was closed forever at the end of three weeks the psychiatrist handed in his report to icoupov and vanished as quickly as he had appeared no matter arkadins nightmares continued to haunt him in the dead of night when upon awakening with a gasp and a start he was convinced he heard rats scuttling red eyes burning in the darkness at those moments the fact that icoupovs villa was completely verminfree was of no solace to him the rats lived inside him squirming shrieking feeding the next person icoupov employed to burrow into arkadins past in an attempt to cure him of his fits of rage was a woman whose sensuality and lush figure he felt would keep her safe from arkadins outbursts of fury marlene was adept at handling men of all kinds and kinks she possessed an uncanny ability to sense the specific thing a man desired from her and provide it at first arkadin didnt trust marlene why should he he couldnt trust the psychiatrist wasnt she just another form of analyst sent to coax out the secrets of his past marlene of course noted this aversion in him and set about countering it the way she saw it arkadin was living under a spell selfinduced or otherwise it was up to her to concoct an antidote this wont be a short process she told icoupov at the end of her first week with arkadin and he believed her arkadin observed marlene walking on little cat feet he suspected she was smart enough to know that even the slightest misstep on her part might strike him as a seismic shift and then all the progress shed made in gaining his trust would evaporate like alcohol over a flame she seemed to him wary acutely aware that at any moment he could turn on her she acted as if she were in a cage with a bear day by day you could track the training of it but that didnt mean it wouldnt unexpectedly rip your face off arkadin had to laugh at that the care with which she was treating every aspect of him but gradually something else began to creep into his consciousness he suspected that she was coming to feel something genuine for him devra watched arkadin through the windshield then she kicked open her door went after him she shaded her eyes against a white sun plastered to a high pale sky what is it she said when shed caught up to him what did i say arkadin turned a murderous look her way he appeared to be in a towering rage just barely holding himself together devra found herself wondering what would happen if he let himself go but she also didnt want to be in his way when it happened she felt an urge to touch him to speak soothingly until he returned to a calmer state of mind but she sensed that would only inflame him further so she went back to the car to wait patiently for him to return eventually he did sitting sideways on the seat his shoes on the ground as if he might bolt again im not going to fuck you he said but that doesnt mean i dont want to she felt he wanted to say something else but couldnt that whatever it was was too bound up in what had happened to him a long time ago it was a joke she said softly i was making a stupid joke there was a time when i wouldve thought nothing of it he said as if talking to himself sex is unimportant she sensed that he was speaking about something else something only he knew and she glimpsed just how alone he was she suspected that even in a crowd even with friendsif he had anyhed feel alone it seemed to her that hed walled himself off from sexual melding because it would underscore the depth of his apartness he seemed to her to be a moonless planet with no sun to revolve around just emptiness everywhere as far as he could see in that moment she realized that she loved him how long has he been in there luther lavalle asked six days general kendall replied he was in his shirtsleeves which were turned up that precaution hadnt been enough to protect them from spatters of blood but i guarantee that to him it feels like six months hes as disoriented as its possible for a human being to be lavalle grunted peering at the bearded arab through the oneway mirror the man looked like a raw piece of meat lavalle didnt know or care whether he was sunni or shia they were the same to himterrorists bent on destroying his way of life he took these matters very personally whats he given up enough that we know the copies of the typhon intercepts batt has given us are disinformation still lavalle said it comes straight from typhon this mans very highly placed theres no question whatsoever of his identity and he knows of no plans moving into their final stages to hit a major new york building that in itself could be disinformation lavalle said these bastards are masters of that kind of shit right kendall wiped his hands on a towel hed thrown over his shoulder like a chef at the stove they love nothing better than to see us running around in circles chasing our tails which is what well be doing if we put out an alert lavalle nodded as if to himself i want our best people to follow up on it confirm the typhon intercepts well do our best but i feel it my duty to report that the prisoner laughed in my face when i asked him about this terrorist group lavalle snapped his fingers several times what are they called again the black lesion the black legion something like that nothing in our database about this group no or at any of our sister agencies either kendall threw the soiled towel into a basket whose contents were incinerated every twelve hours it doesnt exist i tend to agree lavalle said but id like to be certain he turned from the window and the two men went out of the viewing room they walked down a rough concrete corridor painted an institutional green the buzzing fluorescent tubes that hurled purple shadows on the linoleum floor as they passed he waited patiently outside the locker room for kendall to change his clothes then they proceeded down the corridor at the end of it they climbed a flight of stairs to a reinforced metal door lavalle pressed his forefinger onto a fingerprint reader he was rewarded by the clicking of bolts being shot not unlike a bank vault opening they found themselves in another corridor the polar opposite of the one they were leaving this one was paneled in polished mahogany wall sconces produced a soft buttery glow between paintings of historical naval engagements phalanxes of roman legions prussian hussars and english light cavalry the first door on the left brought them into a room straight out of a hightoned mens club replete with huntergreen walls cream moldings leather furniture antique breakfronts and a wooden bar from an old english pub the sofas and chairs were well spaced the better to allow occupants to speak of private matters flames cracked and sparked comfortingly in a large fireplace a liveried butler met them before theyd taken three steps on the thick sounddeadening carpet he guided them to their accustomed spot in a discreet corner where two highbacked leather chairs were arranged on either side of a mahogany pedestal card table they were near a tall mullioned window flanked by thick drapes which overlooked the virginia countryside this clublike room known as the library was in an enormous stone house that the nsa had taken over decades ago it was used as a retreat as well as for formal dinners for the generals and directors of the organization its lower depths however were used for other purposes when they had ordered drinks and light refreshments and were alone again lavalle said do we have a line on bourne yet yes and no kendall crossed one leg over the other arranging the crease in his trousers as per our previous briefing he came onto the grid at six thirtyseven last night passing through immigration at dulles he was booked on a lufthansa flight to moscow had he showed we couldve put mcnally onto the flight bournes far too clever for that lavalle grumbled he knows were after him now the element of surprise has been neutralized dammit we managed to discover that he boarded a nextgen energy solutions corporate jet like a hunting dog on alert lavalles head came up really explain an executive by the name of moira trevor was on it what is she to bourne a question were trying to answer kendall said unhappily he hated disappointing his boss in the meantime we obtained a copy of the flight plan the destination was munich shall i activate a point man there dont waste your time lavalle waved a hand my moneys on moscow thats where he meant to go thats where hes going ill get right on it kendall opened his cell phone i want anthony prowess hes in afghanistan then pull him the fuck out lavalle said shortly get him on a military chopper i want him on the ground in moscow by the time bourne gets there kendall nodded punched in a special encrypted number and typed the coded text message to prowess lavalle smiled at the approaching waiter thank you willard he said as the man snapped out a starched white tablecloth arranged the glasses of whiskey small plates of nibbles and cutlery on the table then departed as silently as hed come lavalle stared at the food it seems weve backed the wrong horse general kendall knew he meant rob batt soraya moore witnessed the debacle shes put two and two together in short order batt told us he knew about harts meet with bourne because he was in her office when bournes call came in other than the moore woman who else is she likely to have told no one thatll lead hart right back to the deputy director hang him out to dry picking up his glass kendall said time for plan b lavalle stared into the chestnut liquid i always thank god for plan b richard always their glasses clinked together they drank in studied silence while lavalle ruminated when half an hour later theyd drained their whiskeys and new ones were in their hands lavalle said on the subject of soraya moore i do believe its time to bring her in for a chat private oh yes lavalle added a dollop of water his whiskey releasing its complex scent bring her here fifteen tell me about jason bourne harun iliev in an american nike jogging suit identical to the one worn by his commander semion icoupov rounded the turn of the natural iceskating rink in the heart of grindelwald village harun had spent more than a decade as icoupovs second in command as a boy hed been adopted by icoupovs father farid after his parents had drowned when a ferry taking them from istanbul to odessa had capsized harun at the age of four was visiting his grandmother there the news of the deaths of her daughter and soninlaw sent her into cardiac arrest she died almost instantlywhich everyone involved felt was a blessing for she lacked both the strength and the stamina to care for a fouryearold farid icoupov stepped in because haruns father had worked for him the two were close theres no easy answer harun said now principally because theres no one answer some swear hes an agent of the american ci others claim hes an international assassin for hire clearly he cant be both what is indisputable is that he was responsible for foiling the plot to gas the attendees of the international antiterrorist conference in reykjavik three years ago and last year the very real nuclear threat to washington dc posed by dujja the terrorist group that was run by the two wahhib brothers fadi and karim aljamil rumor has it bourne killed them both impressive if true but just the fact that no one can get a handle on him is of extreme interest icoupovs arms chugged up and down in perfect rhythm to his gliding back and forth his cheeks were apple red and he smiled warmly at the children skating on either side of them laughing when they laughed giving encouragement when one of them fell and how did such a man get involved with our friend through the university in georgetown harun said he was a slender man with the look of an accountant which wasnt helped by his sallow skin and the way his olivepit eyes were sunk deep in his skull iceskating did not come naturally to him as it did to icoupov besides killing people it seems bourne is something of a genius at linguistics is he now even though theyd skated for more than forty minutes icoupov wasnt breathing hard harun knew he was just getting warmed up they were in spectacular country the resort of grindelwald was just under a hundred miles southeast of bern above them towered three of switzerlands most famous mountainsjungfrau mцnch and eigerglittering white with snow and ice it seems that bournes weak spot is for a mentor the first was a man named alexander conklin who i knew alex icoupov said curtly it was before your time another lifetime it often seems he nodded please continue it seems our friend has made a play to become his new mentor i must interject here that seems improbable then why did bourne kill mikhail tarkanian mischa icoupovs pace faltered for a moment allah preserve us does leonid danilovich know arkadin is currently out of contact whats his progress hes come and gone from sevastopol thats something anyway icoupov shook his head were running out of time arkadin knows this i want tarkanians death kept from him harun mischa was his best friend they were closer than brothers under no circumstances can he be allowed to be distracted from his present assignment a lovely young woman held out her hand as she skated abreast of them icoupov took it and for a time was swept away in an ice dance that made him feel as if he were twenty again when he returned he resumed their skate around the rink something about the easy gliding motion of skating hed once told harun helped him to think given what youve told me icoupov said at length this jason bourne may very well cause an unforeseen complication you can be sure our friend has recruited bourne to his cause by telling him that you caused the death of icoupov shot him a warning look i agree but the question we must answer is how much of the truth hes risked telling bourne knowing our friend harun said i would say very little if at all yes icoupov tapped a gloved forefinger against his lips and if this is the case we can use the truth against him dont you think if we can get to bourne harun said and if we can get him to believe us oh hell believe us ill make sure of that icoupov executed a perfect spin your new assignment harun is to ensure we get to him before he can do any more damage we could ill afford to lose our eye in our friends camp further deaths are unacceptable munich was full of cold rain it was a gray city on the best of days but in this windswept downpour it seemed to hunker down like a turtle it pulled in its head into its concrete shell turning its back on all visitors bourne and moira sat inside the cavernous nextgen bourne was on his cell making a reservation on the next flight to moscow i wish i could authorize the plane to take you moira said after hed folded away the phone no you dont bourne said youd like me to stay here by your side i already told you why i think that would be a bad idea she looked out at the wet tarmac rainbowstreaked with droplets of fuel and oil raindrops trickled down the perspex window like racing cars in their lanes and i find myself not wanting to be here at all bourne opened the file hed taken from veronica hart turned it around held it out id like you to take a look at this moira turned back put the file on her lap paged through it all at once she looked up was it ci that had me under surveillance when bourne nodded she said well thats a relief how is it a relief she lifted the file this is all disinformation a setup two years ago when bidding for the long beach lng terminal was at its height my bosses suspected that allen our chief rival was monitoring our communications in order to get a handle on the proprietary systems that make our terminal unique as a favor to me martin went to the old man for permission to set up a sting the old man agreed but it was imperative that no one else know about it so he never told anyone else at ci it worked by tracking our cell conversations we discovered that allen was indeed monitoring the calls i recall the settlement bourne said because of the evidence martin and i provided allen had no incentive to go to trial nextgen got a mideightfigure settlement right moira nodded and won the rights to build the lng terminal in long beach thats how i got my promotion to executive vice president bourne took back the file he too was relieved for him trust was like an illmade boat springing leaks at every turn threatening at any moment to sink him hed ceded part of himself to moira but the loss of control was like a knife in his heart moira looked at him rather sadly did you suspect me of being a mata hari it was important to make sure he said her face closed up sure i understand she began to stuff papers into a slim leather briefcase more roughly than was needed you thought id betrayed martin and was going to betray you im relieved its not true im so very happy to hear that she shot him an acid stare moira what she pulled hair off her face what is it you want to say to me jason i this is hard for me she leaned forward peering at him just tell me i trusted marie bourne said i leaned on her she helped me with my amnesia she was always there and then suddenly she wasnt moiras voice softened i know he looked at her at last there is no good thing about being alone but for me its all a matter of trust i know you think i havent told you the truth about martin and me she took his hands in hers we were never lovers jason we were more like brother and sister we supported each other trust didnt come easily to either of us i think its important for both of us that i tell you that now bourne understood that she was also talking about the two of them not her and martin hed trusted so few people in his life marie alex conklin mo panov martin soraya he saw all the things that had been keeping him from moving on with his life with so little past it was difficult letting go of the people hed known and cared about a pang of sorrow shot through him marie is dead shes in the past now and my children are far better off with their grandparents their life is stable and happy thats best for them he rose needing to get moving moira aware he was ill at ease changed the subject do you know how long youll be in moscow the same amount of time youll be in munich i imagine that got a smile out of her she stood leaned toward him be well jason stay safe she gave him a lingering loving kiss remember me sixteen soraya moore was ushered cordially into the hushed sanctuary of the library where less than twentyfour hours before luther lavalle and general kendall had had their postrendition fireside chat it was kendall himself who had picked her up chauffeured her to the nsa safe house deep in the virginia countryside soraya had of course never been here lavalle in a midnightblue chalkstriped suit blue shirt with white collar and cuffs a striped tie in the yale colors looked like a merchant banker he rose as kendall brought her over to the area by the window there were three chairs grouped around the antique card table director moore having heard so much about you its a genuine pleasure to meet you smiling broadly lavalle indicated a chair please soraya saw no point in refusing the invitation she didnt know whether she was more curious or alarmed by the abrupt summons she did however glance around the room where is secretary halliday general kendall informed me that the invitation came from him oh it did lavalle said unfortunately the secretary of defense was called into a meeting in the oval office he phoned me to convey to you his apologies and to insist that we carry on without him all of which meant soraya knew that halliday had never had any intention of attending this little tкteаtкte she doubted he even knew about it anyway lavalle said as kendall sat in the third chair now that youre here you might as well enjoy yourself he raised his hand and willard appeared as if by prestidigitation something to drink director i know as muslim youre forbidden alcohol but we have a full range of potions for you to choose from tea please she said directly to willard ceylon if you have it of course maam milk sugar neither thank you shed never formed the british habit willard seemed to bow before he vanished without a sound soraya redirected her attention to the two men now gentlemen in what way can i help you i rather think its the other way around general kendall said soraya cocked her head how dyou figure that frankly because of the turmoil at ci lavalle said we think typhon is working with one hand tied behind its back willard arrived with sorayas tea the mens whiskeys he set the japanned tray down with the cup glasses and tea service then left lavalle waited until soraya had poured her tea before he continued it seems to me that typhon would benefit immensely from taking advantage of all the resources at nsas disposal we could even help you expand beyond the scope of cis reach soraya lifted her cup to her lips found the fragrant ceylon tea exquisitely delicious it seems that you know more about typhon than any of us at ci were aware lavalle let go with a soft laugh okay lets stop beating around the bush we had a mole inside ci you know who it is now he made a fatal mistake in going after jason bourne and failing veronica hart had relieved rob batt of his position that morning a fact that must have come to lavalles attention especially since his replacement peter marks had been one of harts most vocal supporters from day one soraya knew peter well had suggested to hart that he deserved the promotion is batt now working for nsa mr batt has outlived his usefulness kendall said rather stiffly soraya turned her attention to the military man a glimpse of your own fate dont you think general kendalls face closed up like a fist but following an almost imperceptible shake of lavalles head he bit back a rejoinder while its certainly true that life in the intelligence services can be harsh even brutal lavalle interjected certain individuals within it areshall we sayinoculated against such unfortunate eventualities soraya kept her gaze on kendall i suppose i could be one of those certain individuals yes absolutely lavalle put one hand over the other on his knee your knowledge of muslim thought and custom your expertise as martin lindross right hand as he put typhon together are invaluable you see how it is general soraya said one day an invaluable asset like me is bound to take over your position lavalle cleared his throat does that mean youre on board smiling sweetly soraya put her teacup down ill say this for you mr lavalle you certainly know how to make lemonade from lemons lavalle returned her smile as if it were a tennis serve my dear director i do believe youve hit upon one of my specialities what makes you think id abandon ci lavalle put a forefinger beside his nose my reading of you is that youre a pragmatic woman you know better than we do what kind of a mess ci is in how long do you think its going to take the new dci to right the ship what makes you think she even can he raised his finger im exceedingly interested in your opinion but before you answer think about how little time we might have before this unknown terrorist group is going to strike soraya felt as if shed been rabbitpunched how in the hell had nsa gotten wind of the typhon terrorist intercepts at the moment however that was a moot point the important thing was how to respond to this breach of security before she could formulate a counter lavalle said im curious about one thing though why is it that director hart saw fit to keep this intel to herself rather than bringing in homeland security fbi and nsa that was my doing im in it now soraya thought i might as well go all the way until the incident at the freer the intel was sketchy enough that i felt the involvement of other intelligence agencies would only muddy the waters meaning kendall said glad of the opportunity to get in a dig you didnt want us rooting around in your carrot patch this is a serious situation director lavalle said in matters of national security if this muslim terrorist groupwhich we now know calls itself the black legiongets wind that weve intercepted their communications well be sunk before we even start trying to counter their attack i could have you shitcanned and lose my invaluable expertise soraya shook her head i dont think so so what do we have kendall snapped stalemate lavalle passed a hand across his brow do you think it would be possible for me to see the typhon intercepts his tone had changed completely he was now in conciliatory mode believe it or not were not the evil empire we actually might be able to be of some assistance soraya considered i think that be can arranged excellent it would have to be eyes only lavalle agreed at once and in a controlled highly restricted environment soraya added following up her advantage the typhon offices at ci would be perfect lavalle spread his hands why not here soraya smiled i think not under the current climate i think you can understand why id be reluctant to meet you there i take your point soraya thought for a moment if i did bring the intercepts here id have to have someone with me lavalle nodded vigorously of course whatever makes you feel comfortable he seemed far more pleased than kendall who looked at her as if he had caught sight of her from a battlefield trench frankly soraya said none of this makes me feel comfortable she glanced around the room again the building is swept three times a day for electronic bugs lavalle pointed out plus we have all the most sophisticated surveillance systems basically a computerized monitoring system that keeps track of the two thousand closedcircuit video cameras installed throughout the facility and grounds compares them from second to second for any anomalies whatsoever the darpa software compares any anomalies against a database of more than a million images makes realtime decisions in nanoseconds for instance a bird in flight would be ignored a running figure wouldnt believe me you have nothing to worry about right now the only thing i worry about soraya said is you mr lavalle i understand completely lavalle finished off his whiskey thats what this exercise is all about director to engender trust between us how else could we be expected to work together general kendall sent soraya back to the district with one of his drivers she had him drop her where shed arranged to meet kendall outside what had once been the national historical wax museum on e street sw she waited until the black ford had been swallowed up in traffic then she turned away walked all the way around the block at a normal pace by the end of her circuit she was certain she was free of tags nsa or otherwise at that point she sent a threeletter text message via her cell two minutes later a young man on a motorcycle appeared he wore jeans a black leather jacket a gleaming black helmet with the smoked faceplate lowered he slowed stopped just long enough for her to climb on behind him handing her a helmet he waited for her to don it then he zoomed off down the street i have several contacts within darpa deron said darpa was an acronym for the defense advanced research projects agency an arm of the department of defense i have a working knowledge of the software architecture at the heart of the nsas surveillance system he shrugged this is one way i keep my edge we gotta find a way around it or through it tyrone said he was still wearing his black leather jacket his black helmet was on a table alongside the one hed given soraya for the highspeed trip here to derons houselab soraya had met both deron and tyrone when bourne had brought her to this nondescript olivecolored house just off th street ne you must be joking right deron a tall slim handsome man with skin the color of light cocoa looked from one to the other tell me youre joking if we were joking we wouldnt be here soraya rubbed the heel of her hand against her temple as she sought to ignore the fierce headache that had began after her terrifying interview with lavalle and kendall its just not possible deron put his hands on his hips that software is stateoftheart and two thousand cctv cameras fuck me they sat on canvas chairs in his lab a doubleheight room filled with all manner of monitors keyboards electronic systems whose functions were known only to deron ranged around the wall were a number of paintingsall masterpieces by titian seurat rembrandt van gogh water lilies green reflection left part was sorayas favorite that all of them were painted by deron in the atelier in the next room had stunned her the first time she was here now they simply filled her with wonder how he had reproduced monets exact shade of cobalt blue was beyond her it was hardly surprising that bourne used deron to forge all his id documents when in this day and age it was becoming increasingly difficult to do many forgers had quit claiming governments had made their job impossible but not deron it was his stock in trade little wonder that he and bourne were so close birds of a feather soraya thought what about mirrors tyrone said that would be simplest deron said but one of the reasons theyve installed so many cameras is to give the system multiple views of the same area that negates mirrors right there too bad bourne killed dat fucker karim aljamil he could probably write a worm tscrew with the darpa software like he did with the ci database soraya turned to deron can it be done she said could you do it hackings not my thing i leave that to my old lady soraya didnt know deron had a girlfriend how good is she please deron snorted can we talk to her deron looked dubious this is the nsa were talking about those fuckers dont fool around to be frank i dont think you ought to be messing with them in the first place unfortunately i have no choice soraya said they fuckin wid us tyrone said and unless we get all medieval on they ass they gonna walk all over us an own us forever deron shook his head you sure put some interesting notions in this mans head soraya before you came along he was the best street protection i ever had now look at him messing with the big boys in the bad world outside the ghetto he didnt hide the pride he felt for tyrone but his voice held a warning too i hope to hell you know what youre getting yourself into tyrone if this thing comes apart in any way youre in the federal slammer till gabriel comes calling tyrone crossed his arms over his chest stood his ground deron sighed all right then were all adults here he reached for his cell kikis upstairs in her lair she doesnt like to be interrupted but in this case i think shell be intrigued he spoke briefly into the cell then put it down moments later a slim woman with a beautiful african face and deep chocolate skin appeared she was as tall as deron with the upright carriage of proud and ancient royalty her face split into a ferocious grin when she saw tyrone hey they said to each other that one word seemed all that was needed kiki this is soraya deron said kikis smile was wide and dazzling my names actually esiankiki im masai but in america im not so formal everyone calls me kiki the two women touched hands kikis grip was cool and dry she regarded soraya out of large coffeecolored eyes she had the smoothest skin soraya had ever seen which she instantly envied her hair was very short marvelously cut like a cap to fit her elongated skull she wore a brown anklelength dress that clung provocatively to her slim hips and small breasts deron briefly outlined the problem while he brought up the darpa software architecture on one of his computer terminals while kiki checked it out he filled her in on the basics we need something that can bypass the firewall and is undetectable the first isnt all that difficult kikis long delicate fingers were flying over the keyboard as she experimented with the computer code the second i dont know unfortunately thats not the end of it deron positioned himself so he could peer over her shoulder at the terminal this particular software controls two thousand cctv cameras our friends here need to get in and out of the facility without being detected kiki stood up turned around to face them in other words all two thousand cameras have to be covered thats right soraya said you dont need a hacker dear you need the invisible man but you can make them invisible kiki deron slid his arm around her slender waist cant you hmm kiki peered again at the code on the terminal you know there looks like there may be a recurring variance i might be able to exploit she hunkered down on a stool im going to transfer this upstairs deron winked at soraya as if to say i told you so kiki routed a number of files to her computer which was separate from derons she spun around slapped her hands on her thighs and got up okay then ill see you all later how much later soraya said but kiki was already taking the stairs three at a time moscow was wreathed in snow when bourne stepped off the aeroflot plane at sheremetyevo his flight had been delayed forty minutes the jet circling while the runways were deiced he cleared customs and immigration and was met by a small catlike individual wrapped in a white down coat lev baronov professor specters contact no luggage i see baronov said in heavily accented english he was as wiry and hyperactive as a jack russell terrier as he elbowed and barked at the small army of gypsy cab drivers vying for a fare they were a sadfaced lot plucked from the minorities in the caucasus asians and the like whose ethnicity prevented them from getting a decent job with decent pay in moscow well take care of that on the way in to town youll need proper clothes for moscows winter its a balmy minus two celsius today that would be most helpful bourne replied in perfect russian baronovs bushy eyebrows rose in surprise you speak like a native gospadin bourne i had excellent instructors bourne said laconically amid the bustle of the flight terminal he was studying the flow of passengers noting those who lingered at a newsagent or outside the dutyfree shop those who didnt move at all ever since he emerged into the terminal hed had the unshakable feeling that he was being watched of course there were cctv cameras all over but the particular prickling of his scalp that had developed over the years of fieldwork was unerring someone had him under surveillance this fact was both alarming and reassuringthat hed already picked up a tag meant someone knew he was scheduled to arrive in moscow nsa could have scanned the departing flight manifests back at new york and picked up his name from lufthansa thered been no time to take himself off the list he looked only in short touristic glances because he had no desire to alert his shadow that he was on to him im being followed bourne said as he sat in baronovs wheezing zil they were on the m motorway no problem baronov said as if he was used to being tailed all the time he didnt even ask who was following bourne bourne thought of the professors pledge that baronov wouldnt get in his way bourne paged through the packet baronov had given him which included new id a key and the box number to get money out of the safedeposit vault in the moskva bank i need a plan of the bank building bourne said no problem baronov exited the m bourne was now fyodor ilianovich popov a midlevel functionary of gazprom the gargantuan staterun energy conglomerate how well will this id hold up bourne asked not to worry baronov grinned the professor has friends in gazprom who know how to protect you fyodor ilianovich popov anthony prowess had come a long way to keep the ancient zil in sight and he wasnt about to lose it no matter what evasive maneuvers the driver took hed been waiting at sheremetyevo for bourne to come through immigration general kendall had sent a recent surveillance photo of bourne to his cell the photo was grainy and twodimensional because of the long telephoto lens used but it was a closeup there was no mistaking bourne when he arrived for prowess the next few minutes were crucial he had no illusions that he could remain unnoticed by bourne for any length of time therefore in the short moments while his subject was still unselfconscious he needed to drink in every tic and habit no matter how minuscule or seemingly irrelevant he knew from bitter experience that these small insights would prove invaluable as the surveillance ground on especially when it came time to engage the subject and terminate him prowess was no stranger to moscow hed been born here to a british diplomat and his cultural attachй wife not until prowess was fifteen did he understand that his mothers job was a cover she was in fact a spy for mi her majestys secret service four years later prowesss mother was compromised and mi spirited them out of the country because his mother was now a wanted woman the prowesses were sent to america to begin a new life with a new family name the danger had been ground so deeply into prowess that hed actually forgotten what they were once called he was now simply anthony prowess as soon as hed built up qualified academic credits he applied to the nsa from the moment hed discovered that his mother was a spy that was all hed wanted to do no amount of pleading from his parents could dissuade him because of his ease with foreign languages and his knowledge of other cultures the nsa sent him abroad first to the horn of africa to train then to afghanistan where he liaised with the local tribes fighting the taliban in rough mountain terrain he was a hard man no stranger to hardship or to death he knew more ways to kill a human being than there were days in the year compared with what hed been through in the past nineteen months this assignment was going to be a piece of cake seventeen bourne and baronov sped down volokolamskoye highway crocus city was an enormous highend mall built in it was a seemingly endless array of glittering boutiques restaurants car showrooms and marble fountains it was also an excellent place to lose a tail while bourne shopped for suitable clothes baronov was busy on his cell phone there was no point in going to the trouble of losing the tail inside the maze of the mall only to have him pick them up again when they returned to the zil baronov was calling a colleague to come to crocus city theyd take his car and hed drive the zil into moscow bourne paid for his purchases and changed into them baronov took him to the franck muller cafй inside the mall where they had coffee and sandwiches tell me about pyotrs last girlfriend bourne said gala nematova baronov shrugged not much to tell really shes just another one of those pretty girls one sees around all the latest moscow nightclubs these women are a ruble a dozen where would i find her baronov shrugged shell go where the oligarchs cluster really your guess is as good as mine he laughed goodnaturedly for myself im too old for places like that but ill be glad to take you on a roundrobin tonight all i need is for you to lend me a car suit yourself miya droog a few moments later baronov went to the mens room where hed agreed to make the switch of car keys with his friend when he returned he handed bourne a folded piece of paper on which was the plan for the moskva bank building they went out a different direction from the way theyd come in which led them to a parking lot on the other side of the mall they got into a vintage black volga fourdoor sedan that to bournes relief started up immediately you see no problem baronov laughed jovially what would you do without me gospadin bourne the frunzenskaya embankment was located southwest of moscows inner garden ring mikhail tarkanian had said that he could see the pedestrian bridge to gorky park from his living room window he hadnt lied his apartment was in a building not far from khlastekov a restaurant serving excellent russian food according to baronov with its twostory squarecolumned portico and decorative concrete balconies the building itself was a prime example of the stalinist empire style that raped and beat into submission a more pastoral and romantic architectural past bourne instructed baronov to stay in the volga until he returned he went up the stone steps under the colonnade and through the glass door he was in a small vestibule that ended in an inner door which was locked on the right wall was a brass panel with rows of bell pushes corresponding to the apartments bourne ran his finger down the rows until he found the push with tarkanians name noting the apartment number he crossed to the inner door and used a small flexible blade to fool the locks tumblers into thinking he had a key the door clicked open and he went inside there was a small arthritic elevator on the left wall to the right a rather grand staircase swept up to the first floor the first three treads were in marble but these gave way to simple concrete steps that released a kind of talcumlike powder as the porous treads wore away tarkanians apartment was on the third floor down a dark corridor dank with the odors of boiled cabbage and stewed meat the floor was composed of tiny hexagonal tiles chipped and worn as the steps leading up bourne found the door without trouble he put his ear against it listening for sounds within the apartment when he heard none he picked the lock turning the glass knob slowly he pushed open the door a crack weak light filtered in past halfdrawn curtains framing windows on the right behind the smell of disuse was a whiff of a masculine scentcologne or hair cream tarkanian had made it clear he hadnt been back here in years so who was using his apartment bourne moved silently cautiously through the rooms where hed expected to find dust there was none where he expected the furniture to be covered in sheets it wasnt there was food in the refrigerator though the bread on the counter was growing mold still within the week someone had been living here the knobs to all the doors were glass just like the one on the front door and some looked wobbly on their brass shafts there were photos on the wall hightoned blackandwhites of gorky park in different seasons tarkanians bed was unmade the covers lay pulled back in unruly waves as if someone had been startled out of sleep or had made a hasty exit on the other side of the bed the door to the bathroom was half closed as bourne stepped around the end of the bed he noticed a fivebyseven framed photo of a young woman blond with a veneer of beauty cultivated by models the world over he was wondering whether this was gala nematova when he caught a blurred movement out of the corner of his eye a man hidden behind the bathroom door made a run at bourne he was armed with a thickbladed fishermans knife which he jabbed at bourne pointfirst bourne rolled away the man followed he was blueeyed blond and big there were tattoos on the sides of his neck and the palms of his hands mementos of a russian prison the best way to neutralize a knife was to close with your opponent as the man lunged after him bourne turned grabbed the man by his shirt slammed his forehead into the bridge of the mans nose blood spurted the man grunted cursed in guttural russian blyad he drove a fist into bournes side tried to free his hand with the knife bourne applied a nerve block at the base of the thumb the russian butted bourne in the sternum drove him back off the bed into the halfopen bathroom door the glass knob drilled into bournes spine causing him to arch back the door swung fully open and he sprawled on the cold tiles the russian regaining use of his hand pulled out a stechkin aps mm bourne kicked him in the shin so he went down on one knee then struck him on the side of the face and the stechkin went flying across the tiles the russian launched a flurry of punches and hand strikes that battered bourne back against the door before grabbing the stechkin bourne reached up felt the cool octagon of the glass doorknob grinning the russian aimed the pistol at bournes heart wrenching off the knob bourne threw it at the center of the russians forehead where it struck fullon his eyes rolled up and he slumped to the floor bourne gathered up the stechkin and took a moment to catch his breath then he crawled over to the russian of course he had no conventional id on him but that didnt mean bourne couldnt find out where hed come from stripping off the big mans jacket and shirt bourne took a long look at a constellation of tattoos on his chest was a tiger a sign of an enforcer on his left shoulder was a dagger dripping blood a sign that he was a killer but it was the third symbol a genie emerging from a middle eastern lamp that interested bourne the most this was a sign that the russian had been put in prison for drugrelated crimes the professor had told bourne that two of the russian mafia families the kazanskaya and the azeri were vying for sole control of the drug market dont get in their way specter had warned if they have any contact with you i beg you not to engage them instead turn the other cheek its the only way to survive there bourne was about to get up when he saw something on the inside of the russians left elbow a small tattoo of a figure with a mans body and a jackals head anubis egyptian god of the underworld this symbol was supposed to protect the wearer from death but it had also latterly been appropriated by the kazanskaya what was a member of such a powerful russian grupperovka family doing in tarkanians apartment hed been sent to find him and kill him why that was something bourne needed to find out he looked around the bathroom at the sink with its dripping faucet pots of eye cream and powder makeup pencils the stained mirror he pulled back the shower curtain plucked several blond hairs from the drain they were long from a womans head gala nematovas head he made his way to the kitchen opened drawers pawed through them until he found a blue ballpoint pen back in the bathroom he took one of the eyeliner pencils crouching down beside the russian he drew a facsimile of the anubis tattoo on the inside of his left elbow when he got a line wrong he rubbed it off when he was satisfied he used the blue ballpoint pen to make the final tattoo he knew it wouldnt withstand a close inspection but for a flash of identification he thought it would suffice at the sink he delicately rinsed off the makeup pencil then shot some hair spray over the ink outline to further fix it on his skin he checked behind the toilet tank and in it favorite hiding places for money documents or important materials but found nothing he was about to leave when his eyes fell again on the mirror peering more closely he could see a trace of red here and there lipstick which had been carefully wiped off as if someonepossibly the kazanskaya russianhad sought to erase it why would he do that it seemed to bourne the smears formed a kind of pattern taking up a pot of face powder he blew across the top of it the petroleumbased powder sought its twin clung to the ghost image of the petroleumbased lipstick when he was done he put the pot down took a step backward he was looking at a scrawled note off to the kitaysky lyotchik where r u gala so gala nematova pyotrs last girlfriend did live here had pyotr used this apartment while tarkanian was away on his way out he checked the russians pulse it was slow but steady the question of why the kazanskaya sent this prisonhardened assassin to an apartment where gala nematova had once lived with pyotr loomed large in his mind was there a connection between semion icoupov and the grupperovka family taking another long look at gala nematovas photo bourne slipped out of the apartment as silently as hed entered it out in the hallway he listened for human sounds but apart from the muted wailing of a baby in an apartment on the second floor all was still he descended the stairs and went through the vestibule where a little girl holding her mothers hand was trying to drag her upstairs bourne and the mother exchanged the meaningless smiles of strangers passing each other then bourne was outside emerging from under the colonnade save for an old woman gingerly picking her way through the treacherous snow no one was about he slipped into the passengers seat of the volga and shut the door behind him that was when he saw the blood leaking from baronovs throat at the same instant a wire whipped around his neck digging into his windpipe four times a week after work rodney feir chief of field support for ci worked out at a health club a short walk from his house in fairfax virginia he spent an hour on the treadmill another hour weight training then took a cold shower and headed for the steam room this evening general kendall was waiting for him kendall dimly saw the glass door open cold air briefly sucked in as tendrils of steam escaped into the mens locker room then feirs trim athletic body appeared through the mist good to see you rodney general kendall said feir nodded silently sat down beside kendall rodney feir was plan b the backup the general had put in place in the event the plan involving rob batt blew up in fact feir had been easier to land than batt feir was someone whod drifted into security work not for any patriotic reason not because he liked the clandestine life he was simply lazy not that he didnt do his job not that he didnt do it damn well it was just that government life suited him down to his black wingtip shoes the key fact to remember about him was that whatever feir did he did because it would benefit him he was in fact an opportunist he more than any of the others at ci could see the writing on the wall which is why his conversion to the nsa cause had been so easy and seamless with the death of the old man the end of days had arrived he had none of batts loyalty to contend with still it didnt do to take anyone for granted which is why kendall met him here occasionally they would take a steam then shower climb into their civvies and go to dinner at one of several grungy barbecue joints kendall knew in the southeast section of the district these places were no more than shacks they were mainly the pit out back where the pitmaster lovingly smoked his cuts of meatribs brisket burnt ends sweet and hot sausages sometimes a whole hogfor hours on end the old scarred wooden picnic tables topped with four or five sauces of varying ingredients and heat were a kind of afterthought most folk had their meat wrapped up to take out not kendall and feir they sat at a table eating and drinking beer while the bones piled up along with the waddedup napkins and the slices of white bread so soft they disintegrated under a few drops of sauce now and again feir stopped eating to impart to kendall some bit of fact or scuttlebutt currently going around the ci offices kendall noted these with his steeltrap military mind occasionally asking questions to help feir clarify or amplify a point especially when it came to the movements of veronica hart and soraya moore afterward they drove to an old abandoned library for the main event the renaissancestyle building had been bought at fire sale prices by drew davis a local businessman familiar in se but otherwise unknown within the district which was precisely how he liked it he was one of those people savvy enough to fly under the metro police radar not so simple a matter in se because like almost everyone else who lived there he was black unlike most of those around him he had friends in high places this was mainly due to the place he ran the glass slipper to all intents and purposes it was a legit music club and an extremely successful one to boot attracting many bigname r ampb acts but in the back was the real business a highend cathouse that specialized in women of color to those in the know any flavor of color which in this case meant ethnicity could be procured at the glass slipper rates were steep but nobody seemed to mind partly because drew davis paid his girls well kendall had frequented this cathouse since his senior year in college hed come with a bunch of wellconnected buddies one night as a hoot didnt want to but theyd dared him and he knew how much hed be ridiculed if he failed to take them up on it ironically he stayed over the years having developed a taste for as he put it walking on the wild side at first he told himself that the attraction was purely physical then he realized he liked being there no one bothered him no one made fun of him later his continued interest was a reaction to his role as outsider when it came to working with the power junkies like luther lavalle christ even the fallen ron batt had been a member of skull amp bones at yale well the glass slipper is my skull amp bones kendall thought as he was ushered into the back room this was as clandestine as outrй as things got inside the beltway it was kendalls own little hideaway a life that was his alone not even luther knew about the glass slipper it felt good to have a secret from lavalle kendall and feir sat in purple velvet chairsthe color of royalty as kendall pointed outand were treated to a soft parade of women of all sizes and colors kendall chose imani one of his favorites feir a duskyskinned eurasian woman who was part indian they retired to spacious rooms furnished like bedrooms in european villas with fourposter beds tons of chintz velvet swags drapes there kendall watched as in one astonishing shimmy imani slid out of her chocolate silk spaghettistrap dress she wore nothing underneath the lamplight burnished her dark skin then she opened her arms and with a deepfelt groan general richard p kendall melted into the sinuous river of her flawless body the moment bourne felt his air supply cut off he levered himself up off the front bench seat arching his back so that he could put first one foot then the other on the dashboard using his legs he launched himself diagonally into the backseat so that he landed right behind the illfated baronov the strangler was forced to turn to his right in order to keep the wire around bournes throat this was an awkward position for him he now lacked the leverage he had when bourne was directly in front of him bourne planted the heel of his shoe in the stranglers groin and ground down as hard as he could but his strength was depleted from the lack of oxygen die fucker the strangler said in a hardedged midwestern accent white lights danced in his vision and a blackness was seeping up all around him it was as if he were looking down a tunnel through the wrong end of a telescope nothing looked real his sense of perspective was skewed he could see the man his dark hair his cruel face the unmistakable hundredmile stare of the american soldier in combat in the back of his mind he knew the nsa had found him bournes lapse of concentration allowed the strangler to free himself jerk the ends of the wire so that it dug deeper into bournes throat bournes windpipe was totally cut off blood was running down into his collar as the wire bit through his skin strange animal noises bubbled up from deep inside him he blinked away tears and sweat used his last ounce of strength to jam his thumb into the agents eye keeping up the pressure despite blows to his midsection gained him a temporary respite the wire slackened he gasped in a railing breath and dug deeper with his thumb the wire slackened further he heard the car door open the stranglers face wrenched away from him and the car door slammed shut he heard running feet dying away by the time he managed to unwind the wire to cough and gasp air into his burning lungs the street was empty the nsa agent was gone bourne was alone in the volga with the corpse of lev baronov dizzy weak and sick at heart eighteen i cant simply contact haydar devra said after what happened in sevastopol theyll know youll be going after him that being the case arkadin said the document is long gone not necessarily devra stirred her turkish coffee thick as tar they chose this backwater because its so inaccessible but that works both ways chances are haydar hasnt yet been able to pass the document along they were sitting in a tiny dustblown cafй in eskisёehir even for turkey this was a backward place filled with sheep the smells of pine dung and urine and not much else a chill wind blew across the mountain pass there was snow on the north side of the buildings that made up the village and judging by the lowering clouds more was on its way godforsaken is too good a word for this hellhole arkadin said for shits sake there isnt even a cell phone signal thats funny coming from you devra downed her coffee you were born in a shithole werent you arkadin felt an almost uncontrollable urge to drag her around the back of the rickety structure and beat her but he held his hand and his rage husbanding them both for another day when he would gaze down at her as if from a hundred miles away whisper into her ear i have no regard for you to me your life is without meaning if you have any hope of staying alive even a little longer youll never again ask where i was born who my parents were anything of a personal nature whatsoever as it turned out among her other talents marlene was an accomplished hypnotist she told him she wanted to hypnotize him in order to get at the root of his rage ive heard there are people who cant be hypnotized arkadin said is that right yes marlene said it turned out he was one of them you simply will not take suggestion she said your mind has put up a wall its impossible to penetrate they were sitting in the garden behind semion icoupovs villa owing to the steep lay of the land it was the size of a postage stamp they sat on a stone bench beneath the shade afforded by a fig tree whose dark soontobeluscious fruit was just beginning to curl the branches downward to the stony earth well arkadin said what are we to do the question is what are you going to do leonid she brushed a fragment of leaf off her thigh she was wearing american designer jeans an opennecked shirt sandals on her feet the process of examining your past is designed to help you regain control over yourself you mean my homicidal tendencies he said why would you choose to say it that way leonid he looked deeply into her eyes because its the truth marlenes eyes grew dark then why are you so reluctant to talk to me about the things i feel will help you you just want to worm your way inside my head you think if you know everything about me you can control me youre wrong this isnt about control leonid arkadin laughed what is it about then what its always beenits about helping you control yourself a light wind tugged at her hair and she smoothed it back into place he noticed such things and attached to them psychological meaning marlene liked everything just so i was a sad little boy then i was an angry little boy then i ran away from home there does that satisfy you marlene tilted her head to catch a bit of sunlight that appeared through the tossed leaves of the fig tree how is it you went from being sad to being angry i grew up arkadin said you were still a child only in a manner of speaking he studied her for a moment her hands were crossed on her lap she lifted one of them touched his cheek with her fingertips traced the line of his jaw until she reached his chin she turned his face a bit farther toward her then she leaned forward her lips when they touched his were soft they opened like a flower the touch of her tongue was like an explosion in his mouth arkadin damping down the dark eddy of his emotion smiled winningly doesnt matter im never going back i second that emotion devra nodded then rose lets see if we can get proper lodgings i dont know about you but i need a shower then well see about contacting haydar without anyone knowing as she began to turn away he caught her by the elbow just a minute her expression was quizzical as she waited for him to continue if youre not my enemy if you havent been lying to me if you want to stay with me then youll demonstrate your fidelity i said yes i would do what you asked of me that might entail killing the people who are surely guarding haydar she didnt even blink give me the fucking gun veronica hart lived in an apartment complex in langley virginia like so many other complexes in this part of the world it served as temporary housing for the thousands of federal government workers including spooks of all stripes who were often on assignment overseas or in other parts of the country hart had lived in this particular apartment for just over two years not that it mattered since coming to the district seven years ago shed had nothing but temporary lodgings by this point she doubted shed be comfortable settling down and nesting at least those were her thoughts as she buzzed soraya moore into the lobby a moment later a discreet knock sounded and she let the other woman in im clean soraya said as she shrugged off her coat i made sure of that hart hung her coat in the foyer closet led her into the kitchen for breakfast i have cold cereal orshe opened the refrigeratorcold chinese food last nights leftovers im not one for conventional breakfasts soraya said good neither am i hart grabbed an array of cardboard cartons told soraya where to find plates serving spoons and chopsticks they moved into the living room set everything on a glass coffee table between facing sofas hart began opening the cartons no pork right soraya smiled pleased that her boss remembered her muslim strictures thank you hart returned to the kitchen put up water for tea i have earl grey or oolong oolong for me please hart finished brewing the tea brought the pot and two small handleless cups back to the living room the two women settled themselves on opposite sides of the table sitting crosslegged on the abstract patterned rug soraya looked around there were some basic prints on the wall the kind youd expect to find at any midlevel hotel chain the furniture looked rented as anonymous as anything else there were no photos no sense of harts background or family the only unusual feature was an upright piano my only real possession hart said following sorayas gaze its a steinway k better known as a chippendale hamburg its got a sounding board larger than many grand pianos so it lets out with a helluva sound you play hart went over sat down on the stool began to play frйdйric chopins nocturne in bflat minor without missing a beat she segued into isaac albйnizs sensuous malagueсa and finally into a raucous transposition of jimi hendrixs purple haze soraya laughed and applauded as hart rose came back to sit opposite her my absolute only talent besides intelligence work hart opened one of the cartons spooned out general tsos chicken careful she said as she handed it over i order it extra hot thats okay by me soraya said digging deep into the carton i always wanted to play the piano actually i wanted to play electric guitar hart licked oyster sauce off her finger as she passed over another carton my father wouldnt hear of it according to him electric guitar wasnt a ladys instrument strict was he soraya said sympathetically you bet he was a fullbird colonel in the air force hed been a fighter pilot back in his salad days he resented being too old to fly missed that damn oilysmelling cockpit something fierce who could he complain to in the force so he took his frustration out on me and my mother soraya nodded my father is oldschool muslim very strict very rigid like many of his generation hes bewildered by the modern world and that makes him angry i felt trapped at home when i left he said hed never forgive me did he soraya had a faraway look in her eyes i see my mom once a month we go shopping together i speak to my father once in a while hes never invited me back home ive never gone hart put down her chopsticks im sorry dont be it is what it is do you still see your father i do but he doesnt know who i am my mothers gone now which is a blessing i dont think she couldve tolerated seeing him like that it must be hard for you soraya said the indomitable fighter pilot reduced like that theres a point in life where you have to let go of your parents hart resumed eating though more slowly whoevers lying in that bed isnt my father he died a long time ago soraya looked down at her food for a moment then she said tell me how you knew about the nsa safe house ah that harts face brightened clearly she was happy to be on a work topic during my time at black river we were often hired by nsa this was before they trained and deployed their own homegrown blackops details we were good for them because they never had to specify to anyone what wed been hired to do it was all fieldwork priming the battlefield for our troops no one on capitol hill was going to look farther than that she dabbed her mouth sat back anyway after one particular mission i caught the short straw i was the one from my squad who brought the findings back to the nsa because it was a blackops mission the debriefing took place at the safe house in virginia not in the fine library you were taken to but in one of the basementlevel cubicleswindowless featureless just gritty reinforced concrete its like a war bunker down there and what did you see it wasnt what i saw hart said it was what i heard the cubicles are soundproof except for the doors i assume so the guards in the corridors know whats going on what i heard was ghastly the sounds were barely human did you tell your bosses at black river what was the point they didnt care and even if they did what were they going to do start a congressional investigation on the basis of sounds i heard the nsa would have cut them off at the knees put them out of business in a heartbeat she shook her head no these boys are businessmen pure and simple their ideology revolves around milking as much money from the government as possible so now we have a chance to do what you couldnt before what black river wouldnt do thats right hart said i want to get photos videos absolute proof of what nsa is doing down there so i can present the evidence myself to the president thats where you and tyrone come in she shoved her plate away i want luther lavalles head on a platter and by god im going to get it nineteen because of the corpse and all the blood on the seats bourne was forced to abandon the volga before he did though he took baronovs cell phone as well as his money it was freezing within the preternatural afternoon winter darkness came the snow swirling down in everheavier curtains bourne knew he had to get out of the area as quickly as possible he took the sim card out of his phone put it in baronovs then threw his own cell phone down a storm drain in his new identity as fyodor ilianovich popov he couldnt afford to be in possession of a cell with an american carrier he walked leaning into the wind and snow after six blocks huddled in a doorway he used baronovs cell phone to call his friend boris karpov the voice at the end of the line grew cold colonel karpov is no longer with fsb bourne felt a chill go through him russia had not changed so much that lightningswift dismissals on trumpedup charges were a thing of the past i need to contact him bourne said hes now at the federal antinarcotics agency the voice recited a local number before abruptly hanging up that explained the attitude bourne thought the federal antinarcotics agency was headed up by viktor cherkesov but many believed he was much more than that a silovik running an organization so powerful that some had taken to calling it fsb recently an internal war between cherkesov and nikolai patrushev the head of the fsb the modernday successor to the notorious kgb had sprung up within the government the silovik who won that war would probably be the next president of russia if karpov had gone from the fsb to fsb it must be because cherkesov had gotten the upper hand bourne called the office of the federal antinarcotics agency but he was told that karpov was away and could not be reached for a moment he contemplated calling the man who had picked up baronovs zil in the crocus city parking lot but he almost immediately thought better of it hed already gotten baronov killed he didnt want any more deaths on his conscience he walked on until he came to a tram stop he took the first one that appeared out of the gloom hed used the scarf hed bought at the boutique in crocus city to cover up the mark the wire had made across his throat the small seepage of blood had dried up as soon as hed hit the frigid air the tram jounced and rattled along its rails crammed inside with a stinking noisy crowd he felt thoroughly shaken not only had he discovered a kazanskaya assassin waiting in tarkanians apartment but his contact had been murdered by an nsa assassin sent to kill him his sense of apartness had never been more extreme babies cried men rustled newspapers women chatted side by side an old man bigknuckled hands curled over the head of his walking stick clandestinely ogled a young girl engrossed in a manga comic here was life bustling all around him a burbling stream that parted when it came to him an immovable rock only to come together when it passed him flowing on while he remained behind still and alone he thought of marie as he always did at times like this but marie was gone and her memory was of little solace to him he missed his children and wondered whether this was the david webb personality bubbling up an old familiar despair swept through him as it hadnt since alex conklin had taken him out of the gutter formed the bourne identity for him to slip on like a suit of armor he felt the crushing weight of life on him a life lived alone a sad and lonely life that could only end one way and then his thoughts turned to moira of how impossibly difficult that last meeting with her had been if she had been a spy if she had betrayed martin and meant to do the same with him what would he have done would he have turned her over to soraya or veronica hart but she wasnt a spy he would never have to face that conundrum when it came to moira his personal feelings were now bound up in his professional duty inextricably combined he knew that she loved him and now in the face of his despair he understood that he loved her as well when he was with her he felt whole but in an entirely new way she wasnt marie and he didnt want her to be marie she was moira and it was moira he wanted by the time he swung off the tram in moscow center the snow had abated to veils of drifting flakes whirled about by stray gusts of wind across the huge open plazas the citys lights were on against the long winter evening but the clearing sky turned the temperature bitter the streets were clogged with gypsy cabbies in their cheap cars manufactured during the brezhnev years trundling slowly in bumpertobumper lines so as to not miss a fare they were known in local slang as bombilythose who bombbecause of the bowelloosening speed with which they bombed around the citys streets as soon as they had a passenger he went into a cybercafй paid for fifteen minutes at a computer terminal typed in kitaysky lyotchik kitaysky lyotchik zhaoda the full nameor the chinese pilot in its english translationturned out to be a throbbing elitny club at proyezd lubyansky the kitaigorod metro stop let bourne out at the end of the block on one side was a canal frozen solid on the other a row of mixeduse buildings the chinese pilot was easy enough to spot what with the bmws mercedeses and porsche suvs as well as the ubiquitous gaggle of bombily zhigs clustered on the street the crowd behind a velvet rope was being held in check by fiercelooking facecontrol bullies so that waiting partygoers spilled drunkenly off the pavement bourne went up to the red cayenne rapped on the window when the driver scrolled the window down bourne held out three hundred dollars when i come out that door this is my car right the driver eyed the money hungrily right you are sir in moscow especially american dollars talked louder than words and if your client comes out in the meantime he wont the driver assured bourne hes in the champagne room till four at the earliest another hundred dollars got bourne past the shouting unruly mob inside he ate an indifferent meal of an oriental salad and almondcrusted chicken breast from his perch along the glowing bar he watched the russian siloviki come and go with their diamondstudded miniskirted furwrapped dyevochkasstrictly speaking young women who had not yet borne a child this was the new order in russia except bourne knew that many of the same people were still in powereither exkgb siloviki or their progeny lined up against the boys from sokolniki who came from nothing into sudden wealth the siloviki derived from the russian word for power were men from the socalled power ministries including the security services and the military who had risen during the putin era they were the new guard having overthrown the yeltsinperiod oligarchs no matter siloviki or mobster they were criminals theyd killed extorted maimed blackmailed they all had blood on their hands they were all strangers to remorse bourne scanned the tables for gala nematova was surprised to find half a dozen dyevs who might have fit the bill especially in this low light it was astonishing to observe firsthand this wheat field of tall willowy young women one more striking than the next there was a prevalent theory a kind of skewed darwinismsurvival of the prettiestthat explained why there were so many startlingly handsome dyevochkas in russia and ukraine if you were a man in his twenties in these countries in it meant that youd survived one of the greatest male bloodbaths in human history these men being in the vast minority had their pick of women who had they chosen to marry and impregnate the answer was obvious hence the acres of dyevs partying here and in every other nightclub in russia out on the dance floor a crush of gyrating bodies made identification of individuals impossible spotting a redheaded dyev on her own bourne walked over to her gestured if she wanted to dance the earsplitting house music pumped out of a dozen massive speakers made small talk impossible she nodded took his hand and they shoved elbowed and squeezed their way into a cramped space on the dance floor the next twenty minutes could have substituted for a vigorous workout the dancing was nonstop as were the colored flashing lights and the chestvibrating drumming of the highoctane music spewed out by a local band called tequilajazz over the top of the redhead bourne caught a glimpse of yet another blond dyev only this one was different grabbing the redheads hand bourne eeled deeper into the gyrating pack of dancers perfume cologne and sour sweat mixed with the raw tang of hot metal and blazing monster amplifiers still dancing bourne maneuvered around until he was certain the blonde dyev dancing with the broadshouldered mobster was indeed gala nematova itll never be the same dr mitten said what the hell does that mean anthony prowess sitting in an uncomfortable chair in the nsa safe house just outside moscow barked at the ophthalmologist bent over him mr prowess i dont think youre in the best shape to hear a full diagnosis why not wait until the shock a im not in shock prowess lied and b i dont have time to wait that was true enough having lost bournes trail he needed to get back on it asap dr mitten sighed hed been expecting just such a response in fact he wouldve been surprised at anything else still he had a professional responsibility to his patient even if he was on retainer to the nsa what it means he said is that youll never see out of that eye again at least not in any way thatll be useful to you prowess sat with his head back his damaged eye numbed with drops so the damn ophthalmologist could poke around details please dr mitten was a tall thin man with narrow shoulders a wisp of a combover and a neck with a prominent adams apple that bobbed comically when he spoke or swallowed i believe youll be able to discern movement differentiate light from dark thats it on the other hand dr mitten said when the swelling goes down you may be completely blind in that eye fine now i know the worst just fix me the hell up so i can get out of here i dont recommend i dont give a shit what you recommend prowess snapped do as i tell you or ill wring your scrawny little chicken neck dr mitten puffed out his checks in indignation but he knew better than to talk back to an agent they seemed born with hairtrigger responses to everything which their training further honed as the ophthalmologist worked on his eye prowess seethed inside not only had he failed to terminate bourne hed allowed bourne to permanently maim him he was furious at himself for turning tail and running even though he knew that when a victim gains the upper hand you have to exit the field as quickly as possible still prowess would never forgive himself it wasnt that the pain had been excruciatinghe had an extremely high pain threshold it wasnt even that bourne had turned the tables on himhed redress that situation shortly it was his eye ever since he was a child he had a morbid fear of being blind his father had been blinded in an accidental fall getting off a transit bus when the impact had detached both his retinas this was in the days before ophthalmologists could staple retinas back in place at six years old the horror of watching his father deteriorate from an optimistic robust man into a bitter withdrawn nub had imprinted itself forever in his mind that horror had kicked in the moment jason bourne had dug his thumb deep into his eye as he sat in the chair brooding amid the chemical smells emitted by dr mittens ministrations prowess was filled with determination he promised himself hed find jason bourne and when he did bourne would pay for the damage hed inflicted hed pay dearly before prowess killed him professor specter was chairing a chancellors meeting at the university when his private cell phone vibrated he immediately called a fifteenminute break left the room strode down the hall and outside onto the campus when he was clear he opened his cell and heard nemetsovs voice buzzing in his ear nemetsov was the man baronov had called to switch cars with at crocus city baronovs dead specter said how he listened while nemetsov described the attack in the car outside tarkanians apartment building an nsa assassin nemetsov concluded he was waiting for bourne to garrote him as he did baronov and jason survived but the assassin escaped as well specter felt a wave of relief wash over him find that nsa man before he finds jason and kill him is that clear perfectly but shouldnt we also try to make contact with bourne specter considered a moment no hes at his best when working alone he knows moscow speaks russian fluently and he has our fake ids hell do what must be done youve put your faith in this one man you dont know him nemetsov otherwise you wouldnt make such a stupid statement i only wish jason could be with us permanently when sweaty and entangled gala nematova and her boy toy left the dance floor so did bourne he watched as the couple made their way to a table where they were greeted by two other men they all began to guzzle champagne as if it were water bourne waited until theyd refilled their flutes then swaggered over in the style of these newstyle gangsters leaning over galas companion he shouted in her ear i have an urgent message for you hey her companion shouted back with no little belligerence who the fuckre you wrong question glaring at him bourne pushed up the sleeve of his jacket just long enough to give him a glimpse of his fake anubis tattoo the man bit his lip and sat back down as bourne reached over pulled gala nematova away from the table were going outside to talk are you crazy she tried to squirm away from his grip its freezing out there bourne continued to steer her by her elbow well talk in my limo well thats something gala nematova bared her teeth clearly unhappy her teeth were very white as if scrubbed to within an inch of their lives her eyes were a remote chestnut large with uptilted corners that revealed the asian blood in her ancestry a frigid wind swept off the canal blocked only partially by the gridlock of expensive cars and bombily bourne rapped on the porsches door and the driver recognizing him unlocked the doors bourne and the dyev piled in gala shivering hugged her inadequately short fur coat around her bourne asked the driver to turn up the heat he complied sank down in his furcollared greatcoat i dont care what message you have for me gala said sullenly whatever it is the answers no are you sure bourne wondered where she was going with this sure im sure ive had it with you guys trying to find out where leonid danilovich is leonid danilovich bourne said to himself theres a name the professor never mentioned the reason we keep hounding you is hes sure you know bourne had no idea what he was saying but he felt if he kept running with her hed be able to open her up i dont now gala sounded like a little girl in a snit but even if i did i wouldnt rat him out you can tell maslov that she fairly spat out the name of the kazanskayas leader dimitri maslov now were getting somewhere bourne thought but why was maslov after leonid danilovich and what did any of this have to do with pyotrs death he decided to explore this link why were you and leonid danilovich using tarkanians apartment instantly he knew hed made a mistake galas expression changed dramatically her eyes narrowed and she made a sound deep in her throat what the hell is this you already know why we were camped out there tell me again bourne said improvising desperately ive only heard it thirdhand maybe something was left out what could be left out leonid danilovich and tarkanian are the best of friends is that where you took pyotr for your latenight trysts ah so thats what this is all about the kazanskaya want to know all about pyotr zilber and i know why pyotr ordered the murder of borya maks in prison of all placeshigh security prison colony who could do that get in there kill maks a kazanskaya contract killer of great strength and skill and get out without being seen thats precisely what maslov wants to know bourne said because it was the safe comment to make gala picked at her nail extensions realized what she was doing stopped he suspects leonid danilovich did it because leonid is known for such feats no one else could do that hes sure time to press her bourne decided hes right on the money gala shrugged why are you protecting leonid i love him the way you loved pyotr dont be absurd gala laughed i never loved pyotr he was a job semion icoupov paid me handsomely for and pyotr paid for your treachery with his life gala seemed to peer at him in a different light who are you bourne ignored her question during that time where did you meet icoupov i never met him leonid served as intermediary now bournes mind raced to put the building blocks gala had provided into their proper order you know dont you that leonid murdered pyotr he didnt of course know that but given the circumstances it seemed all too likely no gala blanched that cant be you can see how it must be what happened icoupov didnt kill pyotr himself surely that much must be clear to you he observed the fear mounting behind her eyes who else would icoupov have trusted to do it leonid was the only other person to know you were spying on pyotr for icoupov the truth of what he said was written on galas face like a road sign appearing out of the fog while she was still in shock bourne said please tell me leonids full name what just do as i tell you bourne said it may be the only way to save him from being killed by the kazanskaya but youre kazanskaya pushing up his sleeve bourne gave her a closeup look at the false tattoo a kazanskaya was waiting for leonid in tarkanians apartment this evening i dont believe you her eyes widened what were you doing there tarkanians dead bourne said now do you want to help the man you say you love i do love leonid i dont care what he did at that moment the driver cursed mightily turned in his seat my clients coming go on bourne urged gala write his name down something mustve happened in the vip the driver said shit he looks pissed you gotta get outta here now bourne grabbed gala opened the streetside door nearly burying it in the fender of a hurtling bombily he flagged it down with a fistful of rubles made the transfer from western luxury to eastern poverty in one stride gala nematova broke away from him as he was entering the zhig he clutched her by the back of her fur coat but she shrugged it off began to run the cabbie stepped on the gas the stench of diesel fumes foaming up into the interior choking them so badly bourne had to crank open a window as he did so he saw two men whod been at her table come out of the club they looked right and left one of them spotted galas running figure gestured to the other one and they took off after her follow those men bourne shouted to the cabbie the cabbie had a flat face with a distinctly asian caste he was fat greasy and spoke russian with an abominable accent clearly russian wasnt his first language youre joking yes bourne thrust more rubles at him im joking no the cabbie shrugged crashed the zhig into first gear depressed the gas pedal at that moment the two men caught up with gala twenty at precisely that moment leonid danilovich arkadin and devra were deciding how to get to haydar without devras people knowing about it best would be to extract him from his environment arkadin said but for that we need to know his habitual movements i dont have time i know a way devra said the two of them were sitting side by side on a bed on the ground floor of a small inn the room wasnt much to look atjust a bed a chair a brokendown dresserbut it had its own bathroom a shower with plenty of hot water which theyd used one after the other best of all it was warm haydars a gambler she continued almost every evening hes hunkered down in the back room of a local cafй he knows the owner who lets them play without imposing a fee in fact once a week he joins them she glanced at her watch hes sure to be there now what good is that your people are sure to protect him there right thats why we arent going to go near the place an hour later they were sitting in their rented car on the side of a twolane road all their lights were off they were freezing whatever snow had seemed imminent had passed them by a halfmoon rode in the sky an old world lantern revealing wisps of clouds and bluish crusty snowbanks this is the route haydar takes to and from the game devra tilted her watch face so it was illuminated by the moonglow coming off the banked snow he should show any minute now arkadin was behind the wheel just point out the car leave the rest to me one hand was on the ignition key the other on the gearshift we have to be prepared he might have an escort if hes got guards theyll be in the same car with him devra said the roads are so bad it will be extremely difficult to keep him in sight from a trailing vehicle one car arkadin said all the better a moment later the night was momentarily lit by a moving glow below the rise in the road headlights devra tensed thats the right direction youll know his car ill know it she said there arent many cars in the area mostly old trucks for carting the glow brightened then they saw the headlights themselves as the vehicle crested the rise from the position of the headlights arkadin could tell this was a car not a truck its him she said get out arkadin ordered run run now keep moving bourne told the cabbie in first gear only till i tell you different i dont think but bourne had already swung open the curbside door was sprinting toward the two men one had gala the other was turning raising his hand perhaps a signal for one of the waiting cars bourne chopped his midsection with his two hands brought his head down to his raised knee the mans teeth clacked together and he toppled over the second man swung gala around so that she was between him and bourne he scrabbled for his gun but bourne was too quick reaching around gala bourne went for him he moved to block bourne and gala stamped her heel on his instep that was all the distraction bourne needed with a hand around her waist he pulled her away delivered a vicious uppercut to the mans throat reflexively he put two hands up choking and gagging bourne delivered two quick blows to his stomach and he too hit the pavement come on bourne grabbed gala by the hand made for the bombila moving slowly along the street with its door open bourne swung her inside climbed in after her slammed the door shut take off he shouted at the cabbie take off now shivering with the cold gala rolled up the window my name is yakov the cabbie said craning his neck to look at them in the rearview mirror you make much excitement for me tonight is there more where can i take you just drive around bourne said several blocks on he discovered gala staring at him you werent lying to me she said neither were you clearly the kazanskaya think you know where leonid is leonid danilovich arkadin she was still trying to catch her breath thats his name its what you wanted isnt it what i want bourne said is a meeting with dimitri maslov the head of the kazanskaya youre insane leonid has been playing with a very bad crowd bourne said hes put you in harms way unless i can persuade maslov that you dont know where arkadin is youll never be safe shivering gala struggled back into her fur jacket why did you save me she pulled the jacket tight around her slender frame why are you doing this because i cant let arkadin throw you to the wolves thats not what hes done she protested what would you call it she opened her mouth closed it again bit her lip as if she could find an answer in her pain they had reached the inner garden road traffic whizzed by at dizzying speeds the cabbie was about to earn his bombily name where to he said over his shoulder there was silence for a moment then gala leaned forward gave him an address and where the fuck might that be the cabbie asked that was another oddity about bombily since almost none of them were muscovites they had no idea where anything was unfazed gala gave him directions and with a horrific belching of diesel fumes they lurched into the madly spinning traffic since we cant go back to the apartment gala said well crash at my girlfriends place ive done it before shes cool with it do the kazanskaya know about her gala frowned i dont think so no we cant take the chance bourne gave the cabbie the address of one of the new americanrun hotels near red square thats the last place theyll think to look for you he said as the cabbie changed gears and they hurtled through the spangled moscow night alone in the car arkadin fired the ignition and pulled out he stamped on the gas pedal accelerating so quickly his head jerked back just before he slammed into the right corner of haydars car he switched on his headlights he could see haydars bodyguards in the rear seat they were in the process of turning around when arkadins car made jarring contact the rear end of haydars car slewed to the left beginning its spin arkadin braked sharply rammed the right back door staving it in haydar who had been struggling with the wheel completely lost control of the car it spun off the road its front now facing the way it had come its rear struck a tree the bumper broke in two the trunk collapsed and there it sat a crippled animal arkadin drove off the road put his car in park got out stalking toward haydar his headlights were shining directly into the wrecked car he could see haydar behind the wheel conscious clearly in shock only one of the men in the backseat was visible his head was thrown back and to one side there was blood on his face black and glistening in the harsh light haydar cringed fearfully as arkadin made for the bodyguards both rear doors were so buckled they could not be opened using his elbow arkadin smashed the nearside rear window and peered in one man had been caught in arkadins broadside hit hed been thrown clear across the car lay half on the lap of the bodyguard still sitting up neither one moved as arkadin moved to haul haydar out from behind the wheel devra came hurtling out of the darkness haydars eyes opened wide as he recognized her she tackled arkadin her momentum knocking him off his feet haydar watched in amazement as they rolled over through the snow now visible now not in the headlight beams haydar could see her striking him the much larger man fighting back gradually gaining the upper hand by dint of his superior bulk and strength then devra reared back haydar could see a knife in her hand she drove it down into darkness stabbing again and again when she rose again into the headlight beams he could see her breathing heavily her hand was empty haydar figured she must have left the knife buried in her adversary she staggered for a moment with the aftereffects of her struggle then she made her way over to him yanking open the car door she said are you okay he nodded shrinking away from her i was told youd turned on us joined the other side she laughed thats just what i wanted that sonovabitch to think he managed to get to shumenko and filya after that i figured the only way to survive was to play along with him until i got a chance to take him down haydar nodded this is the final battle the thought that youd turned traitor was dispiriting i know some of us thought your status was earned on your back in pyotrs bed but not me the shock was coming out of his eyes the old canny light was returning where is the package she said is it safe i handed it off to heinrich this evening at the card game has he left for munich why the hell would he stay a minute more than he had to he hates it here i assume he was driving to istanbul for his usual earlyevening flight his eyes narrowed why dyou want to know he gave a little yelp as arkadin loomed out of the night looking from devra to arkadin and back again he said what is this i saw you stab him to death you saw what we wanted you to see arkadin handed devra his gun and she shot haydar between the eyes she turned back to him handed him the gun buttfirst there was clear defiance in her voice when she said have i proved myself to you now bourne checked into the metropolya hotel as fyodor ilianovich popov the night clerk didnt bat an eye at galas presence nor did he ask for her id having popovs was enough to satisfy hotel policy the lobby with its gilt sconces and accents and glittering crystal chandeliers looked like something out of the czarist era the designers thumbing their nose at the architecture of soviet brutalism they took one of the silklined elevators to the seventeenth floor bourne opened the door to their room with an electronically coded plastic card after a thorough visual check he allowed her to enter she took off her fur jacket the act of sitting on the bed rode her miniskirt farther up her thighs but she appeared unconcerned leaning forward elbows on knees she said thank you for saving me but to be honest i dont know what ill do now bourne pulled out the chair that went with the desk sat facing her the first thing you have to do is tell me whether you know where arkadin is gala looked down at the carpet between her feet she rubbed her arms as if she was still cold though the temperature in the room was warm enough all right bourne said lets talk about something else do you know anything about the black legion her head came up her brows furrowed now thats odd you should mention them why is that leonid would speak about them is arkadin one of them gala snorted you must be joking no he never actually spoke about them to me i mean he mentioned them now and again when he was going to see ivan and who is ivan ivan volkin hes an old friend of leonids he used to be in the grupperovka leonid told me that from time to time the leaders ask him for advice so he knows all the players hes a kind of de facto underworld historian now anyway hes the one leonid would go to this interested bourne can you take me to him why not hes a night owl leonid used to visit him very late gala searched in her handbag for her cell phone she scrolled through her phone book dialed volkins number after speaking to someone for several minutes she terminated the connection and nodded hell see us in an hour good she frowned put away her phone if youre thinking that ivan knows where leonid is youre mistaken leonid told no one where he was going not even me you must love this man a great deal i do does he love you when she turned back to him her eyes were full of tears yes he loves me is that why you took money to spy on pyotr is that why you were partying with that man tonight at the chinese pilot christ none of that matters bourne sat forward i dont understand why doesnt it matter gala regarded him for a long time whats the matter with you dont you know anything about love a tear overflowed ran down her cheek whatever i do for money allows me to live whatever i do with my body has nothing to do with love love is strictly a matter of the heart my heart belongs to leonid danilovich thats sacred pure no one can touch it or defile it maybe we have different definitions of love bourne said she shook her head youve no right to judge me of course youre right bourne said but that wasnt meant as a judgment i have difficulty understanding love thats all she cocked her head why is that bourne hesitated before continuing ive lost two wives a daughter and many friends have you lost love too i have no idea what that means my brother died protecting me gala began to shake he was all i had no one would ever love me the way he did after our parents were killed we were inseparable he swore hed make sure nothing bad happened to me he went to his grave keeping that promise she sat up straight her face was defiant now do you understand bourne realized that hed seriously underestimated this dyev had he done the same with moira despite admitting his feelings for moira hed unconsciously made the decision that no other woman could be as strong as imperturbable as marie in this he was clearly mistaken he had this russian dyevochka to thank for the insight gala peered at him now her sudden anger seemed to have burned itself out youre like leonid danilovich in many ways you no longer will walk off the cliff you no longer trust in love like him you were damaged in terrible ways but now you see youve made your present as bleak as your past your only salvation is to find someone to love i did find someone bourne said shes dead now is there no one else bourne nodded maybe then you must embrace her instead of running away she clasped her hands together embrace love thats what i would tell leonid danilovich if he were here instead of you three blocks away parked at the curb yakov the cabbie who had dropped gala and bourne off opened his cell phone pressed a speeddial digit on the keypad when he heard the familiar voice he said i dropped them off at the metropolya not ten minutes ago keep an eye out for them the voice said if they leave the hotel tell me then follow them yakov gave his assent drove back around installed himself opposite the hotel entrance then he dialed another number delivered precisely the same information to another of his clients we just missed the package devra said as they walked away from the wreck wed better get on the road to istanbul right away the next contact heinrich has a good couple of hours head start they drove through the night negotiating the twists turns and switchbacks the black mountains with their shimmering stoles of snow were their silent implacable companions the road was as pockmarked as if they were in a war zone once hitting a patch of black ice they spun out but arkadin didnt lose his head he turned into the skid tamped gently on the brakes several times while he threw the car into neutral then turned the engine off they came to a stop in the side of a snowdrift i hope heinrich had the same difficulty devra said arkadin restarted the car but couldnt build up enough traction to get them moving he walked around to the rear while devra took the wheel he found nothing useful inside the trunk so he trudged several paces into the trees snapped off a handful of substantial branches which he wedged in front of the right rear tire he slapped the fender twice and devra stepped on the gas the car wheezed and groaned the tires spun sending up showers of granular snow then the treads found the wood rolled up onto it and over the car was free devra moved over as arkadin took the wheel clouds had slid across the moon steeping the road in dense shadow as they made their way through the mountain pass there was no traffic the only illumination for many miles was the cars own headlights finally the moon rose from its cloud bed and the hemmedin world around them was bathed in an eerie bluish light times like this when i miss my american devra mused her head against the seat back he came from california i loved especially his stories about surfing my god what a weird sport only in america huh but i used to think how great it would be to live in a land of sunshine ride endless highways in convertibles and swim whenever you wanted to the american dream arkadin said sourly she sighed i so wanted him to take me with him when he left my friend mischa wanted me to take him with me arkadin said but that was a long time ago devra turned her head toward him where did you go to america he laughed shortly but not to california it didnt matter to mischa he was crazy about america thats why i didnt take him you go to a place to work you fall in love with it and now you dont want to work anymore he paused for a moment concentrated on navigating through a hairpin switchback i didnt tell him that of course he continued i could never hurt mischa like that we both grew up in slums you know fucking hard life that is i was beaten up so many times i stopped counting then mischa stepped in he was bigger than i was but that wasnt it he taught me how to use a knifenot just stab but how to throw it as well then he took me to a guy he knew skinny little man but he had no fat on him at all in the blink of an eye he had me down on my back in so much pain my eyes watered christ i couldnt even breathe mischa asked me if id like to be able to do that and i said shit where do i sign up the headlights of a truck appeared coming toward them a horrific dazzle that momentarily blinded both of them arkadin slowed down until the truck lumbered past mischas my best friend my only friend really he said i dont know what id do without him will i meet him when you take me back to moscow hes in america now arkadin said but ill take you to his apartment where ive been staying its along the frunzenskaya embankment his living room overlooks gorky park the view is very beautiful he thought fleetingly of gala who was still in the apartment he knew how to get her out it wouldnt be a problem at all i know ill love it devra said it was a relief to hear him talk about himself encouraged by his talkative mood she continued what work did you do in america and just like that his mood flipped he braked the car to a halt you drive he said devra had grown used to his mercurial mood swings but watched him come around the front of the car she slid over he slammed the passengersside door shut and she put the car in gear wondering what tender nerve shed touched they continued along the road heading down the mountainside well hit the highway soon enough she said to break the thickening silence i cant wait to crawl into a warm bed inevitably there came a time when arkadin took the initiative with marlene it happened while she was sleeping he crept down the hall to her door it was childs play for him to pick the lock with nothing more than the wire that wrapped the cork in the bottle of champagne icoupov served at dinner of course being a muslim icoupov himself had not partaken of the alcohol but arkadin and marlene had no such restrictions arkadin had volunteered to open the champagne and when he did he palmed the wire the room smelled of herof lemons and musk a combination that set off a stirring below his belly the moon was full low on the horizon it looked as if god were squeezing it between his palms arkadin stood still listening to her deep even breaths every once in a while catching the hint of a snore the bedcovers rustled as she turned onto her right side away from him he waited until her breathing settled again before moving to the bed he climbed knelt over her her face and shoulder were in moonlight her neck in shadow so that it appeared to him as if hed already decapitated her for some reason this vision disturbed him he tried to breathe deeply and easily but the disturbing vision tightened his chest made him so dizzy that he almost lost his balance and then he felt something hard and cold that in a drawn breath brought him back to himself marlene was awake her head turned staring at him in her right hand was a glock mm ive got a full magazine she said which meant she had fourteen more rounds if she missed the kill with her first shot not that that was likely the glock was one of the most powerful handguns on the market she wasnt fooling around back off he rolled off the bed and she sat up her bare breasts shone whitely in the moonlight she appeared totally unconcerned with her seminudity you werent asleep i havent slept since i came here marlene said ive been anticipating this moment ive been waiting for you to steal into my room she set aside the glock come to bed youre safe with me leonid danilovich as if mesmerized he climbed back onto the bed and like a little child rested his head against the warm cushion of her breasts while she rocked him tenderly she lay curled around him willing her warmth to seep into his cool marble flesh gradually she felt his heartbeat cease its manic racing to the steady sound of her heartbeat he fell into slumber some time later she woke him with a whisper in his ear it wasnt difficult he wanted to be released from his nightmare he started staring at her for a long moment his body rigid his mouth felt raw from yelling in his sleep returning to the present he recognized her he felt her arms around him the protective curl of her body and to her astonishment and elation he relaxed nothing can harm you here leonid danilovich she breathed not even your nightmares he stared at her in an odd unblinking fashion anyone else would have been frightened but not marlene what made you cry out she said there was blood everywhere on the bed your bed were you beaten leonid he blinked and the spell was broken he turned over faced away from her waiting for the ashen light of dawn twentyone on a fine clear afternoon with the sun already low in the sky tyrone drove soraya moore to the nsa safe house nestled within the rolling hills of virginia somewhere in some anonymous cybercafй in northeast washington kiki was sitting at a public computer terminal waiting to sow the software virus shed devised to disable the propertys two thousand cctv surveillance cameras itll loop the video images back on themselves endlessly shed told them that was the easy part in order to make the code a hundred percent invisible itll work for ten minutes no more at that point it will in essence selfdestruct deforming into tiny packets of harmless code the system wont pick up as anomalous everything now depended on timing since it was impossible to send an electronic signal from the nsa safe house without it being picked up and tagged as suspicious they had worked out an external timing scheme which meant that if anything went wrongif tyrone was delayed for any reasonthe ten minutes would tick by and the plan would fail this was the plans achilles heel still it was their only option and they decided to take it besides deron had a number of goodies hed concocted for them after consulting the architectural plans of the building hed mysteriously conjured up she had tried to get them herself and struck out nsa had what she thought was a total lock on the property records just before they stopped at the front gates soraya said are you sure you want to go through with this tyrone nodded stonyfaced lets get on wid it he was pissed that shed even thought to ask that question when he was on the street if one of his crew dared to question his courage or resolve that wouldve been the end of him tyrone had to keep reminding himself that this wasnt the street he knew all too well that shed accepted a huge risk in taking him in off the streetcivilizing him as he sometimes thought of the process when he felt particularly hemmed in by the rules and regulations of white men he knew nothing about he glanced at her out of the corner of his eye wondering if hed ever have stepped into the white mans world were it not for his love of her here was a woman of colora muslim no lesswho was working for the man not just the man but the man squared cubed into infinity whatever if she didnt mind doing it why should he but his upbringing was about as different from hers as it could get from what shed told him her parents had given her everything she needed he barely had parents and they either didnt want to give him anything or were incapable of giving it she had the advantage of a firstclass education he had deron who though hed taught tyrone many things was no substitute for white mans education what was ironic was that only months ago he would have sneered at the kind of education she had but once hed met her he began to understand how ignorant he really was he was streetsmart suremore than she was but he was intimidated around people whod graduated high school and college the more he observed them maneuvering through their worldhow they talked negotiated interacted with one anotherthe more he understood just how stunted his life had been street smarts and nothing else was just what the doctor ordered for picking your way through the hood but there was a whole fucking world beyond the hood once he realized that like deron he wanted to explore the world beyond the borders of his neighborhood he knew hed have to remake himself from the toes up all this was on his mind when he saw the imposing stoneandslate building within the high iron fence as he knew from the plans hed memorized at derons it was perfectly symmetrical with four high chimneys eight gabled rooms a spiky fistful of antennas aerials and satellite dishes was the only anomalous feature you look very handsome in that suit soraya said its fuckin uncomfortable he said i feel stiff just like every nsa agent he laughed the way a roman gladiator might as he entered the colosseum which is the point she added youve got the tag deron gave you he patted a place over his heart safe and sound soraya nodded okay here we go he knew there was a chance hed never come out of that house alive but he didnt care why should he what had his life amounted to up until now shitall hed stood upjust as deron hadmade his choice thats all a man asks for in this life soraya presented the credentials lavalle had sent her by messenger this morning nevertheless both she and tyrone were scrutinized by a bookend pair of suits with square jaws and standing orders not to smile finally they passed muster and were waved through as tyrone drove down the snaking gravel drive soraya pointed out the terrible gauntlet of surveillance systems an intruder would have to pass in order to infiltrate from beyond the propertys borders this monologue reassured him that theyd already bypassed these risks by being lavalles guests now all they had to do was negotiate the interior of the house getting out again was another matter entirely he drove up to the portico before he could turn off the engine a valet came to relieve him of the car yet another squarejawed military type whod never look right in his civilian suit general kendall punctual as usual was at the door to meet them he gave sorayas hand a perfunctory shake then eyeballed tyrone as she introduced him your bodyguard i presume kendall said in a tone someone would use for a rebuke but he doesnt look like standardissue ci material this isnt a standard ci rendezvous soraya returned tartly kendall shrugged another perfunctory handshake and he turned on his heel leading them inside the hulking structure through the public rooms giltedged refined expensive beyond modernday imagining along hushed corridors lined with martial paintings past mullioned windows through which the january sunlight sparked in beams that stretched across the plush blue carpet without seeming to tyrone took note of every detail as if he were casing the joint for a highend robbery which in fact he was they passed the door down to the basement levels it looked precisely as soraya had drawn it from memory for him and deron they went on another ten yards to the walnut doors leading to the library the fireplace contained a roaring blaze a grouping had been set with four chairs in the same spot where soraya said she had sat with kendall and lavalle on her first visit willard met them just inside the door good afternoon ms moore he said with his customary half bow how very nice to see you again so soon would you care for your ceylon tea that would be wonderful thank you tyrone was about to ask for a coke but thought better of it instead he ordered another ceylon tea having not the faintest idea what it tasted like very good willard said and left them this way kendall said unnecessarily leading them to the grouping of chairs where luther lavalle was already seated staring out the mullioned windows at the light gathered to an oval over the western hills he must have heard the whisper of their approach because he rose and turned just as they came up the maneuver seemed to soraya artfully rehearsed and therefore as artificial as lavalles smile dutifully she introduced tyrone and they all sat down together lavalle steepled his fingers before we begin director i feel compelled to point out that our own archives department has unearthed some fragmentary history on the black legion apparently they did exist during the time of the third reich they were composed of muslim prisoners of war who were brought back to germany from the first putsches into the soviet union these muslims mainly of turkish descent from the caucasus detested stalin so much theyd do anything to topple his regime even becoming nazis lavalle shook his head like a history professor recounting evil days to a class of wideeyed students its a particularly unpleasant footnote in a thoroughly repugnant decade but as for the black legion itself theres no evidence whatsoever that it survived the regime that spawned it besides which its benefactor himmler was a master of propaganda especially when it came to advancing himself in the eyes of hitler anecdotal evidence suggests that the role of the black legion on the eastern front was minimal that it was in fact himmlers fantastic propaganda machine that gave it the feared reputation it enjoyed not anything its members themselves did he smiled the sun emerging from behind storm clouds now in that light let me take a look at the typhon intercepts soraya tolerated this rather condescending introduction meant to discredit the origin of the intercepts before she even handed them over she allowed indignation and humiliation to pass through her so she could remain calm and focused on her mission pulling the slim briefcase onto her lap she unlocked the coded lock extracted a red file with a thick black stripe across its upper righthand corner marking it as director eyes onlymaterial of the highest security clearance staring lavalle in the face she handed it over excuse me director tyrone held out his hand the electronic tape oh yes i forgot soraya said mr lavalle would you please hand the file to mr elkins lavalle checked the file more closely saw a ribbon of shiny metal sealing the file dont bother i can peel this back myself not if you want to read the intercepts tyrone said unless the tape is opened with thishe held up a small plastic implementthe file will incinerate within seconds lavalle nodded his approval of the security measures soraya had taken as he gave the file to tyrone soraya said since our last meeting my people have intercepted more communication from the same entity which increasingly seems to be the command center lavalle frowned a command center thats highly unusual for a terrorist network which is by definition made up of independent cadres thats what makes the intercepts so compelling it also makes them suspect in my opinion lavalle said which is why im anxious to read them myself by this time tyrone had slit the metallic security tape handed the file back lavalles gaze dropped as he opened the file and began to read at this point tyrone said i need to use the bathroom lavalle waved a hand go ahead he said without looking up kendall watched him as he went up to willard who was on his way over with the drinks to ask for directions soraya saw this out of the corner of her eye if all went well in the next couple of minutes tyrone would be standing in front of the door down to the basement at the precise moment kiki sent the virus to the nsa security system ivan volkin was a hairy bear of a man saltandpepper hair standing straight up like a madman a full beard white as snow small but cheerful eyes the color of a rainstorm he was slightly bandylegged as if hed been riding a horse all his life his lined and leathery face lent him a certain dignified aspect as if in his life hed earned the respect of many he greeted them warmly welcoming them into an apartment that appeared small because of the stacks of books and periodicals that covered every conceivable horizontal surface including the kitchen stovetop and his bed he led them down a narrow winding aisle from the vestibule to the living room made room for them on the sofa by moving three teetering stacks of books now he said standing in front of them how can i be of help i need to know everything you can tell me about the black legion and why are you interested in such a tiny footnote to history volkin looked at bourne with a jaundiced eye you dont have the look of a scholar neither do you bourne said this produced a spraying laugh from the older man no i suppose not volkin wiped his eyes spoken like one soldier to another eh yes reaching around behind him he swung over a ladderbacked chair straddled it with his arms crossed over the top so what specifically do you want to know how did they manage to survive into the twentyfirst century volkins face immediately shut down who told you the black legion survives bourne did not want to use professor specters name an unimpeachable source is that so well that source is wrong why bother to deny it bourne said volkin rose went into the kitchen bourne could hear the refrigerator door open and close the light clink of glassware when volkin returned he had an iced bottle of vodka in one hand three water glasses in the other handing them the glasses he unscrewed the cap filled their glasses halfway when hed poured for himself he sat down again the bottle standing between them on the threadbare carpet volkin raised his glass to our health he emptied his glass in two great gulps smacking his lips he reached down refilled it listen to me closely if i were to admit that the black legion exists today there would be nothing left of my health to toast how would anyone know bourne said how ill tell you how i tell you what i know then you go out and act on that information where dyou think the shitstorm that ensues is going to land hmm he tapped his barrel chest with his glass slopping vodka onto his already stained shirt every action has a reaction my friend and let me tell you that when it comes to the black legion every reaction is fatal for someone since hed already as much as admitted that the black legion had in fact survived the defeat of nazi germany bourne brought the subject around to what really concerned him why would the kazanskaya be involved pardon in some way i cant yet understand the kazanskaya are interested in mikhail tarkanian i stumbled across one of their contract killers in his apartment volkins expression turned sour what were you doing in his apartment tarkanians dead bourne said what volkin exploded i dont believe you i was there when it happened and i tell you its impossible on the contrary its a fact bourne said his death was a direct result of him being a member of the black legion volkin crossed his arms over his chest he looked like the silverback in the national zoo i see whats happening here how many ways will you try to get me to talk about the black legion every way i can bourne said the kazanskaya are in some way in league with the black legion which is an alarming prospect i may look as if i have all the answers but i dont volkin stared at him as if daring bourne to call him a liar though bourne was certain that volkin knew more than he would admit he also knew it would be a mistake to call him on it clearly this was a man who couldnt be intimidated so there was no point in trying professor specter had warned him not to get caught up in the grupperovka war but the professor was a long way away from moscow his intelligence was only as accurate as his men on the ground here instinct told bourne there was a serious disconnect so far as he could see there was only one way to get to the truth tell me how to get a meet with maslov he said volkin shook his head that would be most unwise with the kazanskaya in the middle of a power struggle with the azeri popov is only my cover name bourne said actually im a consultant to viktor cherkesovthe head of the federal antinarcotics agency one of the two or three most powerful siloviks in russia volkin pulled back as if stung by bournes words he shot gala an accusatory glance as if bourne were a scorpion shed brought into his den turning back to bourne he said have you any proof of this dont be absurd however i can tell you the name of the man i report to boris illyich karpov is that so volkin produced a makarov handgun placed it on his right knee if youre lying he picked up a cell phone he scavenged miraculously from out of the clutter and quickly punched in a number we have no amateurs here after a moment he said into the phone boris illyich i have here with me a man who claims to be working for you i would like to put him on the line yes with a deadpan face volkin handed over the cell boris bourne said its jason bourne jason my good friend karpovs voice reverberated down the line i havent seen you since reykjavik it seems like a long time too long i tell you where have you been in timbuktu what were you doing in mali bourne asked dont ask dont tell karpov laughed i understand youre now working for me thats right my boy ive longed for this day karpov let go with another booming laugh we must toast this moment with vodka but not tonight eh put that old goat volkin back on the line i assume theres something you want from him correct he hasnt believed a word youve told him but ill change that please memorize my cell number then call me when youre alone until we speak again my good friend he wants to talk to you bourne said thats understandable volkin took the cell from bourne put it to his ear almost immediately his expression changed he stared at bourne his mouth slightly open yes boris illyich yes of course i understand volkin broke the connection stared at bourne for what seemed a long time at length he said im going to call dimitri maslov now i hope to hell you know what youre doing otherwise this is the last time anyone will see you either alive or dead twentytwo tyrone went immediately into one of the cubicles in the mens room fishing out the plastic tag deron had made for him he clipped it on the outside of his suit jacket a suit that looked like the regulation government suits all the other spooks wore here the tag identified him as special agent damon riggs out of the nsa field office in la damon riggs was real enough the tag came straight from the nsa hr database tyrone flushed the toilet emerged from the cubicle smiled frostily at an nsa agent bent over one of the sinks washing his hands the agent glanced at tyrones tag said youre a long way from home and in the middle of winter too tyrones voice was strong and firm damn i miss goin topdown in santa monica i hear you the agent dried his hands good luck he said as he left tyrone stared at the closed door for a moment took a deep breath let it out slowly so far so good he went out into the hallway his eyes straight ahead his stride purposeful he passed four or five agents a couple gave his tag a cursory glance nodded the others ignored him altogether the trick deron had said is to look like you belong dont hesitate be purposeful if you look like you know where youre going you become part of the scene no one notices you tyrone reached the door without incident he went past it as two agents deep in conversation passed him then checking both ways he doubled back quickly he took out what seemed to be an ordinary piece of clear tape laid it on top of the fingerprint reader checking his watch he waited until the second hand touched the then holding his breath he pressed his forefinger onto the tape so that it was flush against the reader the door opened he stripped off the tape slipped inside the tape contained lavalles fingerprint which tyrone had lifted off the back cover of the file while working the device that slit the security tape soraya had engaged lavalle in conversation as a diversion at the bottom of the flight of steps he paused for a moment no alarm bells were going off no sound of armed security guards coming his way kikis software program had done its work now the rest was up to him he moved swiftly and silently down the rough concrete corridor buzzing fluorescent strips were the only decoration here casting a sickly glow he saw no one heard nothing beyond the susurrus of machinery snapping on latex gloves he tried each door he came to most were locked the first one that wasnt opened into a small cubicle with a viewing window in one wall tyrone had been in enough police precincts to know this was oneway glass he peered into a room not much larger than the one he was in he could make out a metal chair bolted to the center of the floor beneath which was a large drain affixed to the righthand wall was a threefootdeep trough as long as a man with manacles bolted to each end above which was coiled a fire hose its nozzle looked enormous in the confines of the small room this tyrone knew from photos hed seen was a waterboarding tank he snapped as many photos of it as possible because there was the proof soraya needed that the nsa was enacting illegal and inhuman torture tyrone took photos of everything with the tenmegapixel digital mini camera soraya had given him given the huge memory of its smart card it could record six videos of up to three minutes in duration he moved on knowing he had an extremely limited amount of time opening the door an inch at a time he determined that the corridor was still deserted he hurried down it checking all the doors he came to at length he found himself in another viewing room this time however he saw a man kneeling beside a table his arms were drawn back his bound hands on the table a black hood had been pulled down over his head his attitude was of a defeated soldier about to be forced to kiss the feet of his conqueror tyrone felt a surge of rage run through him such as hed never felt before he couldnt help thinking of the history of his own people hunted by rival tribes on the east coast of africa sold to the white man brought as slaves back to america all of this terrible history deron had made him study to learn where he came from to understand what drove the prejudices the innate hatreds all the powerful forces inside him with an effort he pulled himself together this is what theyd been hoping for proof that the nsa was subjecting prisoners to illegal forms of torture tyrone took a slew of photos even a short video before exiting the viewing room once again he was the only one in the corridor this concerned him surely he would have heard or seen nsa personnel down here but there was no sign of anyone all at once he felt a prickling at the back of his neck he turned retracing his steps at a half run his heart pounded his blood rushed in his ears with every step he took his sense of foreboding increased then he broke into a fullout sprint luther lavalle looked up from his reading said ominously what kind of game are you playing director soraya kept herself from starting i beg your pardon ive been through these transmission intercepts you claim come from the black legion twice now nowhere do i find any reference to that name or for that matter any name at all willard appeared handed general kendall a folded slip of paper kendall read it without any expression then he excused himself soraya watched him leave the library with no little trepidation to regain her attention lavalle waved the sheets briefly in the air like a red flag in front of a bull tell me the truth for all you know these conversations could be between two sets of elevenyearolds playing terrorist games soraya could feel herself bristling my people assure me theyre genuine mr lavalle and theyre the best in the business if you dont believe that i cant imagine why you want a piece of typhon lavalle conceded her point but he wasnt finished with her then how do you know theyre from the black legion collateral intelligence lavalle sat back in his chair his drink was left untouched on the table just what the holy hell does collateral intelligence mean another source unrelated to the intercepts has knowledge of an imminent attack on american soil that originates with the black legion who we have no tangible evidence actually exist soraya was growing increasingly uncomfortable the conversation was veering perilously close to an interrogation i brought these intercepts at your behest with the intention of engendering trust between us thats as may be lavalle said but quite frankly these anonymous intercepts alarming as they seem on the surface dont do it for me youre holding something back director i want to know the source of your socalled collateral intel im afraid thats impossible the source is absolutely sacrosanct soraya could not tell him that her source was jason bourne however she reached down to her slim attachй case pulled out several photos handed them over its a corpse lavalle said i fail to see the significance look at the second photo soraya said its a closeup of the inside of the victims elbow what do you see a tattoo of three horses heads attached towhat is this it looks like the nazi ss deaths head and so it is soraya handed him another photo this is the uniform patch of the black legion under their leader heinrich himmler lavalle pursed his lips then he put sheets back in the file returned it to soraya he held up the photos if you could find this insignia anyone could this could be a group thats simply appropriated the black legions sign like the skinheads in germany appropriated the swastika besides this isnt proof that the intercepts came from the black legion and even if they did i have a problem director its the same as yours i would think youve told mealso according to your sacrosanct sourcethat the black legion is being fronted by the eastern brotherhood if the nsa acts on this intel well have every flavor of pr nightmare visited on us the eastern brotherhood as im sure youre aware is exceedingly powerful especially with the overseas press we run with this and were wrong its going to cause the president and this country an enormous amount of humiliation which we cant afford now do i make myself clear perfectly mr lavalle but if we ignore it and america is successfully attacked again then how do we look lavalle scrubbed his face with one hand so were between a rock and hard place sir you know as well as i do that action is better than inaction especially in a volatile situation like this lavalle was about to capitulate soraya knew it but here came willard again gliding up silent as a ghost he bent whispered something in lavalles ear thank you willard lavalle said that will be all then he returned his attention to soraya well director it seems im urgently wanted elsewhere he stood up and smiled down at her but spoke with a steely tone please join me sorayas heart plummeted this invitation wasnt a request yakov the bombila driver whod been ordered to park across the avenue from the front entrance of the metropolya hotel had been joined forty minutes ago by a man who looked as if hed been in a fistfight with a meat grinder despite efforts to cover it up his face was swollen dark as pounded flesh he wore a silver patch over one eye he was a surly bastard yakov decided even before the man handed him a fistful of money he uttered not a word of greeting but slammed into the backseat slithered down so even the crown of his head was invisible to anyone glancing casually in the atmosphere inside the bombila quickly grew so toxic that yakov was forced to vacate the semiwarmth for the freezing moscow night he bought himself some food from a passing turkish vendor spent the next half hour eating it talking to his friend max whod pulled up behind him because max was a lazy sonovabitch who grasped at any excuse not to work yakov and max were in the middle of heated speculation that concerned last weeks death of a highlevel rab bank officer who was discovered tied up tortured and asphyxiated in the garage of his own elitny dacha the two of them were wondering why the general prosecutors office and the presidents newly formed investigative committee were fighting over jurisdiction of the death its politics pure and simple yakov said dirty politics max retorted theres nothing pure and simple about that it was then that yakov spotted jason bourne and the sexy dyev getting out of a bombila in front of the hotel when he struck the side of his cab three times with the flat of his hand he sensed a stirring in the backseat hes here he said as the rear window rolled down bourne was about to drop gala off at the metropolya hotel when he looked out the bombila window saw the taxi that had earlier taken him from the chinese pilot to the hotel yakov the driver was leaning against the fender of his dilapidated junkmobile eating something greasy while talking to the cabbie parked right behind him bourne saw yakov glance over as he and gala exited the bombila when theyd gone through the revolving door bourne told her to stay put to his left was the service door used by porters to take guestss luggage in and out of the hotel bourne looked out across the street yakov stuck his head in the rear window huddled with a man whod been hidden in the backseat in the elevator on the way up to their room he said are you hungry im starved harun iliev the man semion icoupov sent to find jason bourne had expended hours in contentious negotiations and frustrating dead ends and finally spent a great deal of money in his pursuit it wasnt coincidence that had led him at last to the bombila named yakov for yakov was an ambitious man who knew hed never get rich driving around moscow fending off other bombily pissing them off by cutting in snatching their fares from under their noses what could be more lucrative than spying on other people especially when your chief client was the american yakov had many clients but none of them knew how to throw around dollars like the americans it was their sincere belief that enough money bought you anything mostly they were right when they werent though it was still costly for them most of yakovs other clients laughed at the kind of money the americans threw around chiefly though he suspected it was because they were jealous laughing at what you didnt have and never would was he supposed better than letting it depress you icoupovs people were the only ones who paid as well but they used him far less than the americans on the other hand they had him on retainer yakov knew harun iliev well had dealt with him a number of times before and both liked and trusted him besides they were both muslim yakov kept his religion a secret in moscow especially from the americans who stupidly would have dropped him like a fake ruble directly after the american attachй contacted him for the job yakov had called harun iliev as a consequence harun had already inserted himself in the staff of the metropolya hotel through a cousin of his who worked in the kitchen as one of the expediters he coordinated food orders for the line chefs the moment he saw the roomservice order come down from bournes room he called harun were shortstaffed tonight he said get down here in the next five minutes and ill make sure youre the one to take the order up to him harun iliev quickly presented himself to his cousin and was shown to a trolley neatly covered in starched white linen laden with covered bowls platters plates silverware and napkins thanking his cousin for this opportunity to get to jason bourne he rolled his trolley to the service elevator someone was already there harun took him to be one of the hotel managers until as they entered the elevator he turned so harun caught a fleeting glimpse of his pulped face and the silver patch over one eye harun reached out pressed the button for the seventeenth floor the man pressed the button for the eighteenth the elevator stopped at the fourth floor where a maid got on with her turndown cart she exited a floor later the elevator had just passed the fifteenth floor when the man reached over pulled out the large red emergency stop button harun turned to question the mans action but the man fired one bullet from a exceptionally quiet mm welrod equipped with a suppressor the bullet pierced haruns forehead tore through his brain he was dead before he collapsed to the elevator floor anthony prowess mopped up what little blood there was with a napkin from the roomservice cart then he quickly stripped the clothes off his victim donned the uniform of the metropolya hotel he pushed in the emergency stop button again and the elevator continued its ascent to the seventeenth floor after determining that the hallway was clear prowess consulted a map of the floor dragged the corpse into a utility room then wheeled the cart around the corner to room why dont you take shower a long hot bourne said galas expression was mischievous if i stink at least its not as bad as you she began to slip out of her mini skirt why dont we take one together some other time i have business to attend to her lower lip comically pouted god what could be more boring bourne laughed as she crossed into the bathroom closed the door behind her soon after the sound of running water came to him along with tiny curls of steam he turned on the tv watched a dreadful show in russian with the sound turned up there was a knock on the door bourne rose from his position on the bed opened the door a uniformed waiter in a short jacket and a hat with a bill pulled down over his face pushed a trolley full of food into the room bourne signed the bill the waiter turned to leave instantly he whirled a knife in his hand in one blurred movement he drew his arm back but bourne was ready as the waiter threw the knife bourne raised a domed metal top off a chafing dish used it as a shield to deflect the knife with a flick of his wrist he sent it spinning at the waiter who ducked out of the way the edge of the domed top caught his hat spun it off his head revealing the puffy face of the man whod strangled baronov and tried to kill bourne as well the attacker drew a welrod and squeezed off two shots before bourne shoved the cart into his midsection he staggered back bourne threw himself across the cart grabbed prowess by the front of the uniform then wrestled him to the floor bourne managed to kick away the welrod the man attacked with hands and feet moving bourne so that he could regain possession of the gun bourne could see the patch over the nsa agents eye could only surmise the damage hed inflicted the agent feinted one way then caught bourne flush on the jaw bourne staggered and his attacker was on him with another wire which he whipped around bournes neck pulling hard on it he drew bourne back to his feet bourne staggered against the cart as it skittered away from him he grabbed the chafing dish hurled its contents in the agents face the scalding soup struck the attacker like a torch and he shouted but failed to drop the wire instead pulling it tighter jerking bourne against his chest bourne was on his knees his back arched his lungs were screaming for oxygen his muscles were rapidly losing their strength and it was becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate soon he knew hed pass out with his remaining strength he jabbed his elbow into the agents crotch the wire slacked off enough for him to get to his feet he slammed the back of his head into the agents face heard the satisfying thunk as the mans head struck the wall the wire slackened a bit more enough for bourne to pull it from his throat gasping in air and reverse their positions wrapping the wire around prowesss neck he fought and kicked like a madman but bourne held on working the wire tighter and tighter until the agents body went slack his head toppled to one side bourne didnt slacken the wire until hed assured himself there was no longer a pulse then he let the man slide to the floor he was bent over hands on thighs taking deep slow breaths when gala walked out of the bathroom amid a halo of lavenderscented mist jesus christ she said then she turned and vomited all over her bare pink feet twentythree any way you slice it or dice it luther lavalle said hes a dead man soraya stared bleakly through the oneway glass at tyrone who was standing in a cubicle ominously outfitted with a shallow coffinlike tub that had restraints for wrists and ankles a fire hose above it in the center of the room a steel table was bolted down to the bare concrete floor beneath which was a drain to sluice both water and blood away lavalle held up the digital camera general kendall found this on your compatriot he touched a button and the photos tyrone had taken scrolled across the cameras screen this smoking gun is enough to convict him of treason soraya couldnt help wondering how many shots of the torture chambers tyrone had managed to take before he was caught off with his head kendall said baring his teeth soraya could not rid herself of the sick feeling in her stomach of course tyrone had been in dangerous situations before but she was directly responsible for putting him in harms way if anything happened to him she knew shed never be able to forgive herself what was she thinking involving him in such perilous work the enormity of her miscalculation was all too clear to her now when it was too late to do anything about it the real pity lavalle went on is that with very little difficulty we can make a case against you as well soraya was solely focused on tyrone whom she had wronged so terribly this was my idea she said dully let tyrone go you mean he was only following orders general kendall said this isnt nuremberg frankly theres no viable defense the two of you can put up his conviction and executionas well as yoursare a fait accompli they took her back to the library where willard seeing her ashen face fetched her a fresh pot of ceylon tea the three of them sat by the window the fourth chair conspicuously empty was an accusation to soraya her grievous mismanagement of this mission was compounded by the knowledge that she had seriously underestimated lavalle shed been lulled by his smug overaggressive nature into thinking he was the sort of man whod automatically underestimate her she was dead wrong she fought the constriction in her chest the panic welling up the sense that she and tyrone were trapped in an impossible situation she used the tea ritual to refocus herself for the first time in her life she added cream and sugar and drank the tea as if it were medication or a form of penance she was trying to get her brain unfrozen from shock to get it working normally again in order to help tyrone she knew she needed to get herself out of here if lavalle meant to charge her as he threatened to do with tyrone shed already be in an adjacent cell the fact that theyd brought her back to the library allowed a sliver of light into the darkness that had settled around her she decided for now to allow this scenario to play out on lavalles and kendalls terms the moment she set her teacup down lavalle took up his ax as i said before director the real pity is your involvement id hate to lose you as an allythough i see now i never really had you as an ally this little speech sounded canned as if each word had been chewed over by lavalle frankly he continued in retrospect i can see that youve lied to me from the first you never had any intention of switching your allegiance to nsa did you he sighed as if he were a disciplinary dean addressing a bright but chronically wayward student thats why i cant believe that you concocted this scheme on your own if i were a betting man kendall said id wager your orders came from the top veronica hart is the real problem here lavalle spread his hands perhaps through the lens of whats happened here today you can begin to see things as we do soraya didnt need a weatherman to see which way the wind was blowing keeping her voice deliberately neutral she said how can i be of service lavalle smiled genially turned to kendall said you see richard the director can be of help to us despite your reservations he quickly turned back to soraya his expression sobering the general wants to prosecute you both to the full extent of the law which i neednt reiterate is very full indeed their goodcop badcop routine would seem clichйd soraya thought bitterly except this was for real she knew kendall hated her guts hed made no effort to hide his contempt he was a military man after all the possibility of having to report to a female superior was unthinkable downright risible he hadnt thought much of tyrone either which made his capture of the younger man that much harder to stomach i understand my position is untenable she said despising having to kowtow to this despicable human being excellent then well start from that point lavalle stared up at the ceiling giving an impersonation of someone trying to decide how to proceed but she suspected he knew very well what he was doing every step of the way his eyes engaged hers the way i see it we have a twopart problem one concerns your friend down in the hold the second involves you im more concerned with him soraya said how do i get him out lavalle shifted in his chair lets take your situation first we can build a circumstantial case against you but without direct testimony from your friend tyrone soraya said his name is tyrone elkins to hammer home just whose conversation this was lavalle quite deliberately ignored her without direct testimony from your friend we wont get far direct testimony we will get kendall said as soon as we waterboard him no soraya said you cant why because its illegal kendall chuckled soraya turned to lavalle theres another way you and i both know there is lavalle said nothing for a moment drawing out the tension you told me that your source for the attribution of the typhon intercepts was sacrosanct does that decision still stand if i tell you will you let tyrone go no lavalle said but youll be free to leave what about tyrone lavalle crossed one leg over another lets take one thing at a time shall we soraya nodded she knew that as long as she was sitting here she had no wiggle room my source was bourne lavalle looked startled jason bourne are you kidding me no mr lavalle he has knowledge of the black legion and that they were being fronted by the eastern brotherhood where the hell did this knowledge come from he had no time to tell me even if he had a mind to she said there were too many nsa agents in the vicinity the incident at the freer kendall said lavalle held up a hand you helped him to escape soraya shook her head actually he thought id turned on him interesting lavalle tapped his lip does he still think that soraya determined it was time for a little defiance a little lie i dont know jason has a tendency toward paranoia so its possible lavalle looked thoughtful maybe we can use that to our advantage general kendall looked disgusted so in other words this whole story about the black legion could be nothing more than a lunatic fantasy or more likely deliberate disinformation lavalle said soraya shook her head why would he do that who knows why he does anything lavalle took a slow sip of his whiskey diluted now by the melted ice cubes lets not forget that bourne was in a rage when he told you about the black legion by your own admission he thought youd betrayed him you have a point soraya knew better than to defend bourne to these people the more you argued against them the more entrenched they became in their position theyd built a case against jason out of fear and loathing not because as they claimed he was unstable but because he simply didnt care about their rules and regulations instead of flouting them something the directors had knowledge of and knew how to handle he annihilated them of course i do lavalle set down his glass lets move on to your friend the case against him is airtight openandshut no hope whatsoever of appeal or commutation let him eat cake kendall said marie antoinette never said that by the way soraya said kendall glared at her while lavalle continued let the punishment fit the crime would be more apropos or in your case let the expiation fit the crime he waved the approaching willard away what were going to need from you director is proofincontrovertible proofthat your illegal foray into nsa territory was instigated by veronica hart she knew what he was asking of her so basically were talking an exchange of prisonershart for tyrone youve grasped it entirely lavalle said clearly pleased ill have to think about it lavalle nodded a reasonable request ill have willard prepare you a meal he glanced at his watch richard and i have a meeting in fifteen minutes well be back in approximately two hours you can think over your answer until then no i need to think this over in another environment soraya said director moore given your history of deception that would be a mistake on our part you promised i could leave if i told you my source and so you shall when youve agreed to my terms he rose and with him kendall you and your friend came in here together now youre joined at the hip bourne waited until gala was sufficiently recovered she dressed shivering not once looking at the body of the dead agent im sorry you got dragged into this bourne said no youre not without me you never wouldve gotten to ivan gala angrily jammed her feet into her shoes this is a nightmare she said as if to herself any minute ill wake up in my own bed and none of this will have happened bourne led her toward the door gala shuddered anew as she carefully skirted the body youre hanging out with the wrong crowd ha ha good one she said as they made their way down the hall that includes you a moment later he signaled her to stop kneeling down he touched his fingertip to a wet spot on the carpet what is it bourne examined his fingertip blood gala gave a little whimper whats it doing out here good question bourne said as he crept along the hallway he noted a tiny smear in front of a narrow door wrenching it open he switched on the utility rooms light christ gala said inside was a crumpled body with a bullet in its forehead it was nude but there was a pile of clothes tossed in a corner obviously those of the nsa agent bourne knelt down rifled through them hoping to find some form of id to no avail what are you doing gala cried bourne spotted a tiny triangle of dark brown leather sticking out from under the corpse which was only visible from this low angle rolling the corpse on its side he discovered a wallet the dead mans id would prove useful since bourne now had none of his own his assumed identity which hed used to check in was unusable because the moment the corpse was found in fyodor ilianovich popovs room thered be a massive manhunt for him bourne reached out took the wallet then he rose grabbed galas hand and got them out of there he insisted they take the service elevator down to the kitchen from there it was a simple matter to find the rear entrance outside it had begun to snow again the wind slicing in from the square was icy and bitter flagging down a bombila bourne was about to give the cabbie the address of galas friend then realized that yakov the cabbie working for the nsa knew that address get in the taxi bourne said quietly to gala but be prepared to get out quickly and do exactly as i say soraya didnt need a couple of hours to make up her mind she didnt even need a couple of minutes all right she said ill do whatever it takes to get tyrone out of here lavalle turned back to regard her well now that kind of capitulation would do my heart good if i didnt know you to be such a duplicitous little bitch unfortunately he went on in your case verbal capitulation isnt quite as convincing as it would be in others that being the case the general here will make crystal clear to you the consequences of further treachery on your part soraya rose along with kendall lavalle stopped her with his voice oh and director when you leave here youll have until ten tomorrow morning to make your decision ill expect you back here then i hope ive made myself clear the general led her out of the library down the corridor to the door to the basement the moment she saw where he was taking her she said no dont do this please theres no need but kendall his back ramrodstraight ignored her when she hesitated at the security door he grasped her firmly by the elbow and as if she were a child steered her down the stairs in due course she found herself in the same viewing room tyrone was on his knees his arm behind him bound hands on the tabletop which was higher than shoulder level this position was both extremely painful and humiliating his torso was forced forward his shoulder blades back sorayas heart was filled with dread enough she said i get it youve made your point by no means general kendall said soraya could see two shadowy figures moving about the cell tyrone had become aware of them too he tried to twist around to see what they were up to one of the men shoved a black hood over his head my god soraya said to herself what did the other man have in his hands kendall shoved her hard against the oneway glass where your friend is concerned were just warming up two minutes later they began to fill the waterboarding tank soraya began to scream bourne asked the bombila driver to pass by the front of the hotel everything seemed calm and normal which meant that the bodies on the seventeenth floor hadnt been discovered yet but it wouldnt be long before someone went to look for the missing roomservice waiter he turned his attention across the street searching for yakov he was still outside his car talking to a fellow driver both of them were swinging their arms to keep their circulation going he pointed out yakov to gala who recognized him when theyd passed the square bourne had the bombila pull over he turned to gala i want you to go back to yakov and have him take you to universitetskaya ploshchad at vorobyovy gory bourne was speaking of the top of the only hill in the otherwise flat city where lovers and university students went to get drunk make love and smoke dope while looking out over the city wait there for me and whatever you do dont get out of the car tell the cabbie youre meeting someone there but hes the one whos been spying on us gala said dont worry bourne reassured her ill be right behind you the view out over vorobyovy gory was not so very grand first there was the ugly bulk of luzhniki stadium in the midforeground second there were the spires of the kremlin which would hardly inspire even the most ardent lovers but for all that at night it was as romantic as moscow could get bourne whod had his bombila track the one gala was in all the way there was relieved that yakov had orders only to observe and report back anyway the nsa was interested in bourne not a young blond dyev arriving at the overlook bourne paid the fare hed agreed to at the beginning of the ride strode down the sidewalk and got into the front seat of yakovs taxi hey whats this yakov said then he recognized bourne and made a scramble for the makarov he kept in a homemade sling under the ratty dash bourne pulled his hand away and held him back against the seat while taking possession of the handgun he pointed it at yakov who do you report to yakov said in a whiny voice i challenge you to sit in my seat night after night driving around the garden ring crawling endlessly down tverskaya being cut out of fares by kamikaze bombily and make enough to live on i dont care why you pimp yourself out to the nsa bourne told him i want to know who you report to yakov held up his hand listen listen im from bishkek in kyrgyzstan its not so nice there who can make a living so i pack my family and we travel to russia the beating heart of the new federation where the streets are paved with rubles but when i arrive here i am treated like dirt people in the street spit on my wife my children are beaten and called terrible names and i cant get a job anywhere in this city moscow for muscovites that is the refrain i hear over and over so i take to the bombily because i have no other choice but this life sir you have no idea how difficult it is sometimes after twelve hours i come home with a hundred rubles sometimes with nothing i cannot be faulted for taking money the americans offer russia is corrupt but moscow its more than corrupt there isnt a word for how bad things are here the government is made up of thugs and criminals the criminals plunder the natural resources of russiaoil natural gas uranium everyone takes takes takes so they can have big foreign cars a different dyev for every day of the week a dacha in miami beach and whats left for us potatoes and beets if we work eighteen hours a day and if were lucky i have no animosity toward you bourne said you have a right to earn a living he handed yakov a fistful of dollars i see no one sir i swear just voices on my cell phone all moneys come to a post office box in bourne carefully placed the muzzle of the makarov in yakovs ear the cabbie cringed turned mournful eyes on bourne please please sir what have i done i saw you outside the metropolya with the man who tried to kill me yakov squealed like a skewered rat kill you im employed merely to watch and report i have no knowledge about bourne hit the cabbie stop lying and tell me what i want to know all right all right yakov was shaking with fear the american who pays me his name is low harris low bourne made him give a detailed description of low then he took yakovs cell phone get out of the car he said but sir i answered all your questions yakov protested youve taken everything of mine what more do you want bourne leaned across him opened the door then shoved him out this is a popular place plenty of bombily come and go youre a rich man now use some of the money i gave you to get a ride home sliding behind the wheel he put the zhig in gear drove back into the heart of the city harris low was a dapper man with a pencil mustache he had the prematurely white hair and ruddy complexion of many blueblooded families in the american northeast that he had spent the last eleven years in moscow working for nsa was a testament to his father who had trod the same perilous path low had idolized his father had wanted to be like him for as long as he could remember like his father he had the stars and stripes tattooed on his soul hed been a running back in college gone through the rigorous physical training to be an nsa field agent had tracked down terrorists in afghanistan and the horn of africa he wasnt afraid to engage in handtohand combat or to kill a target he did it for god and country during his eleven years in the capital of russia low had made many friends some of whom were the sons of his fathers friends suffice to say he had developed a network of apparatchiks and siloviks for whom a quid pro quo was the order of the day harris held no illusions to further his countrys cause he would scratch anyones backif they in turn scratched his he heard about the murders at the metropolya hotel from a friend of his in the general prosecutors office whod caught the police squeal harris met this individual at the hotel and was consequently one of the first people on the scene he had no interest in the corpse in the utility closet but he immediately recognized anthony prowess excusing himself from the crime scene he went into the stairwell off the seventeenthfloor hallway punched in an overseas number on his cell a moment later luther lavalle answered we have a problem low said prowess has been rendered inoperative with extreme prejudice thats very disturbing lavalle said we have a rogue operative loose in moscow who has now murdered one of our own i think you know what to do low understood there was no time to bring in another of nsas wetwork specialists which meant terminating bourne was up to him now that hes killed an american citizen lavalle said ill bring the moscow police and the general prosecutors office into the picture theyll have the same photo of him im sending to your cell within the hour low thought a moment the question is tracking him moscow is way behind the curve in closedcircuit tvs bourne is going to need money lavalle said he couldnt take enough through customs when he landed which means he wouldnt try hell have set up a local account at a moscow bank get the locals to help with surveillance pronto consider it done low said and harris dont make the same mistake with bourne that prowess did bourne took gala to her friends apartment which was lavish even by american standards her friend lorraine was an american of armenian extraction her dark eyes and hair her olive complexion all served to increase her exoticism she hugged and kissed gala greeted bourne warmly and invited him to stay for a drink or tea as he took a tour through the rooms gala said hes worried about my safety whats happened lorraine asked are you all right shell be fine bourne said coming back into the living room thisll all blow over in a couple of days having satisfied himself of the security of the apartment he left them with the warning not to open the door for anyone they didnt know ivan volkin had directed bourne to go to novoslobodskaya where the meet with dimitri maslov would take place at first bourne thought it lucky that the bombila he flagged down knew how to find the address but when he was dropped off he understood novoslobodskaya was the address of motorhome a new club jammed with young partying muscovites gigantic flatpanel screens above the center island bar showed telecasts of american baseball basketball football english rugby and world cup soccer the floor of the main room was dominated by tables for russian billiards and american pool following volkins direction bourne headed for the back room which was fitted out as an arabian nights hookah room complete with overlapping carpets jeweltoned cushions and of course gaily colored brass hookahs being smoked by lounging men and women bourne stopped at the doorway by two overdeveloped members of club security told them he was here to see dimitri maslov one of them pointed to a man lounging and smoking a hookah in the far left corner maslov bourne said when he reached the pile of cushions surrounding a low brass table my name is yevgeny maslov isnt here the man gestured sit down please bourne hesitated a moment then sat on a cushion opposite yevgeny where is he did you think it would be so simple one call and poof he pops into existence like a genie from a lamp yevgeny shook his head offered bourne the pipe good shit try some when bourne declined yevgeny shrugged took a toke deep into his lungs held it then let it out with an audible hiss why do you want to see maslov thats between me and him bourne said yevgeny shrugged again as you like maslov is out of the city then why was i told to come here to be judged to see whether you are a serious individual to see whether maslov will make the decision to see you maslov trusts people to make decisions for him he is a busy man he has other things on his mind like how to win the war with the azeri yevgenys eyes narrowed perhaps you can see maslov next week i need to see him now bourne said yevgeny shrugged as i said hes out of moscow but he may be back tomorrow morning why dont you ensure it i could yevgeny said but it will cost you how much ten thousand ten thousand dollars to talk to dimitri maslov yevgeny shook his head the american dollar has become too debased ten thousand swiss francs bourne thought a moment he didnt have that kind of money on him and certainly not in swiss francs however he had the information baronov had given him on the safedeposit box at the moskva bank the problem was that it was in the name of fyodor ilianovich popov who was no doubt now wanted for questioning regarding the body of the man in his room at the metropolya hotel there was no help for it bourne thought hed have to take the chance ill have the money tomorrow morning bourne said that will be satisfactory but ill give it to maslov and no one else yevgeny nodded done he wrote something on a slip of paper showed it to bourne please be at this address at noon tomorrow then he struck a match held it to the corner of the paper which burned steadily until it crumbled into ash semion icoupov in his temporary headquarters in grindelwald took the news of harun ilievs death very hard hed been a witness to death many times but harun had been like a brother to him closer even because the two had no sibling baggage to clutter and distort their relationship icoupov had relied on harun for his wise counsel his was a sad loss indeed his thoughts were interrupted by the orchestrated chaos around him a score of people were staffing computer consoles hooked up to satellite feeds surveillance networks public transportation cctv from major hubs all over the world they were coming to the final buildup to the black legions attack every screen had to be scrutinized and analyzed the faces of suspicious people picked out and run through a nebula of software that could identify individuals from this icoupovs operatives were building a mosaic of the realtime backdrop against which the attack was scheduled to take place icoupov became aware that three of his aides were clustered around his desk apparently theyd been trying to talk to him what is it his voice was testy the better to cover up his grief and inattention ismail the most senior of his aides cleared his throat we wanted to know who you intend to send after jason bourne now that harun his voice trailed off icoupov had been contemplating the same question hed made a mental list that included any number of people he could send but he kept eliminating most of them for one reason or another but on the second and third run through he began to realize that these reasons were in one way or another trivial now as ismail asked the question again he knew he looked up into his aides anxious faces and said its me im going after bourne myself twentyfour it was disturbingly hot in the alter botanischer garten and as humid as a rain forest the enormous glass panels were opaque with beads of mist sliding down their faces moira who had already taken off her gloves and long winter coat now shrugged out of the thick cableknit sweater that helped protect her from munichs chill damp morning which could penetrate to the bone when it came to german cities she much preferred berlin to munich for one thing berlin had for many years been on the cutting edge of popular music berlin was where such notable pop icons as david bowie brian eno and lou reed among many others had come to recharge their creative batteries by listening to what musicians far younger than they were creating for another it hadnt lost its legacy of the war and its aftermath berlin was like a living museum that was reinventing itself with every breath it took there was however a strictly personal reason why she preferred berlin she came for much the same reason bowie did to get away from stale habits to breathe the fresh air of a city unlike those she knew at an early age moira became bored with the familiar every time she felt compelled to join a group because that was what her friends were doing she sensed she was losing a piece of herself gradually she realized that her friends had ceased to become individuals devolving into a cliquey they she found repellent the only way to escape was to flee beyond the borders of the united states she could have chosen london or barcelona as some other college sophomores did but she was a freak for bowie and the velvet underground so berlin it was the botanical garden was built in the mids as an exhibition hall but eighty years later after its garden was destroyed by a fire it gained new life as a public park outside the awful bulk of the prewar fountain of neptune cast a shadow across the space through which she strolled the array of gorgeous specimens on display inside this glassedin space only underscored the fact that munich itself was without verve or spark it was a plodding city of untermenchen businessmen as gray as the city and factories belching smoke into the low angry sky it was also a focal point of european muslim activity which in one of those classic actionreaction scenarios made it a hotbed of skinhead neonazis moira glanced at her watch it was precisely am and here came noah striding toward her he was cool and efficient personally opaque even withholding but he wasnt a bad sort shed have refused him as a handler if he was she was senior enough to command that respect and noah did respect her she was certain of that in many ways noah reminded her of johann the man whod recruited her while she was at the university actually johann hadnt contacted her at college he was far too canny for that he asked his girlfriend to make the approach rightly figuring moira would be more responsive to a fellow female student ultimately moira had met with johann was intrigued by what he had to offer her and the rest was history well not exactly shed never told anyone including martin or bourne who she really worked for to do so would have violated her contract with the firm she stopped in front of the pinkly intimate blooms of an orchid speckled like the bridge of a virgins nose berlin had also been the site of her first passionate love affair the kind that curled your toes obliterated your focus on responsibility and the future the affair almost ruined her principally because it possessed her like a whirlwind and in the process shed lost any sense of herself she became a sexual instrument on which her lover played what he wanted she wanted and so dissolution in the end it was johann who had saved her but the process of separating pleasure from self was immensely painful especially because two months afterward her lover died for a time her rage at johann was boundless curdling their friendship jeopardizing the trust theyd placed in each other it was a lesson she never forgot it was one reason she hadnt allowed herself to fall for martin though part of her yearned for his touch jason bourne was another story entirely for she had once again been overtaken by the whirlwind but this time she wasnt diminished partly that was because she was mature now and knew better mainly though it was because bourne asked nothing of her he sought neither to lead nor to dominate her everything with him was clean and open she moved on to another orchid this one dark as night with a tiny lantern of yellow hidden in its center it was ironic she thought that despite his own issues she had never before met a man so in control of himself she found his selfassurance a compelling aphrodisiac as well as a powerful antidote to her own innate melancholy that was another irony she thought if asked bourne would surely say that he was a pessimist but being one herself she knew an optimist when she met one bourne would take on the most impossible situations and somehow find a solution only the greatest of optimists could accomplish that hearing soft footfalls she turned to see noah shoulders hunched within a tweed overcoat though born in israel he could pass for a german now perhaps because hed lived in berlin for so long hed been johanns protйgй the two had been very close when johann was killed it was noah who took his place hello moira he had a narrow face below dark hair flecked with premature gray his long nose and serious mouth belied a keen sense of the absurd no bourne i see i did my best to get him on board at nextgen noah smiled im sure you did he gestured and they began to walk together few people were around this gloomy morning so there was no chance of being overheard but to be honest from what you told me it was a long shot im not disappointed moira said i detested the entire experience thats because you have feelings for him what if i do moira said rather more defensively than she expected you tell me noah watched her carefully there is a consensus among the partners that your emotions are interfering with your work where the hell is that coming from she said i want you to know that im on your side his voice was that of a psychoanalyst calming an increasingly agitated patient the problem is you should have come here days ago they passed a worker tending a swath of african violets when they were out of her earshot he continued then you go and bring bourne with you i told you i was still trying to recruit him dont lie to a liar moira he crossed his arms over his chest when he spoke again every word had weight there is a grave concern that your priorities arent straight you have a job to do and a vitally important one the firm cant afford to have your attention wandering are you saying you want to replace me its an option that was discussed he acknowledged bullshit at this late stage theres no one who knows the project as well as i do but then another option was requested withdrawal from the project moira was truly shocked you wouldnt noah kept his gaze on her the partners have determined that in this instance it would be preferable to withdraw than to fail moira felt her blood rising you cant withdraw noah im not going to fail im afraid thats no longer an option he said because the decisions been made as of oh seven hundred this morning weve officially notified nextgen that weve withdrawn from the project he handed her a packet here is your new assignment youre required to leave for damascus this afternoon arkadin and devra reached the bosporus bridge and crossed over into istanbul just as the sun was rising since coming down from the cruel snowswept mountains along turkeys spine they had shed layers of clothes and now the morning was exceptionally clear and mild pleasure yachts and huge tankers alike plowed the bosporus on their way to various destinations it felt good to roll down the windows the air fresh moist tangy with salt and minerals was a distinct relief after the dry hard winter of the hinterlands during the night theyd stopped at every gas station beatendown motel or store that was openthough most were notin an attempt to find heinrich the next courier in pyotrs network when it came time for him to spell her she moved to the passengers side put her head against the door and fell into a deep sleep from which emerged a dream she was a whale swimming in icy black water no sun pierced the depths where she swam below her was an unfathomable abyss ahead of her was a shadowy shape she didnt know why but it seemed imperative that she follow that shape catch up with it identify it was it friend or foe every so often she filled her head and throat with sound which she sent out through the darkness but she received no reply there were no other whales around so what was she chasing what was she so desperate to find there was no one to help her she became frightened the fright grew and grew it clung to her as she awoke with a start in the car beside arkadin the grayish predawn light creeping through the landscape rendered every shape unfamiliar and vaguely threatening twentyfive minutes later they were in the seething clamorous heart of istanbul heinrich likes to spend the time before his flight in kilyos the beach community in the northern suburbs devra said do you know how to get there arkadin nodded im familiar with the area they wove their way through sultanahmet the core of old istanbul then took the galata bridge which spanned the golden horn to karakцy in the north in the old days when istanbul was known as constantinople seat of the byzantine empire karakцy was the powerful genoese trading colony known as galata as they reached the center of the bridge devra looked west toward europe then east across the bosporus to ьskьdar and asia they passed into karakцy with its fortified genoese walls and rising from it the stone galata tower with its conical top one of the monuments that along with the topkapi palace and blue mosque dominated the modernday citys skyline kilyos lay along the black sea coast twentytwo miles north of istanbul proper in the summer it was a popular beach resort packed with people swimming snacking in the restaurants that lined the beach shopping for sunglasses and straw hats sunbathing or just dreaming in winter it possessed a sad vaguely disreputable air like a dowager sinking into senility still on this sunsplashed morning under a cloudless cerulean sky there were figures walking up and down the beach young couples hand in hand mothers with young children who ran laughing to the waterline only to run back screaming with terror and delight when the surf piled roughly in an old man sat on a foldup stool smoking a crooked handrolled cigar that gave off a stench like the smokestack of a tannery arkadin parked the car and got out stretching his body after the long drive hell recognize me the moment he sees me devra said staying put she described heinrich in detail just before arkadin headed down to the beach she added he likes putting his feet in the water he says it grounds him down on the beach it was warm enough that some people had taken off their jackets one middleaged man had stripped to the waist and sat with knees drawn up arms locked around them facing up to the sun like a heliotrope kids dug in the sand with yellow plastic tweety bird shovels poured sand into pink plastic petunia pig buckets one pair of lovers had stopped at the shoreline embracing they kissed passionately arkadin walked on just behind them a man stood in the surf his trousers were rolled up his shoes with socks stuffed into them had been placed on a high point in the sand not far away he was staring out at the water dotted here and there with tankers tiny as legos inching along the blue horizon devras description was not only detailed it was accurate the man in the surf was heinrich the moskva bank was housed in an enormous ornate building that would pass for a palace in any other city but was runofthemill by moscow standards it occupied a corner of a busy thoroughfare a stones throw from red square the streets and sidewalks were packed with both muscovites and tourists it was just before am bourne had been walking around the area for the last twenty minutes checking for surveillance that he hadnt spotted any didnt mean the bank wasnt being watched hed glimpsed a number of police cars cruising the snowcovered streets more than usual perhaps as he walked along a street close to the bank he saw another police cruiser this one with its light flashing stepping back into a shop doorway he watched as it sped by halfway down the block it stopped behind a doubleparked car it sat there for a moment then the two policemen got out of their cruiser swaggered over to the vehicle bourne took the opportunity to walk down the crowded sidewalk people were wrapped and bundled swaddled like children breath came out of their mouths and noses in cloudlike bursts as they hurried along with hunched shoulders and bent backs as bourne came abreast of the cruiser he dipped down and glanced in the window there he saw his face staring up at him from a tear sheet that had obviously been distributed to every cop in moscow according to the accompanying text he was wanted for the murder of an american government official bourne walked quickly in the opposite direction disappearing around a corner before the cops had a chance to return to their car he phoned gala who was parked in yakovs battered zhig three blocks away awaiting his signal after his call she pulled out into traffic made a right then another as they had surmised it was slow going the morning traffic sluggish she checked her watch saw she needed to give bourne another ninety seconds as she approached the intersection near the bank she used the time to pick a likely target a shiny zil limousine not a speck of snow on its hood or roof was heading slowly toward the intersection at right angles to her at the appointed time she accelerated forward the bombilas tires which she and bourne had checked when theyd returned to lorraines were nearly bald their treads worn down to a nub gala braked much too hard and the zhig shrieked as the brakes locked the old tires skidding along the icy street until its grille struck the front fender of the zil limo all traffic came to a screeching halt horns blared pedestrians detoured from their appointed rounds drawn by the spectacle within thirty seconds three police cruisers had converged on the site of the accident as the chaos mounted bourne slipped through the revolving door into the ornate lobby of the moskva bank he immediately crossed the marble floor passing under one of the three huge gilt chandeliers that hung from the vaulted ceiling high above the effect of the room was to diminish human size and the experience was not unlike visiting a dead relative in his marble niche there was a low banquette twothirds of the way across the vast room behind which sat a row of drones their heads bent over their work before approaching bourne checked everyone inside the bank for suspicious behavior he produced popovs passport then wrote down the number of the safedeposit box on a small pad kept for that specific purpose the woman glanced at him took his passport and the slip of paper which she ripped off the pad locking her drawer she told bourne to wait he watched her walk over to the rank of supervisors and managers who sat in rows behind identical wooden desks and present bournes documentation the manager checked the number against his master list of safedeposit boxes then he checked the passport he hesitated then reached for the phone but when he noticed bourne staring at him he returned to receiver to its cradle he said something to the woman clerk then rose and came over to where bourne stood mr popov he handed back the passport vasily legev at your service he was an oily muscovite who continually scrubbed his palms together as if his hands had been somewhere hed rather not reveal his smile seemed as genuine as a threedollar bill opening a door in the banquette he ushered bourne through it will be my pleasure to escort you to our vault he led bourne to the rear of the room a discreet door opened onto a hushed carpeted corridor with a row of square columns on either side bad reproductions of famous landscape paintings hung on the walls bourne could hear the muted sounds of phones ringing computer operators inputting information or writing letters the vault was directly ahead its massive door open to the left a set of marble stairs swept upward vasily legev showed bourne through the circular opening and into the vault the hinges of the door looked to be two feet long and as thick around as bournes biceps inside was a rectangular room filled floortoceiling with metal boxes only the fronts of which could be seen they went over to bournes box number there were two locks two keyholes vasily legev inserted his key in the lefthand lock bourne inserted his into the righthand lock the two men turned their keys at the same time and the box was free to be pulled out of its niche vasily legev brought the box to one of a number of small viewing rooms he set it down on a ledge nodded to bourne then left pulling the privacy curtain behind him bourne didnt bother sitting opening the box he discovered a great deal of money in american dollars euros swiss francs and a number of other currencies he pocketed ten thousand swiss francs along with some dollars and euros before he closed the box pulled aside the curtain and emerged into the vault proper vasily legev was nowhere to be seen but two plainclothes cops had placed themselves between bourne and the doorway to the vault one of them aimed a makarov handgun at him the other smirking said you will come with us now gospadin popov arkadin hands in his pockets strolled down the crescent beach past a happily barking dog whose owner had let it off the leash a young woman pulled her auburn hair off her face and smiled at him as they passed each other when he was fairly near heinrich arkadin kicked off his shoes peeled off his socks and rolling up his trousers picked his way down to the surf line where the sand turned dark and crusty he moved at an angle so that as he ventured into the surf he was within earshot of the courier sensing someone near him heinrich turned and shading his eyes from the sun nodded at arkadin before turning away under the pretext of stumbling as the surf rolled in arkadin edged closer im surprised that someone besides me likes the winter surf heinrich seemed not to hear him continued his contemplation of the horizon i keep wondering what it is that feels so good about the water rushing over my feet and pulling back out after a moment heinrich glanced at him if you dont mind im trying to meditate meditate on this arkadin said sticking a knife very carefully in his side heinrichs eyes opened wide he staggered but arkadin was there to catch him they sat down together in the surf like old friends communing with nature heinrichs mouth made gasping sounds they reminded arkadin of a fish hauled out of the water what what arkadin cradled him with one hand as he searched beneath his poplin jacket with the other just as he thought heinrich had the package on him not trusting it to be out of his sight for an instant he held it in his palm for a moment it was in a rolled cardboard cylinder so small for something with that much power a lot of people have died for this arkadin said many more will die before its over heinrich managed to get out who are you im your death arkadin said plunging the knife in again he turned it between heinrichs ribs ah ah ah heinrich whispered as his lungs filled with his own blood his breathing turned shallow then erratic then it ceased altogether arkadin continued to shelter him with a comradely arm when heinrich nothing more than deadweight now slumped against him arkadin held him up as the surf crashed and ebbed around them arkadin stared out at the horizon as heinrich had done certain that beyond the demarcation was nothing save a black abyss endless and unknowable bourne went willingly with the two plainclothes policemen out of the vault as they stepped into the corridor bourne slammed the edge of his hand down on the cops wrist causing the makarov to drop and slide along the floor whirling bourne kicked the other cop who was flung back against the edge of a square column bourne grabbed hold of the arm of the first cop lifting it he slammed his elbow into the cops rib cage then smashed his hand into the back of his neck with both cops down bourne hurried along the corridor but another man came sprinting toward him blocking the way to the front of the bank a man who fit yakovs description of harris low reversing course bourne leapt up the marble staircase taking the steps three at a time racing around the turn he gained the landing of the second floor hed memorized the plans baronovs friend had procured for him and had planned for an emergency not trusting to chance that hed get in and out of the bank without being identified it was clear vasily legev having recognized gospadin popov would blow the whistle on him while he was inside the safedeposit viewing cubicle as bourne broke out into the corridor he encountered one of the banks security men grabbing him by the front of his uniform bourne jerked him off his feet swung him around and hurled him down the stairs at the ascending nsa agent racing down the corridor reached the door to the fire stairs opened it and went through like many buildings of its vintage this one had a staircase that rose around an open central core bourne took off up the stairs he passed the third floor then the fourth behind him he could hear the fire door bang open the sound of hurried footsteps on the stairs behind him his maneuver with the guard had slowed down the agent but hadnt stopped him he was midway to the fifth and top floor when the agent fired on him bourne ducked hearing the spang of the ricochet he sprinted upward as another shot went past him reaching the door to the roof at last he opened it and slammed it shut behind him harris low was furious with all the personnel at his disposal bourne was still at large thats what you get he thought as he raced up the stairwell when you leave the details to the russians they were great at brute force but when it came to the subtleties of undercover work they were all but useless those two plainclothes officers for instance over lows objections they hadnt waited for him had gone into the vault after bourne themselves now he was left with mopping up the mess theyd made he came to the door to the roof turned the handle and banged it open with the flat of his shoe the tarred rooftop the low winter sky glowered at him walther ppks at the ready he stepped out onto the roof in a semicrouch without warning the door slammed shut on him driving him back onto the small landing up on the roof bourne pulled open the door and dived through he struck low three blows directed first at the agents stomach and then at his right wrist forcing low to let go of the gun the walther flew down the stairwell landing on a step just above the fourth floor low enraged drove his fists into bournes kidney twice in succession bourne collapsed to his knees and low kicked him onto his back then straddled his chest pinning bournes arms low gripped bournes throat squeezing as hard as he could bourne struggled to get his arms free but he had insufficient leverage he tried to get a breath but lows grip on him was so complete that he was unable to get any oxygen into his system he stopped trying to free his arms and pressed down with the small of his back providing a fulcrum for his legs which he drew up then extended toward his head he brought his calves together sandwiching lows head between them low tried to shake them off violently twisting his shoulders back and forth but bourne held on increasing his grip then with an enormous effort bourne spun them both to the left lows head hit against the wall and bournes arms were free unwinding his legs he slammed the palms of his hands against lows ears low shouted in pain kicked away and scrambled back down the stairs bourne on his knees could see that low was heading for the walther bourne rose just as low reached it bourne launched himself down and across the air shaft he landed on low who whipped the walthers short but thick barrel into bournes face bourne reared back and low bent him over the railing four floors of air shaft loomed below ending in an unforgiving concrete base as they locked in their struggle low slowly inexorably brought the muzzle of the walther to bear on bournes face at the same time the heel of bournes hand was pushing lows head up low shook loose from bournes grip lunged at him in an effort to pistolwhip him into unconsciousness bourne bent his knees using lows own momentum he slid one arm under the agents crotch and lifted him up low tried to get a fix on bourne with the walther failed swung his arm back to deliver another blow with the barrel using all his remaining strength bourne hefted him up and over the banister dumping him down the air shaft low plummeted a tangle of arms and legs until he hit the bottom bourne turned went back out onto the roof as he loped across it he could hear the familiar rise and fall of police sirens he wiped blood off his cheek with the back of his hand reaching the other side of the roof he climbed atop the parapet leapt across the intervening space onto the roof of the adjoining building he did this twice more until he felt that it was safe for him to return to the street twentyfive soraya had never understood the nature of panic despite the fact that she grew up with an aunt who was prone to panic attacks when the attacks came on her aunt said she felt as if someone had put a plastic drycleaning bag over her head she felt as if she were being smothered to death soraya would watch her huddled in a chair or curled up on her bed and wonder how on earth she could feel such a thing there werent even any plastic drycleaning bags allowed in the house how could a person feel as if she were suffocating when there wasnt anything on her face now she knew as she drove out of the nsa safe house without tyrone as the high reinforced metal gates swung closed behind her her hands trembled on the wheel her heart felt as if it was jumping painfully inside her breast there was a film of sweat on her upper lip under her arms and at the nape of her neck worst of all she couldnt catch her breath her mind raced like a rat in a cage she gasped sucking ragged gulps of air in to her lungs she felt in short as if she were being smothered to death then her stomach rebelled as quickly as she was able she pulled to the side of the road got out and stumbled into the trees falling to her hands and knees she vomited up the sweet milky ceylon tea jason tyrone and veronica hart were now all in terrible jeopardy because of rash decisions shed made she quailed at the thought it was one thing to be chief of station in odessa quite another to be director maybe shed taken on more than she could handle maybe she didnt have the steel nerve that was required to make tough choices where was her vaunted confidence it was back there in the nsa interrogation cell with tyrone somehow she made it to alexandria where she parked she sat in the car bent over her clammy forehead pressed to the steering wheel she tried to think coherently but her brain seemed encased in a block of concrete at last she wept bitterly she had to call deron but she was petrified of his reaction when she told him that she had allowed his protйgй to be captured and tortured by the nsa she had fucked up big time and she had no idea how to rectify the situation the choice lavalle had given herveronica hart for tyronewas unacceptable after a time she calmed down enough to get out of the car she moved like a sleepwalker through crowds of people oblivious to her agony it seemed somehow wrong that the world should spin on as it always had utterly indifferent and uncaring she ducked into a little tea shop and as she rummaged in her handbag for her cell phone she saw the pack of cigarettes a cigarette would calm her nerves but standing out in the chilly street while she smoked would make her feel more of a lost soul she decided to have a smoke on the way back to her car placing her cell phone on the table she stared down at it as if it were alive she ordered chamomile tea which calmed her enough for her to pick up her phone she punched in derons number but when she heard his voice her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth eventually she was able to get out her name before he could ask her how the mission went she asked to speak with kiki derons girlfriend where that came from she had no idea shed met kiki only twice but kiki was a woman and instinctively with an atavistic clannishness soraya knew it would be easier to confess to her than to deron when kiki came on the line soraya asked if she could come to the little tea shop in alexandria when kiki asked when soraya said now please the first thing you have to do is stop blaming yourself kiki said after soraya had finished recounting in painful detail what had happened at the nsa safe house its your guilt thats paralyzing you and believe me youre going to need every last brain cell if were going to get tyrone out of that hole soraya looked up from her pallid tea kiki smiled nodding in her dark red dress her hair up in a swirl hammeredgold earrings depending from her earlobes she looked more regal more exotic than ever she towered over everyone in the tea shop by at least six inches i know i have to tell deron soraya said i just dont know what his reaction is going to be his reaction wont be as bad as what you fear kiki said and after all tyrone is a grown man he knew the risks as well as anyone it was his choice soraya he couldve said no soraya shook her head thats just it i dont think he could at least not from the way he sees things she stirred her tea more to forestall what she knew she had to say then she looked up licked her lips see tyrones got a thing for me doesnt he ever soraya was taken aback you know everyone who knows him knows honey you just have to look at him when the two of you are together soraya felt her cheeks flush i think he wouldve done anything i asked of him no matter how dangerous even if he didnt want to but you know he wanted to it was true soraya thought hed been excited nervous but definitely excited she knew that ever since deron had taken him under his wing hed chafed at being cooped up in the hood he was smarter than that and deron knew it but he had neither the interest nor the aptitude for what deron did then she came along hed told her he saw her as his ticket out of the ghetto yet she still had a knot in her chest a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach she could not get out of her head the image of tyrone on his knees hooded arms held behind him on the tabletop you just turned pale kiki said are you all right soraya nodded she wanted to tell kiki what she had seen but she couldnt she sensed that to talk about it would give it a reality so frightening so powerful it would throw her back into panic then we ought to go sorayas heart tripped over itself no time like the present she said as they went out the door she pulled out the pack of cigarettes and threw it in a nearby trash can she didnt need it anymore as planned gala picked up bourne in yakovs bombila and together they returned to lorraines apartment it was just past am his meet with maslov wasnt until noon he needed a shower a shave and some rest lorraine was kind enough to provide the necessities for all three she gave bourne a set of towels a disposable razor and said if he gave her his clothes shed wash and dry them for him in the bathroom bourne stripped then opened the door enough to hand the dirty clothes to lorraine after i put these in the wash gala and i are going out to get food can we bring you anything bourne thanked her whatever youre having will be fine he closed the door crossed to the shower turned it on full force opening the medicine cabinet he took out rubbing alcohol a gauze pad surgical tape and antibiotic cream then he went back to the toilet put the seat cover down and cleaned his abraded heel it had taken a lot of abuse and was red and raw looking squeezing the cream onto the gauze he placed it over the wound and taped it up then he took his cell phone off the edge of the sink where hed placed it when undressing and dialed the number boris karpov had given him would you mind going without me gala said as lorraine reached into the hall closet for her fur coat all of a sudden im not feeling well lorraine walked back to her what is it i dont know gala sank onto the white leather sofa im kind of dizzy lorraine took hold of the back of her head bend over put your head between your knees gala did as she was told lorraine crossed to the sideboard took out a bottle of vodka and poured some into a glass here take a drink itll settle you gala came up as gingerly as a drunk walks she took the vodka threw it down her throat so fast she almost choked but then the fire hit her stomach and the warmth began to spread through her okay lorraine asked better all right im going to buy you some hot borscht you need to get some nourishment into you she drew on her coat why dont you lie down once again gala did as she was told but after her friend left she rose shed never found the sofa comfortable making sure of her balance she went down the hall she needed to crash on a proper bed as she was passing the bathroom she heard a sound like talking but bourne was in there by himself curious she moved closer then put her ear to the door she could hear the rushing of the shower more clearly but also bournes voice he must be on his cell phone she heard him say medvedev did what he was talking politics to whoever was on the other end of the line she was about to take her ear away from the door when she heard bourne say it was bad luck with tarkanian no no i killed him i had to i had no other choice gala pulled away as if shed touched her ear to a hot iron for some time she stood staring at the closed door then she backed away bourne had killed mischa my god she said to herself how could he and then thinking of arkadin mischas best friend my god twentysix dimitri maslov had the eyes of a rattlesnake the shoulders of a wrestler and the hands of a bricklayer he was however dressed like a banker when bourne met him inside a warehouse that could have doubled as an aircraft hanger he was wearing a chalkstriped threepiece savile row suit an egyptian cotton shirt and a conservative tie his powerful legs ended in curiously dainty feet as if theyd been grafted on from another far smaller body dont bother telling me your name he said as he accepted the ten thousand swiss francs as i always assume theyre fake the warehouse was one among many in this sootladen industrial area on the outskirts of moscow and therefore anonymous like its neighbors it had a front area filled with boxes and crates on neat stacks of wooden pallets piled almost to the ceiling parked in one corner was a forklift next to it was a bulletin board on which had been tacked overlapping layers of flyers notices invoices advertisements and announcements bare lightbulbs at the ends of metal flex burned like miniature suns after bourne had been expertly patted down for weapons and wires hed been escorted through a door to a tiled bathroom that stank of urine and stale sweat it contained a trough with water running sluggishly along its bottom and a line of stalls he was taken to the last stall inside instead of a toilet was a door his escort of two burly russians took him through to what appeared to be a warren of offices one of which was raised on a steel platform bolted onto the far wall they climbed the staircase to the door at which point his escort had left him presumably to go stand guard maslov was seated behind an ornate desk he was flanked on either side by two more men interchangeable with the pair outside in one corner sat a man with a scar beneath one eye who would have been unprepossessing save for the flamboyant hawaiian print shirt he wore bourne was aware of another presence behind him his back against the open door i understand you wanted to see me maslovs rattlesnake eyes shone yellow in the harsh light then he gestured holding out his left arm his hand extended palmup as if he were shoveling dirt away from him however theres someone who insists on seeing you in a blur the figure behind bourne hurled himself forward bourne turned in a half crouch to see the man whod attacked him at tarkanians apartment he came at bourne with a knife extended too late to deflect it bourne sidestepped the thrust grabbed the mans right wrist with his left hand using his own momentum to pull him forward so that his face met bournes raised elbow flushon he went down bourne stepped on the wrist with his shoe until the man let go of the knife which bourne took up in his hand at once the two burly bodyguards drew down on him pointing their glocks ignoring them bourne held the knife in his right palm so the hilt pointed away from him he extended his arm across the desk to maslov maslov stared instead at the man in the hawaiian print shirt who rose took the knife from bournes palm i am dimitri maslov he said to bourne the big man in the bankers suit rose nodded deferentially to maslov who handed him the knife as he sat down behind the desk take evsei out and get him a new nose maslov said to no one in particular the big man in the bankers suit pulled the dazed evsei up dragged him out of the office close the door maslov said again to no one in particular nevertheless one of the burly russian bodyguards crossed to the door closed it turned and put his back against it he shook out a cigarette lit it take a seat maslov said sliding open a drawer he took out a mauser laid it on the desk within easy reach only then did his eyes slide up to engage bournes again my dear friend vanya tells me that you work for boris karpov he says you claim to have information i can use against certain parties who are trying to muscle in on my territory his fingers tapped the grips of the mauser however i would be inexcusably naive to believe that you were willing to part with this information without a price so lets have it what do you want i want to know what your connection is with the black legion mine i have none but youve heard of them of course ive heard of them maslov frowned where is this going you posted your man evsei in mikhail tarkanians apartment tarkanian was a member of the black legion maslov held up a hand where the hell did you hear that he was working against peoplefriends of mine maslov shrugged that might be soi have no knowledge of it one way or another but one thing i can tell you is that tarkanian wasnt black legion then why was evsei there ah now we get to the root of the matter maslovs thumb rubbed against his forefinger and middle finger in the universal gesture show me the quid pro quo to coopt what jerry maguire says his mouth grinned but his yellow eyes remained as remote and malevolent as ever though to tell you the truth im doubting very much theres any money at all i mean to say why would the federal antinarcotics agency want to help me its antifuckingintuitive bourne finally pulled over a chair sat down his mind was rerunning the long conversation hed had with boris at lorraines apartment during which karpov had briefed him on the current political climate in moscow this has nothing to do with narcotics and everything to do with politics the federal antinarcotics agency is controlled by cherkesov whos in the midst of a parallel war to yoursthe silovik wars bourne said it seems as if the president has already picked his successor that pisspot mogilovich maslov nodded yeah so what cherkesov doesnt like him and heres why mogilovich used to work for the president in the st petersburg city administration way back when the president put him in charge of the legal department of vm pulp and paper mogilovich promptly engineered vms dominance to become russias largest and most lucrative pulp and timber company now one of americas largest paper companies is buying fifty percent of vm for hundreds of millions of dollars during bournes discourse maslov had taken out a penknife was busy paring grime from under his manicured nails he did everything but yawn all this is part of the public record whats it to me what isnt known is that mogilovich cut himself a deal giving him a sizable portion of vms shares when the company was privatized through rab bank at the time questions were raised about mogilovichs involvement with rab bank but they magically went away last year vm bought back the twentyfive percent stake that rab had taken to ensure the privatization would go through without a hitch the deal was blessed by the kremlin meaning the president maslov sat up straight put away the penknife right bourne said which means that mogilovich stands to make a kings ransom through the american buyin by means the president wouldnt want made public who knows what the presidents own involvement is in the deal bourne nodded wait a minute maslov said last week a rab bank officer was found tied up tortured and asphyxiated in his dacha garage i remember because the general prosecutors office claimed hed committed suicide we all got a good laugh out of that one he just happened to be the head of rabs loan division to the timber industry the man with the smoking gun that could ruin mogilovich and by extension the president maslov said my boss tells me this man had access to the smoking gun but he never actually had it in his possession his assistant absconded with it days before his assassination and now cant be found bourne hitched his chair forward when you find him for us and hand over the papers incriminating mogilovich my boss is prepared to end the war between you and the azeri once and for all in your favor and how the fuck is he going to do that bourne opened his cell phone played back the mp file boris had sent to him it was a conversation between the kingpin of the azeri and one of his lieutenants ordering the hit on the rab bank executive it was just like the russian in boris to hold on to the evidence for leverage rather than go after the azeri kingpin right away a broad grin broke out across maslovs face fuck he said now were talking after a time arkadin became aware that devra was standing over him without looking at her he held up the cylinder hed taken from heinrich come out of the surf she said but when arkadin didnt make a move she sat down on a crest of sand behind him heinrich was stretched out on his back as if he were a sunbather whod fallen asleep the water had washed away all the blood after a time arkadin moved back first onto the dark sand then up behind the waterline to where devra sat her legs drawn up chin on her knees that was when she noticed that his left foot was missing three toes my god she said what happened to your foot it was the foot that had undone marlene the three missing toes on arkadins left foot marlene made the mistake of asking what had happened an accident arkadin said with a practiced smoothness during my first term in prison a stamping machine came apart and the main cylinder fell on my foot the toes were crushed nothing more than pulp they had to be amputated it was a lie this story a fanciful tale arkadin appropriated from a real incident that took place during his first stint in prison that much at least was the truth a man stole a pack of cigarettes from under arkadins bunk this man worked the stamping machine arkadin tampered with the machine so that when the man started it up the next morning the main cylinder dropped on him the result wasnt pretty you could hear his screams clear across the compound in the end theyd had to take his right leg off at the knee from that day forward he was on his guard with marlene she was attracted to him of this he was quite certain shed slipped from her objective pedestal from the job icoupov had given her he didnt blame icoupov he wanted to tell icoupov again that he wouldnt harm him but he knew icoupov wouldnt believe him why should he he had enough evidence to the contrary to make him suitably nervous and yet arkadin sensed that icoupov would never turn his back on him icoupov would never renege on his pledge to take arkadin in nevertheless something had to be done about marlene it wasnt simply that shed seen his left foot icoupov had seen it as well arkadin knew she suspected the maimed foot was connected with his horrendous nightmares that it was part of something he couldnt tell her even the story arkadin told her did not fully satisfy her it might have with someone else but not marlene she hadnt exaggerated when shed told him that she possessed an uncanny ability to sense what her clients were feeling and to find a way to help them the problem was that she couldnt help arkadin no one could no one was allowed to know what hed experienced it was unthinkable tell me about your mother and father marlene said and dont repeat the pabulum you fed the shrink who was here before me they were out on lake lugano it was a mild summers day marlene was in a twopiece bathing suit red with large pink polka dots she wore pink rubber slippers a visor shaded her face from the sun their small motorboat lay to its anchor dropped small swells rocked them now and again as pleasure boats went to and fro across the crystal blue water the small village of campione ditalia rose up the hillside like the frosted tiers of a wedding cake arkadin looked hard at her it annoyed him that he didnt intimidate her he intimidated most people it was how he got along after his parents were gone what you dont think my mother died badly im interested in your mother before she died marlene said airily what was she like actually she was just like you marlene gave him a basilisk stare seriously he said my mother was tough as a fistful of nails she knew how to stand up to my father marlene seized on this opening why did she have to do that was your father abusive arkadin shrugged no more than any other father i suppose when he was frustrated at work he took it out on her and you find that normal i dont know what the word normal means but youre used to abuse arent you isnt that called leading the witness counselor what did your father do he was consiglierithe counselorto the kazanskaya the family of the moscow grupperovka that controls drug trafficking and the sale of foreign cars in the city and surrounding areas hed been nothing of the sort arkadins father had been an ironworker dirtpoor desperate and drunk as shit twenty hours a day just like everyone else in nizhny tagil so abuse and violence came naturally to him he wasnt on the streets arkadin said continuing his lie she gave him a thin smile all right where do you think your bouts of violence come from if i told you id have to kill you marlene laughed come on leonid danilovich dont you want to be of use to mr icoupov of course i do i want him to trust me then tell me arkadin sat for a time the sun felt good on his forearms the heat seemed to draw his skin tight over his muscles making them bulge he felt the beating of his heart as if it were music for just a moment he felt free of his burden as if it belonged to someone else a tormented character in a russian novel perhaps then his past came rushing back like a fist in his gut and he almost vomited very slowly very deliberately he unlaced his sneakers took them off he peeled off his white athletic socks and there was his left foot with its two toes and three miniature stumps knotty as pink as the polka dots on marlenes bathing suit heres what happened he said when i was fourteen years old my mother took a frying pan to the back of my fathers head hed just come home stone drunk reeking of another woman he was sprawled facedown on their bed snoring peacefully when whack she took a heavy castiron skillet from its peg on the kitchen wall and without a word hit him ten times in the same spot you can imagine what his skull looked like when she was done marlene sat back she seemed to have trouble breathing at length she said this isnt another one of your bullshit stories is it no arkadin said its not and where were you where dyou think i was home i saw the whole thing marlene put a hand to her mouth my god having expelled this ball of poison arkadin felt an exhilarating sense of freedom but he knew what had to come next then what happened she said when she had recovered her equilibrium arkadin let out a long breath i gagged her tied her hands behind her and threw her into the closet in my room and i walked out of the apartment and never went back how there was a look of genuine horror on her face how could you do such a thing i disgust you now dont i he said this not with anger but with a certain resignation why wouldnt she be disgusted by him if only she knew the whole truth tell me in more detail about the accident in prison arkadin knew at once that she was trying to find inconsistencies in his story this was a classic interrogators technique she would never know the truth lets go swimming he said abruptly he shed his shorts and tshirt marlene shook her head im not in the mood you go if oh come on he pushed her overboard stood up dived in after her he found her under the water kicking her legs to bring herself to the surface he wrapped his thighs around her neck locked his ankles tightening his grip on her he rose to the surface held on to the boat swung water out of his eyes as she struggled below him boats thrummed past he waved to two young girls their long hair flying behind them like horses manes he wanted to hum a love song but all he could think of was the theme to bridge on the river kwai after a time marlene stopped struggling he felt her weight below him swaying gently in the swells he didnt want to really he didnt but unbidden the image of his old apartment resurrected itself in his minds eye it was a slum the filthy crumbling sovietera piece of shit building teeming with vermin their poverty didnt stop the older man from banging other women when one of them became pregnant she decided to have the baby he was all for it he told her hed help her in any way he could but what he really wanted was the child his barren wife could never give him when leonid was born he ripped the baby from the girls arms brought leonid to his wife to raise this is the child i always wanted but you couldnt give me he told her she raised arkadin dutifully without complaint because where could a barren woman go in nizhny tagil but when her husband wasnt home she locked the boy in the closet of his room for hours at a time a blind rage gripped her and wouldnt let her go she despised this result of her husbands seed and she felt compelled to punish leonid because she couldnt punish his father it was during one of these long punishments that arkadin woke to awful pain in his left foot he wasnt alone in the closet half a dozen rats large as his fathers shoe scuttled back and forth squealing teeth gnashing he managed to kill them but not before they finished what theyd started they ate three of his toes twentyseven it all started with pyotr zilber maslov said or rather his younger brother aleksei aleksei was a wise guy he tried to muscle in on one of my sources for foreign cars a lot of people were killed including some of my men and my source for that i had him killed dimitri maslov and bourne were sitting in a glassedin greenhouse built on the roof of the warehouse where maslov had his office they were surrounded by a lush profusion of tropical flowers speckled orchids brilliant carmine anthurium birdsofparadise white ginger heliconia the air was perfumed with the scents of the pink plumeria and white jasmine it was so warm and humid maslov looked right at home in his brighthued shortsleeved shirt bourne had rolled up his sleeves there was a table with a bottle of vodka and two glasses theyd already had their first drink zilber pulled strings had my man borya maks sent to high security prison colony in nizhny tagil youve heard of it bourne nodded conklin had mentioned the prison several times then you know its no picnic in there maslov leaned forward refilled their glasses handed one to bourne took the other himself despite that zilber wasnt satisfied he hired someone very very good to infiltrate the prison and kill maks drinking vodka surrounded by a riot of color he appeared totally at his ease only one person could accomplish that and get out alive leonid danilovich arkadin the vodka had done bourne a world of good returning both warmth and strength to his overtaxed body there was still a smear of blood on the point of one cheek dried now but maslov had neither looked at it nor commented on it tell me about arkadin maslov made an animal sound in the back of his throat all you need to know is that the sonovabitch killed pyotr zilber god knows why then he disappeared off the face of the earth i had evsei stake out mischa tarkanians apartment i was hoping arkadin would come back there instead you showed up whats zilbers death to you bourne said from what youve told me there was no love lost between the two of you hey i dont have to like a person to do business with him if you wanted to do business with zilber you shouldnt have had his brother murdered i have my reputation to uphold maslov sipped his vodka pyotr knew what kinds of shit his brother was into but did he stop him anyway the hit was strictly business pyotr took it far too personally turns out he was almost as reckless as his brother there it was again bourne thought the slurs against pyotr zilber what then was he doing running a secret network what was your business with him i coveted pyotrs network because of the war with the azeri ive been looking for a new more secure method to move our drugs zilbers network was the perfect solution bourne put aside his vodka why would zilber want anything to do with the kazanskaya there youve given away the extent of your ignorance maslov eyed him curiously zilber would have wanted money to fund his organization you mean his network i mean precisely what i say maslov looked hard and long at bourne pyotr zilber was a member of the black legion like a sailor who senses an onrushing storm devra stopped herself from asking arkadin again about his maimed foot there was about him at this moment the same slight tremor of intent of a bowstring pulled back to its maximum she transferred her gaze from his left foot to the corpse of heinrich taking in sunlight that would no longer do him any good she felt the danger beside her and she thought of her dream her pursuit of the unknown creature her sense of utter desolation the building of her fear to an unbearable level youve got the package now she said is it over for a moment arkadin said nothing and she wondered whether shed left her deflecting question too late whether he would now turn on her because she had asked about what had happened to that damn foot the red rage had gripped arkadin shaking him until his teeth rattled in his skull it would have been so easy to turn to her smile and break her neck so little effort nothing to it but something stopped him something cooled him it was his own will hedidnotwanttokillher not yet at least he liked sitting here on the beach with her and there were so few things he liked i still have to shut down the rest of the network he said at length not that i think it actually matters at this point christ it was put together by an outofcontrol commander too young to have learned caution peopled by drug addicts inveterate gamblers weaklings and those of no faith its a wonder the network functioned at all surely it would have imploded on its own sooner or later but what did he know he was simply a soldier engaged in an invisible war his was not to reason why pulling out his cell phone he dialed icoupovs number where are you his boss said theres a lot of background noise im at the beach arkadin said what the beach kilyos its a suburb of istanbul arkadin said i hope youre having a good time while were in a semipanic arkadins demeanor changed instantly what happened the bastard had harun killed thats what happened he knew how much harun iliev meant to icoupov like mischa meant to him a rock someone to keep him from drifting into the abyss of his imagination on a happier note he said i have the package icoupov gave a short intake of breath finally open it he commanded tell me if the document is inside arkadin did as he was told breaking the wax seal prying open the plastic disk that capped off the cylinder inside tightly rolled sheets of pale blue architectural paper unfurled like sails there were four in all quickly he scanned them sweat broke out at his hairline im looking at a set of architectural plans its the target of the attack the plans arkadin said are for the empire state building in new york city book three twentyeight it took ten minutes for bourne to get a decent connection to professor specter then another five for his people to rouse him out of bed it was am in washington maslov had gone downstairs to see to business leaving bourne alone in the greenhouse to make his calls bourne used the time to consider what maslov had told him if it was true that pyotr was a member of the black legion two possibilities arose one was that pyotr was running his own operation under the professors nose that was ominous enough the second possibility was far worse namely that the professor was himself a member but then why had he been attacked by the black legion bourne himself had seen the tattoo on the arm of the gunman who had accosted specter beat him and hustled him off the street at that moment bourne heard specters voice in his ear jason he said clearly out of breath whats happened bourne brought him up to date ending with the information that pyotr was a member of the black legion for a long moment there was silence on the line professor are you all right specter cleared his throat im fine but he didnt sound fine and as the silence stretched on bourne strained to catch a hint of his mentors emotional state look im sorry about your man baronov the killer wasnt black legion he was an nsa agent sent to murder me i appreciate your candor specter said and while i grieve for baronov he knew the risks like you he went into this war with his eyes open there was another silence more awkward than the last one finally specter said jason im afraid ive withheld some rather vital information from you pyotr zilber was my son your son by why didnt you tell me that in the first place fear the professor said ive kept his real identity a secret for so many years its become habit i needed to protect pyotr from his enemiesmy enemiesthe enemies who were responsible for murdering my wife i felt the best way to do that was to change his name so in the summer of his sixth year aleksei specter drowned tragically and pyotr zilber came into being i left him with friends left everything and came to america to washington to begin my life anew without him it was the most difficult thing ive ever had to do but how can a father renounce his son when he cant forget him bourne knew precisely what he meant hed been about to tell the professor what hed learned about pyotr and his cast of misfits and fuckups but this didnt seem the right time to bring up more bad news so you helped him bourne guessed secretly ever so secretly specter said i couldnt afford to have anyone link us together i couldnt allow anyone to know my son was still alive it was the least i could do for him jason i hadnt seen him since he was six years old hearing the naked anguish in specters voice bourne waited a moment what happened he did a very stupid thing he decided to take on the black legion himself he spent years infiltrating the organization he discovered that the black legion was planning a major attack inside america then he spent months worming his way closer to the project and finally he had the key to bringing them down he stole the plans to their target since we had to be careful about direct communication i suggested he use his network for the purpose of getting me information on the black legions movements this is how he meant to send me the plans why didnt he simply photograph them and send them to you digitally he tried that but it didnt work the paper the plans are printed on is coated with a substance that makes whatevers printed on it impossible to copy by any means he had to get me the plans themselves surely he told you the nature of the plans bourne said he was going to the professor said but before he could he was caught taken to icoupovs villa where arkadin tortured and killed him bourne considered the implications in light of the new information the professor had given him do you think he told them he was your son ive been concerned about that ever since the kidnapping attempt im afraid icoupov might know our blood connection youd better take precautions professor i plan to do just that jason ill be leaving the dc area in just over an hour meanwhile my people have been hard at work ive gotten word that icoupov sent arkadin to fetch the plans from pyotrs network hes leaving a trail of bodies in his wake where is he now bourne said istanbul but that wont do you any good specter said because by the time you get there hell surely have gone its now more imperative than ever that you find him though because we have confirmed that hes taken the plans from the courier he murdered in istanbul and time is running out before the attack this courier came from where munich the professor said he was the last link in the chain before the plans were to be delivered to me from what you tell me its clear that arkadins mission is twofold bourne said first to get the plans second to permanently shut down pyotrs network by killing its members one by one dieter heinrich the courier in munich is the only one remaining alive who was heinrich supposed to deliver the plans to in munich egon kirsch kirsch is my man specter said ive already alerted him to the danger bourne thought a moment does arkadin know what kirsch looks like no and neither does the young woman with him her name is devra she was one of pyotrs people but now shes helping arkadin kill her former colleagues why would she do that bourne asked i havent the faintest idea the professor said she was something of a cipher in sevastopol where she fell in with arkadinno friends no family an orphan of the state so far my people havent turned up anything useful in any event im going to pull kirsch out of munich bournes mind was working overtime dont do that get him out of his apartment to a safe place somewhere in the city ill take the first flight out to munich before i leave here i want all the information on kirschs life you can get mewhere he was born raised his friends family schooling every detail he can give you ill study it on the flight over then meet with him jason i dont like the way this conversation is headed specter said i suspect i know what youre planning if im right youre going to take kirschs place i forbid it i wont let you set yourself up as a target for arkadin its far too dangerous its a little late for second thoughts professor bourne said its vital i get these plans you said so yourself you do your part and ill do mine fair enough specter said after a moments hesitation but my part includes activating a friend of mine who operates out of munich bourne didnt like the sound of that what do you mean youve already made it clear that you work alone jason but this man jens is someone you want at your back hes intimately familiar with wet work a professional killer for hire bourne thought thank you professor but no this isnt a request jason specters voice held a stern warning not to cross him jens is my condition for you taking kirschs place i wont allow you to walk into this bear trap on your own my decision is final dimitri maslov and boris karpov embraced like old friends while bourne stood on silent when it came to russian politics nothing should surprise him but it was nevertheless astonishing to see a highranking colonel in the federal antinarcotics agency cordially greeting the kingpin of the kazanskaya one of the two most notorious narcotics grupperovka this bizarre reunion took place in bardak near the leninsky prospekt the club had opened for maslov hardly surprising since he owned it bardak meant both brothel and chaos in current russian slang bardak was neither though it did sport a prominent strippers stage complete with poles and a rather unusual leather swing that looked like a horses harness an open audition for pole dancers was in full swing the lineup of eyepoppinglybuilt young blond women snaked around the four walls of the club which was painted in glossy black enamel massive sound speakers lines of vodka bottles on mirrored shelves and vintage mirror balls were the major accoutrements after the two men were finished slapping each other on the back maslov led them across the cavernous room through a door and down a woodpaneled hallway mixed in with the scent of the cedar was the unmistakable waft of chlorine it smelled like a health club and with good reason they went through a translucent pebbled glass door into a locker room the saunas just over there maslov pointed we meet inside in five minutes before maslov would continue the conversation with bourne he insisted on meeting with boris karpov bourne had thought such a conference unlikely but when he called boris his friend readily agreed maslov had given bourne the name of bardak nothing more karpov had said only i know it ill be there in ninety minutes now stripped down to the buff white turkish towels around their loins the three men reconvened in the steamy confines of the sauna the small room was lined like the hallway in cedar paneling slatted wooden benches ran around three walls in one corner was a heap of heated stones above which hung a cord when maslov entered he pulled the cord showering the rocks with water which produced clouds of steam that swirled up to the ceiling and down again engulfing the men as they sat on the benches the colonel has assured me that he will take care of my situation if i take care of his maslov said perhaps i should say that i will take care of cherkesovs problem there was a twinkle in his eye as he said this stripped of his outsize hawaiian shirt he was a small wiry man with ropy muscles and not an ounce of fat on him he wore no gold chains around his neck or diamond rings on his fingers his tattoos were his jewelry they covered his entire torso but these were not the crude and often blurred prison tattoos found on so many of his kind they were among the most elaborate designs bourne had ever seen asian dragons breathing fire coiling their tails spreading their wings grasping with claws outstretched four years ago i spent six months in tokyo maslov said its the only place to get tattoos but thats just my opinion boris rocked with laughter so thats where you were you bastard i scoured all of russia for your skinny butt in the ginza maslov said i hoisted quite a few saki martinis to you and your law enforcement minions i knew youd never find me he made a sweeping gesture but that bit of unpleasantness is behind us the real perpetrator confessed to the murders i was suspected of committing now we find ourselves in our own private glasnost i want to know more about leonid danilovich arkadin bourne said maslov spread his hands once he was one of us then something happened to him i dont know what he broke away from the grupperovka people dont do that and survive for long but arkadin is in a class by himself no one dares to touch him he wraps himself in his reputation for murder and ruthlessness this is a manlet me tell youwho has no heart yes dimitri you might say to me but isnt that true of most of your kind to this i answer yes but arkadin is also without a soul this is where he parts company with the others there is no one else like him the colonel can back me up on this boris nodded sagely even cherkesov fears him our president as well i personally dont know anyone in either fsb or fsb whod be willing to take him on let alone survive hes like a great white shark the murderer of killers arent you being a bit melodramatic maslov sat forward elbows in knees listen my friend whatever the hell your real name is this man arkadin was born in nizhny tagil do you know it no let me tell you this fucking excuse of a city east of here in the southern ural mountains is hell on earth its filled with smokestacks belching sulfurous fumes from its ironworks poor is not even a word you can apply to the residents who swill homemade vodka thats almost pure alcohol and pass out wherever they happen to land the police such as they are are as brutal and sadistic as the citizens as a gulag is ringed by guard towers nizhny tagil is surrounded by highsecurity prisons since the prison inmates are released without even train fare they settle in the town you an american cannot imagine the brutality the callousness of the residents of this human sewer no one but the worst of the crimsas the criminals are calleddares be on the streets after pm maslov wiped the sweat off his cheeks with the back of his hand this is the place where arkadin was born and raised it was from this cesspit that he made a name for himself by kicking people out of their apartments in old sovietera projects and selling them to criminals with a bit of money stolen from regular citizens but whatever happened to arkadin in nizhny tagil in his youthand i dont profess to know what that might behas followed him like a ghoul believe me when i tell you that youve never met a man like him youre better off not i know where he is bourne said im going after him christ maslov shook his head you must have a mighty fucking large death wish you dont know my friend here boris said maslov eyed bourne i know him as much as i want to i think he stood up the stench of death is already on him twentynine the man who stepped off the plane in munich airport who dutifully went through customs and immigration with all the other passengers from the many flights arriving at more or less the same time looked nothing like semion icoupov his name was franz richter his passport proclaimed him as a german national but underneath all the makeup and prosthetics he was semion icoupov just the same nevertheless icoupov felt naked exposed to the prying eyes of his enemies whom he knew were everywhere they waited patiently for him like his own death ever since boarding the plane hed been haunted by a sense of impending doom he hadnt been able to shake it on the flight he couldnt shake it now he felt as if hed come to munich to stare his own death in the face his driver was waiting for him at baggage claim the man heavily armed took the one piece of luggage icoupov pointed out to him off the chrome carousel carried it as he led icoupov through the crowded concourse and out into the dull munich evening gray as morning it wasnt as cold as it had been in switzerland but it was wetter the chill as penetrating as icoupovs foreboding it wasnt fear he felt so much as sorrow sorrow that he might not see this battle finished that his hated nemesis would win that old grudges would not be settled that his fathers memory would remain sullied that his murder would remain unavenged to be sure there had been attrition on both sides he thought as he settled into the backseat of the dovegray mercedes the endgame had begun and already he sensed the checkmate waiting for him not far off it was difficult but necessary for him to admit that he had been outmaneuvered at every turn perhaps he wasnt up to carrying the vision his father had for the eastern brotherhood perhaps the corruption and inversion of ideals had gone too far whatever the case he had lost a great deal of ground to his enemy and icoupov had come to the bleak conclusion that he had only one chance to win his chance rested with arkadin the plans for the black legions attack on new york citys empire state building and jason bourne for he realized now that his nemesis was too strong without the americans help he feared his cause was lost he stared out the smokedglass window at the looming skyline of munich it gave him a shiver to be back here where it all began where the eastern brotherhood was saved from allied war trials following the collapse of the third reich at that time his fatherfarid icoupovand ibrahim sever were jointly in charge of what was left of the eastern legions up until the nazi surrender farid the intellectual ran the intelligence network that infiltrated the soviet union while ibrahim the warrior commanded the legions that fought on the eastern front six months before the reichs capitulation the two men met outside berlin they saw the end even if the lunatic nazi hierarchy was oblivious so they laid plans for how to ensure their people would survive the wars aftermath the first thing ibrahim did was to move his soldiers out of harms way by that juncture the nazi bureaucratic infrastructure had been decimated by allied bombing so it was not difficult to redeploy his people into belgium denmark greece and italy where they were safe from the reflexive violence of the first wave of invading allies because farid and ibrahim despised stalin because they were witness to the massive scale of the atrocities ordered by him they were in a unique position to understand the allied fear of communism farid argued persuasively that soldiers would be of no use to the allies but an intelligence network already inside the soviet union would be invaluable he keenly understood how antithetical communism was to capitalism that the americans and the soviets were allies out of necessity he felt it inevitable that after the war was over these uncomfortable allies would become bitter enemies ibrahim had no recourse but to agree with his friends thesis and indeed this was how it turned out at every step farid and ibrahim brilliantly outmaneuvered the postwar german agencies in keeping control of their people as a result the eastern legions not only survived but in fact prospered in postwar germany farid however fairly quickly uncovered a pattern of violence that made him suspicious german officials who disagreed with his eloquent arguments for continued control were replaced by ones who did that was odd enough but then he discovered that those original officials no longer existed to a one they had dropped out of sight never to be seen or heard from again farid bypassed the weakling german bureaucracy and went straight to the americans with his concerns but he was unprepared for their response which was one big shrug no one it seemed cared the least bit about disappeared germans they were all too busy defending their slice of berlin to be bothered it was about this time that ibrahim came to him with the idea of moving the eastern legions headquarters to munich out of the way of the increasing antagonism between the americans and the soviets fed up with the americans disinterest farid readily agreed they found postwar munich a bombedout wreck seething with immigrant muslims ibrahim wasted no time in recruiting these people into the organization which by this time had changed its name to the eastern brotherhood for his part farid found the american intelligence community in munich far more receptive to his arguments indeed they were desperate for him and his network emboldened he told them that if they wanted to make a formal arrangement with the eastern brotherhood for intelligence from behind the iron curtain they had to look into the disappearances of the list of former german officials he handed them it took three months but at the end of that time he was asked to appear before a man named brian folks whose official title was american attachй of somethingorother in fact he was oss chief of station in munich the man who received the intel farids network provided him from inside the soviet union folks told him that the unofficial investigation farid asked him to undertake had now been completed without another word he handed over a slim file sat without comment as farid read it the folder contained the photos of each of the german officials on the list farid had provided following each photo was a sheet detailing the findings all the men were dead all had been shot in the back of the head farid read through this meager material with an increasing sense of frustration then he looked up at folks and said is this it is this all there is folks watched farid from behind steelrimmed glasses its all that appears in the report he said but those arent all the findings he held out his hand took the file back then he turned put the sheets one by one through a shredder when he was finished he threw the empty folder into the wastebasket the contents of which were burned every evening at precisely pm following this solemn ritual he placed his hands on his desk said to farid the finding of most interest to you is this evidence collected indicates conclusively that the murders of these men were committed by ibrahim sever tyrone shifted on the bare concrete floor it was so slippery with his own fluids that one knee went out from under him splaying him so painfully that he cried out of course no one came to help him he was alone in the interrogation cell in the basement of the nsa safe house deep in the virginia countryside he had to quite literally locate himself in his mind had to trace the route he and soraya had taken when theyd driven to the safe house when three days ago ten hours what the rendition hed been subjected to had erased any sense of time the hood over his head threatened to erase his sense of place so that periodically he had to say to himself im in an interrogation cell in the basement of the nsa safe house inand here he would recite the name of the last town he and soraya had passed when that was the problem really his sense of disorientation was so complete there were periods when he couldnt distinguish up from down worse those periods were becoming both longer and more frequent the pain was hardly an issue because he was used to pain though never this intense or prolonged it was the disorientation that was worming its way into his brain like a surgeons drill it seemed that with each bout he was losing more of himself as if he were made up of grains of salt or sand trickling away from him and what would happen when they were all gone what would he become he thought of dj tank and the rest of his former crew he thought of deron of kiki but none of those tricks worked theyd slip away like mist and hed be left to the void into which he was increasingly sure hed disappear then he thought of soraya conjured her piece by piece as if he were a sculptor molding her out of a lump of clay and he found that as his mind lovingly recreated each minute bit of her he miraculously stayed intact as he struggled back to a position that was tolerably painful he heard a metallic scrape and his head came up before anything else could transpire the scents of freshly cooked eggs and bacon came to him making his mouth water hed been fed nothing but plain oatmeal since he was brought here and at inconsistent timessometimes one meal right after the otherin order to keep his disorientation absolute he heard the scuff of leather solestwo men his ears told him then general kendalls voice saying imperiously set the food on the table willard right there thank you that will be all one set of shoe soles clacked across the floor the sound of the door closing silence then the screech of a chair being hitched across the concrete kendall was sitting down tyrone surmised what have we here kendall said clearly to himself ah my favorite eggs over easy bacon buttered grits hot biscuits and gravy the sound of cutlery being taken up you like grits tyrone you like biscuits and gravy tyrone wasnt too far gone to be incensed ony ting i like betta is watermelon sah thats a damn fine imitation of one of your brethren tyrone he was obviously talking while eating this is damn fine chow would you like some tyrones stomach growled so loudly he was sure kendall heard it all you gotta do is tell me everything you and the moore woman were up to i dont rat anyone out tyrone said bitterly um the sounds of kendall swallowing thats what they all say in the beginning he chewed some more you do know this is just the beginning dont you tyrone sure you do just like you know the moore woman isnt going to save you shes going to hang you out to dry sure as im sitting here eating the most mouthwatering biscuits i ever had you know why because lavalle gave her a choice you or jason bourne you know her history with bourne she might claim she didnt fuck him but you and i know better she never slept with him tyrone said before he could stop himself sure she told you that munch munch munch went kendalls jaws shredding the crisp bacon whatd you expect her to say the sonovabitch was playing mind games with him tyrone knew that for a fact trouble was he wasnt lying tyrone knew how soraya felt about bourneit was written all over her face every time she saw him or his name came up though shed said otherwise the question kendall had just raised had gnawed at him like an addict at a candy bar it was difficult not to envy bourne with his freedom his encyclopedic knowledge his friendship as equals with deron but all these things tyrone dealt with in his own way it was sorayas love for bourne that was so hard to live with he heard the scrape of chair legs and then felt the presence of kendall as he squatted down beside him it was astonishing tyrone thought how much heat another human being gave off i have to say tyrone you really have taken a beating kendall said i think you deserve a reward for how well youve held up shit weve had suspects in here who were crying for their mamas after twentyfour hours not you though the quick clickclack of a metal utensil against a china plate how about some eggs and bacon man this was some big plate of food i surely cant finish it myself so come on join me as the hood was raised high enough to expose his mouth tyrone was conflicted his mind told him to refuse the offer but his severely shrunken stomach yearned for real food he could smell the rich flavors of bacon and eggs felt the food warm as a kiss against his lips hey man whatre you waiting for fuck it tyrone said to himself the tastes of the food exploded inside his mouth he wanted to moan in pleasure he wolfed down the first few forkfuls fed to him then forced himself to chew slowly and methodically extracting every bit of flavor from the hickorysmoked meat and the rich yolk tastes good kendall said he must have regained his feet because his voice was above tyrone when he said tastes real good doesnt it tyrone was about to nod his assent when pain exploded in the pit of his stomach he grunted when it came again hed been kicked before so he knew what kendall was doing the third kick landed he tried to hold on to his food but the involuntary reaction had begun a moment later he vomited up all the delicious food kendall had fed him the munich courier is the last one in the network devra said his name is egon kirsch but thats all i know i never met him no one i know did pyotr made sure that link was completely compartmentalized so far as i know kirsch dealt directly with pyotr and no one else who does kirsch deliver his intel to arkadin said whos at the other end of the network i have no idea he believed her did heinrich and kirsch have a particular meeting place she shook her head on the lufthansa flight from istanbul to munich he sat shouldertoshoulder with her and wondered what the hell he was doing shed given him all the information he was going to get from her he had the plans he was on the last lap of his mission all that remained was to deliver the plans to icoupov find kirsch and persuade him to lead arkadin back to the end of the network childs play which begged the question of what to do with devra hed already made up his mind to kill her as hed killed marlene and so many others it was a fait accompli a fixed point detailed in his mind a diamond that only needed polishing to sparkle into life sitting in the jetliner he heard the quick report from the gun leaves falling over her dead body covering her like a blanket devra who was seated on the aisle got up made her way back to the lavatories arkadin closed his eyes and was back in the sooty stench of nizhny tagil men with filed teeth and blurry tattoos women old before their time bent swigging homemade vodka from plastic soda bottles girls with sunken eyes bereft of a future and then the mass grave his eyes popped open he was having difficulty breathing heaving himself to his feet he followed devra she was the last of the passengers waiting the accordion door on the right opened an older women bustled out squeezed by devra then arkadin devra went into the lavatory closed the door and locked it the occupied sign came on arkadin walked to the door stood in front of it for a moment then he knocked on it gently just a minute her voice came to him leaning his head against the door he said devra its me and after a short silence open the door a moment later the door folded back she stood in front of him i want to come in he said their eyes locked for the space of several heartbeats as each tried to gauge the intent of the other then she backed up against the tiny sink arkadin stepped inside with some difficulty shut the door behind him and turned the lock thirty its stateoftheart gunter mьller said guaranteed both he and moira were wearing hard hats as they walked through the series of semiautomated workshops of kaller steelworks gesellschaft where the coupling link that would receive the lng tankers as they nosed into the nextgen long beach terminal had been manufactured mьller the team leader on the nextgen coupling link project was a senior vice president of kaller a smallish man dressed impeccably in a conservatively cut threepiece chalkstriped suit expensive shoes and a tie in black and gold munichs colors since the time of the holy roman empire his skin was bright pink as if hed just had his face steamcleaned and thick brown hair graying at the sides he talked slowly and distinctly in good english though he was rather endearingly weak with modern american idioms at each step he explained the manufacturing process with excruciating detail great pride spread out before them were the design drawings along with the specs to which mьller referred time and again moira was listening with only one ear how her situation had changed now that the firm was out of the picture now that nextgen was on its own with the security of its terminal operations in long beach now that she had been reassigned but the more things change she thought the more they stay the same the moment noah had handed her the packet for damascus she knew she wouldnt disengage herself from the long beach terminal project no matter what noah or his bosses had determined she couldnt leave nextgen or this project in jeopardy mьller like everyone else at kaller and for that matter nearly everyone at nextgen had no idea she worked for the firm only she knew she should be on a flight to damascus not here with him she had a grace period of mere hours before her contact at nextgen would begin to ask questions as to why she was still on the lng terminal project by then she hoped to convince nextgens president of the wisdom of her disobeying the firms orders finally they reached the loading bay where the sixteen parts of the coupling link were being packed for shipment by air to long beach on the nextgen jet that had brought her and bourne to munich as specified in the contract our team of engineers will be accompanying you on the homeward journey mьller rolled up the drawings snapped a rubber band around them and handed them to moira theyll be in charge of putting the coupling link together on site i have every confidence that all will go smoothly it had better moira said the lng tanker is scheduled to dock at the terminal in thirty hours she shot mьller an unpleasant look not much leeway for your engineers not to worry fraulein trevor he said cheerfully theyre more than up to the task for your companys sake i sincerely hope so she stowed the roll under her left arm preparatory to leaving shall we speak frankly herr mьller he smiled always i wouldnt have had to come here at all had it not been for the string of delays that set your manufacturing process back mьllers smile seemed immovable my dear fraulein as i explained to your superiors the delays were unavoidableplease blame the chinese for the temporary shortage of steel and the south africans for the energy shortages that is forcing the platinum mines to work at half speed he spread his hands weve done the best we could i assure you his smile widened and now we are at the end of our journey together the coupling link will be in long beach within eighteen hours and eight hours later it will be in one piece and ready to receive your tanker of liquid natural gas he stuck out his hand all will have a happy ending yes of course it will thank you herr mьller mьller nearly clicked his heels the pleasure is all mine fraulein moira walked back through the factory with mьller at her side she said goodbye to him once more at the gates to the factory walked across the gravel drive to where her chauffeured car sat waiting for her its precisely engineered german engine purring quietly they pulled out of the kaller steelworks property turned left toward the autobahn back to munich five minutes later her driver said theres a car following us fraulein turning around moira peered out the back window a small volkswagen no more than fifty yards behind them flashed its headlights pull over she pushed aside the hem of her long skirt took a sig sauer out of the holster strapped to her left ankle the driver did as he was told and the car came to a stop on the shoulder of the road the volkswagen pulled in behind moira sat waiting for something to happen she was too well trained to get out of the car at length the volkswagen drove off the shoulder into the underbrush where it disappeared from sight a moment later a man became visible tramping out onto the side of the road he was tall and narrow with a pencil mustache and suspenders holding up his trousers he was in his shirtsleeves oblivious to the german winter chill she could see that he had no weapons on him which she reasoned was the point when he came abreast of her car she leaned across the backseat opened the door for him and he slipped inside my name is hauser fraulein trevor arthur hauser his expression was morose bitter i apologize for the incivility of this impromptu meeting but i assure you the melodrama is necessary as if to underscore his words he glanced back down the road toward the factory his expression fearful i do not have much time so i shall come straight to the point there is a flaw in the coupling linknot i hasten to add in the hardware that i assure you is absolutely sound but there is a problem with the software nothing that will interfere with the operation of the link no not at all it is rather a security flawa window if you will the chances are it might never be discovered but all the same its there when hauser glanced again out the back window a car was coming toward them he clamped his jaws shut watched as the vehicle passed by then visibly relaxed as it drove on down the road herr mьller was not altogether truthful the delays were caused by this software flaw nothing else i should know since i was part of the software design team we tried for a patch but its been devilishly difficult and we ran out of time just how serious is this flaw moira said it depends on whether youre an optimist or a pessimist hauser ducked his head embarrassed as i said it might never be discovered moira glanced out the window for a time thinking that she shouldnt ask the next question because as noah told her in no uncertain terms the firm was now out of ensuring the security of nextgens lng terminal and then she heard herself say what if im a pessimist peter marks found rodney feir chief of field support in the ci caff eating a bowl of new england clam chowder feir looked up gestured to marks to sit peter marks had been elevated to chief of operations after the illstarred rob batt was outed as an nsa rat hows it going feir said how dyou think its going marks parked himself on the chair opposite feir ive been vetting every one of batts contacts for any sign of nsa taint its daunting and frustrating work you as exhausted as you i expect feir sprinkled oyster crackers into the chowder ive been briefing the new dci on everything from agents in the field to the cleaning firm weve used for the past twenty years dyou think shell work out feir knew he had to be careful here ill say this for her shes a stickler for detail no stone unturned shes not leaving anything to chance thats a relief marks twiddled a fork between his thumb and fingers what we dont need is another crisis id be happy with someone who can right this listing ship my sentiments exactly the reason im here marks said is im having a staffing problem ive lost some people to attrition of course thats inevitable i thought id get some good recruits graduating from the program but they went to typhon im in need of a shortterm fix feir chewed on a mouthful of gritty clam bits and soft potato cubes hed diverted those graduates to typhon and had been waiting for marks to come to him ever since how can i help id like some of dick symess people to be assigned to my directorate dick symes was the chief of intelligence just temporarily you understand until i can get some raw recruits through training and orientation have you talked to dick why bother hell just tell me to go to hell but you can plead my case to hart shes so snowed under that youre the one best suited to get her to listen to me if she makes the call dick can yell all he wants it wont matter feir wiped his lips what number of personnel are we talking here peter eighteen two dozen tops not inconsiderable the dci is going to want to know what you have in mind ive got a brief detailing it all ready to go marks said i shoot it to you electronically you walk it in to her personally feir nodded i think that can be arranged relief flooded markss face thanks rodney dont mention it he began to dig into what was left of the chowder as marks was about to rise he said do you by any chance know where soraya is shes not in her office and shes not answering her cell unhunh marks resettled himself why no reason something in feirs voice gave him pause no reason really just you know how office scuttlebutt can be meaning you two are tight arent you is that what you heard well yeah feir placed his spoon into the empty bowl but if it isnt true i dont know where she is rodney markss gaze drifted off we never had that kind of thing going sorry i didnt mean to pry marks waved away his apology forget it i have so what do you want to talk with her about this was what feir was hoping hed say according to the general he and lavalle required intel on the nuts and bolts of how typhon worked budgets shes got so many agents in the field the dci wants an accounting of their expenseswhich frankly hasnt been done since martin died thats understandable given whats been going on in here lately feir shrugged deferentially id do it myself sorayas got more on her plate than she can handle i imagine trouble is i dont even know where the files are he was going to add do you but decided that would be overselling it marks thought a minute i might be able to help you there how badly does your shoulder hurt devra said arkadin pressed against her body his powerful arms around her said i dont know how to answer that i have an extremely high tolerance for pain the airplanes cramped bathroom allowed him to concentrate exclusively on her it was like being in a coffin together like being dead but in a strange afterlife where only they existed she smiled up at him as one of his hands traced its way from the small of her back to her neck his thumb pressed against her jaw gently tilted her head up while his fingers tightened on the nape of her neck he leaned in his weight arching her torso backward above the sink he could see the back of her head in the mirror his face about to eclipse hers a flame of emotion flickered to life illuminating the soulless void inside him he kissed her gently she whispered relax your lips her moist lips opened beneath his her tongue searched for his tentatively at first then with an unmistakable hunger his lips trembled he had never felt anything when kissing a woman in fact hed always done his best to avoid it not knowing what it was for or why women sought it so relentlessly an exchange of fluids thats all it was to him like a procedure performed in a doctors office the best he could say was that it was painless that it was over quickly the electricity that shot through him when his lips met hers stunned him the sheer pleasure of it astonished him it hadnt been like this with marlene it hadnt been like this with anyone he did not know what to make of the tremor in his knees her sweet moaning exhalations entered him like silent cries of ecstasy he swallowed them whole and wanted more wanting was something arkadin was unused to need was the word that had driven his life up to this moment he needed to revenge himself on his mother he needed to escape home he needed strike out on his own no matter the course he needed to bury rivals and enemies he needed to destroy anyone who got close to his secrets but want that was another matter entirely devra defined want for him and it was only when he was certain he no longer needed her that his desire revealed itself he wanted her when he lifted her skirt probing underneath her leg drew up her fingers nimbly freed him from his clothing then he stopped thinking altogether afterward when theyd returned to their seats making their way through the line of glaring passengers queued up to use the lavatory devra burst into laughter arkadin sat watching her this was another thing unique about her anyone else would have asked was that your first time not her she wasnt interested in prying his lid open peering inside to see what made him tick she had no need to know because he was someone who had always needed something he couldnt tolerate that trait in anyone else he was aware of her next to him in a way he was unable to understand it was as if he could feel her heartbeat the rush of blood through her body a body that seemed frail to him even though he knew how tough she could be after all shed suffered how easily her bones could be broken how easily a knife slipped through her ribs might pierce her heart how easily a bullet could shatter her skull these thoughts sent him into a rage and he shifted closer to her as if she were in need of protectionwhich when it came to her former allies she most certainly was he knew then that hed do everything in his power to kill anyone who sought to do her harm feeling him edge closer she turned and smiled you know something leonid for the first time in my life i feel safe all that prickly shit i give off is something i learned early on to keep people away you learned to be tough like your mother she shook her head thats the really shitty part my mother had this tough shell yeah but it was skindeep beneath it she was a mass of fears devra put her head against the headrest as she continued in fact the most vivid thing i remember about my mother was her fear it came off her like a stink even after shed bathed i smelled it of course for a long time i didnt know what it was and maybe i was the only one who smelled it i dont know anyway she used to tell me an old ukrainian folktale it was about the nine levels of hell what was she thinking was she trying to frighten me or lessen her own fear by sharing it with me i dont know in any case this is what she told me there is one heaven but there are nine levels of hell where depending on the severity of your sins youre sent when you die the first the least bad is the one familiar to everyone where you roast in flames the second is where youre alone on the summit of a mountain every night you freeze solid slowly and horribly only to thaw out in the morning when the process begins all over again the third is a place of blinding light the fourth of pitch blackness the fifth is a place of icy winds that cut you quite literally like a knife in the sixth youre pierced by arrows in the seventh youre slowly buried by an army of ants in the eighth youre crucified but it was the ninth level that terrified my mother the most there you lived among wild beasts that gorged themselves on human hearts the cruelty of telling this to a child wasnt lost on arkadin he was absolutely certain that if his mother had been ukrainian shed have told him the same folktale i used to laugh at her storyor at least i tried to devra said i struggled against believing such nonsense but that was before a number of those levels of hell were visited on us arkadin felt her presence inside him all the more deeply the sense of wanting to protect her seemed to bounce around inside him increasing exponentially as his brain tried to come to terms with what the feeling meant had he at last stumbled across something big enough bright enough strong enough to put his demons to rest after marlenes death icoupov had seen the writing on the wall hed stopped trying to peer into arkadins past instead hed shipped him off to america to be rehabilitated reprogrammed icoupov had called it arkadin had spent eighteen months in the washington dc area going through a unique experimental program devised and run by a friend of icoupovs arkadin had emerged changed in many ways though his pasthis shadows his demonsremained intact how he wished the program had erased all memory of it but that wasnt the nature of the program icoupov no longer cared about arkadins past what concerned him was his future and for that the program was ideal he fell asleep thinking about the program but he dreamed he was back in nizhny tagil he never dreamed about the program in the program he felt safe his dreams werent about safety they were about being pushed from great heights late at night a subterranean bar called crespi was the only option when he wanted to get a drink in nizhny tagil it was a reeking place filled with tattooed men in tracksuits gold chains around their necks shortskirted women so heavily made up they looked like store mannequins behind their raccoon eyes were vacant pits where their souls had been it was in crespi where arkadin at age thirteen was first beaten to a pulp by four burly men with pig eyes and neanderthal brows and it was to crespi that arkadin after nursing his wounds returned three months later and blew the mens brains all over the walls when another crim tried to snatch his gun away arkadin shot him pointblank in the face that sight stopped anyone else in the bar from approaching him it also gained him a reputation which helped him to amass a mini real estate empire but in that city of smelted iron and hissing slag success had its own particular consequences for arkadin it was coming to the attention of stas kuzin one of the local crime bosses kuzin found arkadin one night four years later having a bareknuckle brawl with a giant lout whom arkadin called out on a bet for the prize of one beer having demolished the giant arkadin grabbed his free beer swigged half of it down and turning confronted stas kuzin arkadin knew him immediately everyone in nizhny tagil did he had a thick black pelt of hair that came down in a horizontal slash to within an inch of his eyebrows his head sat on his shoulders like a marble on a stone wall his jaw had been broken and reconstructed so badlyprobably in prisonthat he spoke with a peculiar hissing sound like a serpent sometimes what he said was all but unintelligible on either side of kuzin were two ghoulishlooking men with sunken eyes and crude tattoos of dogs on the backs of their hands which marked them as forever bound to their master lets talk this monstrosity said to arkadin jerking his tiny head toward a table the men whod been occupying the table rose as one when kuzin approached fleeing to the other side of the bar kuzin hooked his shoe around a chair leg dragged it around and sat down disconcertingly he kept his hands in his lap as if at any moment hed draw down on arkadin and shoot him dead he began talking but it took the seventeenyearold arkadin some minutes before he could make heads or tails of what kuzin was saying it was like listening to a drowning man going under for the third time at length he realized that kuzin was proposing a merger of sorts half arkadins stake in real estate for percent of kuzins operation and just what was stas kuzins operation no one would speak about it openly but there was no lack of rumors on the subject everything from running spent nuclear fuel rods for the big boys over in moscow to white slave trading drug trafficking and prostitution was laid at kuzins doorstep for his own part arkadin tended to dismiss the more outlandish speculation in favor of what he very well knew would make kuzin money in nizhny tagil namely prostitution and drugs every man in the city had to get laid and if they had any money at all drugs were far preferable to beer and bathtub vodka once again want never appeared on arkadins horizon only need he needed to do more than survive in this city of permasoot violence and black lung disease he had come as far as he could on his own he made enough to sustain himself here but not enough to break away to moscow where he needed to go to grab lifes richest opportunities outside the rings of hell rose up brick smokestacks vigorously belching particleladen smoke iron guard towers of the brutal prison zonas bristling with assault rifles powerful spotlights and bellowing sirens in here he was locked inside his own brutal zona with stas kuzin arkadin gave the only sensible answer he said yes and so entered the ninth level of hell thirtyone while on line for passport control in munich bourne phoned specter who assured him everything was in readiness moments later he came in range of the first set of the airports cctv cameras instantly his image was picked up by the software employed at semion icoupovs headquarters and before hed finished his call to the professor hed been identified at once icoupov was called who ordered his people stationed in munich to move from standby to action thus alerting both the airport personnel and the immigration people under icoupovs control the man directing the incoming passengers to the different cordonedoff lanes leading to the immigration booths received a photo of bourne on his computer screen just in time to indicate bourne should go to booth the immigration officer manning booth listened to the voice coming through the electronic device in his ear when the man identified to him as jason bourne handed over his passport the officer asked him the usual questionshow long do you intend to remain in germany is your visit business or pleasurewhile paging through the passport he moved it away from the window passed the photo under a humming purple light as he did so he pressed a small metallic disk the thickness of a human nail into the inside back cover of the passport then he closed the booklet smoothed its front and back covers and handed it back to bourne have a pleasant stay in munich he said without a trace of emotion or interest he was already looking beyond bourne to the next passenger in line as in sheremetyevo bourne had the sense that he was under physical surveillance he changed taxis twice when he arrived at the seething center of the city in marienplatz a large open square from which the historic marian column ascended he walked past medieval cathedrals through flocks of pigeons lost himself within the crowds of guided tours gawping at the sugaricing architecture and the looming twin domes of the frauenkirche cathedral of the archbishop of munichfreising the symbol of the city he inserted himself in a tour group gathered around a government building in which was inset the citys official shield depicting a monk with hands spread wide the tour leader was telling her charges that the german name mьnchen stemmed from an old high german word meaning monks in or thereabouts the current duke of saxony and bavaria built a bridge over the isar river connecting the saltworks for which the growing city would soon become famous with a settlement of benedictine monks he installed a tollbooth on the bridge which became a vital link in the salt route in and out of the high bavarian plains on which munich was built and a mint in which to house his profits the modernday mercantile city was not so far removed from its medieval beginnings when bourne was certain he wasnt being shadowed he slipped away from the group and boarded a taxi which dropped him off six blocks from the wittelsbach palace according to the professor kirsch said hed rather meet bourne in a public setting he chose the state museum for egyptian art on hofgartenstrasse which was housed within the massive rococo facade of the wittelsbach palace bourne took a full circuit of the streets around the palace checking once more for tags but he couldnt recall being in munich before he didnt have that eerie sense of dйjа vu that meant he had returned to a place he couldnt remember therefore he knew local tags would have the advantage of terrain there might be a dozen places to hide around the palace that he didnt know about shrugging he entered the museum the metal detector was staffed by a pair of armed security guards who were also setting aside backpacks and picking through handbags on either side of the vestibule was a pair of basalt statues of the egyptian god horusa falcon with a disk of the sun on his foreheadand his mother isis instead of walking directly to the exhibits bourne turned stood behind the statue of horus watching for ten minutes as people came and went he noted everyone between twentyfive and fifty memorizing their faces there were seventeen in all he then made his way past a female armed guard into the exhibition halls where he found kirsch precisely where he told specter hed be scrutinizing an ancient carving of a lions head he recognized kirsch from the photo specter had sent him a snapshot of the two men standing together on the university campus the professors courier was a wiry little man with a shiny bald skull and black eyebrows as thick as caterpillars he had pale blue eyes that darted this way and that as if on gimbals bourne went past him ostensibly looking at several sarcophagi while using his peripheral vision to check for any of the seventeen people whod entered the museum after him when no one presented themselves he retraced his steps kirsch did not turn as bourne came up beside him but said i know it sounds ridiculous but doesnt this sculpture remind you of something the pink panther bourne said both because it was the proper code response and because the sculpture did look astonishingly like the modernday cartoon icon kirsch nodded glad you made it without incident he handed over the keys to his apartment the code for the front door and detailed directions to it from the museum he looked relieved as if he were handing over his burdensome life rather than his home there are some features of my apartment i want to talk to you about as kirsch spoke they moved on to a granite sculpture of the kneeling senenmut from the time of the eighteenth dynasty the ancient egyptians knew how to live kirsch observed they werent afraid of death to them it was just another journey not to be undertaken lightly but still they knew there was something waiting for them after life he put his hand out as if to touch the statue or perhaps to absorb some of its potency look at this statue life still glows within it thousands of years later for centuries the egyptians had no equal until they were conquered by the romans and yet kirsch said it was the romans who were changed by the egyptians a century after the ptolemys and julius caesar ruled from alexandria it was isis the egyptian goddess of revenge and rebellion who was worshipped throughout the roman empire in fact its all too likely that the early christian church founders unable to do away with her or her followers transmogrified her stripped her of her warlike nature and made from her the perfectly peaceful virgin mary leonid arkadin could use a little less isis and a lot more virgin mary bourne mused kirsch raised his eyebrows what do you know of this man i know a lot of dangerous people are terrified of him with good reason kirsch said the mans a homicidal maniac he was born and raised in nizhny tagil a hotbed of homicidal maniacs so ive heard bourne nodded and there he would have stayed had it not been for tarkanian bournes ears pricked up hed assumed that maslov had put his man in tarkanians apartment because thats where gala was living wait a minute what does tarkanian have to do with arkadin everything without mischa tarkanian arkadin would never have escaped nizhny tagil it was tarkanian who brought him to moscow are they both members of the black legion so ive been given to understand kirsch said but im only an artist the clandestine life has given me an ulcer if i didnt need the moneyim a singularly unsuccessful artist im afraidi never would have stayed in this long this was to be my last favor for specter his eyes continued to dart to the left and right now that arkadin has murdered dieter heinrich last favor has taken on a new and terrifying meaning bourne was now on full alert specter had assumed that tarkanian was black legion and kirsch just confirmed it but maslov had denied tarkanians affiliation with the terrorist group someone was lying bourne was about to ask kirsch about the discrepancy when out of the corner of his eye he spotted one of the men whod come into the museum just after he had the man had paused for a moment in the vestibule as if orienting himself then strode purposefully off into the exhibition hall because the man was close enough to overhear them in the museums hushed atmosphere bourne took kirschs arm come this way he said leading the german contact into another room which was dominated by a calcite statue of twins from the eighth dynasty it was chipped timeworn dating from bc pushing kirsch behind the statue bourne stood like a sentinel watching the other mans movements the man glanced up saw that bourne and kirsch were no longer at the statue of senenmut and looked casually around stay here bourne whispered to kirsch what is it there was a slight quaver in kirschs voice but he looked stalwart enough is arkadin here whatever happens bourne warned him stay put youll be safe until i come get you as bourne moved around the far side of the egyptian twins the man entered the gallery bourne walked to the side opening and into the room beyond the man sauntering nonchalantly took a quick look around and as if seeing nothing of interest followed bourne this gallery held a number of high display cases but was dominated by a fivethousandyearold stone statue of a woman with half her head sheared off the antiquity was staggering but bourne had no time to appreciate it perhaps because it was toward the rear of the museum the room was deserted save for bourne and the man who was standing between bourne and the one way in or out of the gallery bourne placed himself behind a twosided display case with a board in the center on which were hung small artifactssacred blue scarabs and gold jewelry because of a center gap in the board bourne could see the man but the man remained unaware of his position standing completely still bourne waited until the man began to come around the right side of the display case bourne moved quickly to his right around the opposite side of the case and rushed the man he shoved him against the wall but the man maintained his balance as he took up a defensive posture he pulled a ceramic knife from a sheath under his armpit swung it back and forth to keep bourne at bay bourne feinted right moved left in a semicrouch as he did so he swung his right arm against the hand wielding the knife his left hand grabbed the man by his throat as the man tried to drive his knee into bournes belly bourne twisted to partially deflect the blow in so doing he lost his block on the knife hand and now the blade swept in toward the side of his neck bourne stopped it just before it struck and there they stood locked together in a kind of stalemate bourne the man finally got out my name is jens i work for dominic specter prove it bourne said youre here meeting with egon kirsch so you can take his place when leonid arkadin comes looking for him bourne let up on his grip of jenss neck put away your knife jens did as bourne asked and bourne let go of him completely now wheres kirsch i need to get him out of here and safely on a plane back to washington bourne led him back into the adjoining gallery to the statue of the twins kirsch the gallerys clear you can come out now when the contact didnt appear bourne stepped behind the statue kirsch was there all right crumpled on the floor a bullet hole in the back of his head semion icoupov watched the receiver attuned to the electronic bug in bournes passport as they approached the area of the egyptian museum he told the driver of his car to slow down a keen sense of anticipation coursed through him hed decided to take bourne by gunpoint into his car it seemed the best way now to get him to listen to what icoupov had to tell him at that moment his cell phone sounded with the ringtone hed assigned to arkadins number and while on the lookout for bourne he put the phone to his ear im in munich arkadin said in his ear i rented a car and im driving in from the airport good ive got an electronic tag on jason bourne the man our friend has sent to retrieve the plans where is he ill take care of him arkadin said in his typical blunt way no no i dont want him killed ill take care of bourne in the meantime stay mobile ill be in touch shortly bourne kneeling down beside kirsch examined the dead body theres a metal detector out front jens said how the hell could someone bring a gun in here plus there was no noise bourne turned kirschs head so the back of it caught the light see here he pointed to the entry wound and here theres no exit wound which there would have been with a shot fired at close range he stood up whoever killed him used a suppressor he went out of the gallery with a purposeful stride and whoever killed him works here as a guard the museums security personnel are armed there are three of them jens said keeping pace behind bourne right two on the metal detector one roaming the galleries in the vestibule the two guards were at their station beside the metal detector bourne went up to one of them said i lost my cell phone somewhere in the museum and the guard in the second gallery said shed help me locate it but now i cant find her petra the guard said yeah she just took off for her lunch break bourne and jens went through the front door down the steps onto the sidewalk where they looked left and right bourne saw a uniformed female figure walking fast down the block to their right and he and jens took off after her she disappeared around a corner and the two men sprinted after her as they neared the corner bourne became aware of a sleek mercedes sedan as it came abreast of them icoupov was appalled to discover bourne exiting the museum in the company of franz jens jenss appearance told him that his enemy wasnt leaving anything to chance jenss job was to keep icoupovs people away from bourne so that bourne had a clear shot at retrieving the attack plans a certain dread gripped icoupov if bourne was successful all was lost his enemy would have won he couldnt allow that to happen leaning forward in the backseat he drew a luger pick up speed he told the driver bracing himself against the door frame he waited until the last instant before depressing the button that slid the window down he took aim at the running figure of jens but jens sensed him slowed as he turned with bourne now safely three paces ahead icoupov squeezed off two shots in succession jens slipped to one knee skidded off the sidewalk as he went down icoupov fired a third shot just to be sure jens didnt survive the attack then he slid the window up go he said to the driver the mercedes shot forward down the street screeching away from the bloody body tangled in the gutter thirtytwo rob batt sat in his car a pair of nightvision binoculars to his eyes chewing over the recent past as if it were a piece of gum that had lost its flavor from the time that batt had been called into veronica harts office and confronted with his treacherous actions against ci hed gone numb at the moment hed felt nothing for himself rather his enmity toward hart had morphed into pity or maybe he had thought he pitied himself like a novice hed stepped into a bear trap hed trusted people who never should have been trusted lavalle and halliday were going to have their way he had absolutely no doubt of it filled with selfdisgust hed begun his long night of drinking it wasnt until the morning after that batt waking up with the father of all hangovers realized that there was something he could do about it he thought about that for some time while he swallowed aspirins for his pounding head chasing them down with a glass of water and angostura bitters to calm his rebellious stomach it was then that the plan formed in his mind unfolding like a flower to the rays of the sun he was going to get his revenge for the humiliation lavalle and kendall had caused him and the real beauty part was this if his scheme worked if he brought them down hed resuscitate his own career which was on life support now sitting behind the wheel of a rented car he swept the street across from the pentagon on the lookout for general kendall batt was canny enough to know better than to go after lavalle because lavalle was too smart to make a mistake the same however couldnt be said for the general if batt had learned one thing from his abortive association with the two it was that kendall was a weak link he was too tied to lavalle too slavish in his attitude he needed someone to tell him what to do the desire to please was what made followers vulnerable they made mistakes their leaders didnt he suddenly saw life the way it must appear to jason bourne he knew the work that bourne had done for martin lindros in reykjavik and knew that bourne had put himself on the line to find lindros and bring him home but like most of his former coworkers batt had conveniently dismissed bournes actions as collateral happenstance choosing to stick to the common wisdom that bourne was an outofcontrol paranoid who needed to be stopped before he committed some heinous act that would disgrace ci and yet people in ci had had no compunction about using him when all else failed coercing him into playing as their pawn but at last he batt was no ones pawn he saw general kendall exit a side door of the building and huddled in his trenchcoat hurry across the lot to his car he kept the general in his sights as he put one hand on the keys hed already inserted in the ignition at the precise moment kendall leaned his right shoulder forward to start his engine batt flipped his own ignition so kendall didnt hear another car start when his did as the general pulled out of the lot batt set aside the night glasses and put his car in gear the night seemed quiet and still but maybe that was simply a reflection of batts mood he was a sentinel of the night after all hed been trained by the old man himself hed always been proud of that fact after his downfall though he realized that it was this pride that had distorted his thinking and his decision making it was his pride that made him rebel against veronica hart not because of anything she said or didhe hadnt even given her the chancebut because hed been passed over pride was his weakness one that lavalle had recognized and exploited twentytwenty hindsight was a bitch he thought as he followed kendall toward the fairfax area but at least it provided the humility he needed to see how far hed strayed from his sworn duties at ci he kept well back of the generals car varying his distance and his lane the better to avoid detection he doubted that kendall would consider that he might be followed but it paid to be cautious batt was determined to atone for the sin hed committed against his own organization against the memory of the old man kendall turned in at an anonymous modernlooking building whose entire ground floor was taken up by the intune health club batt observed the general park take out a small gym bag and enter the club nothing useful so far but batt had long ago learned to be patient on stakeouts it seemed nothing came quickly or easily and then because he had nothing better to do until kendall reappeared batt stared at the intune sign while he bit hunks off a snickers bar why did that sign seem familiar he knew he had never been inside had never in fact been in this part of fairfax maybe it was the name intune yes he thought it sounded maddeningly familiar but for the life of him he couldnt think of why fifty minutes had passed since kendall had gone in time to train his night glasses on the entrance he watched people of all description and build come in and out most were solitary figures occasionally two women came out talking once a couple emerged headed in tandem for their car another fifteen minutes passed and still no kendall batt had taken the glasses away from his eyes to give them a rest when he saw the gym door swung open fitting the binoculars back to his eyes he saw rodney feir step out into the night are you kidding me batt thought feir ran his hand through his damp hair and thats when batt remembered why the name intune was so familiar all ci directors were required to post their whereabouts after hours so if they were needed the duty officer could calculate how long it would take them to get back to headquarters watching feir walk over and get into his car batt bit his lip of course it might be sheer coincidence that general kendall used the same health club as feir but batt knew that in his trade there was no such thing as coincidence his suspicion was borne out when feir did not fire up his car but sat silent and still behind the wheel he was waiting for something but what maybe batt thought it was someone ten minutes later general kendall emerged from the club he looked neither to the right nor the left but went immediately to his car started it up and began to back out of his space before hed exited the lot feir started his car kendall turned right out of the lot and feir followed excitement flared in batts chest game on he thought after the first two shots struck jens bourne turned back toward him but the third shot fired into jenss head made him change his mind he ran down the street knowing the other man was dead there was nothing he could do for him he had to assume that arkadin had followed jens to the museum and had been lying in wait turning the same corner as the museum guard bourne saw that she had hesitated half turned to the sound of the shots then seeing bourne coming after her she took off she darted into an alley bourne following saw her vault up a corrugated steel fence beyond which was a cleared building site bristling with heavy machinery she grabbed hold of the top of the fence levered herself up and over bourne scaled the fence after her jumping down onto the packed earth and concrete rubble on the other side he saw her duck behind the mudspattered flank of a bulldozer and ran toward her she swung up into the cab slid behind the wheel and fumbled with the ignition bourne was quite close when the engine rumbled to life throwing the bulldozer into reverse she backed up directly at him shed chosen a clumsy vehicle and he leapt to one side reached for a handhold and swung up the bulldozer lurched the gears grinding as she struggled to shove it into first but bourne was already inside the cab she tried to draw her gun but she was also trying to guide the bulldozer and bourne easily slapped the weapon away it fell to the foot well where he kicked it away from her then he reached over turned off the engine the moment he did that the woman covered her face with her hands and burst into tears this is your mess deron said soraya nodded i know it is you came to uskiki and me i take full responsibility i think in this case deron said we have to share the responsibility we couldve said no but we didnt now all of usnot just tyrone and jasonare in serious jeopardy they were sitting in the den of derons house a cozy room with a wraparound sofa that faced a stone fireplace and above it a large plasma tv drinks were set out on a low wooden table but nobody had touched them deron and soraya sat facing each other kiki was curled up in the corner like a cat tyrones already totally fucked soraya said i saw what theyre doing to him hold on deron sat forward theres a difference between perception and reality dont let them skullfuck you theyre not going to risk damaging tyrone hes their only leverage to coerce you to bring jason to them soraya once again finding fear scattering her thoughts reached over and poured herself a scotch rolling it around in the glass she inhaled its complex aroma which called to mind heather and butterscotch she recalled jason telling her how sights scents idioms or tones of voice could trigger his hidden memories she took a sip of the scotch felt it ignite a stream of fire down to her stomach she wanted to be anywhere but here now she wanted another life but this was the life shed chosen these were the decisions shed made there was no help for itshe could not abandon her friends she had to keep them safe how to do that was the vexing question deron was right about lavalle and kendall taking her back down to the interrogation room was a psychological ploy what theyd showed her was minimal now that she thought about it they were counting on her to imagine the worst to let those thoughts prey on her until she gave in called jason so they could take him into custody and like a show dog present him to the president as proof that having accomplished what numerous ci initiatives could not lavalle deserved to take over and run ci she took another sip of scotch aware that deron and kiki were silent patiently waiting for her to work through the mistake shed made and coming through the other side put it behind her but she had to take the initiative to formulate a plan of counterattack that was what deron meant when he said this is your mess the thing to do she said slowly and carefully is to beat lavalle at his own game and how do you propose to do that deron said soraya stared down at the dregs of her scotch that was just it she had no idea the silence stretched out growing thicker and more deadly by the second at last kiki uncurled herself stood up and said i for one have had enough of this gloom and doom sitting around feeling angry and frustrated isnt helping tyrone and it isnt helping us find a solution im going out to have a good time at my friends club she looked from soraya to deron and back again so whos going to join me the highlow wail of the police sirens came to bourne as he sat beside the museum guard in the bulldozer up close she looked younger than he had imagined her blond hair which had been pulled back in a severe bun had come loose it flowed down around her pale face her eyes were large and liquidred around the rims now from crying there was something about them that made him think shed been born sad take off your jacket he said what the guard appeared totally confused without saying anything bourne helped her off with her jacket pushing up the sleeves of her shirt he checked the insides of her elbows but found no black legion tattoo naked fear had joined the sadness in her eyes whats your name he said softly petraalexandra eichen she said in a quavery voice but everyone calls me petra she wiped at her eyes and gave him a sideways look are you going to kill me now the police sirens were very loud and bourne had a desire to get as far away from them as possible why would i do that because i her voice faltered and she choked it seemed on her own words or on an emotion welling up i shot your friend why did you do that for money she said i need money bourne believed her she didnt act like a professional she didnt talk like one either who paid you fear distorted her expression magnified her eyes until they seemed to goggle at him i i cant tell you he made me promise he said hed kill me if i opened my mouth bourne heard raised voices using the clipped jargon endemic to police the world over theyd started their dragnet he retrieved her gun a walther p the small caliber being the only option for a silent kill in an enclosed space even with a suppressor wheres the suppressor i threw it down a storm drain she said as i was instructed to do continuing to follow orders isnt going to help the people who hired you are going to kill you anyway he said as he dragged her down from the bulldozer youre in way over your head she gave a little moan and tried to break away from him he grabbed her if you want ill let you go straight to the cops theyll be here any minute her mouth worked but nothing intelligible came out voices came to him more distinct now the police were on the other side of the corrugated wall he pulled her in the opposite direction do you know another way out of here petra nodded pointing she and bourne ran diagonally across the yard dodging heavy equipment as they picked their way through the rubble and around deep holes in the earth without turning around bourne could tell that the cops had entered the far side of the yard he pushed petras head down as he himself bent over to keep them both from being spotted beyond a crane a crew chiefs trailer was set up on concrete blocks temporary electric lines were strung into it from just above the tin roof petra threw herself headlong under the trailer and bourne followed the blocks set the trailer just high enough for them to worm their way on their bellies to the far side where bourne saw that a gap had been cut in the chainlink fence crawling through the gap they found themselves in a quiet alley filled with industrialsize garbage bins and a dumpster filled with broken tiles jagged blocks of terrazzo and pieces of twisted metal no doubt from whatever buildings had once stood in the now empty space behind them this way petra whispered as she took them out of the alley and down a residential street around the corner she went to a car and opened it with a set of keys give me the keys bourne said theyll be looking for you he caught them in midair and they both got in a block away they passed a cruising police car the sudden tension caused petras hands to tremble in her lap were going right past them bourne said dont look at them nothing further passed between them until bourne said theyve turned around theyre coming after us thirtythree im going to drop you off somewhere arkadin said i dont want you in the middle of whatevers going to come devra in the passengers seat of the rented bmw shot him a skeptical look that doesnt sound like you at all no who does it sound like we still have to get egon kirsch arkadin turned a corner they were in the center of the city a place filled with old cathedrals and palaces the place looked like something out of grimms fairy tales theres been a complication he said the oppositions king has entered the chess match his name is jason bourne and hes here in munich all the more reason why i should stay with you devra checked the action on one of the two lugers that arkadin had picked up from one of icoupovs local agents a crossfire has many benefits arkadin laughed theres no lack of fire to you that was another thing that drew him to hershe wasnt afraid of the male fire burning in her belly but he had promised herand himselfthat he would protect her it had been a very long time since hed said that to anyone and even though hed sworn never to make that promise again hed done just that and strange to say he felt good about it in fact there was a sense now when he was around her that hed stepped out of the shadows hed been born into that had been tattooed into his flesh by so many violent incidents for the first time in his life he felt as if he could take pleasure in the sun on his face in the wind lifting devras hair behind her like a mane that he could walk down the street with her and not feel as if he was living in another dimension that he hadnt just arrived here from another planet as they stopped at a red light he glanced at her sunlight was streaming into the interior turning her face the palest shade of pink at that precise moment he felt something rush out of him and into her and she turned as if she felt it too and she smiled at him the light turned green and he accelerated through the cross street his cell phone buzzed a glance down at the number of the incoming call told him that gala was calling he didnt answer he had no wish to talk to her now or ever for that matter three minutes later he received a text message it read mischa dead killed by jason bourne having followed rodney feir and general kendall over the key bridge into washington proper rob batt made sure his longlens slr nikon was fully loaded with fast film he shot a series of digital photos with a compact camera but these were only for reference because they could be photoshopped in a heartbeat to forestall any suspicion that the images might be manipulated hed present the undeveloped roll of film to well this was his real problem for a legitimate reason he was persona non grata at ci it was astonishing how quickly yearslong associations vanished but now he realized hed mistaken the camaraderie hed developed with what had been his fellow directors for friendship as far as they were concerned he no longer existed so going to them with any alleged evidence that the nsa had turned yet another ci officer would be either ignored or laughed at trying to approach veronica hart was similarly out of the question assuming he could ever get to herwhich he doubtedspeaking to her now would be like groveling batt had never groveled in his life and he wasnt going to now then he laughed out loud at how easy it was to become selfdeluded why should any of his former colleagues want anything to do with him hed betrayed them abandoned them for the enemy if he were in their shoesand how he wished he werehed feel the same venomous animosity toward someone whod sold him out which was why hed embarked on this mission to destroy lavalle and kendall theyd sold him outhung him out to dry as soon as it suited their purposes the moment he came on board theyd taken control of typhon away from him venomous animosity that was an excellent phrase he thought one that precisely defined his feelings toward lavalle and kendall he knew deep down that hating them was the same as hating himself but he couldnt hate himself that was selfdefeating at this very moment he couldnt believe hed sunk so low as to defect to the nsa hed gone through his line of thinking over and over and now it seemed to him as if someone else some stranger had made that decision it hadnt been him it couldnt have been him ergo lavalle and kendall had made him do it for that they had to pay the ultimate price the two men were on the move again and batt headed out after them after a tenminute drive the two cars ahead of him pulled into the crowded parking lot of the glass slipper as batt passed by feir and kendall got out of their respective cars and went inside batt drove around the block parked on a side street reaching into the glove compartment he took out a tiny leica camera the kind used by the old man in his youthful days of surveillance it was the old spy standby as dependable as it was easy to conceal batt loaded it with fast film put it in the breast pocket of his shirt along with the digital camera and got out of the car the night was filled with a gritty wind refuse spiraled up from the gutter only to come to rest in a different place jamming his hands in his coat pockets batt hurried down the block and into the glass slipper a slide guitarist was up on stage wailing the blues warming up for the feature act a highpowered band with several hit cds under its belt hed heard about the club by reputation only he knew for instance that it was owned by drew davis primarily because davis was a largerthanlife character who continually inserted himself into the political and economic affairs of african americans in the district thanks to his influence homeless shelters had become safer places for their residents halfway houses had been built he made it a point to hire excons he was so cannily public about these hirings that the excons had no choice but to make the most of their second chances what batt didnt know about was the slippers back room so he was puzzled when after a full circuit of the space plus an expedition to the mens room he could find no trace of either feir or the general fearing that theyd slipped out the back he returned to the parking lot only to find their cars where theyd left them back in the slipper he took another trip through the crowd figuring he must have missed them somehow still there was no sign but as he neared the rear of the space he spotted someone talking to a muscled black man the approximate size of a refrigerator after a small bout of jawing mr muscle opened a door batt hadnt noticed before and the man slipped through guessing this was where feir and kendall must have gone batt edged his way toward mr muscle and the door it was then that he saw soraya walk through the front door bourne almost stripped the cars gears trying to outrun the police car on their tail take it easy petra said or youll tear my poor car apart he wished hed taken a longer look at the map of the city a street blocked off with wooden sawhorses flashed by on their left the paving had been torn up leaving the heavily pitted and cracked underlayer the worst parts of which were in the process of being excavated hold on tight bourne said as he reversed then turned into the street and drove the car through the sawhorses cracking one and scattering the others the car hit the underlayer jounced down the street at what seemed a reckless speed it felt as if the vehicle were being machinegunned by a pile driver bournes teeth rattled in his head and petra struggled to keep from crying out behind them the police car was having even more difficulty keeping to a straight path it jerked back and forth to avoid the deepest of the holes gouged in the roadbed putting on another burst of speed bourne was able to lengthen the distance between them but then he glanced ahead a cement truck was parked crosswise at the other end of the street if they kept going there was no way to avoid crashing into it bourne kept the speed on as the cement truck loomed larger and larger the police car was coming up fast behind them what are you doing petra screamed are you out of your fucking mind at that moment bourne threw the car into neutral stepped on the brake he immediately changed into reverse took his foot off the brake and pressed the gas pedal to the floor the car shuddered its engine screaming then the transmission locked into place and the car flew backward the police car came on its driver frozen in shock bourne swerved around it as the vehicle raced forward into the side of the cement truck bourne wasnt even looking he was busy steering the car back down the street in reverse blasting past the shattered sawhorses he turned braked put the car into first and drove off what the hell are you doing here noah said you should be on your way to damascus im due to take off in four hours moira put her hands in her pockets so he wouldnt see that they were curled into fists you havent answered my question noah sighed it doesnt make any difference her laugh had a bitter taste to it why am i not surprised because noah said youve been with black river long enough to know how we operate they were walking down kaufingerstrasse in the center of munich a heavily trafficked area just off the marienplatz turning in at the sign for the augustiner bierkeller they entered a long dim cathedrallike space that smelled powerfully of beer and boiled wurst the hubbub of noise was just right for masking a private conversation crossing the red flagstone floor they chose a table in one of the rooms sat on wooden benches the person closest to them was an old man sucking on a pipe while he leisurely read the paper moira and noah both ordered a hefeweizen a wheat beer still clouded with unfiltered yeast from a waitress dressed in the regional dirndlkleid a long wide skirt and lowcut blouse she had an apron around her waist along with a decorative purse noah moira said when the beers had been served i dont hold any illusions about why we do what we do but how do you expect me to ignore this intel i got right from the source noah took a long draw of his hefeweizen fastidiously wiped his lips before answering then he began to tick off points on his fingers first this man hauser told you that the flaw in the software is virtually undetectable second what he told you isnt verifiable he might simply be a disgruntled employee trying to get revenge on kaller steelworks have you considered that possibility we could run our own tests on the software no time theres less than two days before the lng tanker is scheduled to dock at the terminal he continued ticking off points third we couldnt do anything without alerting nextgen who would then turn around and confront kaller steelworks which would put us in the middle of a nasty situation and fourth and finally what part of the sentence weve officially notified nextgen that weve withdrawn from the project do you not understand moira sat back for a moment and took a deep breath this is solid intel noah it could lead to the situation we were most worried about a terrorist attack how can you youve already taken several steps over the line moira noah said sharply get your tail on that plane and your head into your new assignment or youre through at black river its better for the moment that we dont meet icoupov said arkadin was seething barely holding down his rage and only then because devra canny witch that she was dug her fingernails into the palm of his hand she understood him no questions no probing no trying to pick over his past like a vulture what about the plans he and devra were sitting in a miserable smokefilled bar in a rundown part of the city ill pick them up from you now icoupovs voice sounded thin and far away over the cell phone even though there could be only a mile or two separating them im following bourne im going after him myself arkadin didnt want to hear it i thought that was my job your job is essentially over you have the plans and youve terminated pyotrs network all except egon kirsch kirsch has already been disposed of icoupov said im the one who terminates the targets ill give you the plans and then take care of bourne i told you leonid danilovich i dont want bourne terminated arkadin made an anguished animal sound under his breath but bourne has to be terminated he thought devra dug her claws deeper into his flesh so that he could smell the sweet coppery scent of his own blood and i have to do it he murdered mischa are you listening to me icoupov said sharply arkadin stirred within his web of rage yes sir always however i must insist that you tell me where youll be when you accost bourne this is security for your own safety i wont stand helplessly by while something unforseen happens to you agreed icoupov said after a moments hesitation at the moment hes on the move so i have time to get the plans from you he gave arkadin an address ill be there in fifteen minutes itll take me a bit longer arkadin said within the half hour then the moment i know where ill be intercepting bourne youll know does that satisfy you leonid danilovich completely arkadin folded away his phone disentangled himself from devra and went up to the bar a double oban on rocks the bartender a huge man with tattooed arms squinted at him whats an oban its a singlemalt scotch you moron the bartender polishing an oldfashioned glass grunted what does this look like the princes palace we dont have singlemalt anything arkadin reached over snatched the glass out of the bartenders hands and smashed it bottomfirst into his nose then as blood started to gush he hauled the dazed man over the bar top and proceeded to beat him to a pulp i cant go back to munich petra said not for a while anyway thats what he told me why would you jeopardize your job to kill someone bourne said please she glanced at him a hamster couldnt live on what they paid me in that shithole she was behind the wheel driving on the autobahn they had already passed the outskirts of the city bourne didnt mind he needed to stay out of munich himself until the furor over egon kirschs death died down the authorities would find someone elses id on kirsch and though bourne had no doubt theyd eventually find out his real identity he hoped by that time to have retrieved the plans from arkadin and be flying back to washington in the meantime the police would be searching for him as a witness to the murders of both kirsch and jens sooner or later bourne said youre going to have to tell me who hired you petra said nothing but her hands trembled on the wheel an aftermath of their harrowing chase where are we going bourne said he wanted to keep her engaged in conversation he felt that she needed to connect with him on some personal level in order to open up he had to get her to tell him who had ordered her to kill egon kirsch that might answer the question of whether he was connected to the man whod gunned down jens home she said a place i never wanted to go back to why is that i was born in munich because my mother traveled there to give birth to me but im from dachau she meant the town of course after which the adjacent nazi concentration camp had been named no parent wants dachau to appear on their childs birth certificate so when their time comes the women check into a munich hospital hardly surprising almost two hundred thousand people were exterminated during the camps life the longest of the war since it was the first built becoming the prototype for all the other kz camps the town itself situated along the amper river lay some twelve miles northwest of munich it was unexpectedly bucolic with its narrow cobbled streets oldfashioned street lamps and quiet treelined lanes when bourne observed that most of the people they passed looked contented enough petra laughed unpleasantly they go around in a permanent fog hating that their little town has such a murderous burden to carry she drove through the center of dachau then turned north until they reached what once had been the village of etzenhausen there on a desolate hill known at the leitenberg was a graveyard lonely and utterly deserted they got out of the car walked past the stone stela with the sculpted star of david the stone was scarred furry with blue lichen the overhanging firs and hemlocks blocked out the sky even on such a bright midwinter afternoon as they walked slowly among the gravestones she said this is the kzfriedhof the concentration camp cemetery through most of dachaus life the corpses of the jews were piled up and burned in ovens but toward the end when the camp ran out of coal the nazis had to do something with the corpses so they brought them up here she spread her arms wide this is all the memorial the jewish victims got bourne had been in many cemeteries before and had found them peculiarly peaceful not kzfriedhof where a sensation of constant movement ceaseless murmuring made his skin crawl the place was alive howling in its restless silence he paused squatted down and ran his fingertips over the words engraved on a headstone they were so eroded it was impossible to read them did you ever think that the man you shot today might have been a jew he said she turned on him sharply i told you i needed the money i did it out of necessity bourne looked around them thats what the nazis said when they buried their last victims here a flash of anger momentarily burned away the sadness in her eyes i hate you not nearly as much as you hate yourself he rose handed her back her gun here why dont you shoot yourself and end it all she took the gun aimed it at him why dont i just shoot you killing me will only make matters worse for you besides bourne opened up one palm to show her the bullets hed taken out of her weapon with a disgusted sound petra holstered her gun her face and hands looked greenish in what light filtered through the evergreens you can make amends for what you did today bourne said tell me who hired you petra eyed him skeptically i wont give you the money if thats what youre angling for i have no interest in your money bourne said but i think the man you shot was going to tell me something i needed to know i suspect thats why you were hired to kill him some of the skepticism leached out of her face really bourne nodded i didnt want to kill him she said you understand that you walked up to him put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger petra looked away at nothing in particular i dont want to think about it then youre no better than anyone else in dachau tears spilled over she covered her face with her hands and her shoulders shook the sounds she made were like those bourne had heard on leitenberg at length petras crying jag was spent wiping her reddened eyes with the backs of her hands she said i wanted to be a poet you know i always equated being a poet with being a revolutionary i a german wanted to change the world or at least do something to change the way the world saw us to do something to scoop that core of guilt out of us you should have become an exorcist it was a joke but such was her mood that she found nothing funny in it that would be perfect wouldnt it she looked at him with eyes still filled with tears is it so naive to want to change the world impractical might be a better word she cocked her head youre a cynic arent you when he didnt answer she went on i dont think its naive to believe that wordsthat what you writecan change things why arent you writing then he said instead of shooting people for money thats no way to earn a living she was silent for so long he wondered whether shed heard him at last she said fuck it i was hired by a man named spangler waldhes just past being a boy really no more than twentyone or two id seen him around the pubs we had coffee together once or twice he said he was attending the university majoring in entropic economics whatever that is i dont think anyone can major in entropic economics bourne said figures petra was still sniffling i have to get my bullshit meter recalibrated she shrugged i never was good with people im better off communing with the dead bourne said you cant take on the grief and rage of so many people without being buried alive she looked off at the rows of crumbling headstones what else can i do theyre forgotten now heres where the truth lies if you omit the truth isnt that worse than a lie when he didnt answer she gave a quick twitch of her shoulders and turned around now that youve been here i want to show you what the tourists see she led him back to her car drove down the deserted hill to the official dachau memorial there was a pall over what was left of the camp buildings as if the noxious emissions of the coalfired incinerators still rose and fell on the thermals like carrion birds still searching for the dead an ironwork sculpture a harrowing interpretation of skeletal prisoners made to resemble the barbed wire that had imprisoned them greeted them as they drove in inside what had once been the main administrative building was a mockup of the cells display cases of shoes and other inexpressibly sad items all that was left of the inmates these signs petra said do you see any mention of how many jews were tortured and lost their lives there one hundred and ninetythree thousand people lost their lives here the signs say theres no expiation in this were still hiding from ourselves were still a land of jewhaters no matter how often we try to stifle the impulse with righteous anger as if we have a right to be the aggrieved ones bourne might have told her that nothing in life is as simple as that except he deemed it better to let her fury burn itself out clearly she couldnt vent these views to anyone else she took him on a tour of the ovens which seemed sinister even so many years after their use they seemed alive appeared to shimmer to be part of an alternate universe overflowing with unspeakable horror at length they passed out of the crematorium and arrived at a long room the walls of which were covered with letters some written by prisoners others by families desperate for news of their loved ones as well as other notes drawings and more formal letters of inquiry all were in german none had been translated into other languages bourne read them all the aftermath of despair atrocities and death hung in these rooms unable to escape there was a different kind of silence here than the one on the leitenberg he was aware of the soft scuff of shoe soles the whisper of sneakers as tourists dragged themselves from one exhibit to another it was as if the accumulated inhumanity stifled the ability to speak or perhaps it was that wordsany wordswere both inadequate and superfluous they moved slowly down the room he could see petras lips move as she read letter after letter near the end of the wall one caught his eye quickened his pulse a sheet of paper obviously stationery contained a handwritten text complaining that the author had developed what he claimed was a gas far more effective than zyklonb but that no one at dachau administration had seen fit to answer him possibly that was because the gas was never used at dachau however what interested bourne far more was that the stationery was imprinted with the wheel of three horses heads joined in the center by the ss deaths head petra came up beside him now her brows knitted together in a frown thats damn familiar he turned to her what do you mean there was someone i used to knowold pelz he said he lived in town but i think he was homeless hed come down to the dachau air raid shelter to sleep especially in winter she pushed a stray lock of hair behind one ear he used to babble all the time you know how crazy people do as if he was talking to someone else i remember him showing me a patch with that same insignia he was talking about something called the black legion bournes pulse began to pound what did he say she shrugged you hate the nazis so much he said i wonder if you know that some things they gave birth to still exist yeah sure like the skinheads he pointed at the insignia the black legion still exists its still a danger even more so than when old pelz knew it petra shook her head he talked on and on i never knew whether he was speaking to me or to himself can you take me to him sure but who knows whether hes still alive he drank like a fish ten minutes later petra drove down augsburgerstrasse heading for the foot of a hill known as karlsburg fucking ironic she said bitterly that the one place i despise the most is now the safest place for me she pulled into the lot outside the st jakob parish church its octagonal baroque tower could be seen throughout the town next door was hцrhammers department store you see there at the side of hцrhammers she said as they clambered out of the car those steps lead down to the huge air raid bunker built into the hill but you cant get in that way leading him up the steps into st jakob she led him across the renaissance interior past the choir adjacent to the sacristy was an unobtrusive dark wooden door behind which lay a flight of stone stairs curving down to the crypt which was surprisingly small considering the size of the church above it but as petra quickly showed him there was a reason for the size beyond it lay a labyrinth of rooms and corridors the bunker she said flicking on a string of bare lightbulbs affixed to the stone wall on their right here is where my grandparents fled when your country bombed the shit out of the unofficial capital of the third reich she was speaking of munich but dachau was close enough to feel the brunt of the american air force raids if you hate your country so much bourne said why dont you leave because petra said i also love it its the mystery of being germanproud but selfhating she shrugged what can you do you play the hand fate deals you bourne knew how that felt he looked around youre familiar with this place she sighed heavily as if her fury had left her spent when i was a child my parents took me to sunday mass every week theyre godfearing people what a joke didnt god turn his face away from this place years ago anyway one sunday i was so bored i snuck away in those days i was obsessed with death can you blame me i grew up with the stench of it in my nostrils she looked up at him can you believe that im the only one i know who ever visited the memorial do you think my parents ever did my brothers my aunts and uncles my classmates please they dont even want to admit it exists seemingly weary again so i came down here to commune with the dead but i didnt see enough of them so i pushed on and what did i find dachaus bunker she put her hand on the wall moved it along the roughcut stone as caressingly as if it were a lovers flank this became my place my own private world i was only happy underground in the company of the one hundred and ninetythree thousand dead i felt them i believed that the soul of each and every one of them was trapped here it was so unfair i thought i spent my time trying to figure out how to free them i think the only way to do that bourne said is to free yourself she gestured old pelzs crash pad is this way as they picked their way along a tunnel she said its not too far he liked to be near the crypt he thought a couple of those old folks were his friends hed sit and talk to them for hours drinking away just as if they were alive and he could see them who knows maybe he could stranger things have happened after a short time the tunnel opened out into a series of rooms the odors of whiskey and stale sweat came to them its the third room on the left petra said but before they reached it the doorway was filled with a hulking body topped by a head like a bowling ball with hair standing up like the quills of a porcupine old pelzs mad eyes looked them over who goes there his voice was as thick a fog its me herr pelz petra eichen but old pelz was looking in horror at the gun on her hip the fuck it is hefting a shotgun he yelled nazi sympathizers and fired thirtyfour soraya entered the glass slipper behind kiki and ahead of deron kiki had called ahead and no sooner were they all inside than the owner drew davis came waddling over like scrooge mcduck he was a grizzled old man with white hair that stood on end as if it were shocked to see he was still alive he had an animated face with mischievous eyes a nose like a wad of chewedup gum and a broad smile honed to perfection on tv ops and stumping for local politicos as well as his good works throughout the poorer neighborhoods of the district but he possessed a warmth that was genuine he had a way of looking at you when you spoke with him that made you feel he was listening to you alone he embraced kiki while she kissed him on both cheeks and called him papa later after the introductions when they were seated at a prime table that drew davis had reserved for them after the champagne and goodies had been served kiki explained her relationship with him when i was a little girl our tribe was swept by a drought so severe that many of the elderly and newborn grew sick and died after a time a small group of white people arrived to help us they told us they were from an organization that would send us money each month after theyd set up their program in our village they had brought water but of course there wasnt enough after they left thinking of broken promises we fell into despair but true to their word water came then the rains came until we didnt need their water anymore but they never left their money went for medicines and schooling every month i along with all the other children got letters from our sponsorthe person sending the money when i was old enough i started writing back to drew and we struck up a correspondence years later when i wanted to go on to higher learning he arranged for me to travel to cape town to go to school then he sponsored me for real bringing me to the states for college and university he never asked for anything in return except that i do well in school hes like my second father they drank champagne and watched the pole dancingwhich much to sorayas surprise seemed more artful less crass than she had imagined but there were more surgically enhanced body parts in that one room than shed ever seen for the life of her she couldnt figure out why a woman would want breasts that looked and acted like balloons she continued to drink her champagne all too aware that she was taking tiny overly dainty sips shed like nothing better than to take kikis advice forget about her problems for a couple of hours kick back get drunk let herself go the only trouble was she knew it would never happen she was too controlled too closed in what i ought to do she thought morosely as she watched a redhead with gravitydefying breasts and hips that seemed unattached to the rest of her is get smashed pull off my top and do some pole dancing myself then she laughed at the absurdity of the notion shed never been that kind of person even when it might have been ageappropriate she had always been the good girlcool calculating to the point of overanalysis she glanced over at kiki whose magnificent face was lit up not only by the colored strobe lights but also by a fiercely experienced joy wasnt the good girls life drained of color of flavor soraya asked herself this thought depressed her even more but it was just the prelude because a moment later she looked up to see rob batt what the what she thought hed seen her all right and was making a beeline right at her soraya excused herself rose and walked in the other direction toward the ladies room somehow batt managed to snake his way to a position in front of her she turned on her heel threaded her way around the tables batt running up the waiters aisle from the kitchen caught up with her soraya i need to talk to you she shook him off kept going out the front door in the parking lot she heard him running after her a light sleet was falling but the wind had failed entirely the precipitation coming straight down melting on her shoulders and bare head she didnt know why shed come out here kiki had driven them from derons house so she had no car to get into maybe shed been disgusted by the sight of a man shed liked and trusted a man whod betrayed that trust whod defected to the dark side as she privately called lavalles nsa because she could no longer bear to utter the words national security agency without feeling sick to her stomach the nsa had come to stand for everything that had gone wrong in america over the last number of yearsthe power grabs the sense felt by some inside the beltway that they were entitled to do anything and everything laws of democracy be damned it all boiled down to contempt she thought these people were so sure they were right they felt nothing but contempt and perhaps even pity for those who tried to oppose them soraya wait hold on batt had caught up with her get out of here she said continuing to walk away but ive got to talk to you the hell you do we have nothing to talk about its a matter of national security soraya shaking her head in disbelief laughed bitterly and kept on walking listen youre my only hope youre the only one open enough to listen to me rolling her eyes she turned to face him youve got some fucking nerve rob go back and lick your new masters boots lavalle sold me out soraya you know that his eyes were pleading listen i made a terrible mistake i thought what i was doing would save ci soraya was so incredulous she almost laughed in his face what you dont expect me to believe that im a product of the old man i had no faith in hart i dont use the old man routine with me if you really were his product youd never have sold us out youd have hung in there become part of the solution rather than making the problem worse you didnt hear secretary halliday the guys like a goddamn force of nature i got sucked into his orbit i made a mistake okay i admit it theres no excuse for your loss of faith batt held up his hands palmsoutward youre absolutely right but for gods sake look at me now im being thoroughly punished arent i i dont know rob you tell me i have no job no prospect of getting one either my friends wont answer my calls and when i run into them on the street or a restaurant they act like you did they turn away my wifes moved out and taken the kids with her he ran his hand through his wet hair hell ive been living out of my car since it happened im a mess soraya what could be a worse punishment was it a flaw in her character that her heart went out to him soraya wondered but she showed no trace of sympathy simply stood silent waiting for him to continue listen to me he pleaded listen i dont want to listen as she began to turn away again he shoved a digital camera into her hand at least take a look at these photos soraya was about to hand it back then she figured she had nothing to lose batts camera was on and she pressed the review button what she saw was a series of surveillance photos of general kendall what the hell she said thats what ive been doing since i got canned batt said ive been trying to find a way to bring down lavalle i figured right away that he might be too tough a nut to crack quickly but kendall well hes another story she looked up into his face which shone with an inner fervor shed never seen before how dyou figure that kendalls restless and bitter chafing under lavalles yoke he wants a bigger piece of the action than either halliday or lavalle is willing to give him that desire makes him stupid and vulnerable despite herself she was intrigued what have you found out more than i couldve hoped for batt nodded at her keep going as soraya continued to scroll through the photos her heart started to hammer in her chest she peered closer is that good god its rodney feir batt nodded he and kendall met up at feirs health club then they went to dinner and now theyre here she looked up at him the two of them are here at the glass slipper those are their cars batt pointed theres a back room i dont know what goes on in there but you dont have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out general kendall is a godfearing family man goes to church with his family and lavalles every sunday like clockwork hes very active in the church very visible there soraya saw the light at the end of her own personal tunnel here was a way to get both her and tyrone off the hook two birds with one photo shoot she said yeah only trouble is how to get back there to snap em its invitation only i checked a slow smile spread across sorayas face leave that to me for what seemed a long time after kendall had kicked him until he vomited nothing happened but then tyrone had already taken note that time seemed to have slowed down to an agonizing crawl a minute was made up of a thousand seconds an hour consisted of ten thousand minutes and a daywell there were simply too many hours in a day to count during one of the periods when his hood was taken off he walked back and forth the narrow width of the room not wanting to go near the far end with its ominous waterboarding tub somewhere inside him he knew hed lost track of time that this slippage was part of the process to wear him down open him up and turn him inside out moment by moment he felt himself sliding down a slope so slick so steep that whatever he did to try to hold on to it failed he was falling into darkness into a void filled only with himself this too was calculated he could imagine one of kendalls underlings coming up with a mathematical formula for how far a subject should break down each hour of each day he was subject to incarceration ever since he had suggested to soraya that he might be useful to her hed been reading up on how to handle himself in the worst situations there was a trick hed come across that was useful to him nowhe needed to find a place in his mind where he could withdraw when the going got really rough a place that was inviolable where he knew hed be safe no matter what was done to him he had that place now hed been there several times when the pain of kneeling with his arms locked high behind him became too much even for him but there was one thing that frightened him that damn trough on the other side of the room if they decided to waterboard him he was done for as far back as he could remember hed been terrified of drowning he couldnt swim couldnt even float every time hed tried to do either hed choked had to be hauled from the water like a threeyearold hed soon given up figuring it didnt matter when was he going to go sailing or even lie on a beach never but now the water had come to him that damn trough was waiting grinning like a whale about to swallow him whole he was no jonah he knew that that fucking thing wasnt going to spit him out alive he looked down saw that the hand he held out in front of him was trembling turning away he pressed it against the wall as if the cinder block could absorb his unreasoning terror he started as the sound of the door being unlocked ricocheted around the small space in came one of the nsa zombies with dead eyes and dead breath he put down the tray of food and left without even glancing at tyrone all part of the second phase of the plan to break him down make him think he didnt exist he went over to the tray as usual his food consisted of cold oatmeal it didnt matter he was hungry taking up the plastic spoon he took a bite of the cereal it was gummy had no taste whatsoever he almost gagged on the second bite because he was chewing on something other than oatmeal aware that his every move was monitored he bent over spit out the mouthful then he used the fork to paw open a folded piece of paper there was something written on it he bent over further to make out the letters dont give up it read at first tyrone couldnt believe his eyes then he read it again after reading it a third time he scooped the message up with another bite of oatmeal chewed it all slowly and methodically and swallowed then he went over to the stainlesssteel toilet sat down on the edge and wondered who had written that note and how he could communicate with him it wasnt until some time later that he realized this one brief message from outside his tiny cell had managed to restore the balance hed lost inside his head time resolved itself into normal seconds and minutes and the blood began once again to circulate through his veins arkadin allowed devra to drag him out of the bar before he could demolish it completely not that he cared about the thuggish patrons who sat in stupefied silence watching the mayhem he wreaked as if it were a tv show but he was mindful of the cops who had a significant presence in this trashy neighborhood during the time theyd been in the bar hed noticed three police cruisers pass slowly by on the street they drove through the sunshine down littered streets he heard dogs barking voices shouting he was grateful for the heat of her hip and shoulder against him her presence grounded him wrestled his rage back down to a manageable level he hugged her more tightly to him his mind returning with feverish intensity to his past for arkadin the ninth level of hell began innocently enough with stas kuzins confirmation that his business came from prostitution and drugs easy money arkadin thought immediately lulled into a false sense of security at first his role was as simple as it was clearly defined hed provide the space in his buildings to expand kuzins brothel empire this arkadin did with his usual efficiency nothing could have been simpler and for several months as the rubles rolled in he congratulated himself on making a lucrative business deal plus his association with kuzin brought him a boatload of perks from free drinks at the local pubs to free sessions with kuzins everexpanding ring of teenage girls but it was this very thingthe young prostitutesthat became arkadins slippery slope into hells lowest level when he stayed away from the brothels or made his cursory weekly checkups to ensure the apartments werent being trashed it was easy to turn a blind eye on what was really going on he was mostly too busy counting his money however on those occasions when he availed himself of a freebie or two it was impossible not to notice how young the girls were how afraid they were how bruised their thin arms were how hollow their eyes and all too often how drugged up most of them were it was like zombie nation in there all of this might have passed arkadin by with a minimum of speculation had he not developed a liking for one of them yelena was a girl with wide lips skin as pale as snow and eyes that burned like a coal fire she had a quick smile and unlike some of the other girls she wasnt prone to bursting into tears for no apparent reason she laughed at his jokes she lay with him afterward her face buried in his chest he liked the feel of her in his arms her warmth seeped into him like fine vodka and he grew used to how she found just the right position so that the curves of her body meshed perfectly with his he could fall asleep in her arms which for him was something of a miracle he couldnt remember when hed last slept through the night about this time kuzin called him into a meeting told him he was doing so well he wanted to increase his partnership stake with arkadin of course ill need you to play a more active role kuzin said in his semiintelligible voice business is so good that what i need most now is more girls thats where you come in kuzin made arkadin the head of a crew whose sole purpose was to solicit teenage girls from the populace of nizhny tagil this arkadin did with his usual frightening efficiency his visits to yelenas bed were as plentiful but not as idyllic she had grown afraid she told him of the disappearances of some of the girls one day she saw them the next they had vanished as if theyd never existed no one spoke of them no one answered her questions when she asked where theyd gone in the main arkadin dismissed her fearsafter all the girls were young werent they leaving all the time but yelena was certain the girls disappearances had nothing to do with them and everything to do with stas kuzin no matter what he said her fears did not subside until he promised to protect her to make sure nothing happened to her after six months kuzin took him aside youre doing a great job a mixture of vodka and cocaine slurred kuzins voice even further but i need more they were in one of the brothels which to arkadins practiced eye looked oddly underpopulated where are all the girls he asked kuzin waved an arm gone run away who the fuck knows where these bitches get a bit of money in their pocket theyre off like rabbits ever the pragmatist arkadin said ill take my crew and go find them a waste of time kuzins little head bobbled on his shoulders just find me more its getting difficult arkadin pointed out some of the girls are scared they dont want to come with us take them anyway arkadin frowned i dont follow you okay moron ill lay it out for you take your fucking crew in the fucking van and snatch the bitches off the street youre talking about kidnapping kuzin laughed fuck me he gets it what about the cops kuzin laughed even harder the cops are in my pocket and even if they werent dyou think they get paid to work they dont give a rats ass for the next three weeks arkadin and his crew worked the night shift delivering girls to the brothel whether or not they wanted to come these girls were sullen often belligerent until kuzin took them into a back room where none of them ever wanted to go a second time kuzin didnt mess with their faces as that would be bad for business only their arms and legs were bruised arkadin watched this controlled violence as if through the wrong end of a telescope he knew it was happening but he pretended it had nothing to do with him he continued to count his money which was now piling up at a more rapid clip it was his money and yelena that kept him warm at night each time he was with her he checked her arms and legs for bruises when he made her promise not to take drugs she laughed leonid danilovich who has money for drugs he smiled at this knowing what she meant in fact she had more money than all the other girls in the brothel combined he knew this because he was the one who gave it to her get yourself a new dress a new pair of shoes hed tell her but frugal girl that she was shed merely smile and kiss him on the cheek with great affection she was right he realized not to do anything to call attention to herself one night not long after kuzin accosted him as he was leaving yelenas room i have an urgent problem and i need your help the freak said arkadin went with him out of the apartment building a large van was waiting on the street its engine running kuzin climbed into the back and arkadin followed two of the brothel girls were being guarded by kuzins pair of personal ghouls they tried to escape kuzin said we just caught them they need to be taught a lesson arkadin said because he assumed that was what his partner wanted him to say too fucking late for that kuzin signaled to the driver and the van took off arkadin settled back on the seat wondering where they were going he kept his mouth shut knowing that if he asked questions now hed look like a fool thirty minutes later the van slowed turned off onto an unpaved road for the next several minutes they jounced along a rutted track that must have been very narrow because branches kept scraping against the sides of the van at length they stopped the doors opened and everyone clambered out the night was very dark illuminated only by the headlights of the van but in the distance the fire of the smelters was like blood in the sky or rather on the undersides of the belching miasma churned out by hundreds of smokestacks no one saw the sky in nizhny tagil and when it snowed the flakes turned gray or even sometimes black as they passed through the industrial murk arkadin followed along with kuzin as the two ghouls pushed the girls through the thick weedy underbrush the resiny scent of pine perfumed the air so strongly it almost masked the appalling stench of decomposition a hundred yards in the ghouls pulled back on the collars of the girlss coats reining them in kuzin took out his gun and shot one of the girls in the back of the head she pitched forward into a bed of dead leaves the other girl screamed squirming within the ghouls grasp desperate to run then kuzin turned to arkadin placed the gun in his hand when you pull the trigger he said we become equal partners there was something in kuzins eyes that at this close range gave arkadin the shivers it seemed to him that kuzins eyes were smiling in the way the devil smiled without warmth without humanity because the pleasure that animated the smile was of an evil and perverted nature it was at this precise moment that arkadin thought of the prisons ringing nizhny tagil because he now knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was locked within his own private prison with no idea if there was a key let alone how to use it the gunan old luger with the nazi swastika imprinted on itwas greasy with kuzins excitement arkadin raised it to the height of the girls head she was whimpering and crying arkadin had done many things in his young life some of them unforgivable but hed never shot a girl in cold blood and yet now in order to prosper in order to survive the prison of nizhny tagil this was what he had to do he was aware of kuzins avid eyes boring into him red as the fire of nizhny tagils foundries themselves and then he felt the muzzle of a gun at the nape of his neck and knew that the driver was standing behind him no doubt on kuzins orders do it kuzin said softly because one way or another in the next ten seconds someones going to fire his gun arkadin aimed the luger the shout of the report echoed on and on through the deep and forbidding forest and the girl slid along the leaves into the pit with her friend thirtyfive the sound of the bolt being thrown on the mm mauser k rifle echoed through the dachau air raid bunker that was the end of it however damn old pelz groaned i forgot to load the thing petra took out her handgun pointed it in the air and squeezed the trigger because the result was the same as what had happened to him old pelz threw down the k scheisse he said clearly disgusted she approached him then herr pelz she said gently as i said my name is petra do you remember me the old man stopped muttering peered at her carefully you do look an awful lot like a petraalexandra i once knew petraalexandra she laughed and kissed him on the cheek yes yes thats me he recoiled a little put a hand on his cheek where shed planted her lips then skeptical to the end he looked past her at bourne whos this nazi bastard did he force you to come here his hands curled into fists ill box his ears for him no herr pelz this is a friend of mine hes russian she used the name bourne had given her which was on the passport boris karpov had provided russiansre no better than nazis in my book the old man said sourly actually im an american traveling under a russian passport bourne said this first in english and then in german you speak english very well for a russian old pelz said in excellent english then he laughed showing teeth yellowed by time and tobacco at the sight of an american he seemed to perk up as if coming out of a decadeslong drowse this was the way he was a rabbit being drawn out of a hat only to withdraw again into the shadows he wasnt mad just living both in the drab present and in the vivid past i embraced the americans when they liberated us from tyranny he continued proudly in my time i helped them root out the nazis and the nazi sympathizers pretending to be good germans he spat out the last words as if he couldnt stand to have them in his mouth then what are you doing here bourne said dont you have a home to go to sure i do old pelz smacked his lips as if he could taste the life of his younger self in fact i have a very nice house in dachau its blue and white with flowers all around a picket fence a cherry tree stands in back spreading its wings in summer the house is rented out to a fine young couple with two strapping children who send their rent check like clockwork to my nephew in leipzig hes a bigshot lawyer you know herr pelz i dont understand petra said why not stay in your own home this is no place to live the bunker is my health insurance the old man cocked a canny eye her way do you have any idea what would happen to me if i went back to my house theyd spirit me away in the night and thats the last anyone would ever see of me who would do that to you bourne said pelz seemed to consider his answer as if he needed to remember the text of a book hed read in high school i told you i was a nazi hunter a damn fine one too in those days i lived like a kingor if im honest a duke anyway thats before i got cocky and made my mistake i decided to go after the black legion and that one intemperate decision was my downfall because of them i lost everything even the trust of the americans who at that time needed those damn people more than they needed me the black legion kicked me into the gutter like a piece of garbage or a mangy dog from there it was only a short crawl down here into the bowels of the earth its the black legion i came here to talk to you about bourne said im a hunter too the black legion isnt a nazi organization anymore theyve turned into a muslim terrorist network old pelz rubbed his grizzled jaw id say im surprised but im not those bastards knew how to play all the cards in all the handsthe germans the brits and most importantly the americans they toyed with all of em after the war every western intelligence service was throwing money at them the thought of having builtin spies behind the iron curtain had them all salivating it didnt take the bastards long to figure out it was the americans who had the upper hand why cause they had all the money and unlike the brits werent being tightfisted with it he cackled but thats the american way isnt it not waiting for an answer to a question that was selfevident he plowed on so the black legion took up with the american intelligence machine first off it wasnt difficult to convince the yanks that theyd never been nazis that their only goal was to fight stalin and that was true as far as it went but after the war they had other goals in mind theyre muslims after all they never felt comfortable in western society they wanted to build for the future and like a lot of other insurgents they created their power base with american dollars he squinted up at bourne youre american poor bastard none of these modernday terrorist networks wouldve existed without your countrys backing fucking ironic that is for a time he lapsed into muttering broke into a song whose lyrics were so melancholy tears welled up in his rheumy eyes herr pelz bourne said trying to get the old man to focus you were talking about the black legion call me virgil pelz said nodding as he came out of his fugue state thats right my christian name is virgil and for you american i will hold my lamp high enough to throw light on those bastards who ruined my life why not im at a stage in my life when i should tell someone and it might as well be you theyre in the back bev said to drew davis both of them a woman in her midfifties with a thick frame and a quick wit she was the glass slippers girl wrangler as she wryly called herselfpart disciplinarian part den mother the main interest is in the general davis said isnt that right kiki kiki nodded she was closely flanked by soraya and deron and all of them were clustered in daviss cramped office up a short flight of stairs from the main room the pounding of the bass and drums thumped against the walls like the fists of angry giants the room had the appearance of an attic or a garret windowless its walls like a time machine plastered with photos of drew davis with martin luther king nelson mandela four different american presidents a host of hollywood stars and various un dignitaries and ambassadors from virtually every country in africa there was also a series of informal snapshots of him with his arm around a younger kiki in the masai mara totally unselfconscious looking like a queenintraining after her talk with rob batt in the parking lot soraya had returned to her table inside and filled in kiki and deron on her plan the noise from the band on stage made eavesdropping impossible even by anyone at the next table because of her longtime friendship with drew davis it had been up to kiki to create the spark that would light the fuse this she did resulting in this impromptu meeting in daviss office for me to even contemplate what youre asking you have to guarantee blanket immunity drew davis said to soraya plus leave our names out of it unless you want to piss me offwhich you dontas well as pissing off half the elected officials in the district you have my word soraya said we want these two people thats the beginning and the end of it drew davis glanced at kiki who responded with an almost imperceptible nod now davis turned to bev heres what you can do and what you cant do bev said reacting to her bosss cue i wont allow anyone on my ranch whos not there for legitimate purposesthat is either a patron or a working girl so forget just barging in there i do that and tomorrow we have no business left she wasnt even looking at drew davis but soraya saw him nod in assent and her heart fell everything depended on their gaining access to the general while he was in the midst of his frolics then she had a thought ill go in as a working girl she said no you wont deron said youre known to both the general and feir one look at you and theyll be spooked they dont know me everyone turned their heads to stare at kiki absolutely not deron said ease up there kiki said with a laugh im not going through with anything i just need access she mimed taking photos then she turned to bev how do i get into the generals private room you cant for obvious reasons the private rooms are sacrosanct another rule of the house and both the general and feir have chosen their partners for the evening she drummed her fingers against daviss desktop but in the case of the general there is one way virgil pelz took bourne and petra farther into the bunkers main tunnel to a roughhewn space that opened out into a circle there were benches here a small gas stove a refrigerator lucky someone forgot to turn off the electricity petra said lucky my ass pelz settled himself on a bench my nephew pays a town official under the table to keep the lights on he offered them whiskey or wine which they refused he poured himself a shot of liquor downed it perhaps to fortify himself or to keep himself from sinking back into the shadows it was obvious he liked having company that the stimulation of other humans was bringing him out of himself most of what ive already told you about the black legion is basic history if you know where to look but the key to understanding their success in negotiating the dangerous postwar landscape lies in two men farid icoupov and ibrahim sever i assume this icoupov you speak of is semion icoupovs father bourne said pelz nodded just so and did ibrahim sever have a son he had two pelz replied but im getting ahead of myself he smacked his lips glanced at the bottle of whiskey then decided against another shot farid and ibrahim were the best of friends they grew up together each the only sons in large families possibly this is what bonded them as children the bond was strong it lasted for most of their lives but ibrahim sever was a warrior at heart farid icoupov an intellectual and the seeds of discontent and mistrust must have been sown early during the war their shared leadership worked out just fine ibrahim was in charge of the black legion soldiers on the eastern front farid put in place and directed the intelligencegathering network in the soviet union it was after the war when the problems began stripped of his duties as commandant of the military end ibrahim began to fret that his power was eroding pelz clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth listen american if youre a student of history you know how the two longtime allies and friends gaius julius caesar and pompey magnus became enemies infected by the ambitions fears deceptions and power struggles of those under their respective commands so it was with these two in time ibrahim convinced himselfno doubt abetted by some of his more militant advisersthat his longtime friend was planning a power grab unlike caesar who was off in gaul when pompey declared war on him farid lived in the next house ibrahim sever and his men came in the night and assassinated farid icoupov three days later farids son semion shot ibrahim to death as he was driving to work in retaliation ibrahims son asher went after semion in a munich nightclub asher managed to escape but in the ensuing hail of gunfire ashers younger brother was killed pelz scrubbed his face with his hand you see how it goes american like an ancient roman vendetta an orgy of blood of biblical proportions i know about semion icoupov but not about sever bourne said wheres asher sever now the old man shrugged his thin shoulders who knows if icoupov did sever would surely be dead by now for a time bourne sat silent thinking about the black legions attack on the professor thinking about all the little anomalies that had been piling up in his mind the oddity of pyotrs network of decadents and incompetents the professor saying it was his idea to have the stolen plans delivered to him via the network and the question of whether mischa tarkanianand arkadin himselfwas black legion at last he said virgil i need to ask you several questions yes american pelzs eyes looked as bright and eager as a robins still bourne hesitated revealing anything of his mission or its background to a stranger violated every instinct every lesson hed been taught and yet he could see no other alternative i came to munich because a friend of minea mentor reallyasked me to go after the black legion first because theyre planning an attack against my country and second because their leader semion icoupov ordered his son pyotr killed pelz looked up a curious expression on his face asher sever gathered his power base which hed inherited from his fathera powerful intelligencegathering network strewn across asia and europeand ousted semion icoupov hasnt been running the black legion for decades if he had i doubt whether id still be down here unlike asher sever icoupov was a man you could reason with are you saying that youve met both semion icoupov and asher sever bourne said thats right pelz said nodding why bourne had gone cold as he contemplated the unthinkable could the professor have been lying to him all the time but if soif he was in fact a member of the black legionwhy in the world would he entrust the delivery of the attack plans to pyotrs shaky network surely he would have known how unreliable its members were nothing seemed to make sense knowing he had to solve this problem one step at a time he took out his cell phone scrolled through the photos brought up the one the professor had sent of egon kirsch he looked at the two men in the photo then handed the phone to pelz virgil do you recognize either of these men pelz squinted then stood and walked nearer to one of the bare lightbulbs no he shook his head then after a moments further scrutiny his forefinger jabbed at the photo i dont know because he looks so different he returned to where bourne sat turned the phone so they could both see the photo and tapped the figure of professor specter but damn id swear this one is asher sever thirtysix peter marks chief of operations was with veronica hart in her office poring over reams of personnel data sheets when they came for her luther lavalle accompanied by a pair of federal marshals had swept through ci security armed with their warrant hart had only the briefest of warningsa phone call from the first set of security guards downstairsthat her professional world was imploding no time to get out of the way of the falling debris she barely had time to tell marks then stand up to face her accusers before the three men entered her office and presented her with the federal warrant veronica rose hart the senior of the stonefaced federal marshals intoned you are hereby placed under arrest for conspiring with one jason bourne a rogue agent for purposes that violate the regulations of central intelligence on what evidence hart said nsa surveillance photos of you in the courtyard of the freer handing a packet to jason bourne the marshal said in the same zombie voice marks who was also on his feet said this is insane you cant really believe shut it mr marks luther lavalle said with no fear of contradiction one more word out of you and ill have you put under formal investigation marks was about to reply when a sharp look from the dci forced him to bite back his words his jaws clamped shut but the fury in his eyes was unmistakable hart came around the desk and the junior marshal cuffed her hands behind her back is that really necessary marks said lavalle pointed at him wordlessly as they marched hart from her office she said take over peter youre acting dci now lavalle grinned not for long if i have anything to say about it after theyd gone marks collapsed into his chair finding that his hands were trembling he clasped them together as if in prayer his heart was pounding so hard he found it difficult to think he jumped up walked over to the window behind the dcis desk stood staring out at the washington night all the monuments were lit up all the streets and avenues were filled with traffic everything was as it should be and yet nothing looked familiar he felt as if hed entered an alternate universe he couldnt have been witness to what just happened nsa couldnt be about to absorb ci into its gigantic corpus but then he turned around to find the office empty and the full horror of seeing the dci frogmarched out in handcuffs swept over him made his legs weak so that he sought out the big chair behind the desk and sat in it then the implications of where he sat and why sank in he picked up the phone and dialed stu gold cis lead counsel sit tight ill be right over gold told him in his usual nononsense voice did nothing faze him then marks began to make a series of calls it was going to be a long and harrowing night rodney feir was having the time of his life as he accompanied afrique into one of the rooms in the back of the glass slipper he felt as if he were on top of the world in fact popping a viagra he decided to ask her to do a number of things hed never tried before why the hell not he asked himself while he was undressing he thought of the information on typhons field agents peter marks had sent him via interoffice mail feir had deliberately told marks he didnt want it sent electronically because it was too insecure the info was folded into the inside pocket of his coat ready to give to general kendall before they left the glass slipper tonight he could have handed it over while they were at dinner but hed felt all things considered that a champagne toast after all their treats had been consumed was the proper way to cap off the night afrique was already on the bed spread languidly her large eyes half closed but she got right down to business as soon as feir joined her he tried to keep his mind on the proceedings but seeing as how his body was totally in it there wasnt much point he preferred dwelling on the things that made him truly happy like getting the better of peter marks when he was growing up it was people like marksand for that matter battwhod had it all over him brainiacs with brawn in other words whod made his life miserable they were the ones who had the cool circle of friends who got all the greatlooking girls who rode in cars while he was still tooling around on a scooter he was the nerd the chubbyfat reallykid who was made the butt of all their jokes who was pushed around and ostracized who despite his high iq was so tonguetied he could never stick up for himself hed joined ci as a glorified pencil pusher and yes hed worked his way up the professional ladder but not into fieldwork or counterintelligence no he was chief of field support which meant that he was in charge of gathering and distributing the paperwork generated by the very ci personnel he longed to be like his office was the central hub of supply and demand and there were days when he could convince himself that it was the nerve center of ci but most of the time he saw himself for what he really wassomeone who kept pushing electronic lists data entry forms directorate requests allocation tables budget spreadsheets personnel assignment profiles matйriel lading bills a veritable landslide of paperwork whizzing through the ci intranet a monitor of information in other words a master of nothing he was enveloped in pleasure a warm viscous friction spreading outward from his groin into his torso and limbs he closed his eyes and sighed at first being an anonymous cog in the ci machine suited him but as the years passed as he rose in the hierarchy only the old man understood his worth for it was the old man who promoted him time after time but no one elsecertainly none of the other directorssaid a word to him until they needed something then a request came flying through ci cyberspace as quick as you could say i need it yesterday if he got them what they wanted yesterday he heard nothing not even a nod of thanks in the hallway but should there be any delay at all no matter the reason theyd land on him like woodpeckers on a tree full of insects hed never hear the end of their pestering until they got what they wanted and then silence again it seemed sadly ironic to him that even in an insiders paradise like ci he was on the outside it was humiliating to be one of those stereotypical americans who time and again got sand kicked in his face how he hated himself for being a living breathing clichй it was these evenings spent with general kendall that gave his life color and meaning the clandestine meetings in the health club sauna the dinners at local barbecue joints in se and then the delicious chocolate nightcaps at the glass slipper where he was for once the insider instead of having his nose pressed to someone elses window knowing that he couldnt be transformed he had to settle for losing himself in afriques bed at the glass slipper general kendall smoking a cigar in the corral the colloquial name for the parlor room where the girls were paraded for the benefit of the patrons was enjoying himself immensely if he was thinking of his boss at all it was of the heart attack this scene he was enacting would cause lavalle as for his family they were the farthest thing from his mind unlike feir who always went for the same girl kendall was a man of diverse tastes when it came to the women of the glass slipper and why not he had virtually no choice in any other areas of his life if not here where he sat on the purple velvet sofa one arm thrown along the back watching through slitted eyes the slow parade of flesh he had already made his choice the girl was in her room undressing but when bev had come to him suggesting that he might want something a bit more specialanother girl to create a threesomehe hadnt hesitated hed been just about to make his choice when he saw someone she was impossibly tall with skin like the darkest cocoa and was so regal in her beauty that he broke out into a sweat he caught bevs eye and she came over bev was attuned to his desires i want her he said to bev pointing at the regal beauty im afraid kikis not available she said this answer made kendall want her all the more venal witch she knew him too well he produced five hundreddollar bills how about now he said bev true to form pocketed the money leave it to me she said the general watched her pick her way through the girls to where kiki was standing somewhat apart from the others while he observed the conversation his heart began to beat in his chest like a war drum he was sweating so much he was obliged to wipe his palms on the purple velvet of the sofa arm if she said no what would he do but she wasnt saying no she was looking across the corral at him with a smile that raised his temperature a couple of degrees jesus he wanted her as if in a trance he saw her coming across the room toward him her hips swaying that maddening half smile on her face he stood up with some difficulty he noted he felt like a seventeenyearold virgin kiki held out her hand and he took it terrified that shed be repulsed if it was damp but nothing interfered with that half smile there was something intensely pleasurable about allowing her to lead him past all the other girls enjoying the looks of envy on their faces which room are you in kiki murmured in a voice like honey kendall inhaling her spicy musky scent could not find his voice he pointed and again she led him as if he were on a leash until they were standing in front of the door are you sure you want two girls tonight she brushed her hip against his im more than enough for any man ive been with the general felt a delicious shiver travel down the length of his spine lodge itself like a heated arrow between his thighs reaching out he opened the door lena writhed on the bed naked he heard the door close behind him without thinking he undressed himself then he stepped out of the puddle of his clothes took kikis hand padded over to the bed he knelt on it she let go of his hand and he fell on lena he felt kikis hands on his shoulders and groaning he lost himself within lenas lush body the pleasure built along with the anticipation of kikis long lithe body pressed against his glistening back it took him some time to become aware that the quick flashes of light werent a result of the quickened firing of nerve endings behind his eyes drugged with sex and desire he was slow to turn his head directly into another battery of flashes even then negative images dancing behind his retinas his fogged brain couldnt quite piece together what was happening and his body continued to move rhythmically against lenas pliant flesh then the camera flashed again he belatedly raised his hand to shield his eyes and there was stark reality staring him in the face kiki still dressed continued to take shots of him and lena smile general she said in that sensual honeyed voice theres nothing else you can do ive got too much anger inside me petra said its like one of those flesheating diseases you read about dachau is toxic for you so is munich now bourne said youve got to go away she moved to the lefthand lane of the autobahn put on some real speed they were on their way back to munich in the car pelzs nephew had bought for him under the nephews name the police might still be looking for both of them but their only lead was petras munich apartment and neither of them had any intention of going anywhere near it as long as she didnt get out of the car bourne felt it was relatively safe for her to drive him back into the city where would i go she said leave germany altogether she laughed but it wasnt a pleasant sound turn tail and run you mean why would you see it that way because im german because i belong here the munich police are looking for you he said and if they find me then ill do my time for killing your friend she flashed her headlights so a slower car could get out of her way meanwhile i have money i can live but what will you do she gave him a lopsided smile im going to take care of virgil he needs drying out he needs a friend nearing the city she changed lanes so she could exit when she needed to the cops wont find me she said with an odd kind of certainty because im taking him far away from here virgil and me well be two outlaws learning a whole new way of life egon kirsch lived in the northern district of schwabing known as the young intellectual quarter because of the mass of university students that flooded its streets cafйs and bars as they came abreast of schwabings main plaza petra pulled over when i was younger i used to hang out here with my friends we were all militants then agitating for change and we felt connected to this place because it was from here that the freiheitsaktion bayer one of the most famed resistance groups commandeered radio munich near the end of the war they broadcast messages to the populace to seize and arrest all local nazi leaders and to signal their rejection of the regime by waving white sheets out of their windowsan action that was punishable by death by the way and they managed to save a large number of civilian lives as the american army swept in at last we find something in munich that even you can be proud of bourne said i suppose so petra laughed almost sadly but i among all of my friends was the only one who stayed a revolutionary the others are corporate functionaries or hausfraus now they lead sad gray lives i see them sometimes trudging to and from work i walk by them they dont even look up in the end they all disappointed me kirschs apartment was on the top floor of a beautiful house of stonecolored stucco arched windows and a terracotta tile roof between two of his windows was a niche holding a stone statue of the virgin mary cradling the baby jesus petra pulled into the curb in front of the building i wish you well american she said deliberately using virgil pelzs phrasing thank you for everything you may not believe it but we helped each other bourne said as he got out of the car good luck petra when shed driven off he turned went up the steps to the building and used the code kirsch had given him to open the front door the interior was neat and spotlessly clean the woodpaneled hallway gleamed with a recent waxing bourne climbed the carved wooden staircase to the top floor using kirschs key he let himself in though the apartment itself was light and airy with many windows overlooking the street it was steeped in a deep silence as if it existed on the bottom of the sea there was no tv no computer bookcases lined one entire wall of the living room holding volumes by nietzsche kant descartes heidegger leibniz and machiavelli there were also books by many of the great mathematicians biographers fiction writers and economists the other walls were covered with kirschs framed and matted line drawings so detailed and intricate that at first glance they seemed to be architectural plans but then suddenly they came into focus and bourne realized the drawings were abstracts like all good art they seemed to move back and forth from reality to an imagined dream world where anything was possible after taking a brief tour of all the rooms he settled down in a chair behind kirschs desk he thought long and hard about the professor was he dominic specter the nemesis of the black legion as he claimed to be or was he in fact asher sever the leader of the black legion if he was sever hed staged the attack on himselfan elaborate scheme that had cost a number of lives could the professor be guilty of such an irrational act if he was the leader of the black legion certainly the second question bourne had been asking himself was why the professor would entrust the stolen plans to pyotrs thoroughly undependable network but there was another enigma if the professor was sever why was he so anxious to get those plans wouldnt he already have them these two questions went around and around in bournes head without producing a satisfactory solution nothing about the situation he found himself in appeared to make sense which meant that a vital part of the picture was missing and yet he had the nagging suspicion that like egon kirschs drawings he was being shown two separate realitiesif only he could decipher which was real and which one was false at length he turned his mind to something that had been bothering him ever since the incident at the egyptian museum he knew that franz jens had been the only one to follow him into the museum so how on earth did arkadin know where he was arkadin had to have been the one to kill jens he also must have given the order to kill egon kirsch but again how did he know where kirsch was the answers to both questions were firmly rooted in time and place he hadnt been tailed to the museum then as a chill spread through him bourne went very still with no physical tail there had to be an electronic tail somewhere on his person but how had it been put there someone could have brushed up against him in the airport he rose slowly undressed as he did so he went through every item of clothing looking for an electronic tag finding nothing he dressed sat again in the chair deep in thought with his eidetic memory he went through every step of his journey from moscow to munich when he recalled the german immigration officer he realized that his passport had been out of his possession for close to half a minute taking it out of his breast pocket he began to leaf through it checking each page both by sight and by touch on the inside of the back cover stuck in the fold of the binding he found the tiny transmitter thirtyseven how wonderful it is to breathe the good night air veronica hart said as she stood on the pavement just outside the pentagon diesel fumes and all stu gold said i knew lavalles charges wouldnt stick she said as they crossed to his car theyre patently trumped up i wouldnt begin celebrating just yet the attorney said lavalles put me on notice that hes going to take those surveillance photos of you and bourne to the president tomorrow for an executive order to have you removed come on stu those were private conversations between martin lindros and a civilian moira trevor theres nothing in them lavalles banking on hot air hes got the secretary of defense gold said under the circumstances that alone is enough to make trouble for you the wind was whipping up and hart caught her hair pushed it off her face coming into ci and marching me out in cuffs lavalle made a big mistake grandstanding like that she turned looked back at the headquarters of the nsa in which shed been incarcerated for three hours until the moment gold showed up with his order from a federal judge for her temporary release hell pay for humiliating me veronica dont do anything rash gold opened the car door ushered her inside knowing lavalle as i do its more than likely that he wants you to go off halfcocked thats how fatal mistakes are made he went around the front of the car got behind the wheel and they drove off we cant let him get away with this stu unless we stop him hes going to hijack ci right out from under us she watched the virginia night turn into the district night as they crossed the arlington memorial bridge the lincoln memorial rose up before them i made a pledge when i signed on like all dcis no im talking about a personal pledge she very much wanted to see lincoln sitting on his chair contemplating all the unknowns that lay before every human being she asked gold to make a stop there i never told anyone this stu but the day i officially became dci i went to the old mans grave have you ever been to the arlington national cemetery its a sobering place but in its own way a joyous place as well so many heroes so much courage the bedrock of our freedom stu every one of us theyd come to the memorial they both got out walked up to the majestic floodlit granite statue stood gazing up into lincolns stern wise face someone had left a bouquet of flowers at his feet withered heads nodding in the wind i stayed at the old mans grave for a long time hart continued in a faraway voice i swear i could feel him i swear i felt something stir against me then inside me her gaze swung around to fix on the attorney theres a long exemplary legacy at ci stu i swore then and im swearing now that i wont let anything or anyone damage that legacy she took a breath so whatever it takes gold returned her stare without flinching do you know what youre asking yes i believe i do at last he said all right veronica its your call whatever it takes feeling invigorated and invulnerable after his workout rodney feir met general kendall in the champagne room reserved for those vips who had consummated the evenings pleasures and wanted to linger with or without their girls of course time spent in there was far more expensive with the girls than without the champagne room was decorated like a middle eastern pashas den the two men lazed on voluminous pillows while being served the bubbly of their choice this was where feir planned to hand over the intel on typhons field agents but first he wanted to luxuriate in the pure pleasure provided in the back rooms of the glass slipper after all the moment he set foot outside the real world would come crashing in on him with all its annoyances petty humiliations drudgery and the piquancy of fear that preceded every move he made to advance lavalles position visаvis ci kendall his cell phone at his right hand sat rather stiffly as befitted a military man feir thought he must be slightly uncomfortable in such lush surroundings the men chatted for a time sipping their champagne exchanging theories about steroids and baseball about the chances of the redskins making the playoffs next year the gyrations of the stock market anything but politics after a time when the bottle of champagne was nearly exhausted kendall looked at his watch what dyou have for me this was the moment feir had been keenly anticipating he couldnt wait to see the look on the generals face when he caught a glimpse of the intel reaching into the pocket in the lining of his coat he brought out the packet a lowtech hard copy was the safest way to smuggle data out of the ci building since security systems were in place to monitor the comings and goings of any device with a hard drive large enough to hold substantial data files a smile broke out across feirs face the whole enchilada every last detail on the typhon agents across the globe he held up the packet now lets talk about what i get in return what do you want kendall said without much enthusiasm a higher grade more control i want respect feir said i want lavalle to respect me the way you do a curious smile curled the generals lips i cant speak for luther but ill see what i can do as he leaned forward to take the intel feir was wondering why he was so solemnno worse than solemn he was downright glum feir was on the point of asking him about it when a tall elegant black woman began snapping a series of photos what the hell he said through the blinding string of flashes when his vision cleared he saw soraya moore standing beside them she had the packet of intel in her hand this isnt a good night for you rodney she picked up the generals cell phone thumbed it on and there was the conversation between the general and feir recorded and regurgitated so everyone could hear his treachery for themselves no i would have to say that all things considered its the end of the line im not afraid to die devra said if thats what youre worried about im not worried arkadin said what makes you think im worried she bit into the chocolate ice cream hed bought her youve got that deep vertical indentation between your eyes she wanted ice cream even though it was the middle of winter maybe it was the chocolate she wanted he thought not that it mattered pleasing her in little ways was strangely satisfyingas if in pleasing her he was also pleasing himself although that seemed like an impossibility to him im not worried he said im thoroughly pissed off because your boss told you to stay away from bourne im not going to stay away from bourne youll piss off your boss there comes a time arkadin said walking faster they were in the center of munich he wanted to be in a central location when icoupov told him where he was meeting bourne in order to get there as quickly as possible im not afraid to die devra repeated the only thing is though what do you do when you no longer have memories arkadin shot her a look what when you look at a dead person what do you see she took another bite of ice cream between her teeth leaving little indentations in what was left of the scoop nothing right not a damn thing life has flown the coop and with it all the memories that have been built up over the years she looked at him at that moment you cease to be human so what are you who gives a shit arkadin said itll be a fucking relief to be without memories soraya presented herself at the nsa safe house just before am so that by the time she cleared the various levels of security she was being ushered into the library precisely on time breakfast madam willard asked as he escorted her across the plush carpet i believe i will today she said a fines herbes omelet would be nice do you have a baguette we do indeed madam fine she shifted the evidence damning general kendall from one hand to the other and a pot of ceylon tea willard thank you she walked the rest of the way to where luther lavalle sat drinking his morning cup of coffee he stared out the window casting a jaundiced eye on the early spring it was so warm the fireplace held only cold white ash he did not turn when she sat down she placed the evidence file on her lap then said without preamble ive come to take tyrone home lavalle ignored her theres nothing on your black legion theres no unusual terrorist activities inside the us weve come up blank did you hear what i said ive come for tyrone thats not going to happen lavalle said soraya brought out kendalls cell phone played back the conversation hed had with rodney feir in the champagne room of the glass slipper every last detail on the typhon agents across the globe came feirs voice now lets talk about what i get in return general kendall what do you want a higher grade more control feir i want respect i want lavalle to respect me the way you do who cares lavalles head swung around his eyes were dark and glassy thats feirs problem not mine maybe so soraya slid the file across the table toward him however this is very much your problem lavalle stared at her for a moment his eyes were now full of venom without lowering his gaze he reached out flipped open the file there he saw photo after photo of general kendall naked as sin caught in the midst of having intercourse with a young black woman how is that going to look for the career officer and devout christian family man when the story comes out willard arrived with her breakfast snapping down a starched white tablecloth setting the china and silverware in a precise pattern in front of her when he was finished he turned to lavalle anything for you sir lavalle shooed him away with a curt flick of his hand for a time he did nothing more than leaf through the photos again then he took out a cell phone placed it on the table and pushed it toward her call bourne he said soraya froze with a forkful of omelet halfway to her mouth i beg your pardon i know hes in munich our substation there picked him up on their cctv monitoring of the airport i have men in place to take him into custody all thats needed now is for you to set the trap she laughed as she set down her fork youre dreaming lavalle i have you not the other way around if these photos become public your righthand man will be ruined both professionally and personally you and i both know youre not going to allow that to happen lavalle gathered up the photos slid them back into the envelope then he took out a pen wrote a name and address on the front of the envelope when willard glided over at his beckoning lavalle said please have these scanned and sent electronically to the drudge report then have a courier deliver them to the washington post as soon as possible very good sir willard tucked the envelope under his arm vanished into another part of the library then lavalle took out his cell phone dialed a local number gus this is luther lavalle fine fine hows ginnie good give her my love the kids as well listen gus i have a situation here evidence has come to light regarding general kendall thats right hes been the target of an internal investigation for some months now effective immediately hes been terminated from my command from the nsa in toto well youll see im having the photos messengered over to you even as we speak of course its an exclusive gus frankly im shocked truly shocked you will be too when you see these photos ill have an official statement over to you within forty minutes yes of course no need to thank me gus i always think of you first soraya watched this performance with a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach that grew from an icy ball into an iceberg of disbelief how could you she said when lavalle finished his call kendalls your second in command your friend you and he go to church together with your families every sunday i have no permanent friends or allies i only have permanent interests lavalle said flatly youll be a damn sight better director when you learn that she then drew out another set of photos this one showing feir handing a packet to general kendall that packet she said details the number and locations of typhon field personnel lavalles disdainful expression didnt change whats that to me for the second time soraya struggled to hide her astonishment thats your second in command taking possession of classified ci intel on that score you should see to your own people are you denying that you gave general kendall orders to cultivate rodney feir as a mole yes i am soraya was almost breathless i dont believe you lavalle produced an icy smile i doesnt matter what you believe director only the facts matter he flicked the photo away with his fingernail whatever general kendall did he did on his own i have no knowledge of it soraya was wondering how everything could have gone so wrong when once again lavalle pushed the phone across the table now call bourne she felt as if there were a steel band around her chest the blood was singing in her ears now what she said to herself dear god what can i do she heard someone with her voice say what should i tell him lavalle produced a slip of paper with a time and an address on it he needs to go here at this time tell him that youre in munich that you have information vital to the black legions attack that he has to see it for himself sorayas hand was so slick with sweat she wiped it on her napkin hell be suspicious if i dont call him on my own phone in fact he might not answer if i dont because he wont know its me lavalle nodded but when she produced her phone he said im going to listen to every word you say if you try to warn him i promise your friend tyrone will never leave this building alive clear she nodded but did nothing observing her like a frog split open on a dissecting table lavalle said i know you dont want to do this director i know how badly you dont want to do this but you will call bourne and you will set the trap for me because im stronger than you are by that i mean my will i get what i want director at any cost but not youyou care too much to have a long career in intelligence work youre doomed and you know it soraya had stopped listening to him after the first few words acutely aware that she had vowed to take control of the situation to somehow turn disaster into victory she was furiously marshaling her forces one step at a time she told herself now i have to clear my mind of tyrone of the failed ploy with kendall of my own guilt i have to think of this call now how am i going to make the call and keep jason from being captured it seemed an impossible task but that kind of thinking was defeatist totally unhelpful stillwhat was she to do after your call lavalle said youll stay here under constant surveillance until after bourne is taken into custody uncomfortably aware of his avid eyes on her she flipped open her phone and called jason when she heard his voice she said hi its me soraya bourne was standing in egon kirschs apartment staring down at the street when his cell phone rang he saw sorayas number come up on the screen answered the call and heard her say hi its me soraya where are you actually im in munich he perched on the arm of an upholstered chair actually in munich thats what i said he frowned hearing echoes in his head from far away im surprised not as much as i am you came up on the ci surveillance grid at the airport there was no help for it im sure not anyway im not over here on official ci business weve been continuing to monitor the black legion communications and at last we got a breakthrough he stood up what is it the phones too insecure she said we should meet she told him the place and the time glancing at his watch he said thats a little over an hour from now right as rain i can make it can you i think i can manage he said see you he disconnected went over to the window leaned on the sash replaying the conversation word by word in his mind he felt the jolt of a dislocation as if he had moved outside his body experiencing something that had happened to someone else his mind recording a seismic shift in its neurons was struggling with a memory bourne knew hed had this conversation before but for the life of him he couldnt remember where or when or what significance it might have for him now he would have continued on with his fruitless search had not the downstairs bell rang turning from the window he went across the living room pressed the button that released the outer doors lock the time had finally come when he and arkadin would meet facetofacethe assassin of legend who specialized in killing killers who had slipped in and out of a russian highsecurity prison without anyone being the wiser who had managed to eliminate pyotr and his entire network there was a knock on the door he kept away from the spy hole kept away from the door itself unlatching it from the side there was no gunshot no splintering of the wood and metal instead the door opened inward and a dapper man with dark skin and a spadeshaped beard stepped into the apartment bourne said turn around slowly the man hands where bourne could see them turned to face him it was semion icoupov bourne he said bourne produced his passport opened it to the inside cover icoupov nodded i see is this where you kill me at the behest of dominic specter you mean asher sever oh dear icoupov said there goes my surprise he smiled i confess im shocked nevertheless i congratulate you mr bourne youve come by knowledge no one else has by what means is a complete mystery lets keep it that way bourne said no matter whats important is that i dont have to waste time trying to convince you that sever has played you since youve already uncovered his lies we can move on to the next stage what makes you think im going to listen to anything you have to say if youve discovered severs lies then you know the recent history of the black legion you know we were once like brothers you know how deep the enmity between us runs we are enemies sever and i there can be only one outcome to our war you understand me bourne said nothing i want to help you stop his people from attacking your country is that clear enough he shrugged yes of course youre right to be skeptical i would be if i was in your place he moved his left hand very slowly to the edge of his overcoat pulled it back to reveal the lining there was something sticking out of the slit pocket perhaps before anything untoward happens you should take a look at what i have here bourne leaned in took the sig sauer icoupov had holstered at his belt then he pulled the packet free as he was opening it up icoupov said i went to a great deal of trouble to steal those from my nemesis bourne found himself looking over the architectural plans for the empire state building when he glanced up he found icoupov watching him intently this is what the black legion means to attack do you know when indeed i do icoupov glanced at his watch precisely thirtythree hours twentysix minutes from now thirtyeight veronica hart was looking at the drudge report when stu gold escorted general kendall into her office she was sitting in front of her desk the monitor turned toward the door so kendall could get a clear view of the photos of him and the woman from the glass slipper thats just one site she said waving them to three chairs that had been arranged opposite her there are so many others when her guests were seated she addressed kendall whatever is your family going to say general your minister and the congregation her expression remained neutral she was careful to keep the gloat out of her voice i understand that a goodly number of them arent fond of african americans even as maids and nannies they prefer the eastern europeansyoung blond polish and russian women isnt that right kendall said nothing sat with his back ramrodstraight his hands clasped primly between his knees as if he were at a courtmartial hart wished soraya were here but she hadnt returned from the nsa safe house which was worrying enough she wasnt answering her cell either ive suggested that the best thing he can do now is to help us tie lavalle in to the plot to steal ci secrets gold said now hart smiled rather sweetly at kendall and what do you think of that suggestion general recruiting rodney feir was entirely my idea kendall said woodenly hart sat forward you want us to believe youd embark on such a risky course without informing your superior after the fiasco with batt i had to do something to prove my worth i felt i had the best chance romancing feir this is getting us nowhere hart said gold stood up i agree the general has made up his mind to fall on his sword for the man who sold him down the river he moved to the door im not sure how that computes but it takes all kinds is that it kendall looked straight ahead are you done with me we are hart said but rob batt isnt batts name got a reaction out of the general batt what does he have to do with anything hes out of the picture i dont think so hart got up stood behind his chair batts had you under surveillance from the moment you ruined his life those photos of you and feir going in and out of the health club the barbecue joint and the glass slipper were taken by him but thats not all he has gold lifted his briefcase meaningfully so hart said im afraid your stay at ci will continue awhile longer how much longer what do you care hart said you no longer have a life to go back to while kendall remained with two armed agents hart and gold went next door where rodney feir was sitting guarded by another pair of agents is the general having fun yet feir said as they took seats facing him this is a black day for him he chuckled at his own joke but no one else did do you have any idea how serious your situation is gold said feir smiled i do believe i have a handle on the situation gold and hart exchanged a glance neither could understand feirs lighthearted attitude gold said youre going to jail for a very long time mr feir feir crossed one leg over the other i think not you think wrong gold said rodney we have you stealing typhon secrets and handing them over to a ranking member of a rival intelligence organization please feir said im fully aware of what i did and that you caught me at it what im saying is none of that matters he continued to look like the cheshire cat as if he held a royal flush to their four aces explain yourself gold said curtly i fucked up feir said but im not sorry for what i did only that i got caught that attitude will certainly help your case hart said caustically she was done being manhandled by luther lavalle and his cohorts im not by nature prone to being contrite director but like your evidence my attitude is of no import i mean to say if i were contrite like rob batt would it make any difference to you he shook his head so lets not bullshit each other what i did how i feel about it is in the past lets talk about the future you have no future hart said tartly that remains to be seen feir kept his maddening smile trained on her what im proposing is a barter gold was incredulous you want to make a deal lets call it a fair exchange feir said you drop all charges against me give me a generous severance package and a letter of recommendation i can take into the private sector anything else hart said how about a summer house on the chesapeake and a yacht to go with it a generous offer feir said with a perfectly straight face but im not a pig director gold rose this is intolerable behavior feir eyed him dont get your knickers in a twist counselor you havent heard my side of the exchange not interested gold signaled the two agents take him back down to the holding cell i wouldnt do that if i were you feir didnt struggle as the agents grabbed hold of either arm and hauled him to his feet he turned to hart director did you ever wonder why luther lavalle didnt try a run at ci while the old man was alive i didnt have to i know the old man was too powerful too well connected true enough but theres another more specific reason feir looked from one agent to the other hart wanted to wring his neck let him go she said gold stepped forward director i strongly recommend no harm in hearing the man out stu hart nodded go ahead rodney you have one minute the fact is lavalle tried several times to make a run at ci while the old man was in charge he failed every time and do you know why feir looked from one to the other the cheshire cat grin back on his face because for years the old man has had a deepcover mole inside the nsa hart goggled at him what this is bullshit gold said hes blowing smoke up our ass good guess counselor but wrong i know the identity of the mole how on earth would you know that rodney feir laughed sometimesnot very often i admitit pays to be cis chief file clerk thats hardly what you thats precisely what i am director a storm cloud of deepseated anger momentarily shook him no fancy title can obscure the fact he waved a hand his flash of rage quickly banked to embers but no matter the point is i see things in ci no one else does the old man had contingencies in place should he be killed but you know this better than i do counselor dont you gold turned to hart the old man left a number of sealed envelopes addressed to different directors in the event of his sudden demise one of those envelopes feir said the one with the identity of the mole inside nsa was sent to rob batt which made sense at the time since batt was chief of operations but it never got to batt i saw to that you hart was so enraged that she could barely speak i could say that id already begun to suspect that batt was working for the nsa feir said but that would be a lie so you held on to it even after i was appointed leverage director i figured that sooner or later id need my get out of jail free card there was the smile that made hart want to bury her fist in his face with an effort she restrained herself and meanwhile you let lavalle trample all over us because of you i was led out of my office in handcuffs because of you the old mans legacy is a hairs breadth from being buried yeah well these things happen what can you do ill tell you what i can do hart said signaling the agents who grabbed feir again i can tell you to go to hell i can tell you that youll spend the rest of your life in jail even then feir appeared unfazed i said i knew who the mole is director furthermoreand i believe this will be of especial interest youi know where hes stationed hart was too enraged to care get him out of my sight as he was being led to the door feir said hes inside the nsa safe house the dci felt her heart thumping hard in her chest feirs goddamn smile was not only understandable now it was warranted thirtythree hours twentysix minutes from now icoupovs ominous words were still ringing in bournes ears when he saw a flicker of movement he and icoupov were standing in the foyer the front door was still open and a shadow had for a moment stained the opposite wall of the hallway someone was out there shielded by the halfopen door bourne continuing to talk to icoupov took the other man by his elbow and moved him back into the living room across the rug toward the hallway to the bedrooms and bath as they passed one of the windows it exploded inward with the force of a man swinging through bourne whirled the sig sauer hed taken from icoupov coming to bear on the intruder put the sig down a female voice said from behind him he turned his head to see that the figure in the hallwaya young pale womanwas aiming a luger at his head leonid what are you doing here icoupov seemed apoplectic i gave you express orders its bourne arkadin advanced through the welter of glass littering the floor it was bourne who killed mischa is this true icoupov turned on bourne you killed mikhail tarkanian he left me no choice bourne said devra her luger aimed squarely at bournes head said drop the sig i wont say it again icoupov reached out toward bourne ill take it stay where you are arkadin ordered his own luger was aimed at icoupov leonid what are you doing arkadin ignored him do as the lady says bourne drop the sig bourne did as he was told the moment he let go of the gun arkadin tossed his luger aside and leapt at bourne bourne raised a forearm in time to block arkadins knee but he felt the jolt all the way up into his shoulder they traded punishing blows clever feints and defensive blocks for each move he employed arkadin had the perfect counter and vice versa when he stared into the russians eyes he saw his darkest deeds reflected back at him all the death and destruction that lay in his wake in those implacable eyes there was a void blacker than a starless night they moved across the living room as bourne gave way until they passed under the archway separating the living room from the rest of the apartment in the kitchen arkadin grabbed a cleaver swung it at bourne dodging away from the executioners lethal arc bourne reached for a wooden block that held several carving knives arkadin brought the cleaver down on the countertop missing bournes fingers by less than an inch now he blocked the way to the knives swinging the cleaver back and forth like a scythe reaping wheat bourne was near the sink snatching a plate out of the dish rack he hurled it like a frisbee forcing arkadin to duck out of the way as the plate shattered against the wall behind arkadin bourne withdrew a carving knife like a sword out of its scabbard steel clashed against steel until bourne used the knife to stab directly at arkadins stomach arkadin brought the cleaver down precisely at the place where bourne was gripping the knife and he had to let go the knife rang as it hit the floor then arkadin rushed bourne and the two closed together bourne managed to keep the cleaver away and at such close quarters it was impossible to swing it back and forth realizing it had become a liability arkadin dropped it for three long minutes they were locked together in a kind of double death grip bloody and bruised neither managed to gain the upper hand bourne had never encountered someone of arkadins physical and mental skill someone who was so much like him fighting arkadin was like fighting a mirror image of himself one he didnt care for he felt as if he stood on the precipice of something terrible a chasm filled with endless dread where no life could survive he felt arkadin had reached out to pull him into this abyss as if to show him the desolation that lurked behind his own eyes the grisly image of his forgotten past reflected back at him with a supreme effort bourne broke arkadins hold slammed his fist against the russians ear arkadin recoiled back against a column and bourne sprinted out of the kitchen down the hall as he did so he heard the unmistakable sound of someone racking the slide and he flung himself headlong into the main bedroom a shot splintered the wooden door frame just over his head scrambling up he headed straight for kirschs closet even as he heard arkadin shout to the pale woman to hold her fire pushing aside a rack of clothes on hangers bourne scrabbled at the plywood panel in the rear wall of the closet searching for the clips kirsch had described to him at the museum just as he heard arkadin rush into the bedroom he turned the clips removed the panel and crouching almost double stepped through into a world filled to overflowing with shadow when devra turned around after her attempt to wound bourne she found herself looking at the muzzle of the sig sauer that icoupov had retrieved from the floor you fool icoupov said you and your boyfriend are going to fuck everything up what leonid is doing is his own business she said thats the nature of the mistake icoupov said leonid has no business of his own everything he is he owes to me she stepped out of the shadows of the hallway into the living room the luger at her hip was pointed at icoupov hes quits with you she said his servitude is done icoupov laughed is that what he told you its what i told him then youre a bigger fool than i thought they circled each other wary of the slightest move even so devra managed an icy smile hes changed since he left moscow hes a different person icoupov made a dismissive sound in the back of his throat the first thing you need to get through your head is that leonid is incapable of change i know this better than anyone because i spent so many years trying to make him a better person i failed everyone who tried failed and do you know why because leonid isnt whole somewhere in the days and nights of nizhny tagil he was fractured all the czars horses and all the czars men cant put him back together again the pieces no longer fit he gestured with the sig sauers barrel get out now get out while you can otherwise i promise you hell kill you like he killed all the others who tried to get close to him how deluded you are devra spat youre like all your kind corrupted by power youve spent so many years removed from life on the streets youve created your own reality one that moves only to the wave of your own hand she took a step toward him which prompted a tense response from him think you can kill me before i kill you i wouldnt count on it she tossed her head anyway you have more to lose than i do i was already half dead when leonid found me ah i see it now icoupov nodded hes saved you from yourself hes saved you from the streets is that it leonid is my protector god in heaven talk about deluded devras icy smile widened one of us is fatally mistaken it remains to be seen which one the room is filled with mannequins egon kirsch had said when hed described his studio to bourne i keep the light out with blackout shades because these mannequins are my creation i built them from the ground up so to speak theyre my companions you might say as well as my creations in that sense they can see or if you like i believe that they have the gift of sight and what creature can look upon his creator without going mad or blind or both with the map of the room in his mind bourne crept through the studio avoiding the mannequins so as not to make noise or as kirsch might have said so as not to disturb the process of their birth you think im insane hed said to bourne in the museum not that it matters to all artistssuccessful or nottheir creations are alive im no different its simply that after struggling for years to bring abstractions to life ive given my work human form hearing a sound bourne froze for a moment then peered around a mannequins thigh his eyes had adjusted to the extreme gloom and he could see movement arkadin had found the panel and had come through into the studio after him bourne liked his chances here far better than in kirschs apartment he knew the layout the darkness would help him and if he struck quickly hed have the advantage of being able to see where arkadin couldnt with that strategy in mind he moved out from behind the mannequin picked his way toward the russian the studio was like a minefield there were three mannequins between him and arkadin all set at different angles and poses one was sitting holding a small painting as if reading a book another was standing spreadlegged in a classic shooters pose the third was running leaning forward as if stretching to cross the finish line bourne moved around the runner arkadin was crouched down on his hams wisely staying in one place until his eyes adjusted it was precisely what bourne had done when hed entered the studio moments before once again bourne was struck by the eerie mirror image that arkadin represented there was no pleasure and a great deal of anxiety at the most primitive level in watching yourself do his best to find you and kill you picking up his pace bourne negotiated the space to where the mannequin sat reading his painting keenly aware that he was running out of time bourne moved stealthily abreast of the shooter just as he was about to lunge at arkadin his cell phone buzzed the screen lighting up with moiras number with a silent curse bourne sprang arkadin alert for even the tiniest anomaly turned defensively toward the sound and bourne was met with a solid wall of muscle behind which was a murderous will of fiery intensity arkadin swung bourne slid backward between the legs of the shooter mannequin as arkadin came after him he ran right into the mannequins hips recoiling with a curse he swung at the mannequin the blade struck the acrylic skin and lodged in the sheet metal underneath bourne kicked out while arkadin was trying to pull the blade free and made contact with the left side of his chest arkadin tried to roll away bourne jammed his shoulder against the back of the shooter it was extremely heavy he put all of his strength into it and the mannequin tipped over trapping arkadin underneath your friend gave me no choice bourne said he wouldve killed me if i hadnt stopped him he was too far away i had to throw the knife a sound like the crackle of a fire came from arkadin it took a moment for bourne to realize it was laughter ill make you a bet bourne before he died i bet mischa said you were a dead man bourne was about to answer him when he saw the dim glint of a sig sauer mosquito in arkadins hand he ducked just before the bullet whizzed over his head he was right bourne twisted away dodging around the other mannequins using them as cover even as arkadin squeezed off three more rounds plaster wood and acrylic shattered near bournes left shoulder and ear before he dived behind kirschs worktable behind him he could hear arkadins grunts combined with the screech of metal as he worked to free himself from the fallen shooter bourne knew from kirschs description that the front door was to the left scrambling up he dashed around the corner as arkadin fired another shot a chunk of plaster and lath disintegrated where the impacted the corner reaching the door bourne unlocked it pulled it open and sprinted out into the hallway the open door to kirschs apartment loomed to his left no good can come of us training guns on each other icoupov said lets try to reason through this situation rationally thats your problem devra said life isnt rational its fuckedup chaos its part of the delusion power makes you think you can control everything but you cant no one can you and leonid think you know what youre doing but youre wrong no one operates in a vacuum if you kill bourne it will have terrible repercussions repercussions for you not for us this is what power does you think in shortcuts expediency political opportunities corruption without end it was at that moment they both heard the gunshots but only devra knew they came from arkadins mosquito she could sense icoupovs finger tighten around the sigs trigger and she went into a semicrouch because she knew if bourne appeared rather than arkadin she would shoot him dead the situation had reached a boiling point and icoupov was clearly worried devra i beg you to reconsider leonid doesnt know the whole picture i need bourne alive what he did to mischa was despicable but personal feelings have no place in this equation so much planning so much spilled blood will come to nothing if leonid kills bourne you must let me stop it ill give you anythinganything you want do you think you can buy me money means nothing to me what i want is leonid devra said just as bourne appeared through the front doorway devra and icoupov both turned devra screamed because she knew or she thought she knew that arkadin was dead and so she redirected the luger from icoupov to bourne bourne ducked back into the hallway and she fired shot after shot at him as she walked toward the door because her focus was entirely concentrated on bourne she took her eyes off icoupov and so missed the crucial movement as he swung the sig in her direction i warned you he said as he shot her in the chest she fell onto her back why didnt you listen icoupov said as he shot her again devra made a little sound as her body arched up icoupov stood over her how could you let yourself be seduced by such a monster he said devra stared up at him with redrimmed eyes blood pumped out of her with every labored beat of her heart thats exactly what i asked him about you each ragged breath filled her with indescribable pain hes not a monster but if he were youd be so much worse her hand twitched icoupov caught up in her words paid no attention until the bullet she fired from her luger struck his right shoulder he spun back against the wall the pain caused him to drop the sig seeing her struggling to fire again he turned and ran out of the apartment fleeing down the stairwell and out onto the street thirtynine willard relaxing in the stewards lounge adjacent to the library of the nsa safe house was enjoying his sweet and milky midmorning cup of coffee while reading the washington post when his cell phone buzzed he checked it saw that it was from his son oren of course it wasnt actually from oren but willard was the only one who knew that he put down the paper watched as the photo appeared on the phones screen it was of two people standing in front of a rural church its steeple rising up into the top margin of the photo he had no idea who the people were or where they were but these things were irrelevant there were six ciphers in his head this photo told him which one to use the two figures plus the steeple meant he was to use cipher three if for instance the two people were in front of an arch hed subtract one from two instead of adding to it there were other visual cues a brick building meant divide the number of figures by two a bridge multiply by two and so on willard deleted the photo from his phone then picked up the third section of the post and began to read the first story on page three starting with the third word he began to decipher the message that was his call to action as he moved through the article substituting certain letters for others as the protocol dictated he felt a profound stirring inside him he had been the old mans eyes and ears inside the nsa for three decades and the old mans sudden death last year had saddened him deeply then he had witnessed luther lavalles latest run at ci and had waited for his phone to ring but for months his desire to see another photo fill his screen had been inexplicably unfulfilled he simply couldnt understand why the new dci wasnt making use of him had he fallen between the cracks did veronica hart not know he existed it certainly seemed that way especially after lavalle had trapped soraya moore and her compatriot who was still incarcerated belowdecks as willard privately called the rendition cells in the basement hed done what he could for the young man named tyrone though god knows it was little enough yet he knew that even the smallest sign of hopethe knowledge that you werent alonewas enough to reinvigorate a stalwart heart and if he was any judge of character tyrone had a stalwart heart willard had always wanted to be an actorfor many years olivier had been his godbut in his wildest dreams hed never imagined his acting career would be in the political arena hed gotten into it by accident playing a role in his college company henry v to be exact one of shakespeares great tragic politicians as the old man said to him when hed come backstage to congratulate willard henrys betrayal of falstaff is political rather than personal and ends in success how would you like to do that in real life the old man had asked him hed come to willards college to recruit for ci he said he often found his people in the most unlikely places finished with the deciphering willard had his immediate instructions and he thanked the powers that be that he hadnt been tossed aside with the old mans trash he felt like his old friend henry v though more than thirty years had passed since hed trod a theater stage once again he was being called on to play his greatest role one that he wore as effortlessly as a second skin he folded the paper away under one arm took up his cell phone and went out of the lounge he still had twenty minutes left on his break more than enough time to do what was required of him what he had been ordered to do was find the digital camera tyrone had on him when hed been captured poking his head into the library he satisfied himself that lavalle was still sitting in his accustomed spot opposite soraya moore then he went down the hall though the old man had recruited him it was alex conklin who had trained him conklin the old man had told him was the best at what he did namely preparing agents to be put into the field it didnt take him long to learn that though conklin was renowned inside ci for training wetwork agents he was also adept at coaching sleeper agents willard spent almost a year with conklin though never at ci headquarters he was part of treadstone conklins project that was so secret even most ci personnel was unaware of its existence it was of paramount importance that he have no overt association with ci because the role the old man had planned for him was inside the nsa his background check had to be able to withstand the most vigorous scrutiny all this flashed through willards mind as he walked the sacrosanct hallways and corridors of the nsas safe house he passed agent after agent and knew that hed done his job to perfection he was the indispensable nobody the person who was always present whom no one noticed he knew where tyrones camera was because hed been there when kendall and lavalle had spoken about its disposition but even if he hadnt hed have suspected where lavalle had hidden it he knew for instance that it wouldnt have been allowed to leave the safe house even on lavalles person unless the damaging images tyrone had taken of the rendition cells and the waterboarding tanks had been transferred to the inhouse computer server or deleted off the cameras drive in fact there was a chance that the images had been deleted but he doubted it in the short amount of time the camera had been in the nsas possession kendall was no longer in residence and lavalle had become obsessed with coercing soraya moore into giving him jason bourne he knew all about bourne hed read the treadstone files even the ones that no longer existed having been shredded and then burned when the information they held became too dangerous for conklin as well as for ci he knew there had been far more to treadstone than even the old man knew that was conklins doing hed been a man for whom the word secrecy was the holy grail what his ultimate plan for treadstone had been was anyones guess inserting his passkey into the lock on lavalles office door he punched in the proper electronic code willard knew everyones codewhat use would he be as a sleeper agent otherwise the door opened inward and he slipped inside shutting and locking it behind him crossing to lavalles desk he opened the drawers one by one checking for false backs or bottoms finding none he moved on to the bookcase the sideboard with its hanging files and liquor bottles side by side he lifted the prints off the walls searching behind them for a hidden cache but there was nothing he sat on a corner of the desk contemplated the room unconsciously swinging his leg back and forth while he tried to work out where lavalle had hidden the camera all at once he heard the sound the heel of his shoe made against the skirt of the desk hopping off he went around crawled into the kneehole and rapped on the skirt until he replicated the sound his heel had made yes he was certain now this part of the skirt was hollow feeling around with his fingertips he discovered the tiny latch pushed it aside and swung open the door there was tyrones camera he was reaching for it when he heard the scratch of metal on metal lavalle was at the door tell me you love me leonid danilovich devra smiled up at him as he knelt over her what happened devra what happened was all he could say hed extricated himself at last from the sculpture and would have gone after bournebut hed heard the shots coming from kirschs apartment then the sound of running feet the living room was spattered with blood he saw her lying on the floor the luger still in her hand her shirt was dyed red leonid danilovich shed called his name when he appeared in her limited field of vision i waited for you she started to tell him what had happened but blood bubbles formed at the corners of her mouth and she started to gurgle horribly arkadin lifted her head off the floor cradled it on his thighs he pushed matted hair off her forehead and cheeks leaving red streaks like war paint she tried to continue stopped her eyes went out of focus and he thought hed lost her then they cleared her smile returned and she said do you love me leonid he bent down and whispered her in ear was it i love you there was so much static in his head he couldnt hear himself did he love her and if he did what would it mean did it even matter hed promised to protect her and failed he stared down into her eyes into her smile but all he saw was his own past rising up to engulf him once again i need more money yelena said one night as she lay entangled with him what for i give you enough as it is i hate it here its like a prison girls are crying all the time theyre beaten and then they disappear i used to make friends just to pass the time to have something to do during the day but now i dont bother whats the point theyre gone within a week arkadin had become aware of kuzins seemingly insatiable need for more girls i dont see how any of this has to do with you needing more money if i cant have friends yelena said i want drugs i told you no drugs arkadin said as he rolled away from her and sat up if you love me youll get me out of here love he turned to stare at her who said anything about love she started to cry i want to live with you leonid i want to be with you always feeling something unknown close around his throat arkadin stood up backed away jesus he said gathering up his clothes where do you get such ideas leaving her to her pitiful weeping he went out to procure more girls before he reached the front door of the brothel stas kuzin intercepted him yelenas wailing is disturbing the other girls he said in his hissing way its bad for business she wants to live with me arkadin said can you imagine kuzin laughed the sound like nails screeching against a blackboard im wondering what would be worse the nagging wife wanting to know where you were all night or the caterwauling brats making it impossible to sleep they both laughed at the comment and arkadin thought nothing more about it for the next three days he worked steadily methodically combing nizhny tagil for more girls to restock the brothel at the end of that time he slept for twenty hours then went straight to yelenas room he found another girl one hed recently hijacked off the streets sleeping in yelenas bed wheres yelena he said throwing off the covers she looked up at him blinking like a bat in sunlight whos yelena she said in a voice husky with sleep arkadin strode out of the room and into stas kuzins office the big man sat behind a gray metal desk talking on the phone but he beckoned arkadin to take a seat while he finished his call arkadin preferring to stand gripped the back of a wooden chair leaning forward over its ladder back at length kuzin put down the receiver said what can i do for you my friend wheres yelena who kuzins frown knit his brows together making him look something like a cyclops oh yes the wailer he smiled theres no chance of her bothering you again what does that mean why ask a question to which you already know the answer kuzins phone rang and he answered it hold the fuck on he said into it then he looked up at his partner tonight well go to dinner to celebrate your freedom leonid danilovich well make a real night of it eh then he returned to his call arkadin felt frozen in time as if he was now doomed to relive this moment for the rest of his life mute he walked like an automaton out of the office out of the brothel out of the building he owned with kuzin without even thinking he got into his car drove north into the forest of dripping firs and weeping hemlocks there was no sun in the sky the horizon was rimmed with smokestacks the air was hazed with carbon and sulfur particles tinged a lurid orangered as if everything were on fire arkadin pulled off the road and walked down the rutted track following the route the van had taken previously somewhere along the line he found that he was running as fast as he could through the evergreens the stench of decay and decomposition billowing up as if eager to meet him he brought himself up abruptly at the edge of the pit in places sacks of quicklime had been shaken out in order to aid the decomposition nevertheless it was impossible to mistake the content his eyes roved over the bodies until he found her yelena was lying in a tangle where shed landed after being kicked over the side several very large rats were picking their way toward her arkadin staring into the mouth of hell gave a little cry the sound a puppy might make if you mistakenly stepped on its paw scrambling down the side he ignored the appalling stench and through watering eyes dragged her up the slope laid her out on the forest floor the bed of brown needles soft as her own then he trudged back to the car opened the trunk and took out a shovel he buried her half a mile away from the pit in a small clearing that was private and peaceful he carried her over his shoulder the whole way and by the time he was finished he smelled like death at that moment crouched on his hamstrings his face streaked with sweat and dirt he doubted whether hed ever be able to scrub off the stench if he knew a prayer he would have said it then but he knew only obscenities which he uttered with the fervor of the righteous but he wasnt righteous he was damned for a businessman there was a decision to be made arkadin was no businessman though so from that day forward his fate was sealed he returned to nizhny tagil with his two stechkin handguns fully loaded and extra rounds of ammunition in his breast pockets entering the brothel he shot the two ghouls dead as they stood at guard neither had a chance to draw his weapon stas kuzin appeared in the doorway gripping a korovin tk pistol leonid what the fuck arkadin shot him once in each knee kuzin went down screaming as he tried to raise the korovin arkadin trod heavily on his wrist kuzin grunted heavily when he wouldnt let go of the pistol arkadin kicked him in the knee the resulting bellow brought the last of the girls from their respective rooms get out of here arkadin addressed the girls though his gaze was fixed on kuzins monstrous face take whatever money you can find and go back to your families tell them about the lime pit north of town he heard them scrambling babbling to one another then it was quiet fucking sonovabitch kuzin said staring up at arkadin arkadin laughed and shot him in the right shoulder then jamming the stechkins in their holsters he dragged kuzin across the floor he had to push one of the dead ghouls out of the way but at last he made it down the stairs and out the front door with the moaning kuzin in tow in the street one of kuzins vans screeched to a halt arkadin drew his guns emptied them into the interior the car rocked on its shocks glass shattered its horn blared as the dead driver fell over onto it no one got out arkadin dragged kuzin to his car and dumped him in the backseat then he drove out of town to the forest turning off at the rutted dirt track at the end of it he stopped hauled kuzin to the edge of the pit fuck you arkadin kuzin shouted fuck arkadin shot him pointblank in the left shoulder shattering it and sending kuzin down into the quicklime pit he peered over there was the monster lying on the corpses kuzins mouth drooled blood kill me he shouted dyou think im afraid of death go on do it now its not for me to kill you stas kill me i said for fucks sake finish it now arkadin gestured at the corpses youll die in your victimss arms hearing their curses echoing in your ears what about all your victims kuzin shouted when arkadin disappeared from view youll die choking on your own blood arkadin paid him no mind he was already behind the wheel of his car backing out of the forest it had begun to rain gunmetalcolored drops that fell like bullets out of a colorless sky a slow booming coming from the smelters starting up sounded like the thunder of cannons signaling the beginning of a war that would surely destroy him unless he found a way out of nizhny tagil that wasnt in a body bag forty where are you jason moira said ive been trying to reach you im in munich he said how wonderful thank god youre close by i need to see you she seemed slightly out of breath tell me where you are and ill meet you there bourne switched his cell phone from one ear to the other the better to check his immediate surroundings im on my way to the englischer garten what are you doing in schwabing its a long story ill tell you about it when i see you bourne checked his watch but im due to meet up with soraya at the chinese pagoda in ten minutes she says she has new intel on the black legion attack thats odd moira said so do i bourne crossed the street hurrying but still alert for tags ill meet you moira said im in a car i can be there in fifteen minutes not a good idea he didnt want her involved in a professional rendezvous ill call you as soon as im through and we can all of a sudden he realized he was talking to dead air he dialed moiras number but got her voice mail damn her he thought he reached the outskirts of the garden which was twice the size of new yorks central park divided by the isar river it was filled with jogging and bicycle paths meadows forests and even hills near the crown of one of these was the chinese pagoda which was actually a beer garden he was naturally thinking of soraya as he approached the area it was odd that both she and moira had intel on the black legion now he thought back over his phone conversation with her something about it had been bothering him something just out of reach every time he strained for it it seemed to move farther away from him his pace was slowed by the hordes of tourists american diplomats children with balloons or kites riding the wind in addition a rally of teenagers protesting new rulings on curriculum at the university had begun to gather at the pagoda he pushed his way forward past a mother and child then a large family in nikes and hideous tracksuits the child glanced at him and instinctively bourne smiled then he turned away wiped the blood off his face though it continued to seep through the cuts opened during his fight with arkadin no you cant have sausages the mother said to her son in a strong british accent you were sick all night but mummy he replied i feel right as rain right as rain bourne stopped in his tracks rubbed the heel of his hand against his temple right as rain the phrase rattled around in his head like a steel ball in a pachinko machine soraya hi its me soraya thats how shed started off the call then shed said actually im in munich and just before shed hung up right as rain i can make it can you bourne buffeted by the quickening throngs felt as if his head were on fire something about those phrases he knew them and he didnt how could that be he shook his head as if to clear it memories were appearing like knife slashes through a piece of fabric light was glimmering and then he saw moira she was hurrying toward the chinese pagoda from the opposite direction her expression intent grim even what had happened what information did she have for him he craned his neck trying to find soraya in the swirl of the demonstration that was when he remembered right as rain he and soraya had had this conversation beforewhere in odessa hi its me coming before her name meant that she was under duress actually coming before a place where she was supposed to be meant that she wasnt there right as rain meant its a trap he looked up and his heart sank moira was heading right into it when the door opened willard froze he was on his hands and knees hidden from the doorway by the desks skirt he heard voices one of them lavalles and held his breath theres nothing to it lavalle said email me the figures and after im done with the moore woman ill check them good deal patrick one of lavalles aides said but youd better get back to the library the moore woman is kicking up a fuss lavalle cursed willard heard him cross to the desk shuffle some papers perhaps he was looking for a file lavalle grunted in satisfaction walked back across the office and closed the door after him it was only when willard heard the grate of the key in the lock that he exhaled he fired up the camera praying that the images hadnt been deleted and there they were one after another evidence that would damn luther lavalle and his entire nsa administration using both the camera and his cell phone he linked them through the wireless bluetooth protocol then transferred the images to his cell once that was completed he navigated to his sons phone numberwhich wasnt his sons number though if anyone called it a young man who had standing instructions to pass as his son would answerand sent the photos in one long burst sending them one by one via separate calls would surely cause a red flag on the security server at last willard sat back and took a deep breath it was done the photos were now in the hands of ci where theyd do the most good orif you were luther lavallethe most damage checking his watch he pocketed the camera relatched the door to the hidden compartment and scrambled out from under the desk four minutes later his hair freshly combed his uniform brushed down and looking very smart indeed he placed a ceylon tea in front of soraya moore and a singlemalt scotch in front of luther lavalle ms moore thanked him lavalle staring at her ignored him as usual moira hadnt seen him and bourne couldnt call out to her because in this maelstrom of people his voice wouldnt carry blocked in his forward motion he edged his way back to the periphery moving to his left in order to circle around to her he tried her cell again but she either couldnt hear it or wasnt answering it was as he was disengaging the line that he saw the nsa agents they were moving in concert toward the center of the crowd and he could only assume that there were others in a tightening circle within which they meant to trap him they hadnt spotted him yet but moira was close to one of the pair in bournes view there was no way to get to her without them spotting him nevertheless he continued to circle through the fringes of the crowd which had grown so large that many of the young people were shoving one another as they shouted their slogans bourne pushed on although it seemed to him at a slower and slower pace as if he were in a dream where the laws of physics were nonexistent he needed to get to moira without the agents seeing him it was dangerous for her to be looking for him with nsa infiltrating the crowd far better for him to get to her first so he could control both their movements finally as he neared the nsa agents he could see the reason for the sudden rancor of the crowd the shoving was being precipitated by a large group of skinheads some wielding brass knuckles or baseball bats they had swastikas tattooed on their bulging arms and when they began to swing at the chanting university students bourne made a run for moira but as he lunged for her one of the agents elbowed a skinhead aside and as he did so caught a glimpse of bourne he whirled his lips moving as he spoke urgently into the earpiece with which he was wirelessly connected with the other members of what bourne assumed was an execution team he grabbed moira but the agent had hold of him and he began to jerk bourne back toward him as if to detain him long enough for the other members of the team to reach them bourne struck him flush on the chin with the heel of his hand the agents head snapped back and he collapsed into a group of skinheads who thought he was attacking them and started beating him jason what the hell happened to you moira said as she and bourne turned making their way through the throng wheres soraya she was never here bourne said this is another nsa trap it would have been best to keep to where the garden was most crowded but that would put them in the center of the trap bourne led them around the crowd hoping to emerge in a place where the agents wouldnt spot them but now he saw three more outside the mass of the demonstration and knew retreat was impossible instead he reversed course drawing moira farther into the surging mass of demonstrators what are you doing moira said arent we headed straight into the trap trust me instinctively he headed toward one of the flashpoints where the skinheads were clashing with the university students they reached the edge of the escalating fight between the two groups of teens out of the corner of his eye bourne saw an nsa agent struggling through the same mass of people bourne tried to alter their course but their way was blocked and a resurgent wave of students pushed them like flotsam at the tide line feeling the new influx of people the agent turned to fight against it and ran right into moira he barked bournes name into the microphone in his earpiece and bourne slammed a shoe into the side of his knee the agent faltered but managed to counter the chop bourne directed at his shoulder blade the agent drew a handgun and bourne snatched a baseball bat from a skinheads grip struck the agent so hard on the back of his hands that he dropped the handgun then from behind him bourne heard moira say jason theyre coming the trap was about to snap shut on both of them fortyone luther lavalle waited on tenterhooks for the call from his extraction team leader in munich he sat in his customary chair facing the window that looked out over the rolling lawns to the left of the wide gravel drive which wound through the elms and oaks lining it like sentinels having verbally put her in her place after returning from his office he contrived to ignore soraya moore and willard who after the second time had given up asking him if he wanted his singlemalt scotch refreshed he didnt want his singlemalt scotch refreshed and he didnt want to hear another word from the moore woman what he wanted was his cell phone to ring for his team leader to tell him that jason bourne was in custody thats all he required of this day he didnt think it was too much to ask nevertheless it was true that his nerves were pulled tighter than a drawn bowstring he found himself wanting to scream to punch someone hed almost launched himself like a missile at willard when the steward had approached him the last timehe was so damn servile beside him the moore woman sat one leg crossed over her knee sipping her damnable ceylon tea how could she be so calm he reached over slapped the cup and saucer out of her hands they bounced on the thick carpet along with what was left of the espresso but they didnt break he jumped up stomped the china beneath his heel until it cracked and cracked again aware of soraya staring up at him he snapped what what are you looking at his cell phone buzzed and he snatched it off the table his heart lifted a smile of triumph wreathed his face but it was a guard at the front gate not the leader of his extraction team sir im sorry to bother you the guard said but the director of central intelligence is here what lavalle fairly shouted his response he was flooded with bitter disappointment keep her the fuck out im afraid thats not possible sir of course its possible he moved to the window im giving you a direct order shes with a contingent of federal marshals the guard said theyre already on their way to the main house it was true lavalle could see the convoy making its way up the drive he stood speechless with confusion and fury how dare the dci invade his private sanctuary hed have her in prison for this outrage he started feeling someone standing next to him it was soraya moore her wide lips were curled in an enigmatic smile then she turned to him and said i do believe its the end of days the maelstrom closed around bourne and moira what had once been a simple demonstration was now a fullblown melee he heard screams and shouts hurled invective and then under it all the familiar highlow wail of police sirens approaching from several different directions bourne was quite certain the nsa hit squad had no desire to run afoul of the munich police it was therefore running out of time the agent near bourne heard the sirens too and with his hands clearly still half numb from the bat grabbed moira around the throat drop the bat and come with me bourne he said against the rising tide of screams and shouts or so help me ill break her neck like a twig bourne dropped the bat but as he did so moira bit into the agents hand bourne drove his fist into the soft spot just below his sternum then taking hold of his wrist he turned over the arm at an awkward angle and with a sharp blow broke the agents elbow the agent groaned went to his knees bourne dug out his passport and earbud threw the passport to moira as he fitted the electronic bud into his ear canal name he said moira already had the wallet open william k saunders this is saunders bourne said addressing the wireless network bourne and the girl are getting away theyre heading north by northwest past the pagoda then he took her hand biting his hand he said as they stepped over the fallen agent that was quite a professional move she laughed it did the trick didnt it they made their way through the mob heading southeast behind them the nsa agents were shoving their way toward the opposite side of the mass of people ahead a corps of uniformed policemen outfitted in riot gear were trotting along the path semiautomatics at the ready they passed bourne and moira without a second look moira glanced at her watch lets get to my car as quickly as possible we have a plane to catch dont give up those three words tyrone had found in his oatmeal were enough to sustain him kendall never came back nor did any other interrogator in fact his meals came at regular intervals the trays filled with real food which was a blessing because he didnt think he could ever get oatmeal down again the periods when the black hood was taken off seemed to him longer and longer in duration but his sense of time had been shot so he didnt really know whether or not that was true in any case hed used those periods to walk do situps pushups and squats anything to relieve the terrible bonedeep aching of his arms shoulders and neck dont give up that message might just as well have read youre not alone or have faith so rich were those words like a millionaires cache when he read them he knew both that soraya hadnt abandoned him and that something inside the building someone who had access to the basement was on his side and that was the moment when the revelation struck him as if if he remembered his bible correctly he were paul on the road to damascus converted by gods light someone is on my side not the side of the old tyrone who roamed his hood with perfect wrath and retribution not the tyrone whod been saved from life in the gutter by deron not even the tyrone whod been awed by soraya no once he spontaneously thought someone is on my side he realized that my side meant ci he had not only moved out of the hood forever but also stepped out from under sorayas beautiful shadow he was his own man now hed found his own calling not as derons protector or his disciple not as sorayas adoring assistant ci was where he wanted to be in the service of making a difference his world was no longer defined by himself on one side and the man on the other he was no longer fighting what he was becoming he looked up now to get out of here but how his best choice was to try to find a way to communicate with whoever had sent the note he considered a moment the note had been hidden in his food so the logical answer would be to write a note of his own and somehow hide it in his leftovers of course there was no way to be sure that person would find the note or even know it was there but it was his only shot and he was determined to take it he was looking around for something to use to write when the clanging of the door brought him up short he turned to face it as it opened had kendall returned for more sadistic playtime had the real torturer arrived he took a fearful glance over his shoulder at the waterboarding tank and his blood turned cold then he turned back and saw soraya standing in the doorway she was grinning from ear to ear god she said its good to see you how nice to see you again veronica hart said especially under these circumstances luther lavalle had come away from the window he was standing when the dci flanked by federal marshals and a contingent of ci agents entered the library everyone else in the library at the time goggled then at the behest of the marshals beat a hasty retreat now he sat ramrodstraight in his chair facing hart how dare you lavalle said now this intolerable behavior wont go unpunished as soon as i inform secretary of defense halliday of your criminal breach of protocol hart fanned out the photos of the rendition cells in the basement youre right mr lavalle this intolerable behavior wont go unpunished but i believe it will be secretary of defense halliday wholl be leading the charge to punish you for your criminal protocols i do what i do in the defense of my country lavalle said stiffly when a country is at war extraordinary actions must be undertaken in order to safeguard its borders its you and people like you with your weakwilled leftist leanings that are to blame not me he was livid his cheeks aflame im the patriot here youyoure just an obstructionist this country will crack and fall if people like you are left to run it im americas only salvation sit down hart said quietly but firmly before one of my leftist people knocks you down lavalle glared at her for a moment then slowly sank into the chair nice to be living in your own private world where you make the rules and you dont give a shit about reality im not sorry for what i did if youre expecting remorse youre sorely mistaken frankly hart said im not expecting anything out of you until after youre waterboarded she waited until all the blood had drained from his face before she added that would be one solutionyour solutionbut it isnt mine she shuffled the photos back into their envelope whos seen those lavalle asked the dci saw him wince when she said everyone who needs to see them well then he was unbowed unrepentant its over hart looked past him to the front of the library not quite yet she nodded here come soraya and tyrone semion icoupov sat on the stoop of a building not far from where the shooting had taken place his greatcoat hid the blood that had pooled inside it so it he didnt draw a crowd just a curious glance or two from pedestrians hurrying by he felt dizzy and nauseated no doubt from shock and loss of blood which meant he wasnt thinking clearly he looked around with bloodshot eyes where was the car that had brought him here he needed to get out of here before arkadin emerged from the building and spotted him hed taken a tiger from the wild and had tried to domesticate him a historic mistake by any measure how many times had it been attempted before with always the same result tigers werent meant to be domesticated neither was arkadin he was what he was and would never be anything else a killing machine of almost preternatural abilities icoupov had recognized the talent and greedily had tried to harness it to his own needs now the tiger had turned on him hed had a premonition that he would die in munich now he knew why now he knew how looking back toward egon kirschs apartment building he felt a sudden rush of fear as if at any moment death would emerge from it stalking him down the street he tried to pull himself together tried to rise to his feet but a horrific pain shot through him his knees buckled and he collapsed back onto the cold stone more people passed now ignoring him altogether cars rolled by the sky came down the day darkened as if covered with a shroud a sudden gust of wind brought the onset of rain hard as sleet he ducked his head between his shoulders shivered mightily and then he heard his name shouted and turning his head saw the nightmare figure of leonid danilovich arkadin coming down the steps of kirschs building now more highly motivated icoupov once again tried to get up he groaned as he gained his feet but tottered there uncertainly as arkadin began to run toward him at that moment a black mercedes sedan pulled up to the sidewalk the driver hurried out and taking hold of icoupov half carried him across the pavement icoupov struggled but to no avail he was weak with lost blood and growing weaker by the moment the driver opened the rear door bundled him into the backseat he pulled an hk and with it warned arkadin away then he hustled back around the front of the mercedes slid behind the wheel and took off icoupov slumped in the near corner of the backseat made rhythmic grunts of pain like puffs of smoke from a steam locomotive he was aware of the soft rocking of the shocks as the car sped through the munich streets more slowly came the realization that he wasnt alone in the backseat he blinked heavily trying to clear his vision hello semion a familiar voice said and then icoupovs vision cleared you its been a long time since weve seen each other hasnt it dominic specter said the empire state building moira said as she studied the plans bourne had managed to scoop up in kirschs apartment i cant believe i was wrong they were parked in a rest stop by the side of the autobahn on the way to the airport what do you mean wrong bourne said she told him what arthur hauser the engineer hired by kaller steelworks had confessed about the flaw in lng terminals software bourne thought a moment if a terrorist used that flaw to gain control of the software what could he do the tanker is so huge and the terminal is so complex that the docking is handled electronically through the software program moira nodded so he could cause the tanker to crash into the terminal he turned to her would that set off the tanks of liquid gas quite possibly yes bourne was thinking furiously still the terrorist would have to know about the flaw how to exploit it and how to reconfigure the software it sounds simpler than trying to blow up a major building in manhattan she was right of course and because of the questions hed been pondering he grasped implications of that immediately moira glanced at her watch jason the nextgen plane with the coupling link is scheduled to take off in thirty minutes she put the car in gear nosed out onto the autobahn we have to make up our minds before we get to the airport do we go to new york or to long beach bourne said ive been trying to figure out why both specter and icoupov were so hellbent on retrieving these plans he stared down at the blueprints as if willing them to speak to him the problem he said slowly and thoughtfully is that they were entrusted to specters son pyotr who was more interested in girls drugs and the moscow nightlife than he was in his work as a consequence his network was peopled by misfits junkies and weaklings why in the world would specter entrust so important a document to a network like that thats just the point bourne said he wouldnt moira glanced at him what does that mean is the network bogus not as far as pyotr was concerned bourne said but so far as specter saw it yes everyone who was a part of it was expendable then the plans are bogus too no i think theyre real and thats what specter was counting on bourne said but when you consider the situation logically and coolly which no one does when it comes to the threat of an imminent terrorist attack the probability of a cell managing to get what it needs into the empire state building is very low he rolled up the plans no i think this was all an elaborate disinformation schemeleaking communications to typhon recruiting me because of my loyalty to specter it was all meant to mobilize american security forces on the wrong coast so you think the black legions real target is the lng terminal in long beach yes bourne said i do tyrone stood looking down at lavalle a terrible silence had descended over the library when he and soraya had entered he watched soraya scoop up lavalles cell phone from the table good she said with an audible sigh of relief no ones called jason must be safe she tried him on her cell but he wasnt answering hart who had stood up when theyd come over said you look a little the worse for wear tyrone nothing a stint at the ci training school wouldnt cure he said hart glanced at soraya before saying i think youve earned that right she smiled in your case ill forgo the usual warning about how rigorous the training program is how many recruits drop out in the first two weeks i know we wont have to be concerned about you dropping out no maam just call me director tyrone youve earned that as well he nodded but he couldnt keep his eyes off lavalle his interest did not go unnoticed the dci said mr lavalle i think it only just that tyrone decide your fate youre out of your mind lavalle looked apoplectic you cant on the contrary hart said i can she turned to tyrone its entirely up to you tyrone let the punishment fit the crime tyrone impaling lavalle in his glare saw there what he always saw in the eyes of white people who confronted him a toxic mixture of contempt aversion and fear once that would have sent him into a frenzy of rage but that was because of his own ignorance perhaps what he had seen in them was a reflection of what had been on his own face not today not ever again because during his incarceration hed finally come to understand what deron had tried to teach him that his own ignorance was his worst enemy knowledge allowed him to work at changing other peoples expectations of him rather than confronting them with a switchblade or a handgun he looked around saw the look of expectation on sorayas face turning back to lavalle he said i think something public would be in order something embarrassing enough to work its way up to secretary of defense halliday veronica hart couldnt help laughing she laughed until tears came to her eyes and she heard the gilbert and sullivan lines run through her head his object all sublime he will achieve in timelet the punishment fit the crime fortytwo i seem to have you at quite a disadvantage dear semion dominic specter watched icoupov as he dealt with the pain of sitting up straight i need to see a doctor icoupov was panting like an underpowered engine struggling up a steep grade what you need dear semion is a surgeon specter said unfortunately theres no time for one i need to get to long beach and i cant afford to leave you behind this was my idea asher having braced his back against the seat some small amount of color was returning to icoupovs cheeks so was using pyotr what did you call my son oh yes a useless wart on fates ass that was it wasnt it he was useless asher all he cared about was getting laid and getting high did he have a commitment to the cause did he even know what the word meant i doubt it and so do you you killed him semion and you had iliev murdered i thought youd changed your mind sever said i assumed youd sent him after bourne to expose me to gain the upper hand by telling him about the long beach target dont look at me like that is it so strange after all weve been enemies longer than weve been allies youve become paranoid icoupov said though at the time he had sent his second in command to expose sever hed temporarily lost faith in severs plan had finally felt the risks to all of them were too great from the beginning hed argued with sever against bringing bourne into the picture but had acquiesced to severs argument that ci would bring bourne into play sooner later far better for us to preempt them to put bourne in play ourselves sever had said capping his argument and that had been the end of it until now weve both become paranoid a sad fact icoupov said with a gasp of pain it was true their great strength in working together without anyone in either camp knowing about it was also a weakness because their regimes ostensibly opposed each other because the black legions nemesis was in reality its closest ally all other potential rivals shied away leaving the black legion to operate without interference however the actions both men were sometimes obliged to take for the sake of appearance caused a subconscious erosion of trust between them icoupov could feel that their level of distrust had achieved its highest point yet and he sought to defuse it pyotr killed himselfand in fact i was only defending myself did you know he hired arkadin to kill me what would you have had me do there were other options sever said but your sense of justice is an eye for an eye for a muslim you have a great deal of the jewish old testament in you and now it appears that that very justice is about to be turned on you arkadin will kill you if he can get his hands on you sever laughed im the only one who can save you now ironic isnt it you kill my son and now i have the power of life and death over you we always had the power of life and death over each other icoupov still struggled to gain equality in the conversation there were casualties on both sidesregrettable but necessary the more things change the more they stay the same except for long beach theres the problem precisely sever said ive just come from interrogating arthur hauser our man on the inside as such he was monitored by my people earlier today he got cold feet he met with a member of black river it took me some time to convince him to talk but eventually he did he told this womanmoira trevorabout the software flaw so black river knows if they do sever said they arent doing anything about it hauser also told me that they withdrew from nextgen black river isnt handling their security anymore who is it doesnt matter sever said the point is the tanker is less than a day away from the california coastline my software engineer is aboard and in place the question now is whether this black river operative is going to act on her own icoupov frowned why should she you know black river as well as i do they act as a team true enough but the trevor woman should have been on to her next assignment by now my people tell me that shes still in munich maybe shes taking some downtime and maybe sever said shes going to act on the information hauser gave her they were nearing the airport and with some difficulty icoupov pointed the only way to find out is to check to see whether shes on the nextgen plane thats transshipping the coupling link to the terminal he smiled thinly you seem surprised that i know so much i have my spies as well many of whom you know nothing about he gasped in pain as he searched beneath his greatcoat it was texted to me but i cant seem to find my cell he looked around it must have fallen out of my pocket when your driver manhandled me into the car sever waved a hand ignoring the implied rebuke never mind hauser gave me all the details if we can get through security i have people in immigration you dont know about severs smile held a measure of the cruelty that was common to both of them my dear semion you have a use after all arkadin found icoupovs cell phone in the gutter where it had fallen as icoupov had been bundled into the mercedes controlling the urge to stomp it into splinters he opened it to see whom icoupov had called last and noticed that the last incoming message was a text accessing it he read the information on a nextgen jet due to take off in twenty minutes he wondered why that would be important to icoupov part of him wanted to go back to devra the same part that had balked at leaving her to go after icoupov but kirschs building was swarming with cops the entire block was in the process of being cordoned off so he didnt look back tried not to think of her lying twisted on the floor her blank eyes staring up at him even after she stopped breathing do you love me leonid how had he answered her even now he couldnt remember her death was like a dream something vivid that made no sense maybe it was a symbol but of what he couldnt say do you love me leonid it didnt matter but he knew to her it did he had lied then surely hed lied to ease the moments before her death but the thought that hed lied to her sent a knife through whatever passed for his heart he looked down at the text message and knew this was where hed find icoupov turning around he walked back toward the cordonedoff area posing as a crime reporter from the abendzeitung newspaper he boldly accosted one of the junior uniformed police asking him pointed questions about the shooting stories of gunfire hed gleaned from residents of the neighboring buildings as he suspected the cop was on guard duty and knew next to nothing but that wasnt the point hed now gotten inside the cordon leaning against one of the police cars as he conducted his phony and fruitless interview at length the cop was called away and he dismissed arkadin saying the commissioner would be holding a press conference at at which time he would be free to ask all the questions he wanted this left arkadin alone leaning against the fender it didnt take him long to walk around the front of the vehicle and when the medical examiners van arrivedcreating a perfect diversionhe opened the driversside door ducked in behind the wheel the keys were already in the ignition he started the car and drove off when he reached the autobahn he put on the siren and drove at top speed toward the airport i wont have a problem getting you on board moira said as she turned off onto the fourlane approach to the freight terminal she showed her nextgen id at the guard booth then drove on toward the parking lot outside the terminal during the drive to the airport shed thought long and hard about whether to tell jason about whom she really worked for revealing that she was with black river was a direct violation of her contract and right now she prayed thered be no reason to tell him after passing through security customs and immigration they arrived on the tarmac and approached the a set of mobile stairs rose up to the high passenger door which stood open on the far side of the plane the truck from kaller steelworks gesellschaft was parked along with an airport hoist which was lifting crated parts of the lng coupling link into the jets cargo area the truck was obviously late and the loading process was necessarily slow and tedious neither kaller nor nextgen could afford an accident at this late stage moira showed her nextgen id to one of the crew members standing at the bottom of the stairs he smiled and nodded welcoming them aboard moira breathed a sigh of relief now all that stood between them and the black legion attack was the tenhour flight to long beach but as they neared the top of the stairs a figure appeared from the planes interior he stood in the doorway staring down at her moira noah said what are you doing here why arent you on your way to damascus manfred holger icoupovs man in immigration met them at the checkpoint to the freight terminals got in the car with them and they lurched forward icoupov had called him using severs cell phone hed been about to go off duty but luckily for them had not yet changed out of his uniform theres no problem holger spoke in the officious manner that had been drummed into him by his superiors all i have to do is check the recent immigration records to see if shes come through the system not good enough icoupov said she may be traveling under a pseudonym all right then ill go on board and check everyones passports holger was sitting in the front seat now he swiveled around to look at icoupov if i find that this woman moira trevor is on board what would you have me do take her off the plane sever said at once holger looked inquiringly at icoupov who nodded icoupovs face was gray again and he was having more difficulty keeping the pain at bay bring her here to us sever said holger had taken their diplomatic passports passed them quickly through security now the mercedes was sitting just off the tarmac the with the nextgen logo emblazoned on its sides and tail was at rest still being loaded from the kaller steelworks truck the driver had pulled up so that the truck shielded them from being seen by anyone boarding the plane or already inside it holger nodded got out of the mercedes and walked across the tarmac to the rolling stairs kriminalpolizei arkadin said as he stopped the police car at the freight terminal checkpoint we have reason to believe a man who killed two people this afternoon has fled here the guards waved him past customs and immigration without asking for id the car itself was proof enough for them as arkadin rolled past the parking lot and onto the tarmac he saw the jet crates from the nextgen truck being hoisted into the cargo bay and the black mercedes idling some distance away from both recognizing the car at once he nosed the police cruiser to a spot directly behind the mercedes for a moment he sat behind the wheel staring at the mercedes as if the car itself were his enemy he could see the silhouettes of two male figures in the backseat it wasnt a stretch for him to figure that one of them was semion icoupov he wondered which of the handguns he had with him he should use to kill his former mentor the sig sauer mm the luger or the sig mosquito it all depended on what kind of damage he wanted to inflict and to what part of the body hed shot stas kuzin in the knees the better to watch him suffer but this was another time and especially another place the airport was public space the adjacent passenger terminal was crawling with security personnel just because he had been able to get this far as a member of the kriminalpolizei he knew better than to overstep his luck no this kill needed to be quick and clean all he desired was to look into icoupovs eyes when he died for him to know whod ended his life and why unlike the moment of kuzins demise arkadin was fully aware of this moment keyed in to the importance of the son overtaking the father of revenging himself for the psychological and physical advantages an adult takes with a child that he hadnt in fact been a child when mischa had sent semion icoupov to resurrect him never occurred to him from the moment the two had met he had always seen icoupov as a father figure hed obeyed him as he would a father had accepted his judgments had swallowed whole his worldview had been faithful to him and now for the sins icoupov had visited on him he was going to kill him when you didnt show for your scheduled flight i had a hunch youd show up here noah stared at her completely ignoring bourne i wont allow you on the plane moira youre no longer a part of this she still works for nextgen doesnt she bourne said who is this noah said keeping his eyes on her my name is jason bourne a slow smile crept over noahs face moira you didnt introduce us he turned to bourne stuck out his hand noah petersen bourne shook his hand jason bourne keeping the same sly smile on his face noah said do you know she lied to you that she tried to recruit you to nextgen under false pretenses his eyes flicked toward moira but he was disappointed to see neither shock nor outrage on her face why would she do that bourne said because moira said like noah here i work for black river the private security firm we were hired by nextgen to oversee security on the lng terminal it was noah who registered shock moira thats enough youre in violation of your contract it doesnt matter noah i quit black river half an hour ago ive been made chief of security at nextgen so in point of fact its you who isnt welcome aboard this flight noah stood rigid as stone until bourne took a step toward him then he backed away descending the flight of rolling stairs halfway down he turned to her pity moira i once had faith in you she shook her head the pity is that black river has no conscience noah looked at her for a moment then turned clattered down the rest of the stairs and stalked off across the tarmac without seeing the mercedes or the police car behind it because it would make the least noise arkadin decided on the mosquito hand curled around the grips he got out of the police car stalked to the drivers side of the mercedes it was the driverwho doubtless doubled as a bodyguardhe had to dispense with first keeping his mosquito out of sight he rapped on the drivers window with a bare knuckle when the driver slid the glass down arkadin shoved the mosquito in his face and pulled the trigger the drivers head snapped back so hard the cervical vertebrae cracked pulling open the door arkadin shoved the corpse aside and knelt on the seat facing the two men in the backseat he recognized sever from an old photograph when icoupov had showed him the face of his enemy he said wrong time wrong place and shot sever in the chest as he slumped over arkadin turned his attention to icoupov you didnt think you could escape me father did you icoupovwho between the sudden attack and the unendurable pain in his shoulder was going into delayed shocksaid why do you call me father your father died a long time ago leonid danilovich no arkadin said he sits here before me like a wounded bird a wounded bird yes with great effort icoupov opened his greatcoat the lining of which was sopping wet with his blood your paramour shot me before i shot her in selfdefense this is not a court of law what matters is that shes dead arkadin shoved the muzzle of the mosquito under icoupovs chin and tilted upward and you father are still alive i dont understand you icoupov swallowed hard i never did what was i ever to you except a means to an end i killed when you ordered me to why why did i do that can you tell me icoupov said nothing not knowing what he could say to save himself from judgment day i did it because i was trained to do it arkadin said thats why you sent me to america to washington not to cure me of my homicidal rages as you said but to harness them for your use what of it icoupov finally found his voice of what other use were you when i found you you were close to taking your own life i saved you you ungrateful shit you saved me so you could condemn me to this life which if i am any judge is no life at all i see i never really escaped nizhny tagil i never will icoupov smiled believing hed gotten the measure of his protйgй you dont want to kill me leonid danilovich im your only friend without me youre nothing nothing is what i always was arkadin said as he pulled the trigger now youre nothing too then he got out of the mercedes walked out on the tarmac to where the nextgen personnel were almost finished offloading the crates without being seen he climbed onto the hoist there he hunkered down just beneath the operators cab and after the last crate had been stowed aboard when the nextgen loaders were exiting the cargo hold via the interior stairwell he leapt aboard the plane scrambled behind a stack of crates and sat down patient as death while the doors closed locking him in bourne saw the german official coming and suspected there was something wrong an immigration officer had no business interrogating them now then he recognized the mans face he told moira to get back inside the plane then stood barring the door as the official mounted the stairs i need to see everyones passport the officer said as he approached bourne passport checks have already been made mein herr nevertheless another security scan must be made now the officer held out his hand your passport please and then i will check the identity of everyone else aboard you dont recognize me mein herr please the officer put his hand on the butt of his holstered luger you are obstructing official government business believe me i will take you into custody unless you show me your passport and then move aside heres my passport mein herr bourne opened it to the last page pointed to a spot on the inside cover and here is where you placed an electronic tracking device what accusation is this you have no proof bourne produced the broken bug i dont believe youre here on official business i think whoever instructed you to plant this on me is paying you to check these passports bourne gripped the officers elbow lets stroll over to the commandant of immigration and ask them if they sent you here the officer drew himself up stiffly im not going anywhere with you i have a job to do so do i as bourne dragged him down the rolling stairs the officer went for his gun bourne dug his fingers into the nerve bundle just above the mans elbow draw it if you must bourne said but be prepared for the consequences the officials frosty aloofness finally cracked revealing the fear beneath his round face was pallid and sweating what do you want of me he said as they walked along the tarmac take me to your real employer the officer had one last blast of bravado in him you dont really think hes here do you as a matter of fact i wasnt sure until you said that now i know he is bourne shook the official now take me to him defeated the officer nodded bleakly no doubt he was contemplating his immediate future at a quickened pace he led bourne around behind the at that moment the nextgen truck rumbled to life heading away from the plane back the way it had come that was when bourne saw the black mercedes and a police car directly behind it where did that police car come from the officer tore himself away from bourne and broke into a run toward the parked cars bourne who saw the driversside doors on both vehicles standing open was at the officers heels it was clear as they approached that no one was in the police car but looking through the mercedess door they saw the driver slumped over it looked as if hed been kicked to the passengers side of the seat bourne pulled open the rear door saw icoupov with the top of his head blown off another man had fallen forward against the front seat rests when bourne pulled him gently backward he saw that it was dominic specteror asher severand everything became clear to him beneath the public enmity the two men were secret allies this answered many questions not the least of which was why everyone bourne had spoken to about the black legion had a different opinion about who was a member and who wasnt sever looked small and frail old beyond his years hed been shot in the chest with a bourne took his pulse listened to his breathing he was still alive ill call for an ambulance the officer said do what you have to do bourne said as he scooped sever up im taking this one with me he left the immigration officer to deal with the mess crossing the tarmac and mounting the rolling stairs lets get out of here he said as he laid sever down across three seats what happened to him moira said with a gasp is he alive or dead bourne knelt beside his old mentor hes still breathing as he began to rip off the professors shirt he said to moira get us moving okay we need to get out of here now moira nodded as she went up the aisle she spoke to one of the flight attendants who ran for the firstaid kit the door to the cockpit was still open and she gave the order for takeoff to the captain and the copilot within five minutes the rolling stairs had been removed and the was taxiing to the head of the runway a moment later the control tower cleared it for takeoff the brakes were let out the engines revved up and with increasing velocity the jet hurtled down the runway then it lifted off its wheel retracted flaps were adjusted and it soared into a sky filled with the crimson and gold of the setting sun fortythree is he dead sever stared up at bourne who was cleaning his chest wound you mean semion yes semion is he dead icoupov and the driver both bourne held sever down while the alcohol burned off everything that could cause the wound to suppurate no organs had been struck but the injury must be extremely painful bourne applied an antiseptic cream from a tube in the firstaid kit who shot you arkadin tears of pain rolled down severs cheeks for some reason hes gone completely insane maybe he was always insane i thought so anyway allah that hurts he took several shallow breaths before he went on he came out of nowhere the driver said a police car has pulled up behind us the next thing i know hes rolling down the window and a gun is fired pointblank in his face neither semion nor i had time to think there was arkadin inside the car he shot me but im certain it was semion hed come for intuiting what must have happened in kirschs apartment bourne said icoupov killed his woman devra sever squeezed his eyes shut he was having trouble breathing normally so what arkadin never cared what happened to his women he cared about this one bourne said applying a bandage sever stared up at bourne with an expression of disbelief the odd thing was i think i heard him call semion father semion didnt understand and now he never will stop your fussing let me die dammit sever said crossly it doesnt matter now whether i live or die bourne finished up whats done is done fate has been sealed theres nothing you or anyone else can do to change it bourne sat on a seat opposite sever he was aware of moira standing to one side watching and listening the professors betrayal only went to prove that you were never safe when you let personal feelings into your life jason severs voice was weaker i never meant to deceive you yes you did professor thats all you know how to do i came to look upon you as a son like icoupov looked upon arkadin with an effort sever shook his head arkadin is insane perhaps they both were perhaps their shared insanity is what drew them together bourne sat forward let me ask you a question professor do you think youre sane of course im sane severs eyes held steady on bournes a challenge still at this late stage for a moment bourne did nothing then he rose and together with moira walked forward toward the cockpit its a long flight she said softly and you need your rest we both do they sat next to each other silent for a long time occasionally they heard sever utter a soft moan otherwise the drone of the engines conspired to lull them to sleep it was freezing in the baggage hold but arkadin didnt mind the nizhny tagil winters had been brutal it was during one of those winters that mischa tarkanian had found him hiding out from the remnants of stas kuzins regime mischa hard as a knife blade had the heart of a poet he told stories that were beautiful enough to be poems arkadin had been enchanted if such a word could be ascribed to him mischas talent for storytelling had the power to take arkadin far away from nizhny tagil and when mischa smuggled him out past the inner ring of smokestacks past the outer ring of highsecurity prisons his stories took arkadin to places beyond moscow to lands beyond russia the stories gave arkadin his first inkling of the world at large as he sat now his back against a crate knees drawn up to his chest in order to conserve warmth he had good cause to think of mischa icoupov had paid for killing devra now bourne must pay for killing mischa but not just yet arkadin brooded though his blood called out for revenge if he killed bourne now icoupovs plan would succeed and he couldnt allow that otherwise his revenge against him would be incomplete arkadin put his head back against the edge of the crate and closed his eyes revenge had become like one of mischas poems its meaning flowering open to surround him with a kind of ethereal beauty the only form of beauty that registered on him the only beauty that lasted it was the glimpse of that promised beauty the very prospect of it that allowed him to sit patiently curled between crates waiting for his moment of revenge his moment of inestimable beauty bourne dreamed of the hell known as nizhny tagil as if hed been born there and when he awoke he knew arkadin was near opening his eyes he saw moira staring at him what do you feel about the professor she said by which he suspected she meant what do you feel about me i think the years of obsession have driven him insane i dont think he knows good from evil right from wrong is that why you didnt ask him why he embarked on this path to destruction in a way bourne said whatever his answer would have been it wouldnt have made sense to us fanatics never make sense she said thats why theyre so difficult to counteract a rational response which is always our choice is rarely effective she cocked her head he betrayed you jason he nurtured your belief in him and played on it if you climb on a scorpions back youve got to expect to get stung dont you have a desire for revenge maybe i should i smother him in his sleep or shoot him to death as arkadin did to semion icoupov do you really expect that to make me feel better ill exact my revenge by stopping the black legions attack you sound so rational i dont feel rational moira she took his meaning and blood rushed to her cheeks i may have lied to you jason but i didnt betray you i could never do that she engaged his eyes there were so many times in the last week when i ached to tell you but i had a duty to black river duty is something i understand moira understanding is one thing but will you forgive me he put out his hand you arent a scorpion he said its not in your nature she took his hand in hers brought it up to her mouth and pressed it to her cheek at that moment they heard sever cry out and they rose went down the aisle to where he lay curled on his side like a small child afraid of the dark bourne knelt down drew sever gently onto his back to keep pressure off the wound the professor stared at bourne then as moira spoke to him at her why did you do it moira said why attack the country youd adopted as your own sever could not catch his breath he swallowed convulsively youd never understand why dont you try me sever closed his eyes as if to better visualize each word as it emerged from his mouth the muslim sect i belong to that semion belonged to is very oldancient even it had its beginnings in north africa he paused already out of breath our sect is very strict we believe in a fundamentalism so devout it cannot be conveyed to infidels by any means but i can tell you this we cannot live in the modern world because the modern world violates every one of our laws therefore it must be destroyed nevertheless he licked his lips and bourne poured out some water lifted his head and allowed him to drink his fill when he was finished he continued i should never have tried to use you jason over the years there have been many disagreements between semion and myselfthis was the latest the one that broke the proverbial camels back he said youd be trouble and he was right i thought i could manufacture a reality that i could use you to convince the american security agencies we were going to attack new york city he emitted a dry little laugh i lost sight of the central tenet of life that reality cant be controlled its too random too chaotic so you see it was i who was on a fools errand jason not you professor its all over moira said we wont let the tanker dock until we have the software patched sever smiled a good idea but it will avail you nothing do you know the damage that much liquid natural gas will do five square miles of devastation thousands killed americas corrupt greedy way of life delivered the hammer blow semion and i have been dreaming of for decades its my one great calling in this life the loss of human life and physical destruction is icing on the cake he paused to catch his breath which was shallower and more ragged than ever when the nations largest port is incinerated americas economy will go with it almost half your imports will dry up therell be widespread shortages of goods and food companies will collapse the stock exchanges will plummet wholesale panic will ensue how many of your men are on board bourne said sever smiled weakly i love you like a son jason you let your own son be killed bourne said sacrificed jason theres a difference not to him bourne returned to his agenda how many men professor one only one one man cant take over the tanker moira said the smile played around his lips even as his eyes closed his consciousness fading if man hadnt made machines to do his work moira turned to bourne what does that mean bourne shook the old mans shoulder but hed slipped into deep unconsciousness moira checked his eyes his forehead his carotid artery without intravenous antibiotics i doubt hell make it she looked at bourne were near enough new york city now we could touch down there have an ambulance waiting theres no time bourne said i know theres no time moira took his arm but i want to give you the choice bourne stared down at his mentors face lined and seamed far older in sleep as if it had imploded hell make it on his own or he wont he turned away moira at his side and he said call nextgen this is what i need fortyfour the tanker moon of hormuz plowed through the pacific no more than an hour out of long beach harbor the captain a veteran named sultan had gotten word that the lng terminal was online and ready to receive its inaugural shipment of liquid natural gas with the current state of the worlds economies the lng had become even more precious from the time the moon of hormuz had left algeria its cargo had increased in value by over percent the tanker twelve stories high and as large as a village held thirtythree million gallons of lng cooled to a temperature of degrees that translated into the energy equivalent of twenty billion gallons of natural gas the ship required five miles to come to a stop and because of the shape of its hull and the containers on deck sultans view ahead was blocked for threequarters of a mile the tanker had been steaming at twenty knots but three hours ago hed ordered the engines into reverse well within five miles of the terminal the ship was down to six knots of speed and still decelerating within the fivemile radius to shore his nerves became a jittery flame the nightmare of armageddon always with him because a disaster aboard the moon of hormuz would be just that if the tanks spilled into the water the resulting fire would be five miles in diameter for another five miles beyond that thermal radiation would burn any human to a crisp but those scenarios were just that nightmares in ten years thered never been even a minor incident aboard his ship and there never would be if he had anything to say about it he was just thinking about how fine the weather was and how much he was going to enjoy his ten days on the beach with a friend in malibu when the radio officer handed him a message from nextgen he was to expect a helicopter in fifteen minutes he was to give its passengersmoira trevor and jason bourneany and all help they requested that was surprising enough but he bristled at the last sentence he was to take orders from them until the moon of hormuz was safely docked at the terminal when the doors to the cargo bay were opened arkadin was ready crouched behind one of the containers as the airport maintenance team clambered aboard he edged out then called from the shadows for one of them to help him when the man complied arkadin broke his neck dragged him into the deepest shadows of the cargo bay away from the nextgen containers he stripped and donned the mans maintenance uniform then he stepped over to the work area keeping the id tag clipped to it out of full view so that no one could that see that his face didnt match that on the tag not that it mattered these people were here to get the cargo offloaded and onto the waiting nextgen trucks as quickly as possible it never occurred to any of them that there might be an imposter among them in this way arkadin worked his way to the open bay doors onto the loading lifts with the container he hopped onto the tarmac as the cargo was being loaded onto the truck then ducked away beneath the wing finding himself alone on the opposite side of the aircraft he walked away at a brisk businesslike clip no one challenged him no one even gave him a second look because he moved with the authority of someone who belonged there that was the secret of assuming a different identity even temporarilypeoples eyes either ignored or accepted what looked correct to them as he went he breathed deeply of the clear salt air the freshening breeze whipping his pants against his legs he felt free of all the leashes that had bound him to the earth stas kuzin marlene gala icoupov they were all gone now the sea beckoned him and he was coming nextgen had its own small terminal on the freight side of the long beach airport moira had radioed ahead to nextgen headquarters giving them a headsup and asking for a helicopter to be ready to take her and bourne to the tanker arkadin beat bourne to the nextgen terminal hurrying now he used the badge to open the door to the restricted areas out on the tarmac he saw the helicopter right away the pilot was talking to a maintenance man the moment they both squatted down examining one of the runners arkadin pulled his cap low on his forehead walked briskly around to the far side of the helicopter and made himself busy there he saw bourne and moira emerge from the nextgen terminal they paused for a moment and he could hear their argument about whether or not she should come but they must have had it before because the fight was hammered out in brief staccato bursts like shorthand face facts jason i work for nextgen without me you wont get on that copter bourne turned away and for an instant arkadin felt a foreboding as if bourne had seen him then bourne turned back to moira and together they hurried across the tarmac bourne climbed in on the pilots side while moira headed to arkadins side of the copter with a professional smile he held out a hand helping her up into the cockpit he saw the maintenance man about to come across but waved him off looking up at moira through the curved perspex door he thought of devra and felt a lurch in his chest as if her bleeding head had fallen against him he waved at moira and she lifted her hand in return the rotors began to swirl the maintenance man signaled for arkadin to come away arkadin gave him the thumbsup sign faster and faster the rotors spun and the copters frame began to shudder just before it lifted off arkadin climbed onto the runner and curled himself into a ball as they swung out over the pacific buffeted by a stiff onshore wind the tanker loomed large in the passengers vision as the copter sped toward it at top speed only one other boat could be seen a commercial fishing vessel several miles away beyond the security limits imposed by the coast guard and homeland security bourne who was sitting directly behind the pilot saw that he was working to keep the copters pitch at the correct angle is everything okay he shouted over the roar of the rotors the pilot pointed to one of the gauges theres a small anomaly in the pitch probably the wind its gusting up quite a bit but bourne wasnt so sure the anomaly was constant whereas the wind wasnt he had an intuition whator more accurately whowas causing the problem i think we have a stowaway bourne said to the pilot take it in low when you get to the tanker skim the tops of the containers what the pilot shook his head too dangerous then ill take a look myself unstrapping himself bourne crept toward the door okay okay the pilot shouted just get back in your seat they were almost at the bow of the tanker now it was unbelievably big a city lumbering through the pacific swells hang on the pilot shouted as he took them down far more quickly than normal they could see members of the crew racing across the deck and someoneno doubt the captainemerged from the wheelhouse near the stern someone was shouting to pull up the tops of the containers were coming at them with frightening speed just before they skimmed the top of the nearest container the copter rocked slightly the anomalys gone the pilot said stay here bourne shouted to moira whatever happens stay on board then he gripped the weapon lying astride his knees opened the door and as she screamed his name jumped out of the copter he landed after arkadin who had already leapt down onto the deck and was scuttling between containers crew members rushed toward them both bourne had no idea whether one of them was severs software engineer but he raised a hunting crossbow and they stopped in their tracks knowing that firing a gun would be tantamount to suicide on a tanker full of liquid natural gas hed had moira ask nextgen to have two crossbows in the copter how they procured them so quickly was anyones guess but a corporation of nextgens size could get just about anything at a moments notice behind him the chopper set down on the part of the foredeck that had been cleared and cut the engines doubled over to avoid the rotors he opened the copter door and looked up at moira arkadin is here somewhere please stay out of the way i need to report to the captain i can take care of myself she too was cradling a crossbow what does arkadin want me i killed his friend it doesnt matter to him that it was in selfdefense i can help jason if we work together two are better than one he shook his head not in this case besides you see how slowly the tanker is moving its screws are in reverse its within the fivemile limit for every foot we travel forward the danger to thousands of lives and the port of long beach itself grows exponentially she nodded stiffly stepped down and hurried along the deck to where the captain stood awaiting her orders bourne turned moving cautiously among the containers in the direction hed glimpsed arkadin heading moving along the aisles was like walking down the canyons of manhattan wind howled as it cut across corners magnified racing down the aisles as if they were tunnels just before he reached the end of the first set of containers he heard arkadins voice speaking to him in russian there isnt much time bourne stood still trying to determine where the voice was coming from what dyou know about it arkadin why dyou think im here i killed mischa tarkanian now you kill me isnt that how you defined it back in egon kirschs apartment listen to me bourne if thats what i wanted i could have killed you anytime while you and the woman slept aboard the nextgen bournes blood ran cold why didnt you listen to me bourne semion icoupov who saved me whom i trusted shot my woman to death yes thats why you killed him do you begrudge me my revenge bourne said nothing thinking of what he would do to arkadin if he hurt moira you dont have to say anything bourne i already know the answer bourne turned the voice appeared to have shifted where the hell was he hiding but as i said we have little time to find icoupovs man on board its severs man actually bourne said arkadin laughed do you think that matters they were in bed together all the time they posed as bitter enemies they were plotting this disaster i want to stop iti have to stop it or my revenge on icoupov will be incomplete i dont believe you listen bourne you know we havent much time ive avenged myself on the father but this plan is his child he and sever gave birth to it fed it nurtured it through its infancy through its adolescent growing pains now each moment brings this floating supernova closer to the moment of destruction those two madmen envisioned the voice moved again is that what you want bourne of course not then lets join together to find severs man bourne hesitated he didnt trust arkadin and yet he had to trust him he examined the situation from all sides and concluded that the only way to play it was to move forward hes a software engineer he said arkadin appeared climbing down from the top of one of the containers for a moment the two men stood facing each other and once again bourne felt the dislocating sensation of looking in a mirror when he stared into arkadins eyes he didnt see the madness the professor spoke of he saw himself a heart of darkness and pain beyond understanding sever told me there was only one man but he also said we wouldnt find him and even if we did it wouldnt matter arkadin frowned giving him the canny feral appearance of a wolf what did he mean im not sure he turned walking down the deck toward the crew members who had cleared the space for the copter to land what were looking for he said as arkadin fell into step beside him is a tattoo specific to the black legion the wheel of horses with the deaths head center arkadin nodded ive seen it its on the inside of the elbow we could kill them all arkadin laughed but i guess that would offend something inside you one by one the two men examined the arms of the eight crewmen on deck but found no tattoo by the time they reached the wheelhouse the tanker was within two miles of the terminal it was barely moving four tugboats had hove to and were waiting at the onemile limit to tow the tanker the rest of the way in the captain was a swarthy individual with a face that looked like it had been deeply etched by acid rather than the wind and the sun as i was telling ms trevor there are seven more crewmen mostly involved in engine room duties then theres my first mate here the communications officer and the ships doctor hes in sick bay tending to a crewman who fell ill two days out of algeria oh yes and the cook bourne and arkadin glanced at each other the radioman seemed the logical choice but when the captain summoned him he too was without the black legion tattoo so were the captain and his first mate the engine room bourne said at his captains orders the first mate led them out onto the deck then down the starboard companionway into the bowels of the ship reaching the enormous engine room at last five men were hard at work their faces and arms filthy with a coating of grease and grime as the first mate instructed them they held out their arms but as bourne reached the third in line the fourth man looked at them beneath halfclosed lids before he bolted bourne went after him while arkadin circled snaking through the oily city of grinding machinery he eluded bourne once but then rounding a corner bourne spotted him near the line of gigantic hyundai diesel engines specifically designed to power the worlds fleet of lng tankers he was trying to furtively shove a small box between the structural struts of the engine but arkadin coming up behind him grabbed for his wrist the crewman jerked away brought the box back toward him and was about to thumb a button on it when bourne kicked it out of his hand the box went flying and arkadin dived after it careful the crewman said as bourne grabbed hold of him he ignored bourne was staring at the box arkadin brought back to them you hold the whole world in your hand meanwhile bourne pushed up his shirtsleeve the mans arm was smeared with grease deliberately so it seemed because when bourne took a rag and wiped it off the black legion tattoo appeared on the inside of his left elbow the man seemed totally unconcerned his entire being was focused on the box that arkadin was holding that will blow up everything he said and made a lunge toward it bourne jerked him back with a stranglehold lets get him back up to the captain bourne said to the first mate thats when he saw the box up close he took it out of arkadins hand careful the crewman cried one slight jar and youll set it off but bourne wasnt so sure the crewman was being too vocal with his warnings wouldnt he want the ship to blow now that it had been boarded by severs enemies when he turned the box over he saw that the seam between the bottom and the side was ragged what are you doing are you crazy the crewman was so agitated that arkadin slapped him on the side of the head in order to silence him inserting his fingernail into the seam bourne pried the box apart there was nothing inside it was a dummy moira found it impossible to stay in one place her nerves were stretched to the breaking point the tanker was on the verge of meeting up with the tugboats they were only a mile from shore if the tanks went the devastation to both human life and the countrys economy would be catastrophic she felt useless a third wheel hanging around while the two men did their hunting exiting the wheelhouse she went belowdecks looking for the engine room smelling food she poked her head into the galley a large algerian was sitting at the stainlesssteel mess table reading a twoweekold arabic newspaper he looked up gesturing at the paper it gets old the fifteenth time through but when youre at sea what can you do his burly arms were bare to the shoulders they bore tattoos of a star a crescent and a cross but not the black legions insignia following the directions he gave her she found the infirmary three decks below inside a slim muslim was sitting at a small desk built into one of the bulkheads in the opposite bulkhead were two berths one of them filled with the patient who had fallen ill the doctor murmured a traditional muslim greeting as he turned away from his laptop computer to face her he frowned deeply when he saw the crossbow in her hands is that really necessary he said or even wise id like to speak with your patient moira said ignoring him im afraid thats impossible the doctor smiled that smile only doctors can hes been sedated whats wrong with him the doctor gestured at the laptop im still trying to find out hes been subject to seizures but so far i cant find the pathology were near long beach youll get help then she said i just need to see the insides of his elbows the doctors eyebrows rose i beg your pardon i need to see whether hes got a tattoo they all have tattoos these sailors the doctor shrugged but go ahead you wont disturb him moira approached the lower berth bending over to pull the thin blanket back from the patients arm as she did so the doctor stepped forward and struck her a blow on the back of her head she fell forward and cracked her jaw on the metal frame of the bunk the pain pulled her rudely back from a precipice of blackness and groaning she managed to roll over the coppersweet taste of blood was in her mouth and she fought against wave after wave of dizziness dimly she saw the doctor bent over his laptop his fingers racing over the keys and she felt a ball of ice form in her belly hes going to kill us all with this thought reverberating in her head she grabbed the crossbow off the floor where shed dropped it she barely had time to aim but she was close enough not to have to be accurate she breathed a prayer as she let fly the doctor arched up as the bolt pierced his spine he staggered backward toward where moira sat braced against the berth frame his arms extended his fingers clawing for the keyboard and moira rose swung the crossbow into the back of his head his blood spattered like rain over her face and hands the desk and the laptops keyboard bourne found her on the floor of the infirmary cradling the computer in her lap when he came in she looked up at him and said i dont know what he did im afraid to shut it off are you all right she nodded the ships doctor was severs man so i see he said as he stepped over the corpse i didnt believe him when he told me he had only one man on board it would be like him to have a backup he knelt down examined the back of her head its superficial did you black out i dont think so no he took a large gauze pad from the supply cabinet doused it with alcohol ready he placed it against the back of her head where her hair was plastered down with blood she moaned a little through gritted teeth can you hold it in place for a minute she nodded and gently bourne lifted the laptop into his arms there was a software program running that much was clear two radio buttons on the screen were blinking one yellow the other red on the other side of the screen was a green radio button which wasnt blinking bourne breathed a sigh of relief he brought up the program but you got to him before he could activate it thank god she said where arkadin i dont know when the captain told me youd gone below i took off after you jason you dont think putting the computer aside he helped her to her feet lets get you back up to the captain so you can give him the good news there was a fearful look on his face and you he handed her the laptop go to the wheelhouse and stay there and moira this time i really mean it with the crossbow in one hand he stepped into the passageway looked right and left all right go go arkadin had returned to nizhny tagil down in the engine room surrounded by steel and iron he realized that no matter what had happened to him no matter where hed gone hed never been able to escape the prison of his youth part of him was still in the brothel he and stas kuzin had owned part of him still stalked the nighttime streets abducting young girls their pale fearful faces turned toward him as deer turn toward headlights but what theyd needed from him he couldntor wouldntgive them instead hed sent them to their deaths in the quicklime pit kuzins regime had dug amid the firs and the weeping hemlocks many snows had passed since hed dragged yelena from the rats and the quicklime but the pit remained in his memory vivid as a blaze of fire if only he could have his memory wiped clean he started at the sound of stas kuzin screaming at him what about all your victims but it was bourne descending the steel companionway to the engine room its over arkadin the disaster has been averted arkadin nodded but inside he knew better the disaster had already occurred and it was too late to stop its consequences as he walked toward bourne he tried to fix him in his mind but he seemed to morph like an image seen through a prism when he was within arms length of him he said is it true what sever told icoupov that you have no memory beyond a certain point in time bourne nodded its true i cant remember most of my life arkadin felt a terrible pain as if the very fabric of his soul was being torn apart with an inchoate cry he flicked open his switchblade lunged forward aiming for bournes belly turning sideways bourne grabbed his wrist began to turn it in an attempt to get arkadin to drop the weapon arkadin struck out with his other hand but bourne blocked it with his forearm in doing so the crossbow clattered to the deck arkadin kicked it into the shadows it doesnt have to be this way bourne said theres no reason for us to be enemies theres every reason arkadin broke away tried another attack which bourne countered dont you see it were the same you and me the two of us cant exist in the same world one of us will kill the other bourne stared into arkadins eyes and even though his words were those of a madmen bourne saw no madness in them only a despair beyond description and an unyielding will for revenge in a way arkadin was right revenge was all he had now all he lived for with tarkanian and devra gone the only meaning life had for him lay in avenging their deaths there was nothing bourne could say to sway him that was a rational response to an irrational impulse it was true the two of them couldnt exist in the same world at that moment arkadin feinted right with his knife drove left with his fist rocking bourne back onto his heels at once he stabbed out with the switchblade burying it in the meat of bournes left thigh bourne grunted fought the buckling of his knee and arkadin jammed his boot into bournes wounded thigh blood spurted and bourne fell arkadin jumped on him using his fist to pummel bournes face when bourne blocked his knife stabs bourne knew he couldnt take much more of this arkadins desire for revenge had filled him with an inhuman strength bourne fighting for his very life managed to counterpunch long enough to roll out from under arkadin then he was up and running in an ungainly limp to the companionway arkadin reached up for him as he was half a dozen rungs off the engine room deck bourne kicked out with his bad leg surprising arkadin catching him under the chin as he fell back bourne scrambled up the rungs as fast as he could his left leg was on fire and he was trailing blood as the wounded muscle was forced to work overtime gaining the next deck he continued up the companionway up and up until he came to the first level belowdecks which according to moira was where the galley was finding it he raced in grabbed two knives and a glass saltshaker stuffing the shaker into his pocket he wielded the knives as arkadin loomed in the doorway they fought with their knives but bournes unwieldy carving knives were no match for arkadins slenderbladed switchblade and bourne was cut again this time in the chest he kicked arkadin in the face dropped his knives in order to wrest the switchblade out of arkadins hand to no avail arkadin stabbed at him again and bourne nearly suffered a punctured liver he backed away then ran out the doorway up the last companionway to the open deck the tanker was at a near stop the captain was busy coordinating the hookups with the tugboats that would bring it the final distance to the lng terminal bourne couldnt see moira which was a blessing he didnt want her anywhere near arkadin bourne heading for the sanctuary of the container city was bowled over as arkadin leapt on him locked together they rolled over and over until they fetched up against the port railing the sea was far below them churning against the tankers hull one of the tugs signaled with its horn as it came alongside and arkadin stiffened to him it was the siren sounding an escape from one of nizhny tagils prisons he saw the black skies tasted the sulfur smoke in his lungs he saw stas kuzins monstrous face felt marlenes head between his ankles beneath the water heard the terrible reports when semion icoupov shot devra he screamed like a tiger pulling bourne to his feet pummeling him over and over until he was bent back over the railing in that moment bourne knew that he was going to die as he had been born falling over the side of a ship lost in the depth of the sea and only by the grace of god being brought in to a fishing boat with their catch his face was bloody and swollen his arms felt like lead weights he was going over then at the last instant he pulled the shaker from his pocket broke it against the rail and threw the salt in arkadins eyes arkadin bellowed in shock and pain his hand flew up reflexively and bourne snatched the switchblade from him blinded arkadin still fought on and he grasped the blade with a superhuman effort not caring that the edges cut into his fingers he wrested the switchblade away from bourne bourne heaved him backward but arkadin had control of the knife now he had partial vision back through his tearing eyes and he ran at bourne with his head tucked into his shoulders all his weight and determination behind the charge bourne had one chance stepping into the charge he ignored the knife grabbed arkadin by his uniform jacket and using his own momentum against him pivoted from the hip as he swung him around and up arkadins thighs struck the railing his upper body continuing its flight so that he toppled headoverheels over the side falling falling falling the equivalent of twelve stories before plunging beneath the waves fortyfive i need a vacation moira said im thinking bali would do me quite well she and bourne were in the nextgen clinic in one of the campus buildings that overlooked the pacific the moon of hormuz had successfully docked at the lng terminal and the cargo of the highly compressed liquid was being piped from the tanker to onshore containers where it would be slowly warmed expanding to six hundred times its present volume so it could be used by individual consumers and utility and business power plants the laptop had been turned over to the nextgen it department so the software could be parsed and permanently shut down the grateful ceo of nextgen had just left the clinic after promoting moira to president of the security division and offering bourne a highly lucrative consulting position with the firm bourne had phoned soraya each of them bringing the other up to date hed given her the address of severs house detailing the clandestine operation it housed i wish i knew what a vacation felt like bourne said when hed finished the call well moira smiled at him youve only to ask bourne considered for a long time vacations were something hed never contemplated but if ever there was a time to take one he thought this was it he looked back at her and nodded her smile broadened ill have nextgen make all the arrangements how long do you want to go for how long bourne said right now ill take forever on his way to the airport bourne stopped at the long beach memorial medical center where professor sever had been admitted moira who had declined to come up with him was waiting for him in the chauffeured car nextgen had hired for them theyd put sever in a private room on the fifth floor the room was deathly still except for the respirator the professor had sunk deeper into a coma and was now unable to breathe on his own a thick tube emerged from his throat snaking to the respirator that wheezed like an asthmatic other smaller tubes were needled into severs arms a catheter attached to a plastic bladder hooked to the side of the bed caught his urine his bluish eyelids were so thin bourne thought he could see his pupils beneath them standing beside his former mentor he found that he had nothing to say he wondered why hed felt compelled to come here maybe it was simply to look once more on the face of evil arkadin was a killer pure and simple but this man had made himself brick by brick into a liar and a deceiver and yet he looked so frail so helpless now it was difficult to believe he was the mastermind of the monstrous plan to incinerate much of long beach because as hed said his sect couldnt live in the modern world it was bound to destroy it was that the real reason or had sever once again lied to him hed never know now he was abruptly nauseated by being in severs presence but as he turned away a small dapper man came in allowing the door to close at his back jason bourne when bourne nodded the man said my name is frederick willard soraya told me about you bourne said well done willard thank you sir please dont call me sir willard gave a small deprecating smile pardon me my training is so ingrained in me thats all i am now he glanced over at sever do you think hell live hes alive now bourne said but i wouldnt call it living willard nodded though he seemed not at all interested in the disposition of the figure lying in the bed i have a car waiting downstairs bourne said as it happens so do i willard smiled but there was something sad about it i know that you worked for treadstone not treadstone bourne said alex conklin i worked for conklin too many years ago its one and the same mr bourne bourne felt impatience now he was eager to join moira to see the sherbet skies of bali you see i know all of treadstones secretsall of them this is something only you and i know mr bourne a nurse came in on her silent white shoes checked all of severs feeds scribbled on his chart then left them alone again mr bourne i thought long and hard about whether i should come here to tell you he cleared his throat you see the man you fought on the tanker the russian who went overboard arkadin leonid danilovich arkadin yes willards eyes met bournes and something inside him winced away he was treadstone what bourne couldnt believe what he was hearing arkadin was treadstone willard nodded before youin fact he was conklins pupil just before you but what happened to him how did he wind up working for semion icoupov it was icoupov who sent him to conklin they were friends once upon a time willard said conklin was intrigued when icoupov told him about arkadin treadstone was moving into a new phase by then conklin believed arkadin was perfect for what he had in mind but arkadin rebelled he went rogue almost killed conklin before he escaped to russia bourne was desperately trying to process all this information at last he said willard do you know what alex had in mind when he created treadstone oh yes i told you i know all of treadstones secrets your mentor alex conklin was attempting to build the perfect beast the perfect beast what do you mean but bourne already knew because hed seen it when hed looked into arkadins eyes when he understood that what he was seeing reflected there was himself the ultimate warrior willard one hand on the door handle smiled now thats what you are mr bourne thats what leonid danilovich arkadin wasuntil that is he came up against you he scrutinized bournes face as if searching for a trace of the man whod trained him to be a consummate covert operative in the end conklin succeeded didnt he bourne felt a chill go through him what do you mean you against arkadin it was always meant to be that way willard opened the door the pity of it is conklin never lived to see who won but its you mr bourne its you
