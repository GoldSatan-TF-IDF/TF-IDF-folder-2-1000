michael connelly the lincoln lawyer the first book in the mickey haller series this is for daniel f daly and roger o mills there is no client as scary as an innocent man j michael haller criminal defense attorney los angeles part one pretrial intervention monday march one the morning air off the mojave in late winter is as clean and crisp as youll ever breathe in los angeles county it carries the taste of promise on it when it starts blowing in like that i like to keep a window open in my office there are a few people who know this routine of mine people like fernando valenzuela the bondsman not the baseball pitcher he called me as i was coming into lancaster for a nine oclock calendar call he must have heard the wind whistling in my cell phone mick he said you up north this morning at the moment i said as i put the window up to hear him better you got something yeah i got something i think i got a franchise player here but his first appearance is at eleven can you make it back down in time valenzuela has a storefront office on van nuys boulevard a block from the civic center which includes two courthouses and the van nuys jail he calls his business liberty bail bonds his phone number in red neon on the roof of his establishment can be seen from the highpower wing on the third floor of the jail his number is scratched into the paint on the wall next to every pay phone on every other ward in the jail you could say his name is also permanently scratched onto my christmas list at the end of the year i give a can of salted nuts to everybody on it planters holiday mix each can has a ribbon and bow on it but no nuts inside just cash i have a lot of bail bondsmen on my christmas list i eat holiday mix out of tupperware well into spring since my last divorce it is sometimes all i get for dinner before answering valenzuelas question i thought about the calendar call i was headed to my client was named harold casey if the docket was handled alphabetically i could make an eleven oclock hearing down in van nuys no problem but judge orton powell was in his last term on the bench he was retiring that meant he no longer faced reelection pressures like those from the private bar to demonstrate his freedomand possibly as a form of payback to those he had been politically beholden to for twelve yearshe liked to mix things up in his courtroom sometimes the calendar went alphabetical sometimes reverse alphabetical sometimes by filing date you never knew how the call would go until you got there often lawyers cooled their heels for better than an hour in powells courtroom the judge liked that i think i can make eleven i said without knowing for sure whats the case guys gotta be big money beverly hills address family lawyer waltzing in here first thing this is the real thing mick they booked him on a half mil and his mothers lawyer came in here today ready to sign over property in malibu to secure it didnt even ask about getting it lowered first i guess they arent too worried about him running booked for what i asked i kept my voice even the scent of money in the water often leads to a feeding frenzy but i had taken care of valenzuela on enough christmases to know i had him on the hook exclusively i could play it cool the cops booked him for agassault gbi and attempted rape for starters the bondsman answered the da hasnt filed yet as far as i know the police usually overbooked the charges what mattered was what the prosecutors finally filed and took to court i always say cases go in like a lion and come out like a lamb a case going in as attempted rape and aggravated assault with great bodily injury could easily come out as simple battery it wouldnt surprise me and it wouldnt make for much of a franchise case still if i could get to the client and make a fee agreement based on the announced charges i could look good when the da later knocked them down you got any of the details i asked he was booked last night it sounds like a bar pickup gone bad the family lawyer said the womans in it for the money you know the civil suit to follow the criminal case but im not so sure she got beat up pretty good from what i heard whats the family lawyers name hold on a sec ive got his card here somewhere i looked out the window while waiting for valenzuela to find the business card i was two minutes from the lancaster courthouse and twelve minutes from calendar call i needed at least three of those minutes in between to confer with my client and give him the bad news okay here it is valenzuela said guys name is cecil c dobbs esquire out of century city see i told you money valenzuela was right but it wasnt the lawyers century city address that said money it was the name i knew of c c dobbs by reputation and guessed that there wouldnt be more than one or two names on his entire client list that didnt have a belair or holmby hills address his kind of client went home to the places where the stars seemed to reach down at night to touch the anointed give me the clients name i said that would be louis ross roulet he spelled it and i wrote it down on a legal pad almost like the spinning wheel but you pronounce it roolay he said you going to be here mick before responding i wrote the name c c dobbs on the pad i then answered valenzuela with a question why me i asked was i asked for or did you suggest me i had to be careful with this i had to assume dobbs was the kind of lawyer who would go to the california bar in a heartbeat if he came across a criminal defense attorney paying off bondsmen for client referrals in fact i started wondering if the whole thing might be a bar sting operation that valenzuela hadnt picked up on i wasnt one of the bars favorite sons they had come at me before more than once i asked roulet if he had a lawyer you know a criminal defense lawyer and he said no i told him about you i didnt push it i just said you were good soft sell you know was this before or after dobbs came into it no before roulet called me this morning from the jail they got him up on high power and he saw the sign i guess dobbs showed up after that i told him you were in gave him your pedigree and he was cool with it hell be there at eleven youll see how he is i didnt speak for a long moment i wondered how truthful valenzuela was being with me a guy like dobbs would have had his own man if it wasnt his own forte then hed have had a criminal specialist in the firm or at least on standby but valenzuelas story seemed to contradict this roulet came to him emptyhanded it told me that there was more to this case i didnt know than what i did hey mick you there valenzuela prompted i made a decision it was a decision that would eventually lead me back to jesus menendez and that i would in many ways come to regret but at the moment it was made it was just another choice made of necessity and routine ill be there i said into the phone ill see you at eleven i was about to close the phone when i heard valenzuelas voice come back at me and youll take care of me for this right mick i mean you know if this is the franchise it was the first time valenzuela had ever sought assurance of a payback from me it played further into my paranoia and i carefully constructed an answer that would satisfy him and the barif it was listening dont worry val youre on my christmas list i closed the phone before he could say anything else and told my driver to drop me off at the employee entrance to the courthouse the line at the metal detector would be shorter and quicker there and the security men usually didnt mind the lawyersthe regularssneaking through so they could make court on time as i thought about louis ross roulet and the case and the possible riches and dangers that waited for me i put the window back down so i could enjoy the mornings last minute of clean fresh air it still carried the taste of promise two the courtroom in department a was crowded with lawyers negotiating and socializing on both sides of the bar when i got there i could tell the session was going to start on time because i saw the bailiff seated at his desk this meant the judge was close to taking the bench in los angeles county the bailiffs are actually sworn deputy sheriffs who are assigned to the jail division i approached the bailiff whose desk was right next to the bar railing so citizens could come up to ask questions without having to violate the space assigned to the lawyers defendants and courtroom personnel i saw the calendar on the clipboard in front of him i checked the nameplate on his uniformr rodriguezbefore speaking roberto you got my guy on there harold casey the bailiff used his finger to start down the list on the call sheet but stopped quickly this meant i was in luck yeah casey hes second up alphabetical today good do i have time to go back and see him no theyre bringing the first group in now i just called the judge is coming out youll probably have a couple minutes to see your guy in the pen thank you i started to walk toward the gate when he called after me and its reynaldo not roberto right right im sorry about that reynaldo us bailiffs we all look alike right i didnt know if that was an attempt at humor or just a dig at me i didnt answer i just smiled and went through the gate i nodded at a couple lawyers i didnt know and a couple that i did one stopped me to ask how long i was going to be up in front of the judge because he wanted to gauge when to come back for his own clients appearance i told him i was going to be quick during a calendar call incarcerated defendants are brought to the courtroom in groups of four and held in a woodandglass enclosure known as the pen this allows the defendants to confer with their attorneys in the moments before their case is called for whatever matter is before the court i got to the side of the pen just as the door from the interior holding cell was opened by a deputy and the first four defendants on the docket were marched out the last of the four to step into the pen was harold casey my client i took a position near the side wall so that we would have privacy on at least one side and signaled him over casey was big and tall as they tend to recruit them in the road saints motorcycle gangor club as the membership prefers to be known while being held in the lancaster jail he had cut his hair and shaved as i had requested and he looked reasonably presentable except for the tattoos that wrapped both arms and poked up above his collar but there is only so much you can do i dont know much about the effect of tattoos on a jury but i suspect its not overly positive especially when grinning skulls are involved i do know that jurors in general dont care for ponytailson either the defendants or the lawyers who represent them casey or hard case as he was known in the club was charged with cultivation possession and sale of marijuana as well as other drug and weapons charges in a predawn raid on the ranch where he lived and worked sheriffs deputies found a barn and quonset hut complex that had been turned into an indoor growing facility more than two thousand fully mature plants were seized along with sixtythree pounds of harvested marijuana packaged in various weights in plastic bags additionally twelve ounces of crystal meth which the packagers sprinkled on the harvested crop to give it an extra kick were seized along with a small arsenal of weapons many of them later determined to be stolen it would appear that hard case was fucked the state had him cold he was actually found asleep on a couch in the barn five feet from the packaging table added to this he had twice previously been convicted of drug offenses and was currently still on parole for the most recent in the state of california the third time is the charm realistically casey was facing at least a decade in prison even with good time but what was unusual about casey was that he was a defendant who was looking forward to trial and even to the likelihood of conviction he had refused to waive his right to a speedy trial and now less than three months after his arrest eagerly wanted to bring it on he was eager because it was likely that his only hope lay in an appeal of that likely conviction thanks to his attorney casey saw a glimmer of hopethat small twinkling light that only a good attorney can bring to the darkness of a case like this from this glimmer a case strategy was born that might ultimately work to free casey it was daring and would cost casey time as he waited out the appeal but he knew as well as i did that it was the only real shot he had the crack in the states case was not in its assumption that casey was a marijuana grower packager and seller the state was absolutely correct in these assumptions and the evidence more than proved it it was in how the state came to that evidence that the case tottered on an unsteady foundation it was my job to probe that crack in trial exploit it put it on record and then convince an appellate court of what i had not been able to convince judge orton powell of during a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence in the case the seed of the prosecution of harold casey was planted on a tuesday in middecember when casey walked into a home depot in lancaster and made a number of mundane purchases that included three lightbulbs of the variety used in hydroponic farming the man behind him in the checkout line happened to be an offduty sheriffs deputy about to purchase outdoor christmas lights the deputy recognized some of the artwork on caseys armsmost notably the skull with halo tattoo that is the emblematic signature of the road saintsand put two and two together the offduty man then dutifully followed caseys harley as he rode to the ranch in nearby pearblossom this information was passed to the sheriffs drug squad which arranged for an unmarked helicopter to fly over the ranch with a thermal imaging camera the subsequent photographs detailing rich red heat blooms from the barn and quonset hut along with the statement of the deputy who saw casey purchase hydroponic lights were submitted in an affidavit to a judge the next morning casey was rousted from sleep on the couch by deputies with a signed search warrant in an earlier hearing i argued that all evidence against casey should be excluded because the probable cause for the search constituted an invasion of caseys right to privacy using an individuals commonplace purchases at a hardware store as a springboard to conduct a further invasion of privacy through surveillance on the ground and in the air and by thermal imaging would surely be viewed as excessive by the framers of the constitution judge powell rejected my argument and the case moved toward trial or disposition by plea agreement in the meantime new information came to light that would bolster caseys appeal of a conviction analysis of the photographs taken during the flyover of caseys house and the focal specifications of the thermal camera used by the deputies indicated the helicopter was flying no more than two hundred feet off the ground when the photographs were taken the us supreme court has held that a law enforcement observation flight over a suspects property does not violate an individuals right to privacy so long as the aircraft is in public airspace i had raul levin my investigator check with the federal aviation administration caseys ranch was located beneath no airport flight pattern the floor for public airspace above the ranch was a thousand feet the deputies had clearly invaded caseys privacy while gathering the probable cause to raid the ranch my job now was to take the case to trial and elicit testimony from the deputies and pilot as to the altitude they were flying when they went over the ranch if they told the truth i had them if they lied i had them i dont relish the idea of embarrassing law enforcement officers in open court but my hope was that they would lie if a jury sees a cop lie on the witness stand then the case might as well end right there you dont have to appeal a notguilty verdict the state has no comebacks from a notguilty verdict either way i was confident i had a winner we just had to get to trial and there was only one thing holding us back that was what i needed to talk to casey about before the judge took the bench and called the case my client sauntered over to the corner of the pen and didnt offer a hello i didnt either he knew what i wanted wed had this conversation before harold this is calendar call i said this is when i tell the judge if were ready to go to trial i already know the states ready so todays about us so so theres a problem last time we were here you told me id be getting some money but here we are harold and no money dont worry i have your money thats why i am worried you have my money i dont have my money its coming i talked to my boys yesterday its coming you said that last time too i dont work for free harold the expert i had go over the photos doesnt work for free either your retainer is long gone i want some more money or youre going to have to get yourself a new lawyer a public defender no pd man i want you well i got expenses and i gotta eat you know what my nut is each week just to pay for the yellow pages take a guess casey said nothing a grand averages out a grand a week just to keep my ad in there and thats before i eat or pay the mortgage or the child support or put gas in the lincoln im not doing this on a promise harold i work on green inspiration casey seemed unimpressed i checked around he said you cant just quit on me not now the judge wont let you a hush fell over the courtroom as the judge stepped out of the door to his chambers and took the two steps up to the bench the bailiff called the courtroom to order it was showtime i just looked at casey for a long moment and stepped away he had an amateur jailhouse knowledge of the law and how it worked he knew more than most but he was still in for a surprise i took a seat against the rail behind the defendants table the first case called was a bail reconsideration that was handled quickly then the clerk called the case of california v casey and i stepped up to the table michael haller for the defense i said the prosecutor announced his presence as well he was a young guy named victor devries he had no idea what was going to hit him when we got to trial judge orton powell made the usual inquiries about whether a lastminute disposition in the case was possible every judge had an overflowing calendar and an overriding mandate to clear cases through disposition the last thing any judge wanted to hear was that there was no hope of agreement and that a trial was inevitable but powell took the bad news from devries and me in stride and asked if we were ready to schedule the trial for later in the week devries said yes i said no your honor i said i would like to carry this over until next week if possible what is the cause of your delay mr haller the judge asked impatiently the prosecution is ready and i want to dispose of this case i want to dispose of it as well your honor but the defense is having trouble locating a witness who will be necessary to our case an indispensable witness your honor i think a oneweek carryover should be sufficient by next week we should be ready to go forward as expected devries objected to the delay your honor this is the first the state has heard about a missing witness mr haller has had almost three months to locate his witnesses hes the one who wanted the speedy trial and now he wants to wait i think this is just a delay tactic because hes facing a case that you can hold on to the rest of that for the jury mr devries the judge said mr haller you think one week will solve your problem yes your honor okay well see you and mr casey next monday and you will be ready to go is that understood yes your honor thank you the clerk called the next case and i stepped away from the defense table i watched a deputy lead my client out of the pen casey glanced back at me a look on his face that seemed to be equal parts anger and confusion i went over to reynaldo rodriguez and asked if i could be allowed back into the holding area to further confer with my client it was a professional courtesy allowed to most of the regulars rodriguez got up unlocked a door behind his desk and ushered me through i made sure to thank him by his correct name casey was in a holding cell with one other defendant the man whose case had been called ahead of his in the courtroom the cell was large and had benches running along three sides the bad thing about getting your case called early in the courtroom is that after the hearing you have to sit in this cage until it fills with enough people to run a full bus back to the county jail casey came right up to the bars to speak to me what witness were you talking about in there he demanded mr green i said mr green is all we need for this case to go forward caseys face contorted in anger i tried to cut him off at the pass look harold i know you want to move this along and get to the trial and then the appeal but youve got to pay the freight along the way i know from long hard experience that it does me no good to chase people for money after the horse is out of the barn you want to play now then you pay now i nodded and was about to turn back to the door that led to freedom but then i spoke to him again and dont think the judge in there didnt know what was going on i said you got a young prosecutor whos wet behind the ears and doesnt have to worry about where his next paychecks coming from but orton powell spent a lot of years in the defense bar before he got to the bench he knows about chasing indispensable witnesses like mr green and he probably wont look too kindly upon a defendant who doesnt pay his lawyer i gave him the wink harold if i want off the case ill get off but what id rather do is come in here next monday and stand up out there and tell him we found our witness and we are ready to go you understand casey didnt say anything at first he walked to the far side of the cell and sat down on the bench he didnt look at me when he finally spoke as soon as i get to a phone he said sounds good harold ill tell one of the deputies you have to make a call make the call then sit tight and ill see you next week well get this thing going i headed back to the door my steps quick i hate being inside a jail im not sure why i guess its because sometimes the line seems so thin the line between being a criminal attorney and a criminal attorney sometimes im not sure which side of the bars i am on to me its always a deadbang miracle that i get to walk out the way i walked in three in the hallway outside the courtroom i turned my cell phone back on and called my driver to tell him i was coming out i then checked voicemail and found messages from lorna taylor and fernando valenzuela i decided to wait until i was in the car to make the callbacks earl briggs my driver had the lincoln right out front earl didnt get out and open the door or anything his deal was just to drive me while he worked off the fee he owed me for getting him probation on a cocaine sales conviction i paid him twenty bucks an hour to drive me but then held half of it back to go against the fee it wasnt quite what he was making dealing crack in the projects but it was safer legal and something that could go on a résumé earl said he wanted to go straight in life and i believed him i could hear the sound of hiphop pulsing behind the closed windows of the town car as i approached but earl killed the music as soon as i reached for the door handle i slid into the back and told him to head toward van nuys who was that you were listening to i asked him um that was three six mafia dirty south thats right over the years i had become knowledgeable in the subtle distinctions regional and otherwise in rap and hiphop across the board most of my clients listened to it many of them developing their life strategies from it i reached over and picked up the shoebox full of cassette tapes from the boyleston case and chose one at random i noted the tape number and the time in the little logbook i kept in the shoebox i handed the tape over the seat to earl and he slid it into the dashboard stereo i didnt have to tell him to play it at a volume so low that it would amount to little more than background noise earl had been with me for three months he knew what to do roger boyleston was one of my few courtappointed clients he was facing a variety of federal drugtrafficking charges dea wiretaps on boylestons phones had led to his arrest and the seizure of six kilos of cocaine that he had planned to distribute through a network of dealers there were numerous tapesmore than fifty hours of recorded phone conversations boyleston talked to many people about what was coming and when to expect it the case was a slam dunk for the government boyleston was going to go away for a long time and there was almost nothing i could do but negotiate a deal trading boylestons cooperation for a lower sentence that didnt matter though what mattered to me were the tapes i took the case because of the tapes the federal government would pay me to listen to the tapes in preparation for defending my client that meant i would get a minimum of fifty billable hours out of boyleston and the government before it was all settled so i made sure the tapes were in heavy rotation whenever i was riding in the lincoln i wanted to make sure that if i ever had to put my hand on the book and swear to tell the truth i could say in good conscience that i played every one of those tapes i billed uncle sugar for i called lorna taylor back first lorna is my case manager the phone number that runs on my halfpage ad in the yellow pages and on thirtysix bus benches scattered through highcrime areas in the south and east county goes directly to the officesecond bedroom of her kings road condo in west hollywood the address the california bar and all the clerks of the courts have for me is the condo as well lorna is the first buffer to get to me you start with her my cell number is given out to only a few and lorna is the gatekeeper she is tough smart professional and beautiful lately though i only get to verify this last attribute once a month or so when i take her to lunch and sign checksshes my bookkeeper too law office she said when i called in sorry i was still in court i said explaining why i didnt get her call whats up you talked to val right yeah im heading down to van nuys now i got that at eleven he called here to make sure he sounds nervous he thinks this guy is the golden goose wants to make sure hes along for the ride ill call him back to reassure him i did some preliminary checking on the name louis ross roulet credit check is excellent the name in the times archive comes up with a few hits all real estate transactions looks like he works for a real estate firm in beverly hills its called windsor residential estates looks like they handle all exclusive pocket listingsnot the sort of properties where they put a sign out front thats good anything else not on that and just the usual so far on the phone which meant that she had fielded the usual number of calls drawn by the bus benches and the yellow pages all from people who wanted a lawyer before the callers hit my radar they had to convince lorna that they could pay for what they wanted she was sort of like the nurse behind the desk in the emergency room you have to convince her you have valid insurance before she sends you back to see the doc next to lornas phone she keeps a rate schedule that starts with a flat fee to handle a dui and ranges to the hourly fees i charge for felony trials she makes sure every potential client is a paying client and knows the costs of the crime they have been charged with theres that saying dont do the crime if you cant do the time lorna likes to say that with me its dont do the crime if you cant pay for my time she accepts mastercard and visa and will get purchase approval before a client ever gets to me nobody we know i asked gloria dayton called from twin towers i groaned the twin towers was the countys main lockup in downtown it housed women in one tower and men in the other gloria dayton was a highpriced prostitute who needed my legal services from time to time the first time i represented her was at least ten years earlier when she was young and drugfree and still had life in her eyes now she was a pro bono client i never charged her i just tried to convince her to quit the life when did she get popped last night or rather this morning her first appearance is after lunch i dont know if i can make that with this van nuys thing theres also a complication cocaine possession as well as the usual i knew that gloria worked exclusively through contacts made on the internet where she billed herself on a variety of websites as glory days she was no streetwalker or barroom troller when she got popped it was usually after an undercover vice officer was able to penetrate her check system and set up a date the fact that she had cocaine on her person when they met sounded like an unusual lapse on her part or a plant from the cop all right if she calls back tell her i will try to be there and if im not there i will have somebody take it will you call the court and firm up the hearing im on it but mickey when are you going to tell her this is the last time i dont know maybe today what else isnt that enough for one day itll do i guess we talked a little more about my schedule for the rest of the week and i opened my laptop on the folddown table so i could check my calendar against hers i had a couple hearings set for each morning and a oneday trial on thursday it was all south side drug stuff my meat and potatoes at the end of the conversation i told her that i would call her after the van nuys hearing to let her know if and how the roulet case would impact things one last thing i said you said the place roulet works handles pretty exclusive real estate deals right yeah every deal his name was attached to in the archives was in seven figures a couple got up into the eights holmby hills belair places like that i nodded thinking that roulets status might make him a person of interest to the media then why dont you tip sticks to it i said you sure yeah we might be able to work something there will do talk to you later by the time i closed the phone earl had us back on the antelope valley freeway heading south we were making good time and getting to van nuys for roulets first appearance wasnt going to be a problem i called fernando valenzuela to tell him thats real good the bondsman said ill be waiting as he spoke i watched two motorcycles glide by my window each rider wore a black leather vest with the skull and halo patch sewn on the back anything else i asked yeah one other thing i should probably tell you valenzuela said i was doublechecking with the court on when his first appearance was going to be and i found out the case was assigned to maggie mcfierce i dont know if thats going to be a problem for you or not maggie mcfierce as in margaret mcpherson who happened to be one of the toughest and yes fiercest deputy district attorneys assigned to the van nuys courthouse she also happened to be my first exwife it wont be a problem for me i said without hesitation shes the one wholl have the problem the defendant has the right to his choice of counsel if there is a conflict of interest between the defense lawyer and the prosecutor then it is the prosecutor who must bow out i knew maggie would hold me personally responsible for her losing the reins on what might be a big case but i couldnt help that it had happened before in my laptop i still had a motion to disqualify from the last case in which we had crossed paths if necessary i would just have to change the name of the defendant and print it out id be good to go and shed be as good as gone the two motorcycles had now moved in front of us i turned and looked out the back window there were three more harleys behind us you know what that means though i said no what shell go for no bail she always does with crimes against women shit can she get it im looking at a nice chunk of change on this man i dont know you said the guys got family and c c dobbs i can make something out of that well see shit valenzuela was seeing his major payday disappear ill see you there val i closed the phone and looked over the seat at earl how long have we had the escort i asked just came up on us earl said you want me to do something lets see what they i didnt have to wait until the end of my sentence one of the riders from the rear came up alongside the lincoln and signaled us toward the upcoming exit for the vasquez rocks county park i recognized him as teddy vogel a former client and the highestranked road saint not incarcerated he might have been the largest saint as well he went at least pounds and he gave the impression of a fat kid riding his little brothers bike pull off earl i said lets see what hes got we pulled into the parking lot next to the jagged rock formation named after an outlaw who had hid in them a century before i saw two people sitting and having a picnic on the edge of one of the highest ledges i didnt think i would feel comfortable eating a sandwich in such a dangerous spot and position i lowered my window as teddy vogel approached on foot the other four saints had killed their engines but remained on their bikes vogel leaned down to the window and put one of his giant forearms on the sill i could feel the car tilt down a few inches counselor hows it hanging he said just fine ted i said not wanting to call him by his obvious gang sobriquet of teddy bear whats up with you what happened to the ponytail some people objected to it so i cut it off a jury huh mustve been a collection of stiffs from up this way whats up ted i got a call from hard case over there in the lancaster pen he said i might catch you heading south said you were stalling his case till you got some green that right counselor it was said as routine conversation no threat in his voice or words and i didnt feel threatened two years ago i got an abduction and aggravated assault case against vogel knocked down to a disturbing the peace he ran a saintsowned strip club on sepulveda in van nuys his arrest came after he learned that one of his most productive dancers had quit and crossed the street to work at a competing club vogel had crossed the street after her grabbed her off the stage and carried her back to his club she was naked a passing motorist called the police knocking the case down was one of my better plays and vogel knew this he had a soft spot for me hes pretty much got it right i said i work for a living if he wants me to work for him hes gotta pay me we gave you five grand in december vogel said thats long gone ted more than half went to the expert who is going to blow the case up the rest went to me and i already worked off those hours if im going to take it to trial then i need to refill the tank you want another five no i need ten and i told hard case that last week its a threeday trial and ill need to bring my expert in from kodak in new york ive got his fee to cover and he wants first class in the air and the chateau marmont on the ground thinks hes going to be drinking at the bar with movie stars or something that place is four hundred a night just for the cheap rooms youre killing me counselor whatever happened to that slogan you had in the yellow pages reasonable doubt for a reasonable fee you call ten grand reasonable i liked that slogan it brought in a lot of clients but the california bar wasnt so pleased with it made me get rid of it ten is the price and it is reasonable ted if you cant or dont want to pay it ill file the paperwork today ill drop out and he can go with a pd ill turn everything i have over but the pd probably wont have the budget to fly in the photo expert vogel shifted his position on the window sill and the car shuddered under the weight no no we want you hard case is important to us you know what i mean i want him out and back to work i watched him reach inside his vest with a hand that was so fleshy that the knuckles were indented it came out with a thick envelope that he passed into the car to me is this cash i asked thats right whats wrong with cash nothing but i have to give you a receipt its an irs reporting requirement this is the whole ten its all there i took the top off of a cardboard file box i keep on the seat next to me my receipt book was behind the current case files i started writing out the receipt most lawyers who get disbarred go down because of financial violations the mishandling or misappropriation of client fees i kept meticulous records and receipts i would never let the bar get to me that way so you had it all along i said as i wrote what if i had backed down to five what would you have done then vogel smiled he was missing one of his front teeth on the bottom had to have been a fight at the club he patted the other side of his vest i got another envelope with five in it right here counselor he said i was ready for you damn now i feel bad leaving you with money in your pocket i tore out his copy of the receipt and handed it out the window i receipted it to casey hes the client fine with me he took the receipt and dropped his arm off the window sill as he stood up straight the car returned to a normal level i wanted to ask him where the money came from which of the saints criminal enterprises had earned it whether a hundred girls had danced a hundred hours for him to pay me but that was a question i was better off not knowing the answer to i watched vogel saunter back to his harley and struggle to swing a trash canthick leg over the seat for the first time i noticed the double shocks on the back wheel i told earl to get back on the freeway and get going to van nuys where i now needed to make a stop at the bank before hitting the courthouse to meet my new client as we drove i opened the envelope and counted out the money twenties fifties and hundreddollar bills it was all there the tank was refilled and i was good to go with harold casey i would go to trial and teach his young prosecutor a lesson i would win if not in trial then certainly on appeal casey would return to the family and work of the road saints his guilt in the crime he was charged with was not something i even considered as i filled out a deposit slip for my client fees account mr haller earl said after a while what earl that man you told him was coming in from new york to be the expert will i be picking him up at the airport i shook my head there is no expert coming in from new york earl the best camera and photo experts in the world are right here in hollywood now earl nodded and his eyes held mine for a moment in the rearview mirror then he looked back at the road ahead i see he said nodding again and i nodded to myself no hesitation in what i had done or said that was my job that was how it worked after fifteen years of practicing law i had come to think of it in very simple terms the law was a large rusting machine that sucked up people and lives and money i was just a mechanic i had become expert at going into the machine and fixing things and extracting what i needed from it in return there was nothing about the law that i cherished anymore the law school notions about the virtue of the adversarial system of the systems checks and balances of the search for truth had long since eroded like the faces of statues from other civilizations the law was not about truth it was about negotiation amelioration manipulation i didnt deal in guilt and innocence because everybody was guilty of something but it didnt matter because every case i took on was a house built on a foundation poured by overworked and underpaid laborers they cut corners they made mistakes and then they painted over the mistakes with lies my job was to peel away the paint and find the cracks to work my fingers and tools into those cracks and widen them to make them so big that either the house fell down or failing that my client slipped through much of society thought of me as the devil but they were wrong i was a greasy angel i was the true road saint i was needed and wanted by both sides i was the oil in the machine i allowed the gears to crank and turn i helped keep the engine of the system running but all of that would change with the roulet case for me for him and certainly for jesus menendez four louis ross roulet was in a holding tank with seven other men who had made the halfblock bus ride from the van nuys jail to the van nuys courthouse there were only two white men in the cell and they sat next to each other on a bench while the six black men took the other side of the cell it was a form of darwinian segregation they were all strangers but there was strength in numbers since roulet supposedly came from beverly hills money i looked at the two white men and it was easy to choose between them one was rail thin with the desperate wet eyes of a hype who was long past fix time the other looked like the proverbial deer in the headlights i chose him mr roulet i said pronouncing the name the way valenzuela had told me to the deer nodded i signaled him over to the bars so i could talk quietly my name is michael haller people call me mickey i will be representing you during your first appearance today we were in the holding area behind the arraignment court where attorneys are routinely allowed access to confer with clients before court begins there is a blue line painted on the floor outside the cells the threefoot line i had to keep that distance from my client roulet grasped the bars in front of me like the others in the cage he had on ankle wrist and belly chains they wouldnt come off until he was taken into the courtroom he was in his early thirties and though at least six feet tall and pounds he seemed slight jail will do that to you his eyes were pale blue and it was rare for me to see the kind of panic that was so clearly set in them most of the time my clients have been in lockup before and they have the stonecold look of the predator its how they get by in jail but roulet was different he looked like prey he was scared and he didnt care who saw it and knew it this is a setup he said urgently and loudly you have to get me out of here i made a mistake with that woman thats all shes trying to set me up and i put my hands up to stop him be careful what you say in here i said in a low voice in fact be careful what you say until we get you out of here and can talk in private he looked around seemingly not understanding you never know who is listening i said and you never know who will say he heard you say something even if you didnt say anything best thing is to not talk about the case at all you understand best thing is not to talk to anyone about anything period he nodded and i signaled him down to the bench next to the bars there was a bench against the opposite wall and i sat down i am really here just to meet you and tell you who i am i said well talk about the case after we get you out i already spoke to your family lawyer mr dobbs out there and we will tell the judge that we are prepared to post bail do i have all of that right i opened a leather mont blanc folder and prepared to take notes on a legal pad roulet nodded he was learning good i said tell me about yourself how old you are whether youre married what ties you have to the community um im thirtytwo ive lived here my whole lifeeven went to school here ucla not married no kids i work divorced no never married i work for my familys business windsor residential estates its named after my mothers second husband its real estate we sell real estate i was writing notes without looking up at him i quietly asked how much money did you make last year when roulet didnt answer i looked up at him why do you need to know that he asked because i am going to get you out of here before the sun goes down today to do that i need to know everything about your standing in the community that includes your financial standing i dont know exactly what i made a lot of it was shares in the company you didnt file taxes roulet looked over his shoulder at the others in the cell and then whispered his answer yes i did on that my income was a quarter million but what youre saying is that with the shares you earned in the company you really made more right one of roulets cellmates came up to the bars next to him the other white man he had an agitated manner his hands in constant motion moving from hips to pockets to each other in desperate grasps hey man i need a lawyer too you got a card not for you pal theyll have a lawyer out there for you i looked back at roulet and waited a moment for the hype to move away he didnt i looked back at him look this is private could you leave us alone the hype made some kind of motion with his hands and shuffled back to the corner he had come from i looked back at roulet what about charitable organizations i asked what do you mean roulet responded are you involved in any charities do you give to any charities yeah the company does we give to make a wish and a runaway shelter in hollywood i think its called my friends place or something like that okay good are you going to get me out im going to try youve got some heavy charges on youi checked before coming back hereand i have a feeling the da is going to request no bail but this is good stuff i can work with it i indicated my notes no bail he said in a loud panicked voice the others in the cell looked in his direction because what he had said was their collective nightmare no bail calm down i said i said that is what she is going to go for i didnt say she would get it when was the last time you were arrested i always threw that in out of the blue so i could watch their eyes and see if there was going to be a surprise thrown at me in court never ive never been arrested this whole thing is i know i know but we dont want to talk about that here remember he nodded i looked at my watch court was about to start and i still needed to talk to maggie mcfierce im going to go now i said ill see you out there in a few minutes and well see about getting you out of here when we are out there dont say anything until you check with me if the judge asks you how you are doing you check with me okay well dont i say not guilty to the charges no theyre not going to even ask you that today all they do is read you the charges talk about bail and set a date for an arraignment thats when we say not guilty so today you say nothing no outbursts nothing got that he nodded and frowned are you going to be all right louis he nodded glumly just so you know i said i charge twentyfive hundred dollars for a first appearance and bail hearing like this is that going to be a problem he shook his head no i liked that he wasnt talking most of my clients talk way too much usually they talk themselves right into prison good we can talk about the rest of it after you are out of here and we can get together in private i closed my leather folder hoping he had noticed it and was impressed then stood up one last thing i said whyd you pick me theres a lot of lawyers out there why me it was a question that didnt matter to our relationship but i wanted to test valenzuelas veracity roulet shrugged i dont know he said i remembered your name from something i read in the paper what did you read about me it was a story about a case where the evidence got thrown out against some guy i think it was drugs or something you won the case because they had no evidence after that the hendricks case it was the only one i could think of that had made the papers in recent months hendricks was another road saint client and the sheriffs department had put a gps bug on his harley to track his deliveries doing that on public roads was fine but when he parked his bike in the kitchen of his home at night that bug constituted unlawful entry by the cops the case was tossed by a judge during the preliminary hearing it made a decent splash in the times i cant remember the name of the client roulet said i just remembered your name your last name actually when i called the bail bondsman today i gave him the name haller and asked him to get you and to call my own attorney why no reason just curious i appreciate the call ill see you in the courtroom i put the differences between what roulet had said about my hiring and what valenzuela had told me into the bank for later consideration and made my way back into the arraignment court i saw maggie mcfierce sitting at one end of the prosecution table she was there along with five other prosecutors the table was large and lshaped so it could accommodate an endlessly revolving number of lawyers who could sit and still face the bench a prosecutor assigned to the courtroom handled most of the routine appearances and arraignments that were paraded through each day but special cases brought the big guns out of the district attorneys office on the second floor of the courthouse next door tv cameras did that too as i stepped through the bar i saw a man setting up a video camera on a tripod next to the bailiffs desk there was no network symbol on the camera or the mans clothes the man was a freelancer who had gotten wind of the case and would shoot the hearing and then try to sell it to one of the local stations whose news director needed a thirtysecond story when i had checked with the bailiff earlier about roulets place on the calendar he told me the judge had already authorized the filming i walked up to my exwife from behind and bent down to whisper into her ear she was looking at photographs in a file she was wearing a navy suit with a thin gray stripe her ravencolored hair was tied back with a matching gray ribbon i loved her hair when it was back like that are you the one who used to have the roulet case she looked up not recognizing the whisper her face was involuntarily forming a smile but then it turned into a frown when she saw it was me she knew exactly what i had meant by using the past tense and she slapped the file closed dont tell me she said sorry he liked what i did on hendricks and gave me a call son of a bitch i wanted this case haller this is the second time youve done this to me i guess this town aint big enough for the both of us i said in a poor cagney imitation she groaned all right she said in quick surrender ill go peacefully after this hearing unless you object to even that i might you going for a nobail hold thats right but that wont change with the prosecutor that was a directive from the second floor i nodded that meant a case supervisor must have called for the nobail hold hes connected in the community and has never been arrested i studied her reaction not having had the time to make sure roulets denial of ever being previously arrested was the truth its always amazing how many clients lie about previous engagements with the machine when it is a lie that has no hope of going the distance but maggie gave no indication that she knew otherwise maybe it was true maybe i had an honesttogoodness firsttime offender for a client it doesnt matter whether hes done anything before maggie said what matters is what he did last night she opened the file and quickly checked through the photos until she saw the one she liked and snatched it out heres what your pillar of the community did last night so i dont really care what he did before im just going to make sure he doesnt get out to do this again the photo was an x closeup of a womans face the swelling around the right eye was so extensive that the eye was completely and tightly closed the nose was broken and pushed off center bloodsoaked gauze protruded from each nostril there was a deep gash over the right eyebrow that had been closed with nine butterfly stitches the lower lip was cut and had a marblesize swelling as well the worst thing about the photo was the eye that was undamaged the woman looked at the camera with fear pain and humiliation undeniably expressed in that one tearful eye if he did it i said because that is what i would be expected to say right maggie said sure if he did it he was only arrested in her home with her blood on him but youre right thats a valid question i like it when youre sarcastic do you have the arrest report there id like to get a copy of it you can get it from whoever takes the case over from me no favors haller not this time i waited expecting more banter more indignation maybe another shot across the bow but that was all she said i decided that getting more out of her on the case was a lost cause i changed the subject so i said how is she shes scared shitless and hurting like hell how else would she be she looked up at me and i saw the immediate recognition and then judgment in her eyes you werent even asking about the victim were you i didnt answer i didnt want to lie to her your daughter is doing fine she said perfunctorily she likes the things you send her but she would rather you show up a little more often that wasnt a shot across the bow that was a direct hit and it was deserved it seemed as though i was always chasing cases even on weekends deep down inside i knew i needed to start chasing my daughter around the backyard more often the time to do it was going by i will i said starting right now what about this weekend fine you want me to tell her tonight uh maybe wait until tomorrow so i know for sure she gave me one of those knowing nods we had been through this before great let me know tomorrow this time i didnt enjoy the sarcasm what does she need i asked trying to stumble back to just being even i just told you what she needs more of you in her life okay i promise i will do that she didnt respond i really mean that maggie ill call you tomorrow she looked up at me and was ready to hit me with both barrels she had done it before saying i was all talk and no action when it came to fatherhood but i was saved by the start of the court session the judge came out of chambers and bounded up the steps to the bench the bailiff called the courtroom to order without another word to maggie i left the prosecution table and went back to one of the seats along the bar the judge asked his clerk if there was any business to be discussed before the custodies were brought out there was none so the judge ordered the first group out as with the courtroom in lancaster there was a large holding area for incustody defendants i got up and moved to the opening in the glass when i saw roulet come through the door i signaled him over youre going first i told him i asked the judge to take you out of order as a favor i want to try to get you out of here this was not the truth i hadnt asked the judge anything and even if i had the judge would do no such thing for me as a favor roulet was going first because of the media presence in the courtroom it was a general practice to deal with the media cases first this was a courtesy to the cameramen who supposedly had other assignments to get to but it also made for less tension in the courtroom when lawyers defendants and even the judge could operate without a television camera on them whys that camera here roulet asked in a panicked whisper is that for me yes its for you somebody tipped him to the case if you dont want to be filmed try to use me as a shield roulet shifted his position so i was blocking the view of him from the camera across the courtroom this lowered the chances that the cameraman would be able to sell the story and film to a local news program that was good it also meant that if he was able to sell the story i would be the focal point of the images that went with it this was also good the roulet case was called his name mispronounced by the clerk and maggie announced her presence for the prosecution and then i announced mine maggie had upped the charges as was her usual mo as maggie mcfierce roulet now faced attempted murder along with the attempted rape count it would make it easier for her to argue for a nobail hold the judge informed roulet of his constitutional rights and set an arraignment date for march speaking for roulet i asked to address the nobail hold this set off a spirited backandforth between maggie and me all of which was refereed by the judge who knew we were formerly married because he had attended our wedding while maggie listed the atrocities committed upon the victim i in turn listed roulets ties to the community and charitable efforts and pointed to c c dobbs in the gallery and offered to put him on the stand to further discuss roulets good standing dobbs was my ace in the hole his stature in the legal community would supersede roulets standing and certainly be influential with the judge who held his position on the bench at the behest of the votersand campaign contributors the bottom line judge is that the state cannot make a case for this man being a flight risk or a danger to the community i said in closing mr roulet is anchored in this community and intends to do nothing other than vigorously attack the false charges that have been leveled against him i used the word attack purposely in case the statement got on the air and happened to be watched by the woman who had leveled the charges your honor maggie responded all grandstanding aside what should not be forgotten is that the victim in this case was brutally ms mcpherson the judge interrupted i think we have gone back and forth on this enough i am aware of the victims injuries as well as mr roulets standing i also have a busy calendar today i am going to set bail at one million dollars i am also going to require mr roulet to be supervised by the court with weekly checkins if he misses one he forfeits his freedom i quickly glanced out into the gallery where dobbs was sitting next to fernando valenzuela dobbs was a thin man who shaved his head to hide malepattern balding his thinness was exaggerated by valenzuelas girth i waited for a signal as to whether i should take the judges bail order or try to argue for a lower amount sometimes when a judge thinks he is giving you a gift it can backfire to press for moreor in this case less dobbs was sitting in the first seat in the first row he simply got up and started to walk out of the courtroom leaving valenzuela behind i took that to mean that i should leave well enough alone that the roulet family could handle the million i turned back to the bench thank you your honor i said the clerk immediately called the next case i glanced at maggie as she was closing the file on the case she would no longer prosecute she then stood up and walked out through the bar and down the center aisle of the courtroom she spoke to no one and she did not look back at me mr haller i turned to my client behind him i saw a deputy coming to take him back into holding hed be bused the half block back to jail and then depending on how fast dobbs and valenzuela worked released later in the day ill work with mr dobbs and get you out i said then well sit down and talk about the case thank you roulet said as he was led away thank you for being here remember what i said dont talk to strangers dont talk to anybody yes sir after he was gone i walked to the bar valenzuela was waiting at the gate for me with a big smile on his face roulets bail was likely the highest he had ever secured that meant his cut would be the highest hed ever received he clapped me on the arm as i came through the gate whatd i tell you he said we got ourselves a franchise here boss well see val i said well see five every attorney who works the machine has two fee schedules there is schedule a which lists the fees the attorney would like to get for certain services rendered and there is schedule b the fees he is willing to take because that is all the client can afford a franchise client is a defendant who wants to go to trial and has the money to pay his lawyers schedule a rates from first appearance to arraignment to preliminary hearing and on to trial and then appeal the franchise client demands hundreds if not thousands of billable hours he can keep gas in the tank for two to three years from where i hunt they are the rarest and most highly sought beast in the jungle and it was beginning to look like valenzuela had been on the money louis roulet was looking more and more like a franchise client it had been a dry spell for me it had been almost two years since id had anything even approaching a franchise case or client im talking about a case earning six figures there were many that started out looking like they might reach that rare plateau but they never went the distance c c dobbs was waiting in the hallway outside the arraignment court when i got out he was standing next to the wall of glass windows that looked down upon the civic center plaza below i walked up to him quickly i had a few seconds lead on valenzuela coming out of the court and i wanted some private time with dobbs sorry dobbs said before i could speak i didnt want to stay in there another minute it was so depressing to see the boy caught up in that cattle call the boy louis ive represented the family for twentyfive years i guess i still think of him as a boy are you going to be able to get him out it wont be a problem i have a call in to louiss mother to see how she wants to handle it whether to put up property or go with a bond to put up property to cover a milliondollar bail would mean that at least a million dollars in the propertys value could not be encumbered by a mortgage additionally the court might require a current appraisal of the property which could take days and keep roulet waiting in jail conversely a bond could be purchased through valenzuela for a ten percent premium the difference was that the ten percent was never returned that stayed with valenzuela for his risks and trouble and was the reason for his broad smile in the courtroom after paying his insurance premium on the milliondollar bail hed end up clearing close to ninety grand and he was worried about me taking care of him can i make a suggestion i asked please do louis looked a little frail when i saw him back in the lockup if i were you i would get him out of there as soon as possible to do that you should have valenzuela write a bond it will cost you a hundred grand but the boy will be out and safe you know what i mean dobbs turned to the window and leaned on the railing that ran along the glass i looked down and saw that the plaza was filling up with people from the government buildings on lunch break i could see many people with the redandwhite name tags i knew were given to jurors i know what you mean the other thing is that cases like this tend to bring the rats out of the walls what do you mean i mean other inmates who will say they heard somebody say something especially a case that gets on the news or into the newspapers theyll take that info off the tube and make it sound like our guy was talking thats criminal dobbs said indignantly that shouldnt be allowed yeah i know but it happens and the longer he stays in there the wider the window of opportunity is for one of these guys valenzuela joined us at the railing he didnt say anything i will suggest we go with the bond dobbs said i already called and she was in a meeting as soon as she calls me back we will move on this his words prompted something that had bothered me during the hearing she couldnt come out of a meeting to talk about her son in jail i was wondering why she wasnt in court today if this boy as you call him is so clean and upstanding dobbs looked at me like i hadnt used mouthwash in a month mrs windsor is a very busy and powerful woman i am sure that if i had stated it was an emergency concerning her son she would have been on the phone immediately mrs windsor she remarried after she and louiss father divorced that was a long time ago i nodded then realized that there was more to talk about with dobbs but nothing i wanted to discuss in front of valenzuela val why dont you go check on when louis will be back at van nuys jail so you can get him out thats easy valenzuela said hell go on the first bus back after lunch yeah well go doublecheck that while i finish with mr dobbs valenzuela was about to protest that he didnt need to doublecheck it when he realized what i was telling him okay he said ill go do it after he was gone i studied dobbs for a moment before speaking dobbs looked to be in his late fifties he had a deferential presence that probably came from thirty years of taking care of rich people my guess was that he had become rich in the process himself but it hadnt changed his public demeanor if were going to be working together i guess i should ask what you want to be called cecil cc mr dobbs cecil will be fine well my first question cecil is whether we are going to be working together do i have the job mr roulet made it clear to me he wanted you on the case to be honest you would not have been my first choice you may not have been any choice because frankly i had never heard of you but you are mr roulets first choice and that is acceptable to me in fact i thought you acquitted yourself quite well in the courtroom especially considering how hostile that prosecutor was toward mr roulet i noticed that the boy had become mr roulet now i wondered what had happened to advance him in dobbss view yeah well they call her maggie mcfierce shes pretty dedicated i thought she was a bit overboard do you think there is any way to get her removed from the case maybe get someone a little more grounded i dont know trying to shop prosecutors can be dangerous but if you think she needs to go i can get it done thats good to hear maybe i should have known about you before today maybe do you want to talk about fees now and get it out of the way if you would like i looked around the hallway to make sure there were no other lawyers hanging around in earshot i was going to go schedule a all the way on this i get twentyfive hundred for today and louis already approved that if you want to go hourly from here i get three hundred an hour and that gets bumped to five in trial because i cant do anything else if youd rather go with a flat rate ill want sixty thousand to take it from here through a preliminary hearing if we end it with a plea ill take twelve more on top of that if we go to trial instead i need another sixty on the day we decide that and twentyfive more when we start picking a jury this case doesnt look like more than a week including jury selection but if it goes past a week i get twentyfiveaweek extra we can talk about an appeal if and when it becomes necessary i hesitated a moment to see how dobbs was reacting he showed nothing so i pressed on ill need thirty thousand for a retainer and another ten for an investigator by the end of the day i dont want to waste time on this i want to get an investigator out and about on this thing before it hits the media and maybe before the cops talk to some of the people involved dobbs slowly nodded are those your standard fees when i can get them im worth it what are you charging the family cecil i was sure he wouldnt walk away from this little episode hungry thats between me and my client but dont worry i will include your fees in my discussion with mrs windsor i appreciate it and remember i need that investigator to start today i gave him a business card i pulled from the right pocket of my suit coat the cards in the right pocket had my cell number the cards in my left pocket had the number that went to lorna taylor i have another hearing downtown i said when you get him out call me and well set up a meeting lets make it as soon as possible i should be available later today and tonight perfect dobbs said pocketing the card without looking at it should we come to you no ill come to you id like to see how the other half lives in those highrises in century city dobbs smiled glibly it is obvious by your suit that you know and practice the adage that a trial lawyer should never dress too well you want the jury to like you not to be jealous of you well michael a century city lawyer cant have an office that is nicer than the offices his clients come from and so i can assure you that our offices are very modest i nodded in agreement but i was insulted just the same i was wearing my best suit i always did on mondays thats good to know i said the courtroom door opened and the videographer walked out lugging his camera and folded tripod with him dobbs saw him and immediately tensed the media he said how can we control this mrs windsor wont hold on a sec i called to the cameraman and he walked over i immediately put my hand out he had to put his tripod down to take it im michael haller i saw you in there filming my clients appearance using my formal name was a code robert gillen the cameraman said people call me sticks he gestured to his tripod in explanation his use of his formal name was a return code he was letting me know he understood that i had a play working here are you freelancing or on assignment i asked just freelancing today howd you hear about this thing he shrugged as though he was reluctant to answer a source a cop i nodded gillen was locked in and playing along what do you get for that if you sell it to a news station depends i take sevenfifty for an exclusive and five for a nonexclusive nonexclusive meant that any news director who bought the tape from him knew that he might sell the footage to a competing news station gillen had doubled the fees he actually got it was a good move he must have been listening to what had been said in the courtroom while he shot it tell you what i said how about we take it off your hands right now for an exclusive gillen was perfect he hesitated like he was unsure of the ethics involved in the proposition in fact make it a grand i said okay he said you got a deal while gillen put the camera on the floor and took the tape out of it i pulled a wad of cash from my pocket i had kept twelve hundred from the saints cash teddy vogel had given me on the way down i turned to dobbs i can expense this right absolutely he said he was beaming i exchanged the cash for the tape and thanked gillen he pocketed the money and moved toward the elevators a happy man that was brilliant dobbs said we have to contain this it could literally destroy the familys business if thisin fact i think that is one reason mrs windsor was not here today she didnt want to be recognized well well have to talk about that if this thing goes the distance meantime ill do my best to keep it off the radar thank you a cell phone began to play a classical number by bach or beethoven or some other dead guy with no copyright and dobbs reached inside his jacket retrieved the device and checked the small screen on it this is she he said then ill leave you to it as i walked off i heard dobbs saying mary everything is under control we need now to concentrate on getting him out we are going to need some money while the elevator made its way up to me i was thinking that i was pretty sure that i was dealing with a client and family for which some money meant more than i had ever seen my mind moved back to the sartorial comment dobbs had made about me it still stung the truth was i didnt have a suit in my closet that cost less than six hundred dollars and i always felt good and confident in any one of them i wondered if he had intended to insult me or he had intended something else maybe trying at this early stage of the game to imprint his control over me and the case i decided i would need to watch my back with dobbs i would keep him close but not that close six traffic heading downtown bottlenecked in the cahuenga pass i spent the time in the car working the phone and trying not to think about the conversation id had with maggie mcpherson about my parenting skills my exwife had been right about me and thats what hurt for a long time i had put my law practice ahead of my parenting practice it was something i promised myself to change i just needed the time and the money to slow down i thought that maybe louis roulet would provide both in the back of the lincoln i first called raul levin my investigator to put him on alert about the potential meeting with roulet i asked him to do a preliminary run on the case to see what he could find out levin had retired early from the lapd and still had contacts and friends who did him favors from time to time he probably had his own christmas list i told him not to spend a lot of time on it until i was sure i had roulet locked down as a paying client it didnt matter what c c dobbs had said to me facetoface in the courthouse hallway i wouldnt believe i had the case until i got the first payment next i checked on the status of a few cases and then called lorna taylor again i knew the mail was delivered at her place most days right before noon but she told me nothing of importance had come in no checks and no correspondence i had to pay immediate attention to from the courts did you check on gloria daytons arraignment i asked her yes it looks like they might hold her over until tomorrow on a medical i groaned the state has fortyeight hours to charge an individual after arrest and bring them before a judge holding gloria daytons first appearance over until the next day because of medical reasons meant that she was probably drug sick this would help explain why she had been holding cocaine when she was arrested i had not seen or spoken to her in at least seven months her slide must have been quick and steep the thin line between controlling the drugs and the drugs controlling her had been crossed did you find out who filed it i asked leslie faire she said i groaned again thats just great okay well im going to go down and see what i can do ive got nothing going until i hear about roulet leslie faire was a misnamed prosecutor whose idea of giving a defendant a break or the benefit of the doubt was to offer extended parole supervision on top of prison time mick when are you going to learn with this woman lorna said about gloria dayton learn what i asked although i knew exactly what lorna would say she drags you down every time you have to deal with her shes never going to get out of the life and now you can bet shes never going to be anything less than a twofer every time she calls that would be fine except you never charge her what she meant by twofer was that gloria daytons cases would from now on be more complicated and timeconsuming because it was likely that drug charges would always accompany solicitation or prostitution charges what bothered lorna was that this meant more work for me but no more income in the process well the bar requires that all lawyers practice some pro bono work lorna you know you dont listen to me mick she said dismissively thats exactly why we couldnt stay married i closed my eyes what a day i had managed to get both my exwives angry with me what does this woman have on you she asked why dont you charge even a basic fee with her look she doesnt have anything on me okay i said can we sort of change the subject now i didnt tell her that years earlier when i had looked through the dusty old account books from my fathers law practice i had found that hed had a soft spot for the socalled women of the night he defended many and charged few maybe i was just continuing a family tradition fine lorna said how did it go with roulet you mean did i get the job i think so vals probably getting him out right now well set up a meeting after that i already asked raul to sniff around on it did you get a check not yet get the check mick im working on it hows the case look ive only seen the pictures but it looks bad ill know more after i see what raul comes up with and what about roulet i knew what she was asking how was he as a client would a jury if it came to a jury like him or despise him cases could be won or lost based on jurors impressions of the defendant he looks like a babe in the woods hes a virgin never been inside the iron house well did he do it she always asked the irrelevant question it didnt matter in terms of the strategy of the case whether the defendant did it or not what mattered was the evidence against himthe proofand if and how it could be neutralized my job was to bury the proof to color the proof a shade of gray gray was the color of reasonable doubt but the question of did he or didnt he always seemed to matter to her who knows lorna thats not the question the question is whether or not hes a paying customer the answer is i think so well let me know if you need anyoh theres one other thing what sticks called and said he owes you four hundred dollars next time he sees you yeah he does youre doing pretty good today im not complaining we said our goodbyes on a friendly note the dispute over gloria dayton seemingly forgotten for the moment probably the security that comes with knowing money is coming in and a highpaying client is on the hook made lorna feel a bit better about my working some cases for free i wondered though if shed have minded so much if i was defending a drug dealer for free instead of a prostitute lorna and i had shared a short and sweet marriage with both of us quickly finding out that we had moved too quickly while rebounding from divorces we ended it remained friends and she continued to work with me not for me the only time i felt uncomfortable about the arrangement was when she acted like a wife again and secondguessed my choice of client and who and what i charged or didnt charge feeling confident in the way i had handled lorna i called the das office in van nuys next i asked for margaret mcpherson and caught her eating at her desk i just wanted to say im sorry about this morning i know you wanted the case well you probably need it more than me he must be a paying customer if hes got c c dobbs carrying the roll behind him by that she was referring to a roll of toilet paper highpriced family lawyers were usually seen by prosecutors as nothing more than ass wipers for the rich and famous yeah i could use one like himthe paying client not the wiper its been a while since i had a franchise well you didnt get as lucky a few minutes ago she whispered into the phone the case was reassigned to ted minton never heard of him hes one of smithsons young guns just brought him in from downtown where he was filing simple possession cases he didnt see the inside of a courtroom until he came up here john smithson was the ambitious head deputy in charge of the van nuys division he was a better politician than a prosecutor and had parlayed that skill into a quick climb over other more experienced deputies to the division chiefs post maggie mcpherson was among those hed passed by once he was in the slot he started building a staff of young prosecutors who did not feel slighted and were loyal to him for giving them a shot this guys never been in court i asked not understanding how going up against a trial rookie could be unlucky as maggie had indicated hes had a few trials up here but always with a babysitter roulet will be his first time flying solo smithson thinks hes giving him a slam dunk i imagined her sitting in her cubicle probably not far from where my new opponent was sitting in his i dont get it mags if this guys green why wasnt i lucky because these guys smithson picks are all cracked out of the same mold theyre arrogant assholes they think they can do no wrong and whats more she lowered her voice even more they dont play fair and the word on minton is that hes a cheater watch yourself haller better yet watch him well thanks for the headsup but she wasnt finished a lot of these new people just dont get it they dont see it as a calling to them its not about justice its just a gamea batting average they like to keep score and to see how far it will get them in the office in fact theyre all just like junior smithsons a calling it was her sense of calling that ultimately cost us our marriage on an intellectual level she could deal with being married to a man who worked the other side of the aisle but when it came down to the reality of what we did we were lucky to have lasted the eight years we had managed honey how was your day oh i got a guy who murdered his roommate with an ice pick a sevenyear deal and you oh i put a guy away for five years because he stole a car stereo to feed his habit it just didnt work four years in a daughter arrived but through no fault of her own she only kept us going another four years still i didnt regret a thing about it i cherished my daughter she was the only thing that was really good about my life that i could be proud of i think deep down the reason i didnt see her enoughthat i was chasing cases instead of herwas because i felt unworthy of her her mother was a hero she put bad people in jail what could i tell her was good and holy about what i did when i had long ago lost the thread of it myself hey haller are you there yeah mags im here what are you eating today just the oriental salad from downstairs nothing special where are you heading downtown listen tell hayley ill see her this saturday ill make a plan well do something special you really mean that i dont want to get her hopes up i felt something lift inside me the idea that my daughter would get her hopes up about seeing me the one thing maggie never did was run me down with hayley she wasnt the kind that would do that i always admired that yes im sure i said great ill tell her let me know when youre coming or if i can drop her off okay i hesitated i wanted to talk to her longer but there was nothing else to say i finally said goodbye and closed the phone in a few minutes we broke free of the bottleneck i looked out the window and saw no accident i saw nobody with a flat tire and no highway patrol cruiser parked on the shoulder i saw nothing that explained what had caused the traffic tieup it was often like that freeway traffic in los angeles was as mysterious as marriage it moved and flowed then stalled and stopped for no easily explainable reason i am from a family of attorneys my father my half brother a niece and a nephew my father was a famous lawyer in a time when there was no cable television and no court tv he was the dean of criminal law in la for almost three decades from mickey cohen to the manson girls his clients always made the headlines i was just an afterthought in his life a surprise visitor to his second marriage to a blevel movie actress known for her exotic latin looks but not her acting skills the mix gave me my black irish looks my father was old when i came so he was gone before i was old enough to really know him or talk to him about the calling of the law he only left me his name mickey haller the legal legend it still opened doors but my older brotherthe half brother from the first marriagetold me that my father used to talk to him about the practice of law and criminal defense he used to say he would defend the devil himself just as long as he could cover the fee the only bigtime case and client he ever turned down was sirhan sirhan he told my brother that he had liked bobby kennedy too much to defend his killer no matter how much he believed in the ideal that the accused deserved the best and most vigorous defense possible growing up i read all the books about my father and his cases i admired the skill and vigor and strategies he brought to the defense table he was damn good and it made me proud to carry his name but the law was different now it was grayer ideals had long been downgraded to notions notions were optional my cell phone rang and i checked the screen before answering whats up val were getting him out they already took him back to the jail and were processing him out now dobbs went with the bond you got it i could hear the delight in his voice dont be so giddy you sure hes not a runner im never sure im going to make him wear a bracelet i lose him i lose my house i realized that what i had taken as delight at the windfall that a milliondollar bond would bring to valenzuela was actually nervous energy valenzuela would be taut as a wire until this one was over one way or the other even if the court had not ordered it valenzuela was going to put an electronic tracking bracelet on roulets ankle he was taking no chances with this guy wheres dobbs back at my office waiting ill bring roulet over as soon as hes out shouldnt be too much longer is maisy over there yeah shes there okay im going to call over i ended the call and hit the speeddial combo for liberty bail bonds valenzuelas receptionist and assistant answered maisy its mick can you put mr dobbs on the line sure thing mick a few seconds later dobbs got on the line he seemed put out by something just in the way he said this is cecil dobbs this is mickey haller how is it going over there well if you consider i am letting my duties to other clients slide while i sit here and read yearold magazines not good you dont carry a cell phone to do business i do but thats not the point my clients arent cell phone people theyre facetoface people i see well the good news is i hear our boy is about to be released our boy mr roulet valenzuela should have him out inside the hour i am about to go into a client conference but as i said before i am free in the afternoon do you want to meet to go over the case with our mutual client or do you want me to take it from here no mrs windsor has insisted that i monitor this closely in fact she may choose to be there as well i dont mind the meetandgreet with mrs windsor but when it comes down to talking about the case its just going to be the defense team that can include you but not the mother okay i understand lets say four oclock at my office i will have louis there ill be there my firm employs a crack investigator ill ask him to join us that wont be necessary cecil i have my own and hes already on the job well see you at four i ended the call before dobbs could start a debate about which investigator to use i had to be careful that dobbs didnt control the investigation preparation and strategy of the case monitoring was one thing but i was louis roulets attorney now not him when i called raul levin next he told me he was already on his way to the lapd van nuys division to pick up a copy of the arrest report just like that i asked no not just like that in a way you could say it took me twenty years to get this report i understood levins connections procured over time and experience traded over trust and favors had come through for him no wonder he charged five hundred dollars a day when he could get it i told him about the meeting at four and he said he would be there and would be ready to furnish us with the law enforcement view of the case the lincoln pulled to a stop when i closed the phone we were in front of the twin towers jail facility it wasnt even ten years old but the smog was beginning to permanently stain its sandcolored walls a dreary gray it was a sad and forbidding place that i spent too much time in i opened the car door and got out to go inside once again seven there was an attorneys checkin window that allowed me to bypass the long line of visitors waiting to get in to see loved ones incarcerated in one of the towers when i told the window deputy whom i wanted to see he tapped the name into the computer and never said anything about gloria dayton being in medical and unavailable he printed out a visitors pass which he slid into the plastic frame of a clipon badge and told me to put it on and wear it at all times in the jail he then told me to step away from the window and wait for an attorney escort it will be a few minutes he said i knew from prior experience that my cell phone did not get a signal inside the jail and that if i stepped outside to use it i might miss my escort and then have to go through the whole signin process again so i stayed put and watched the faces of the people who came to visit those being held inside most were black and brown most had the look of routine on their faces they all probably knew the ropes here much better than i after twenty minutes a large woman in a deputys uniform came into the waiting area and collected me i knew that she had not gotten into the sheriffs department with her current dimensions she was at least a hundred pounds overweight and seemed to struggle just to carry it while walking but i also knew that once somebody was in it was hard to get them out about the best this one could do if there was a jail break was lean up against a door to keep it closed sorry it took so long she told me as we waited between the double steel doors of a mantrap in the womens tower i had to go find her make sure we still had her she signaled that everything was all right to a camera above the next door and its lock clacked open she pushed through she was up in medical getting fixed up she said fixed up i wasnt aware of the jail having a drugtreatment program that included fixing up addicts yeah she got hurt the deputy said got a little banged up in a scuffle she can tell you i let the questions go at that in a way i was relieved that the medical delay was not duenot directly at leastto drug ingestion or addiction the deputy led me to the attorney room which i had been in many times before with many different clients the vast majority of my clients were men and i didnt discriminate but the truth was i hated representing women who were incarcerated from prostitutes to murderersand i had defended them allthere was something pitiful about a woman in jail i had found that almost all of the time their crimes could be traced back to men men who took advantage of them abused them deserted them hurt them this is not to say they were not responsible for their actions or that some of them did not deserve the punishments they received there were predators among the female ranks that easily rivaled those among the males but even still the women i saw in jail seemed so different from the men in the other tower the men still lived by wiles and strength the women had nothing left by the time they locked the door on them the visiting area was a row of booths in which an attorney could sit on one side and confer with a client who sat on the other side separated by an eighteeninch sheet of clear plexiglas a deputy sat in a glassedin booth at the end of the room and observed but supposedly didnt listen if paperwork needed to be passed to the client it was held up for the booth deputy to see and approve i was led to a booth and my escort left me i then waited another ten minutes before the same deputy appeared on the other side of the plexiglas with gloria dayton immediately i saw that my client had a swelling around her left eye and a single butterfly stitch over a small laceration just below her widows peak gloria dayton had jetblack hair and olive skin she had once been beautiful the first time i represented her seven or eight years before she was beautiful the kind of beauty that leaves you stunned at the fact she was selling it that she had decided that selling herself to strangers was her best or only option now she just looked hard to me the lines of her face were taut she had visited surgeons who were not the best and anyway there was nothing they could do about eyes that had seen too much mickey mantle she said youre going to bat for me again she said it in her little girls voice that i suppose her regular clients enjoyed and responded to it just sounded strange to me coming from that tightly drawn mouth and face with eyes that were as hard and had as much life in them as marbles she always called me mickey mantle even though she was born after the great slugger had long retired and probably knew little about him or the game he played it was just a name to her i guess the alternative would have been to call me mickey mouse and i probably wouldnt have liked it much im going to try gloria i told her what happened to your face howd you get hurt she made a dismissive gesture with her hand there was a little disagreement with some of the girls in my dorm about what just girl stuff are you getting high in there she looked indignant and then she tried putting a pouting look on her face no im not i studied her she seemed straight maybe she wasnt getting high and that was not what the fight had been about i dont want to stay in here mickey she said in her real voice i dont blame you i dont like being in here myself and i get to leave i immediately regretted saying the last part and reminding her of her situation she didnt seem to notice you think maybe you could get me into one of those pretrial whatchamacallits where i can get myself right i thought it was interesting how addicts call both getting high and getting sober the same thinggetting right the problem is gloria we got into a pretrial intervention program last time remember and it obviously didnt work so this time i dont know they only have so many spaces in those things and the judges and prosecutors dont like sending people back when they didnt take advantage of it in the first place what do you mean she protested i took advantage i went the whole damn time thats right that was good but then after it was over you went right back to doing what you do and here we are again they wouldnt call that a success gloria i have to be honest with you i dont think i can get you into a program this time i think you have to be ready for them to be tougher this time her eyes drooped i cant do it she said in a small voice look they have programs in the jail youll get straight and come out with another chance to start again clean she shook her head she looked lost youve had a long run but it cant go on i said if i were you id think about getting out of this place la i mean go somewhere and start again she looked up at me with anger in her eyes start over and do what look at me what am i going to do get married have kids and plant flowers i didnt have an answer and neither did she lets talk about that when the time comes for now lets worry about your case tell me what happened what always happens i screened the guy and it all checked out he looked legit but he was a cop and that was that you went to him she nodded the mondrian he had a suitethats another thing the cops usually dont have suites they dont have the budget didnt i tell you how stupid it would be to take coke with you when you work and if a guy even asks you to bring coke with you then you know hes a cop i know all of that and he didnt ask me to bring it i forgot i had it okay i got it from a guy i went to see right before him what was i supposed to do leave it in the car for the mondrian valets to take what guy did you get it from a guy at the travelodge on santa monica i did him earlier and he offered it to me you know instead of cash then after i left i checked my messages and i had the call from the guy at the mondrian so i called him back set it up and went straight there i forgot i had the stuff in my purse nodding i leaned forward i was seeing a glimmer on this one a possibility this guy in the travelodge who was he i dont know just some guy who saw my ad on the site she arranged her liaisons through a website which carried photos phone numbers and email addresses of escorts did he say where he was from no he was mexican or cuban or something he was sweaty from using when he gave you the coke did you see if he had any more yeah he had some i was hoping for a call back but i dont think i was what he was expecting last time i had checked her ad on ladarlingscom to see if she was still in the life the photos shed put up were at least five years old and looked ten i imagined that it could lead to some disappointment when her clients opened their hotel room doors how much did he have i dont know i just knew he had to have more because if it was all he had left he wouldnt have given it to me it was a good point the glimmer was getting brighter did you screen him course what his drivers license no his passport he said he didnt have a license what was his name hector something come on gloria hector what try to re hector something moya it was three names but i remember moya because i said hector give me moya when he brought out the coke okay thats good you think its something you can use to help me maybe depending on who this guy is if hes a tradeup i want to get out okay listen gloria im going to go see the prosecutor and see what shes thinking and see what i can do for you theyve got you in here on twentyfive thousand dollars bail what its higher than usual because of the drugs you dont have twentyfive hundred for the bond do you she shook her head i could see the muscles in her face constricting i knew what was coming could you front it to me mickey i promise id i cant do that gloria thats a rule and i could get in trouble if i broke it youre going to have to be in here overnight and theyll take you over to arraignment in the morning no she said more like a moan than a word i know its going to be tough but you have to nut it out and you have to be straight in the morning when you come into court or ill have no shot at lowering your bond and getting you out so none of that shit they trade in here you got that she raised her arms over her head almost as if she was protecting herself from falling debris she squeezed her hands into tight fists of dread it would be a long night ahead youve got to get me out tomorrow ill do my best i waved to the deputy in the observation booth i was ready to go one last thing i said do you remember what room the guy at the travelodge was in she thought a moment before answering yeah its an easy one three thirtythree okay thanks im going to see what i can do she stayed sitting when i stood up soon the escort deputy came back and told me i would have to wait while she first took gloria back to her dorm i checked my watch it was almost two i hadnt eaten and was getting a headache i also had only two hours to get to leslie faire in the das office to talk about gloria and then out to century city for the case meeting with roulet and dobbs isnt there somebody else who can take me out of here i said irritably i need to get to court sorry sir thats how it works well please hurry i always do fifteen minutes later i realized that my complaining to the deputy had only succeeded in her making sure she left me waiting even longer than had i just kept my mouth shut like a restaurant customer who gets the cold soup he sent back to the kitchen returned hot with the piquant taste of saliva in it i should have known better on the quick drive over to the criminal courts building i called raul levin he was back at his home office in glendale looking through the police reports on the roulet investigation and arrest i asked him to put it aside to make some calls i wanted to see what he could find out about the man in room at the travelodge on santa monica i told him i needed the information yesterday i knew he had sources and ways of running the name hector moya i just didnt want to know who or what they were i was only interested in what he got as earl pulled to a stop in front of the ccb i told him that while i was inside he should take a run over to philippes to get us roast beef sandwiches id eat mine on my way out to century city i passed a twentydollar bill over the seat to him and got out while waiting for an elevator in the always crowded lobby of the ccb i popped a tylenol from my briefcase and hoped it would head off the migraine i felt coming on from lack of food it took me ten minutes to get to the ninth floor and another fifteen waiting for leslie faire to grant me an audience i didnt mind the wait though because raul levin called back just before i was allowed entrance if faire had seen me right away i wouldnt have gone in with the added ammunition levin had told me that the man in room at the travelodge had checked in under the name gilberto garcia the motel did not require identification since he paid cash in advance for a week and put a fiftydollar deposit on phone charges levin had also run a trace on the name i had given him and came up with hector arrande moya a colombian wanted on a fugitive warrant issued after he fled san diego when a federal grand jury handed down an indictment for drug trafficking it added up to real good stuff and i planned to put it to use with the prosecutor faire was in an office shared with three other prosecutors each had a desk in a corner two were gone probably in court but a man i didnt know sat at the desk in the corner opposite faire i had to speak to her with him in earshot i hated doing this because i found that the prosecutor i was dealing with in these situations would often play to the others in the room trying to sound tough and shrewd sometimes at the expense of my client i pulled a chair away from one of the empty desks and brought it over to sit down i skipped the pleasantries because there werent any and got right to the point because i was hungry and didnt have a lot of time you filed on gloria dayton this morning i said shes mine i want to see what we can do about it well we can plead her guilty and she can do one to three years at frontera she said it matteroffactly with a smile that was more of a smirk i was thinking of pti i was thinking she already got a bite out of that apple and she spit it out no way look how much coke did she have on her a couple grams its still illegal no matter how much she had gloria dayton has had numerous opportunities to rehabilitate herself and avoid prison but shes run out of chances she turned to her desk opened a file and glanced at the top sheet nine arrests in just the last five years she said this is her third drug charge and shes never spent more than three days in jail forget pti shes got to learn sometime and this is that time im not open to discussion on this if she pleads ill give her one to three if she doesnt ill go get a verdict and she takes her chances with the judge at sentencing i will ask for the max on it i nodded it was going about the way i thought it would with faire a onetothreeyear sentence would likely result in a ninemonth stay in the slam i knew gloria dayton could do it and maybe should do it but i still had a card to play what if she had something to trade faire snorted like it was a joke like what a hotel room number where a major dealer is doing business sounds a little vague it was vague but i could tell by the change in her voice she was interested every prosecutor likes to trade up call your drug guys ask them to run the name hector arrande moya on the box hes a colombian i can wait she hesitated she clearly didnt like being manipulated by a defense attorney especially when another prosecutor was in earshot but the hook was already set she turned again to her desk and made a call i listened to one side of the conversation her telling someone to give her a background check on moya she waited awhile and then listened to the response she thanked whoever it was she had called and hung up she took her time turning back to me okay she said what does she want i had it ready she wants a pti slot all charges dropped upon successful completion she doesnt testify against the guy and her name is on no documents she simply gives the hotel and room number where hes at and your people do the rest theyll need to make a case shes got to testify i take it the two grams she had came from this guy then she has to tell us about it no she doesnt whoever you just talked to told you theres already a warrant you can take him down for that she worked it over for a few moments moving her jaw back and forth as if tasting the deal and deciding whether to eat more i knew what the stumble was the deal was a tradeup but it was a tradeup to a federal case that meant that they would bust the guy and the feds would take over no prosecutorial glory for leslie faireunless she had designs on jumping over to the us attorneys office one day the feds will love you for this i said trying to wedge into her conscience hes a bad guy and hell probably check out soon and the chance to get him will be lost she looked at me like i was a bug dont try that with me haller sorry she went back to her thinking i tried again once you have his location you could always try to set up a buy would you be quiet please i cant think i raised my hands in surrender and shut up all right she finally said let me talk to my boss give me your number and ill call you later but ill tell you right now if we go for it shell have to go to a lockdown program something at countyusc were not going to waste a residency slot on her i thought about it and nodded countyusc was a hospital with a jail wing where injured sick and addicted inmates were treated what she was offering was a program where gloria dayton could be treated for her addiction and released upon completion she would not face any charges or further time in jail or prison fine with me i said i looked at my watch i had to get going our offer is good until first appearance tomorrow i said after that ill call the dea and see if they want to deal directly then it will be taken out of your hands she looked indignantly at me she knew that if i got a deal with the feds they would squash her head to head the feds always trumped the state i stood up to go and put a business card down on her desk dont try to backdoor me haller she said if it goes sideways on you ill take it out on your client i didnt respond i pushed the chair i had borrowed back to its desk she then dropped the threat with her next line anyway im sure we can handle this on a level that makes everybody happy i looked back at her as i got to the office door everybody except for hector moya i said eight the law offices of dobbs and delgado were on the twentyninth floor of one of the twin towers that created the signature skyline of century city i was right on time but everyone was already gathered in a conference room with a long polished wood table and a wall of glass that framed a western exposure stretching across santa monica to the pacific and the charter islands beyond it was a clear day and i could see catalina and anacapa out there at the very edge of the world because the sun was going down and seemed to be almost at eye level a film had been rolled down over the window to cut the glare it was like the room had sunglasses on and so did my client louis roulet sat at the head of the table with a pair of blackframed raybans on out of his gray jail jumpsuit he now wore a dark brown suit over a pale silk tshirt he looked like a confident and cool young real estate executive not the scared boy i saw in the holding pen in the courthouse to roulets left sat cecil dobbs and next to him was a wellpreserved wellcoiffed and bejeweled woman i assumed to be roulets mother i also assumed that dobbs hadnt told her that the meeting would not include her to roulets right the first seat was empty and waiting for me in the seat next to it sat my investigator raul levin with a closed file in front of him on the table dobbs introduced mary alice windsor to me she shook my hand with a strong grip i sat down and dobbs explained that she would be paying for her sons defense and had agreed to the terms i had outlined earlier he slid an envelope across the table to me i looked inside and saw a check for sixty thousand dollars with my name on it it was the retainer i had asked for but i had expected only half of it in the initial payment i had made more in total on cases before but it was still the largest single check i had ever received the check was drawn on the account of mary alice windsor the bank was solid goldfirst national of beverly hills i closed the envelope and slid it back across the table im going to need that to come from louis i said looking at mrs windsor i dont care if you give him the money and then he gives it to me but i want the check i get to come from louis i work for him and thats got to be clear from the start i knew this was different from even my practice of that morningaccepting payment from a third party but it was a control issue one look across the table at mary alice windsor and c c dobbs and i knew i had to make sure that they knew this was my case to manage to win or to lose i wouldnt have thought it could happen but mary windsors face hardened for some reason she reminded me of an old grandfather clock her face flat and square mother roulet said heading something off before it started its all right i will write him a check i should be able to cover it until you give me the money she looked from me to her son and then back to me very well she said mrs windsor i said your support for your son is very important and i dont mean just the financial end of things if we are not successful in getting these charges dropped and we choose the alternative of trial it will be very important for you to show your support in public ways dont be silly she said i will back him come hell or high water these ridiculous charges must be removed and that woman she isnt going to get a penny from us thank you mother roulet said yes thank you i said i will be sure to inform you probably through mr dobbs where and when you are needed its good to know you will be there for your son i said nothing else and waited it didnt take her long to realize she had been dismissed but you dont want me here right now is that it thats right we need to discuss the case and it is best and most appropriate for louis to do this only with his defense team the attorneyclient privilege does not cover anyone else you could be compelled to testify against your son but if i leave how will louis get home i have a driver i will get him home she looked at dobbs hoping he might have higher standing and be able to overrule me dobbs smiled and stood up so he could pull her chair back she finally let him and stood up to go very well she said louis i will see you at dinner dobbs walked her through the door of the conference room and i saw them exchange conversation in the hallway i couldnt hear what was said then she left and dobbs came back closing the door i went through some preliminaries with roulet telling him he would have to be arraigned in two weeks and submit a plea he would have the opportunity at that time to put the state on notice that he was not waiving his right to a speedy trial thats the first choice we have to make i said whether you want this thing to drag out or you want to move quickly and put the pressure on the state what are the options dobbs asked i looked at him and then back at roulet ill be very honest with you i said when i have a client who is not incarcerated my inclination is to drag it out its the clients freedom that is on the linewhy not get the most of it before the hammer comes down youre talking about a guilty client roulet said on the other hand i said if the states case is weak then delaying things only gives them time to strengthen their hand you see time is our only leverage at this point if we refuse to waive our right to a speedy trial it puts a lot of pressure on the prosecutor i didnt do what they are saying i did roulet said i dont want to waste any time i want this shit behind me if we refuse to waive then theoretically they must put you on trial within sixty days of arraignment the reality is that it gets pushed back when they move to a preliminary hearing in a prelim a judge hears the evidence and decides if there is enough there to warrant a trial its a rubberstamp process the judge will hold you over for trial you will be arraigned again and the clock is reset to sixty days i cant believe this roulet said this is going to last forever we could always waive the prelim too it would really force their hand the case has been reassigned to a young prosecutor hes pretty new to felonies it may be the way to go wait a minute dobbs said isnt a preliminary hearing useful in terms of seeing what the states evidence is not really i said not anymore the legislature tried to streamline things a while back and they turned the prelim into a rubber stamp because they relaxed hearsay rules now you usually just get the case cop on the stand and he tells the judge what everybody said the defense usually doesnt get a look at any witnesses other than the cop if you ask me the best strategy is to force the prosecution to put up or shut up make them go sixty days from first arraignment i like that idea roulet said i want this over with as soon as possible i nodded he had said it as though a notguilty verdict was a foregone conclusion well maybe it doesnt even get to a trial dobbs said if these charges dont hold muster the da is not going to drop this i said cutting him off usually the cops overcharge and then the da cuts the charges back that didnt happen here instead the da upped the charges that tells me two things one is that they believe the case is solid and two they upped the charges so that when we start to negotiate they will deal from a higher ground youre talking about a plea bargain roulet asked yeah a disposition forget it no plea bargain im not going to jail for something i didnt do it might not mean going to jail you have a clean rec i dont care if it means i could walk im not going to plead guilty to something i didnt do if that is going to be a problem for you then we need to part company right here i looked closely at him almost all of my clients make protestations of innocence at one point along the way especially if it is our first case together but roulets words came with a fervor and directness i hadnt seen in a long time liars falter they look away roulets eyes were holding mine like magnets there is also the civil liability to consider dobbs added a guilty plea will allow this woman to i understand all of that i said cutting him off again i think were all getting ahead of ourselves here i only wanted to give louis a general idea of the way this was going to go we dont have to make any moves or any hardandfast decisions for at least a couple of weeks we just need to know at the arraignment how we are going to play it louis took a year of law at ucla dobbs said i think he has baseline knowledge of the situation roulet nodded okay good i said then lets just get to it louis lets start with you your mother said she expects to see you at dinner do you live at home i mean at her home i live in the guesthouse she lives in the main house anyone else live on the premises the maid in the main house no siblings boyfriends girlfriends thats it and you work at your mothers firm more like i run it shes not there too much anymore where were you saturday night satur you mean last night dont you no i mean saturday night start there saturday night i didnt do anything i stayed home and watched television by yourself thats right what did you watch a dvd an old movie called the conversation coppola so nobody was with you or saw you you just watched the movie and then went to bed basically basically okay that brings us to sunday morning what did you do yesterday during the day i played golf at riviera my usual foursome started at ten and finished at four i came home showered and changed had dinner at my mothers houseyou want to know what we had that wont be necessary but later on i probably will need the names of the guys you played golf with what happened after dinner i told my mother i was going to my place but instead i went out i noticed that levin had started taking notes on a small notebook he had taken out of a pocket what kind of car do you drive i have two an ohfour range rover i use for taking clients around in and an ohone carrera i use for myself you used the porsche last night then thats right whered you go i went over the hill and down into the valley he said it as though it was a risky move for a beverly hills boy to descend into the workingclass neighborhoods of the san fernando valley where did you go i asked ventura boulevard i had a drink at nats north and then i went down the street a ways to morgans and i had a drink there too those places are pickup bars wouldnt you say yes thats why i went to them he was matteroffact about it and i appreciated his honesty so you were looking for someone a woman anyone in particular someone you knew no one in particular i was looking to get laid pure and simple what happened at nats north what happened was that it was a slow night so i left i didnt even finish my drink you go there often do the bartenders know you yeah they know me a girl named paula was working last night okay so it wasnt working for you there and you left you drove down to morgans why morgans its just another place i go they know you there they should im a good tipper last night denise and janice were behind the bar they know me i turned to levin raul what is the victims name levin opened his file to pull out a police report but answered before having to look it up regina campo friends call her reggie twentysix years old she told police shes an actress working as a telephone solicitor and hoping to retire soon dobbs said i ignored him louis did you know reggie campo before last night i asked roulet shrugged sort of id seen her around the bar scene but i had never been with her before id never even spoken to her had you ever tried no i never could really get to her she always seemed to be with someone or more than one person i dont like to have to penetrate the crowd you know my style is to look for the singles what was different last night last night she came to me that was what was different tell us about it nothing to tell i was at the bar at morgans minding my own business having a look at the possibilities and she was at the other end and she was with some guy so she wasnt even on my radar because she looked like she was already taken you know uhhuh so what happened well after a while the guy she was with gets up to go take a leak or go outside for a smoke and as soon as hes gone she gets up and slides on down the bar to me and asks if im interested i said i was but what about the guy shes already with she says dont worry about him hell be out the door by ten and then shes free the rest of the night she wrote her address down for me and said to come by after ten i told her id be there what did she write the address down on a napkin but the answer to your next question is no i dont still have it i memorized the address and threw out the napkin i work in real estate i can remember addresses about what time was this i dont know well she said come by at ten did you look at your watch at any point to see how long you would have to wait until then i think it was between eight and nine as soon as the guy came back in they left when did you leave the bar i stayed for a few minutes and then i left i made one more stop before i went to her place where was that well she lived in an apartment in tarzana so i went up to the lamplighter it was on the way why well you know i wanted to see what the possibilities were you know see if there was something better out there something i didnt have to wait around for or or what he still didnt finish the thought take seconds on he nodded okay so whod you talk to at the lamplighter where is that by the way it was the only place so far i was unfamiliar with its on ventura near white oak i didnt really talk to anybody it was crowded but there really wasnt anybody i was interested in there the bartenders know you there no not really i dont go there all that much you usually get lucky before you hit the third option nah i usually just give up after two i nodded just to buy a little time to think about what else to ask before we got to what happened at the victims house how long were you at the lamplighter about an hour id say maybe a little less at the bar how many drinks yeah two drinks at the bar how many drinks in all did you have last night before getting to reggie campos apartment um four at the most over two two and a half hours i left one drink untouched at morgans what were you drinking martinis gray goose did you pay for any of these drinks in any of these places with a credit card levin asked offering his first question of the interview no roulet said when i go out i pay cash i looked at levin and waited to see if he had anything else to ask he knew more about the case than i did at this moment i wanted to give him free rein to ask what he wanted he looked at me and nodded he was good to go okay i said what time was it when you got to reggies place it was twelve minutes to ten i looked at my watch i wanted to make sure i didnt knock on her door early so what did you do i waited in the parking lot she said ten so i waited till ten did you see the guy she left morgans with come out yeah i saw him he came out and left then i went up what kind of car was he driving levin asked a yellow corvette roulet said it was a nineties version i dont know the exact year levin nodded he was finished i knew he was just trying to get a line on the man who had been in campos apartment before roulet i took the questioning back so he leaves and you go in what happens i go in the building and her place is on the second floor i go up and knock and she answers and i walk in hold on a second i dont want the shorthand you went up how stairs elevator what give us the details elevator anybody else on it anybody see you roulet shook his head i signaled him to continue she opened the door a crack saw it was me and told me to come in there was a hallway by the front door so it was kind of a tight space i walked by her so she could close the door thats how come she was behind me and so i didnt see it coming she had something she hit me with something and i went down it got black real fast i was silent while i thought about this tried to picture it in my mind so before a single thing happened she just knocked you out she didnt say anything yell anything just sort of came up behind and bang thats right okay then what what do you remember next its still pretty foggy i remember waking up and these two guys are sitting on me holding me down and then the police came and the paramedics i was sitting up against the wall and my hands were cuffed and the paramedic put that ammonia or something under my nose and thats when i really came out of it you were still in the apartment yeah where was reggie campo she was sitting on the couch and another paramedic was working on her face and she was crying and telling the other cop that i had attacked her all these lies that i had surprised her at the door and punched her that i said i was going to rape her and then kill her all these things i didnt do and i moved my arms so i could look down at my hands behind my back i saw they had my hand in like a plastic bag and i could see blood on my hand and thats when i knew the whole thing was a setup what do you mean by that she put blood on my hand to make it look like i did it but it was my left hand im not lefthanded if i was going to punch somebody id use my right hand he made a punching gesture with his right hand to illustrate this for me in case i didnt get it i got up from my spot and paced over to the window it now seemed like i was higher than the sun i was looking down at the sunset i felt uneasy about roulets story it seemed so farfetched that it might actually be true and that bothered me i was always worried that i might not recognize innocence the possibility of it in my job was so rare that i operated with the fear that i wouldnt be ready for it when it came that i would miss it okay lets talk about this for a second i said still facing the sun youre saying that she puts blood on your hand to set you up and she puts it on your left but if she was going to set you up wouldnt she put the blood on your right since the vast majority of people out there are righthanded wouldnt she go with the numbers i turned back to the table and got blank stares from everyone you said she opened the door a crack and then let you in i said could you see her face not all of it what could you see her eye her left eye so did you ever see the right side of her face like when you walked in no she was behind the door thats it levin said excitedly she already had the injuries when he got there she hid it from him then he steps in and she clocks him all the injuries were to the right side of her face and that dictated that she put the blood on his left hand i nodded as i thought about the logic of this it seemed to make sense okay i said turning back to the window and continuing to pace i think thatll work now louis youve told us you had seen this woman around the bar scene before but had never been with her so she was a stranger why would she do this louis why would she set you up like you say she did money but it wasnt roulet who answered it had been dobbs i turned from the window and looked at him he knew he had spoken out of turn but didnt seem to care its obvious dobbs said she wants money from him from the family the civil suit is probably being filed as we speak the criminal charges are just the prelude to the suit the demand for money thats what shes really after i sat back down and looked at levin exchanging eye contact i saw a picture of this woman in court today i said half her face was pulped you are saying thats our defense that she did that to herself levin opened his file and took out a piece of paper it was a blackandwhite photocopy of the evidence photograph maggie mcpherson had showed me in court reggie campos swollen face levins source was good but not good enough to get him actual photos he slid the photocopy across the table to dobbs and roulet well get the real photos in discovery i said they look worse a lot worse and if we go with your story then the jurythat is if this gets to a juryis going to have to buy that she did that to herself i watched roulet study the photocopy if it had been he who attacked reggie campo he showed no tell while studying his handiwork he showed nothing at all you know what i said i like to think im a good lawyer and a good persuader when it comes to juries but even im having trouble believing myself with that story nine it was now raul levins turn in the conference room wed spoken while i had been riding into century city and eating bites of roast beef sandwich i had plugged my cell into the cars speaker phone and told my driver to put his earbuds in id bought him an ipod his first week on the job levin had given me the basics of the case just enough to get me through the initial questioning of my client now levin would take command of the room and go through the case using the police and evidence reports to tear louis roulets version of events to shreds to show us what the prosecution would have on its side at least initially i wanted levin to be the one to do this because if there was going to be a good guybad guy aspect to the defense i wanted to be the one roulet would like and trust i wanted to be the good guy levin had his own notes in addition to the copies of the police reports he had gotten through his source it was all material the defense was certainly entitled to and would receive through the discovery process but usually it took weeks to get it through court channels instead of the hours it had taken levin as he spoke he held his eyes down on these documents at teneleven last night the lapd communications center received a nineoneone emergency call from regina campo of seventeensixty white oak boulevard apartment twoeleven she reported an intruder had entered her home and attacked her patrol officers responded and arrived on the premises at tenseventeen slow night i guess because that was pretty quick better than average response to a hot shot anyway the patrol officers were met in the parking lot by ms campo who said she had fled the apartment after the attack she informed the officers that two neighbors named edward turner and ronald atkins were in her apartment holding the intruder officer santos proceeded to the apartment where he found the suspect intruder later identified as mr roulet lying on the floor and in the command and control of turner and atkins they were the two faggots who were sitting on me roulet said i looked at roulet and saw the flash of anger quickly fade the officers took custody of the suspect levin continued as if he had not been interrupted mr atkins wait a minute i said where was he found on the floor what room doesnt say i looked at roulet it was the living room it wasnt far from the front door i never got that far in levin wrote a note to himself before continuing mr atkins produced a folding knife with the blade open which he said had been found on the floor next to the intruder the officers handcuffed the suspect and paramedics were called to treat both campo and roulet who had a head laceration and slight concussion campo was transported to holy cross medical center for continued treatment and to be photographed by an evidence technician roulet was taken into custody and booked into van nuys jail the premises of ms campos apartment were sealed for crime scene processing and the case was assigned to detective martin booker of valley bureau detectives levin spread more photocopies of the police photos of regina campos injuries out on the table there were front and profile shots of her face and two closeups of bruising around her neck and a small puncture mark under her jaw the copy quality was poor and i knew the photocopies werent worthy of serious study but i did notice that all the facial injuries were on the right side of campos face roulet had been correct about that she had either been repeatedly punched by someones left handor possibly her own right hand these were taken at the hospital where ms campo also gave a statement to detective booker in summary she said she came home about eightthirty sunday night and was home alone when there was a knock at her door at about ten oclock mr roulet represented himself as someone ms campo knew and so she opened the door upon opening the door she was immediately struck by the intruders fist and driven backwards into the apartment the intruder entered and closed and locked the door ms campo attempted to defend herself but was struck at least twice more and driven to the floor this is such bullshit roulet yelled he slammed his fists down on the table and stood up his seat rolling backwards and banging loudly into the glass window behind him hey easy now dobbs cautioned you break the window and its like a plane we all get sucked out of here and go down no one smiled at his attempt at levity louis sit back down i said calmly these are police reports nothing more or less they are not supposed to be the truth they are one persons view of the truth all we are doing here is getting a first look at the case seeing what we are up against roulet rolled his chair back to the table and sat down without further protest i nodded to levin and he continued i noted that roulet had long stopped acting like the meek prey i had seen earlier in the day in lockup ms campo reported that the man who attacked her had his fist wrapped in a white cloth when he punched her i looked across the table at roulets hands and saw no swelling or bruising on the knuckles or fingers wrapping his fist could have allowed him to avoid such telltale injuries was it taken into evidence i asked yes levin said in the evidence report it is described as a cloth dinner napkin with blood on it the blood and the cloth are being analyzed i nodded and looked at roulet did the police look at or photograph your hands roulet nodded the detective looked at my hands but nobody took pictures i nodded and told levin to continue the intruder straddled ms campo on the floor and grasped one hand around her neck he said the intruder told ms campo that he was going to rape her and that it didnt matter to him whether she was alive or dead when he did it she could not respond because the suspect was choking her with his hand when he released pressure she said she told him that she would cooperate levin slid another photocopy onto the table it was a photo of a blackhandled folding knife that was sharpened to a deadly point it explained the earlier photo of the wound under the victims neck roulet slid the photocopy over to look at it more closely he slowly shook his head this is not my knife he said i didnt respond and levin continued the suspect and the victim stood up and he told her to lead the way to the bedroom the suspect maintained a position behind the victim and pressed the point of the knife against the left side of her throat as ms campo entered a short hallway that led to the apartments two bedrooms she turned in the confined space and pushed her attacker backwards into a large floor vase as he stumbled backwards over the vase she made a break for the front door realizing that her attacker would recover and catch her at the front door she ducked into the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of vodka off the counter when the intruder passed by the kitchen on his way to the front door to catch her ms campo stepped out of the blind and struck him on the back of the head knocking him to the floor ms campo then stepped over the fallen man and unlocked the front door she ran out the door and called the police from the firstfloor apartment shared by turner and atkins turner and atkins returned to the apartment where they found the intruder unconscious on the floor they maintained control of him as he started to regain consciousness and remained in the apartment until police arrived this is incredible roulet said to have to sit here and listen to this i cant believe what has happened to me i did not do this this is like a dream she is lying she if it is all lies then this will be the easiest case i ever had i said i will tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea but we have to know what she has put on the record before we can construct traps and go after her and if you think this is hard to sit through wait until we get to trial and its stretched out over days instead of minutes you have to control yourself louis you have to remember that you will get your turn the defense always gets its turn dobbs reached over and patted roulet on the forearm a nice fatherly gesture roulet pulled his arm away damn right you are going to go after her roulet said pointing a finger across the table at my chest i want you to go after her with everything weve got thats what i am here for and you have my promise i will now let me ask my associate a few questions before we finish up here i waited to see if roulet had anything else to say he didnt he leaned back into his chair and clasped his hands together you finished raul i asked for now im still working on all the reports i should have a transcript of the nineoneone call tomorrow morning and there will be more stuff coming in good what about a rape kit there wasnt one bookers report said she declined since it never got to that whats a rape kit roulet asked its a hospital procedure where bodily fluids hair and fibers are collected from the body of a rape victim levin said there was no rape roulet exclaimed i never touched we know that i said thats not why i asked i am looking for cracks in the states case the victim said she was not raped but was reporting what was certainly a sex crime usually the police insist on a rape kit even when a victim claims there was no sexual assault they do this just in case the victim actually has been raped and is just too humiliated to say so or might be trying to keep the full extent of the crime from a husband or family member its standard procedure and the fact that she was able to talk her way out of it might be significant to us she didnt want the first guys dna showing up in her dobbs said maybe i said it might mean any number of things but it might be a crack lets move on raul is there any mention anywhere about this guy who louis saw her with no none hes not in the file and what did crime scene find i dont have the report but i am told that no evidence of any significant nature was located during the crime scene evaluation of the apartment thats good no surprises what about the knife blood and prints on the knife but nothing back on that yet tracing ownership will be unlikely you can buy those folding knives in any fishing or camping store around im telling you that is not my knife roulet interjected we have to assume the fingerprints will be from the man who turned it in i said atkins levin responded right atkins i said turning to louis but it would not surprise me to find prints from you on it as well there is no telling what occurred while you were unconscious if she put blood on your hand then she probably put your prints on the knife roulet nodded his agreement and was about to say something but i didnt wait for him is there any statement from her about being at morgans earlier in the evening i asked levin he shook his head no the interview with the victim was in the er and not formal it was basic and they didnt go back with her to the early part of the evening she didnt mention the guy and she didnt mention morgans she just said she had been home since eightthirty they asked about what happened at ten they didnt really get into what she had been doing before im sure that will all be covered in the followup investigation okay if and when they go back to her for a formal i want that transcript im on it it will be a sitdown on video when they do it and if crime scene does a video i want that too i want to see her place levin nodded he knew i was putting on a show for the client and dobbs giving them a sense of my command of the case and all the irons that were going into the fire the reality was i didnt need to tell raul levin any of this he already knew what to do and what to get for me okay what else i asked do you have any questions cecil dobbs seemed surprised by the focus suddenly shifting to him he quickly shook his head no no im fine this is all good were making good progress i had no idea what he meant by progress but i let it go by without question so what do you think roulet asked i looked at him and waited a long moment before answering i think the state has got a strong case against you they have you in her home they have a knife and they have her injuries they also have what i am assuming is her blood on your hands added to that the photos are powerful and of course they will have her testimony having never seen or spoken to the woman i dont know how impressive she will be i stopped again and milked the silence even longer before continuing but there is a lot they dont haveevidence of breakin dna from the suspect a motive or even a suspect with a past record of this or any sort of crime there are a lot of reasonslegitimate reasonsfor you to have been in that apartment plus i looked past roulet and dobbs and out the window the sun was dropping behind anacapa and turning the sky pink and purple it beat anything i ever saw from the windows of my office plus what roulet asked too anxious to wait on me plus you have me i got maggie mcfierce off the case the new prosecutor is good but hes green and hell have never come up against someone like me before so whats our next step roulet asked the next step is for raul to keep doing his thing finding out what he can about this alleged victim and why she lied about being alone we need to find out who she is and who her mystery man is and to see how that plays into our case and what will you do ill be dealing with the prosecutor ill set something up with him try to see where hes going and well make our choice on which way to go i have no doubt that ill be able to go to the da and knock all of this down to something you can plea to and get behind you but it will require a concession you i told you i will not i know what you said but you have to hear me out i may be able to get a nocontest plea so that you dont actually ever say the word guilty but i am not seeing the state completely dropping this you will have to concede responsibility in some regard it is possible to avoid jail time but you will likely have to perform community service of some sort there ive said it that is the first recitation there will be more i am obligated as your attorney to tell you and make sure you understand your options i know its not what you want or are willing to do but it is my duty to educate you on the choices okay fine okay of course as you know any concession on your part will pretty much make any civil action ms campo takes against you a slam dunk so as you can guess disposing of the criminal case quickly will probably end up costing you a lot more than my fee roulet shook his head the plea bargain was already not an option i understand my choices he said you have fulfilled your duty but im not going to pay her a cent for something i didnt do im not going to plead guilty or no contest to something i didnt do if we go to trial can you win i held his gaze for a moment before answering well you understand that i dont know what will come up between now and then and that i cant guarantee anything but yes based on what i see now i can win this case im confident of that i nodded to roulet and i think i saw a look of hope enter his eyes he saw the glimmer there is a third option dobbs said i looked from roulet to dobbs wondering what wrench he was about to throw into the franchise machine and whats that i asked we investigate the hell out of her and this case maybe help mr levin out with some of our people we investigate six ways from sunday and establish our own credible theory and evidence and present it to the da we head this off before it ever gets to trial we show this greenhorn prosecutor where he will definitely lose the case and get him to drop all charges before he suffers that professional embarrassment added to this i am sure this man works for a man who runs that office and is susceptible shall we say to political pressures we apply it until things turn our way i felt like kicking dobbs under the table not only did his plan involve cutting my biggest fee ever by more than half not only did it see the lions share of client money going to the investigators including his own but it could only have come from a lawyer who had never defended a criminal case in his entire career thats an idea but it is very risky i said calmly if you can blow their case out of the water and you go in before trial to show them how you are also giving them a blueprint for what to do and what to avoid in trial i dont like to do that roulet nodded his agreement and dobbs looked a bit taken aback i decided to leave it at that and to address dobbs further on it when i could do it without the client present what about the media levin asked thankfully changing the subject thats right dobbs said anxious to change it himself now my secretary says i have messages from two newspapers and two television stations i probably do as well i said what i didnt mention was that the messages left with dobbs were left by lorna taylor at my direction the case had not attracted the media yet other than the freelance videographer who showed up at the first appearance but i wanted dobbs and roulet and his mother to believe they all could be splashed across the papers at any moment we dont want publicity on this dobbs said this is the worst kind of publicity to get he seemed to be adept at stating the obvious all media should be directed to me i said i will handle the media and the best way to do that is to ignore it but we have to say something to defend him dobbs said no we dont have to say anything talking about the case legitimizes it if you get into a game of talking to the media you keep the story alive information is oxygen without it they die as far as i am concerned let em die or at least wait until there is no avoiding them if that happens only one person speaks for louis thats me dobbs reluctantly nodded his agreement i pointed a finger at roulet under no circumstances do you talk to a reporter even to deny the charges if they contact you you send them to me got it i got it good i decided that we had said enough for a first meeting i stood up louis ill take you home now but dobbs wasnt going to release his grasp on his client so quickly actually ive been invited to dinner by louiss mother he said i could take him since i am going there i nodded my approval the criminal defense attorney never seemed to get invited to dinner fine i said but well meet you there i want raul to see his place and louis needs to give me that check we spoke about earlier if they thought i had forgotten about the money they had a lot to learn about me dobbs looked at roulet and got an approving nod dobbs then nodded to me sounds like a plan he said well meet again there fifteen minutes later i was riding in the back of the lincoln with levin we were following a silver mercedes carrying dobbs and roulet i was checking with lorna on the phone the only message of importance had come from gloria daytons prosecutor leslie faire the message was we had a deal so levin said when i closed the phone what do you really think i think there is a lot of money to be made on this case and were about to go get the first installment sorry im dragging you over there i didnt want it to seem like it was all about the check levin nodded but didnt say anything after a few moments i continued im not sure what to think yet i said whatever happened in that apartment happened quick thats a break for us no actual rape no dna that gives us a glimmer of hope it sort of reminds me of jesus menendez only without dna remember him yeah but i dont want to i tried not to think about clients who were in prison without appellate hopes or anything else left but years of time in front of them to nut out i do what i can with each case but sometimes there is nothing that can be done jesus menendezs case was one of those hows your time on this i asked putting us back on course ive got a few things but i can move them around you are going to have to work nights on this i need you to go into those bars i want to know everything about him and everything about her this case looks simple at this point we knock her down and we knock the case down levin nodded he had his briefcase on his lap you got your camera in there always when we get to the house take some pictures of roulet i dont want you showing his mug shot in the bars itll taint things can you get a picture of the woman without her face being all messed up i got her drivers license photo its recent good run them down if we find a witness who saw her come over to him at the bar in morgans last night then were gold thats where i was thinking id start give me a week or so ill come back to you before the arraignment i nodded we drove in silence for a few minutes thinking about the case we were moving through the flats of beverly hills heading up into the neighborhoods where the real money was hidden and waiting and you know what else i think i said money and everything aside i think theres a chance he isnt lying his story is just quirky enough to be true levin whistled softly between his teeth you think you might have found the innocent man he said that would be a first i said if i had only known it this morning i would have charged him the innocent man premium if youre innocent you pay more because youre a hell of a lot more trouble to defend aint that the truth i thought about the idea of having an innocent client and the dangers involved you know what my father said about innocent clients i thought your father died when you were like six years old five actually they didnt even take me to the funeral and he was talking to you about innocent clients when you were five no i read it in a book long after he was gone he said the scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client because if you fuck up and he goes to prison itll scar you for life he said it like that words to that effect he said there is no inbetween with an innocent client no negotiation no plea bargaining no middle ground theres only one verdict you have to put an ng up on the scoreboard theres no other verdict but not guilty levin nodded thoughtfully the bottom line was my old man was a damn good lawyer and he didnt like having innocent clients i said im not sure i do either thursday march ten the first ad i ever put in the yellow pages said any case anytime anywhere but i changed it after a few years not because the bar objected to it but because i objected to it i got more particular los angeles county is a wrinkled blanket that covers four thousand square miles from the desert to the pacific there are more than ten million people fighting for space on the blanket and a considerable number of them engage in criminal activity as a lifestyle choice the latest crime stats show almost a hundred thousand violent crimes are reported each year in the county last year there were felony arrests and then another highend misdemeanor arrests for drug and sex offenses add in the duis and every year you could fill the rose bowl twice over with potential clients the thing to remember is that you dont want clients from the cheap seats you want the ones sitting on the fiftyyard line the ones with money in their pockets when the criminals get caught they get funneled into a justice system that has more than forty courthouses spread across the county like burger kings ready to serve themas in serve them up on a plate these stone fortresses are the watering holes where the legal lions come to hunt and to feed and the smart hunter learns quickly where the most bountiful locations are where the paying clients graze the hunt can be deceptive the client base of each courthouse does not necessarily reflect the socioeconomic structure of the surrounding environs courthouses in compton downey and east los angeles have produced a steady line of paying clients for me these clients are usually accused of being drug dealers but their money is just as green as a beverly hills stock swindlers on the morning of the seventeenth i was in the compton courthouse representing darius mcginley at his sentencing repeat offenders mean repeat customers and mcginley was both as many of my clients tend to be for the sixth time since i had known him he had been arrested and charged with dealing crack cocaine this time it was in nickerson gardens a housing project known by most of its residents as nixon gardens no one i ever asked knew whether this was an abbreviation of the true name of the place or a name bestowed in honor of the president who held office when the vast apartment complex and drug market was built mcginley was arrested after making a direct handtohand sale of a balloon containing a dozen rocks to an undercover narcotics officer at the time he had been out on bail after being arrested for the exact same offense two months earlier he also had four prior convictions for drug sales on his record things didnt look good for mcginley who was only twentythree years old after hed taken so many previous swings at the system the system had now run out of patience with him the hammer was coming down though mcginley had been coddled previously with sentences of probation and county jail time the prosecutor set the bar at the prison level this time any negotiation of a plea agreement would begin and end with a prison sentence otherwise no deal the prosecutor was happy to take the two outstanding cases to trial and go for a conviction and a doubledigit prison sentence the choice was hard but simple the state held all of the cards they had him cold on two handtohand sales with quantity the reality was that a trial would be an exercise in futility mcginley knew this the reality was that his selling of three hundred dollars in rock cocaine to a cop was going to cost him at least three years of his life as with many of my young male clients from the south side of the city prison was an anticipated part of life for mcginley he grew up knowing he was going the only questions were when and for how long and whether he would live long enough to make it there in my many jailhouse meetings with him over the years i had learned that mcginley carried a personal philosophy inspired by the life and death and rap music of tupac shakur the thug poet whose rhymes carried the hope and hopelessness of the desolate streets mcginley called home tupac correctly prophesied his own violent death south la teemed with young men who carried the exact same vision mcginley was one of them he would recite to me long riffs from tupacs cds he would translate the meanings of the ghetto lyrics for me it was an education i valued because mcginley was only one of many clients with a shared belief in a final destiny that was thug mansion the place between heaven and earth where all gangsters ended up to mcginley prison was only a rite of passage on the road to that place and he was ready to make the journey ill lay up get stronger and smarter then ill be back he said to me he told me to go ahead and make a deal he had five thousand dollars delivered to me in a money orderi didnt ask where it came fromand i went back to the prosecutor got both pending cases folded into one and mcginley agreed to plead guilty the only thing he ever asked me to try to get for him was an assignment to a prison close by so his mother and his three young children wouldnt have to be driven too far or too long to visit him when court was called into session judge daniel flynn came through the door of his chambers in an emerald green robe which brought false smiles from many of the lawyers and court workers in the room he was known to wear the green on two occasions each yearst patricks day and the friday before the notre dame fighting irish took on the southern cal trojans on the football field he was also known among the lawyers who worked the compton courthouse as danny boy as in danny boy sure is an insensitive irish prick isnt he the clerk called the case and i stepped up and announced mcginley was brought in through a side door and stood next to me in an orange jumpsuit with his wrists locked to a waist chain he had no one out in the gallery to watch him go down he was alone except for me top o the morning to you mr mcginley flynn said in an irish brogue you know what today is i lowered my eyes to the floor mcginley mumbled his response the day i get my sentence that too but i am talking about st patricks day mr mcginley a day to revel in irish heritage mcginley turned slightly and looked at me he was street smart but not life smart he didnt understand what was happening whether this was part of the sentencing or just some form of white man disrespect i wanted to tell him that the judge was being insensitive and probably racist instead i leaned over and whispered in his ear just be cool hes an asshole do you know the origin of your name mr mcginley the judge asked no sir do you care not really sir its a name from a slaveholder i spect why would i care who that motherfucka be excuse me your honor i said quickly i leaned over to mcginley again darius cool it i whispered and watch your language hes dissing me he said back a little louder than a whisper and he hasnt sentenced you yet you want to blow the deal mcginley stepped back from me and looked up at the judge sorry about my language yhonor i come from the street i can tell that flynn said well it is a shame you feel that way about your history but if you dont care about your name then i dont either lets get on with the sentencing and get you off to prison shall we he said the last part cheerfully as if he were taking great delight in sending mcginley off to disneyland the happiest place on earth the sentencing went by quickly after that there was nothing in the presentencing investigation report besides what everybody already knew darius mcginley had had only one profession since age eleven drug dealer hed had only one true family a gang hed never gotten a drivers license though he drove a bmw hed never gotten married though hed fathered three babies it was the same old story and same old cycle trotted out a dozen times a day in courtrooms across the county mcginley lived in a society that intersected mainstream america only in the courtrooms he was just fodder for the machine the machine needed to eat and mcginley was on the plate flynn sentenced him to the agreedupon three to five years in prison and read all of the standard legal language that came with a plea agreement for laughsthough only his own courtroom staff compliedhe read the boilerplate using his brogue again and then it was over i know mcginley dealt death and destruction in the form of rock cocaine and probably committed untold violence and other offenses he was never charged with but i still felt bad for him i felt like he was another one whod never had a shot at anything but thug life in the first place hed never known his father and had dropped out of school in the sixth grade to learn the rock trade he could accurately count money in a rock house but he had never had a checking account he had never been to a county beach let alone outside of los angeles and now his first trip out would be on a bus with bars over the windows before he was led back into the holding cell for processing and transfer to prison i shook his hand his movement restricted by the waist chain and wished him good luck it is something i rarely do with my clients no sweat he said to me ill be back and i didnt doubt it in a way darius mcginley was just as much a franchise client as louis roulet roulet was most likely a oneshot deal but over the years i had a feeling mcginley would be one of what i call my annuity clients he would be the gift that would keep on givingas long as he defied the odds and kept on living i put the mcginley file in my briefcase and headed back through the gate while the next case was called outside the courtroom raul levin was waiting for me in the crowded hallway we had a scheduled meeting to go over his findings in the roulet case hed had to come to compton because i had a busy schedule top o the morning levin said in an exaggerated irish accent yeah you saw that i stuck my head in the guys a bit of a racist isnt he and he can get away with it because ever since they unified the courts into one countywide district his name goes on the ballot everywhere even if the people of compton rose up like a wave to vote him off the westsiders could still cancel them out its fucked up howd he get on the bench in the first place hey you get a law degree and make the right contributions to the right people and you could be a judge too he was appointed by the governor the hard part is winning that first retention election he did youve never heard the in like flynn story nope youll love it about six years ago flynn gets his appointment from the governor this is before unification back then judges were elected by the voters of the district where they presided the supervising judge for la county checks out his credentials and pretty quickly realizes that hes got a guy with lots of political connections but no talent or courthouse experience to go with it flynn was basically an office lawyer probably couldnt find a courthouse let alone try a case if you paid him so the presiding judge dumps him down here in compton criminal because the rule is you have to run for retention the year after being appointed to the bench he figures flynn will fuck up anger the folks and get voted out one year and out headache over exactly only it didnt work that way in the first hour on the first day of filing for the ballot that year fredrica brown walks into the clerks office and puts in her papers to run against flynn you know downtown freddie brown not personally i know of her so does everybody else around here besides being a pretty good defense lawyer shes black shes a woman and shes popular in the community she would have crushed flynn five to one or better then how the hell did flynn keep the seat thats what im getting to with freddie on the ballot nobody else filed to run why bother she was a shoointhough it was kind of curious why shed want to be a judge and take the pay cut back then she had to have been well into mid six figures with her practice so what happened what happened was a couple months later on the last hour before filing closed freddie walks back into the clerks office and withdraws from the ballot levin nodded so flynn ends up running unopposed and keeps the seat he said you got it then unification comes in and theyll never be able to get him out of there levin looked outraged thats bullshit they had some kind of deal and thats gotta be a violation of election laws only if you could prove there was a deal freddie has always maintained that she wasnt paid off or part of some plan flynn cooked up to stay on the bench she says she just changed her mind and pulled out because she realized she couldnt sustain her lifestyle on a judges pay but ill tell you one thing freddie sure seems to do well whenever she has a case in front of flynn and they call it a justice system yeah they do so what do you think about blake it had to be brought up it was all anybody else was talking about robert blake the movie and television actor had been acquitted of murdering his wife the day before in van nuys superior court the da and the lapd had lost another big media case and you couldnt go anywhere without it being the number one topic of discussion the media and most people who lived and worked outside the machine didnt get it the question wasnt whether blake did it but whether there was enough evidence presented in trial to convict him of doing it they were two distinctly separate things but the public discourse that had followed the verdict had entwined them what do i think i said i think i admire the jury for staying focused on the evidence if it wasnt there it wasnt there i hate it when the da thinks they can ride in a verdict on common senseif it wasnt him who else could it have been give me a break with that you want to convict a man and put him in a cage for life then put up the fucking evidence dont hope a jury is going to bail your ass out on it spoken like a true defense attorney hey you make your living off defense attorneys pal you should memorize that rap so forget blake im jealous and im already tired of hearing about it you said on the phone that you had good news for me i do where do you want to go to talk and look at what ive got i looked at my watch i had a calendar call on a case in the criminal courts building downtown i had until eleven to be there and i couldnt miss it because i had missed it the day before after that i was supposed to go up to van nuys to meet for the first time with ted minton the prosecutor who had taken the roulet case over from maggie mcpherson i dont have time to go anywhere i said we can go sit in my car and grab a coffee you got your stuff with you in answer levin raised his briefcase and rapped his knuckles on its side but what about your driver dont worry about him then lets do it eleven after we were in the lincoln i told earl to drive around and see if he could find a starbucks i needed coffee ain no starbuck round here earl responded i knew earl was from the area but i didnt think it was possible to be more than a mile from a starbucks at any given point in the county maybe even the world but i didnt argue the point i just wanted coffee okay well drive around and find a place that has coffee just dont go too far from the courthouse we need to get back to drop raul off after you got it and earl put on your earphones while we talk about a case back here for a while okay earl fired up his ipod and plugged in the earbuds he headed the lincoln down acacia in search of java soon we could hear the tinny sound of hiphop coming from the front seat and levin opened his briefcase on the folddown table built into the back of the drivers seat okay what do you have for me i said im going to see the prosecutor today and i want to have more aces in my hand than he does we also have the arraignment monday i think ive got a few aces here levin replied he sorted through things in his briefcase and then started his presentation okay he said lets begin with your client and then well check in on reggie campo your guy is pretty squeaky other than parking and speeding ticketswhich he seems to have a problem avoiding and then a bigger problem payingi couldnt find squat on him hes pretty much your standard citizen whats with the tickets twice in the last four years hes let parking ticketsa lot of themand a couple speeding tickets accumulate unpaid both times it went to warrant and your colleague c c dobbs stepped in to pay them off and smooth things over im glad ccs good for something by paying them off i assume you mean the tickets not the judges lets hope so other than that only one blip on the radar with roulet what at the first meeting when you were giving him the drill about what to expect and so on and so forth it comes out that hed had a year at ucla law and knew the system well i checked on that see half of what i do is try to find out who is lying or who is the biggest liar of the bunch so i check damn near everything and most of the time its easy to do because everythings on computer right i get it so what about the law school was that a lie looks like it i checked the registrars office and hes never been enrolled in the law school at ucla i thought about this it was dobbs who had brought up ucla law and roulet had just nodded it was a strange lie for either one of them to have told because it didnt really get them anything it made me think about the psychology behind it was it something to do with me did they want me to think of roulet as being on the same level as me so if he lied about something like that i said thinking out loud right levin said i wanted you to know about it but i gotta say thats it on the negative side for mr roulet so far he mightve lied about law school but it looks like he didnt lie about his storyat least the parts i could check out tell me well his track that night checks out i got wits in here who put him at nats north morgans and then the lamplighter bing bing bing he did just what he told us he did right down to the number of martinis four total and at least one of them he left on the bar unfinished they remember him that well they remember that he didnt even finish his drink i am always suspicious of perfect memory because there is no such thing and it is my job and my skill to find the faults in the memory of witnesses whenever someone remembers too much i get nervousespecially if the witness is for the defense no im not just relying on a bartenders memory ive got something here that you are going to love mick and you better love me for it because it cost me a grand from the bottom of his briefcase he pulled out a padded case that contained a small dvd player i had seen people using them on planes before and had been thinking about getting one for the car the driver could use it while waiting on me in court and i could probably use it from time to time on cases like this one levin started loading in a dvd but before he could play it the car pulled to a stop and i looked up we were in front of a place called the central bean lets get some coffee and then see what youve got there i said i asked earl if he wanted anything and he declined the offer levin and i got out and went in there was a short line for coffee levin spent the waiting time telling me about the dvd we were about to watch in the car im in morgans and want to talk to this bartender named janice but she says i have to clear it first with the manager so i go back to see him in the office and hes asking me what exactly i want to ask janice about theres something off about this guy im wondering why he wants to know so much you know then it comes clear when he makes an offer he tells me that last year they had a problem behind the bar pilferage from the cash register they have as many as a dozen bartenders working back there in a given week and he couldnt figure out who had sticky fingers he put in a camera you got it a hidden camera he caught the thief and fired his ass but it worked so good he kept the camera in place the system records on highdensity tape from eight till two every night its on a timer he gets four nights on a tape if there is ever a problem or a shortage he can go back and check it because they do a weekly profitandloss check he rotates two tapes so he always has a weeks worth of film to look at he had the night in question on tape yes he did and he wanted a thousand dollars for it right again the cops dont know about it they havent even come to the bar yet theyre just going with reggies story so far i nodded this wasnt all that unusual there were too many cases for the cops to investigate thoroughly and completely they were already loaded for bear anyway they had an eyewitness victim a suspect caught in her apartment they had the victims blood on the suspect and even the weapon to them there was no reason to go further but were interested in the bar not the cash register i said i know that and the cash register is against the wall behind the bar the camera is up above it in a smoke detector on the ceiling and the back wall is a mirror i looked at what he had and pretty quickly realized that you can see the whole bar in the mirror its just reversed i had the tape transferred to a disc because we can manipulate the image better blow it up and zero in that sort of thing it was our turn in line i ordered a large coffee with cream and sugar and levin ordered a bottle of water we took our refreshments back to the car i told earl not to drive until after wed viewed the dvd i can read while riding in a car but i thought looking at the small screen of levins player while bumping along south county streets might give me a dose of motion sickness levin started the dvd and gave a running commentary to go with the visuals on the small screen was a downward view of the rectangularshaped bar at morgans there were two bartenders on patrol both women in black jeans and white shirts tied off to show flat stomachs pierced navels and tattoos creeping up out of their rear belt lines as levin had explained the camera was angled toward the back of the bar area and cash register but the mirror that covered the wall behind the register displayed the line of customers sitting at the bar i saw louis roulet sit down by himself in the dead center of the frame there was a frame counter in the bottom left corner and a time and date code in the right corner it said that it was pm on march theres louis showing up levin said and over here is reggie campo he manipulated buttons on the player and froze the image he then shifted it bringing the right margin into the center on the short side of the bar to the right a woman and a man sat next to each other levin zoomed in on them are you sure i asked i had only seen pictures of the woman with her face badly bruised and swollen yeah its her and thats our mr x okay now watch he started the film moving again and widened the picture back to full frame he then started moving it in fastforward mode louis drinks his martini he talks with the bartenders and nothing much happens for almost an hour levin said he checked a notebook page that had notes attributed to specific frame numbers he slowed the image to normal speed at the right moment and shifted the frame again so that reggie campo and mr x were in the center of the screen i noticed that we had advanced to on the time code on the screen mr x took a pack of cigarettes and a lighter off the bar and slid off his stool he then walked out of camera range to the right hes heading to the front door levin said they have a smoking porch in the front reggie campo appeared to watch mr x go and then she slid off her stool and started walking along the front of the bar just behind the patrons on stools as she passed by roulet she appeared to drag the fingers of her left hand across his shoulders almost in a tickling gesture this made roulet turn and watch her as she kept going she just gave him a little flirt there levin said shes heading to the bathroom thats not how roulet said it went down i said he claimed she came on to him gave him her just hold your horses levin said shes got to come back from the can you know i waited and watched roulet at the bar i checked my watch i was doing okay for the time being but i couldnt miss the calendar call at the ccb i had already pushed the judges patience to the max by not showing up the day before here she comes levin said leaning closer to the screen i watched as reggie campo came back along the bar line this time when she got to roulet she squeezed up to the bar between him and a man on the next stool to the right she had to move into the space sideways and her breasts were clearly pushed against roulets right arm it was a comeon if i had ever seen one she said something and roulet bent over closer to her lips to hear after a few moments he nodded and then i saw her put what looked like a crumpled cocktail napkin into his hand they had one more verbal exchange and then reggie campo kissed louis roulet on the cheek and pulled backwards away from the bar she headed back to her stool youre beautiful mish i said using the name i gave him after he told me of his mishmash of jewish and mexican descent and you say the cops dont have this i added they didnt know about it last week when i got it and i still have the tape so no they dont have it and probably dont know about it yet under the rules of discovery i would need to turn it over to the prosecution after roulet was formally arraigned but there was still some play in that i didnt technically have to turn over anything until i was sure i planned to use it in trial that gave me a lot of leeway and time i knew that what was on the dvd was important and no doubt would be used in trial all by itself it could be cause for reasonable doubt it seemed to show a familiarity between victim and alleged attacker that was not included in the states case more important it also caught the victim in a position in which her behavior could be interpreted as being at least partially responsible for drawing the action that followed this was not to suggest that what followed was acceptable or not criminal but juries are always interested in the causal relationships of crime and the individuals involved what the video did was move a crime that might have been viewed through a blackandwhite prism into the gray area as a defense attorney i lived in the gray areas the flip side of that was that the dvd was so good it might be too good it directly contradicted the victims statement to police about not knowing the man who attacked her it impeached her showed her in a lie it only took one lie to knock a case down the tape was what i called walking proof it would end the case before it even got to trial my client would simply walk away and with him would go the big franchise payday levin was fastforwarding the image again now watch this he said she and mr x split at nine but watch when he gets up levin had shifted the frame to focus on campo and the unknown man when the time code hit he put the playback in slow motion okay theyre getting ready to leave he said watch the guys hands i watched the man took a final draw on his drink tilting his head far back and emptying the glass he then slipped off his stool helped campo off hers and they walked out of the camera frame to the right what i said what did i miss levin moved the image backwards until he got to the moment the unknown man was finishing his drink he then froze the image and pointed to the screen the man had his left hand down flat on the bar for balance as he reared back to drink he drinks with his right hand he said and on his left you can see a watch on his wrist so it looks like the guy is righthanded right yeah so what does that get us the injuries to the victim came from blows from the left think about what ive told you i did and after a few moments i got it the mirror everythings backwards hes lefthanded levin nodded and made a punching motion with his left fist this could be the whole case right here i said not sure that was a good thing happy saint paddys day lad levin said in his brogue again not realizing i might be staring at the end of the gravy train i took a long drink of hot coffee and tried to think about a strategy for the video i didnt see any way to hold it for trial the cops would eventually get around to the followup investigations and they would find out about it if i held on to it it could blow up in my face i dont know how im going to use it yet i said but i think its safe to say mr roulet and his mother and cecil dobbs are going to be very happy with you tell them they can always express their thanks financially all right anything else on the tape levin started to fastforward the playback not really roulet reads the napkin and memorizes the address he then hangs around another twenty minutes and splits leaving a fresh drink on the bar he slowed the image down at the point roulet was leaving roulet took one sip out of his fresh martini and put it down on the bar he picked up the napkin reggie campo had given him crumpled it in his hand and then dropped it to the floor as he got up he left the bar leaving the drink behind levin ejected the dvd and returned it to its plastic sleeve he then turned off the player and started to put it away thats it on the visuals that i can show you here i reached forward and tapped earl on the shoulder he had his sound buds in he pulled out one of the ear plugs and looked back at me lets head back to the courthouse i said keep your plugs in earl did as instructed what else i said to levin theres reggie campo he said shes not snow white what did you find out its not necessarily what i found out its what i think you saw how she was on the tape one guy leaves and shes dropping love notes on another guy alone at the bar plus i did some checking shes an actress but shes not currently working as an actress except for private auditions you could say he handed me a professional photo collage that showed reggie campo in different poses and characters it was the kind of photo sheet sent to casting directors all over the city the largest photo on the sheet was a head shot it was the first time i had seen her face up close without the ugly bruises and swelling reggie campo was a very attractive woman and something about her face was familiar to me but i could not readily place it i wondered if i had seen her in a television show or a commercial i flipped the head shot over and read her credits they were for shows i never watched and commercials i didnt remember in the police reports she lists her current employer as topsail telemarketing theyre over in the marina they take the calls for a lot of the crap they sell on latenight tv workout machines and stuff like that anyway its day work you work when you want the only thing is reggie hasnt worked a day there for five months so what are you telling me shes been tricking ive been watching her the last three nights and you what i turned and looked at him if a private eye working for a criminal defendant was caught tailing the victim of a violent crime there could be hell to pay and i would be the one to pay it all the prosecution would have to do is go see a judge and claim harassment and intimidation and id be held in contempt faster than the santa ana wind through the sepulveda pass as a crime victim reggie campo was sacrosanct until she was on the stand only then was she mine dont worry dont worry levin said it was a very loose tail very loose and im glad i did it the bruises and the swelling and all of that have either gone away or shes using a lot of makeup because this lady has been getting a lot of visitors all men all alone all different times of the night it looks like she tries to fit at least two into her dance card each night is she picking them up in the bars no shes been staying in these guys must be regulars or something because they know their way to her door i got some plate numbers if necessary i can visit them and try to get some answers i also shot some infrared video but i havent transferred it to disc yet no lets hold off on visiting any of these guys for now word could get back to her we have to be very careful around her i dont care if shes tricking or not i drank some more coffee and tried to decide how to move with this you ran a check on her right no criminal record right shes clean my guess is that shes new to the game you know these women who want to be actresses its a tough gig it wears you down she probably started by taking a little help from these guys here and there then it became a business she went from amateur to pro and none of this is in the reports you got before nope like i told you there hasnt been a lot of followup by the cops at least so far if she graduated from amateur to pro she couldve graduated to setting a guy like roulet up he drives a nice car wears nice clothes have you seen his watch yeah a rolex if its real then hes wearing ten grand right there on his wrist she could have seen that from across the bar maybe thats why she picked him out of all the rest we were back by the courthouse i had to start heading toward downtown i asked levin where he was parked and he directed earl to the lot this is all good i said but it means louis lied about more than ucla yeah levin agreed he knew he was going into a payforplay deal with her he should have told you about it yeah and now im going to talk to him about it we pulled up next to the curb outside a pay lot on acacia levin took a file out of his briefcase it had a rubber band around it that held a piece of paper to the outside cover he held it out to me and i saw the document was an invoice for almost six thousand dollars for eight days of investigative services and expenses based on what i had heard during the last half hour the price was a bargain that file has everything we just talked about plus a copy of the video from morgans on disc levin said i hesitantly took the file by taking it i was moving it into the realm of discovery not accepting it and keeping everything with levin would have given me a buffer wiggle room if i got into a discovery scrap with the prosecutor i tapped the invoice with my finger ill call this in to lorna and well send out a check i said how is lorna i miss seeing her when we were married lorna used to ride with me a lot and go into court with me to watch sometimes when i was short a driver she would take the wheel levin saw her more often back then shes doing great shes still lorna levin cracked his door open but didnt get out you want me to stay on reggie that was the question if i approved i would lose all deniability if something went wrong because now i would know what he was doing i hesitated but then i nodded very loose and dont farm it out i only trust you on it dont worry ill handle it myself what else the lefthanded man we have to figure out who mr x is and whether he was part of this thing or just another customer levin nodded and pumped his lefthanded fist again im on it he put on his sunglasses opened the door and slid out he reached back in for his briefcase and his unopened bottle of water then said goodbye and closed the door i watched him start walking through the lot in search of his car i should have been ecstatic about all i had just learned it tilted everything steeply toward my client but i still felt uneasy about something i couldnt quite put my finger on earl had turned his music off and was awaiting direction take me downtown earl i said you got it he replied the ccb yeah and hey who was that you were listening to on the pod i could sort of hear it that was snoop gotta play him up loud i nodded la s own and a former defendant who faced down the machine on a murder charge and walked away there was no better story of inspiration on the street earl i said take the seventen were running late twelve sam scales was a hollywood con man he specialized in internet schemes designed to gather credit card numbers and verification data that he would then turn and sell in the financial underworld the first time we had worked together he had been arrested for selling six hundred card numbers and their attendant verification informationexpiration dates and the addresses social security numbers and passwords of the rightful owners of the cardsto an undercover sheriffs deputy scales had gotten the numbers and information by sending out an email to five thousand people who were on the customer list of a delawarebased company that sold a weightloss product called trimslim over the internet the list had been stolen from the companys computer by a hacker who did freelance work for scales using a rentbythehour computer in a kinkos and a temporary email address scales then sent out a mass mailing to all those on the list he identified himself as counsel for the federal food and drug administration and told the recipients that their credit cards would be refunded the full amount of their purchases of trimslim following an fda recall of the product he said fda testing of the product proved it to be ineffective in promoting weight loss he said the makers of the product had agreed to refund all purchases in an effort to avoid fraud charges he concluded the email with instructions for confirming the refund these included providing the credit card number expiration date and all other pertinent verification data of the five thousand recipients of the message there were six hundred who bit scales then made an internet contact in the underworld and set up a handtohand sale six hundred credit card numbers and vitals for ten thousand in cash it meant that within days the numbers would be stamped on plastic blanks and then put to use it was a fraud that would reach into the millions of dollars in losses but it was stunted in a west hollywood coffee shop where scales handed over a printout to his buyer and was given a thick envelope containing cash in return when he walked out carrying the envelope and an iced decaf latte he was met by sheriffs deputies he had sold his numbers to an undercover scales hired me to get him a deal he was thirtythree years old at the time and had a clean record even though there were indications and evidence that he had never held a lawful job by focusing the prosecutor assigned to the case on the theft of card numbers rather than the potential losses of the fraud i was able to get scales a disposition to his liking he pleaded guilty to one felony count of identity theft and received a oneyear suspended sentence sixty days of caltrans work and four years of probation that was the first time that was three years ago sam scales did not take the opportunity afforded him by the nojail sentence he was now back in custody and i was defending him in a fraud case so reprehensible that it was clear from the start that it was going to be beyond my ability to keep him out of prison on december of the previous year scales used a front company to register a domain name of sunamihelpcom on the world wide web on the home page of the website he put photographs of the destruction and death left two days earlier when a tsunami in the indian ocean devastated parts of indonesia sri lanka india and thailand the site asked viewers to please help by making a donation to sunamihelp which would then distribute it among the numerous agencies responding to the disaster the site also carried the photograph of a handsome white man identified as reverend charles who was engaged in the work of bringing christianity to indonesia a personal note from reverend charles was posted on the site and it asked viewers to give from the heart scales was smart but not that smart he didnt want to steal the donations made to the site he only wanted to steal the credit card information used to make the donations the investigation that followed his arrest showed that all contributions made through the site actually were forwarded to the american red cross and did go to efforts to help victims of the devastating tsunami but the numbers and information from the credit cards used to make those donations were also forwarded to the financial underworld scales was arrested when a detective with the lapds fraudbytrick unit named roy wunderlich found the website knowing that disasters always drew out the con artists in droves wunderlich had started typing in possible website names in which the word tsunami was misspelled there were several legitimate tsunami donation sites on the web and he typed in variations of these always misspelling the word his thinking was that the con artists would misspell the word when they set up fraud sites in an effort to draw potential victims who were likely to be of a lower education level sunamihelpcom was among several questionable sites the detective found most of these he forwarded to an fbi task force looking at the problem on a nationwide scale but when he checked the domain registration of sunamihelpcom he found a los angeles post office box that gave wunderlich jurisdiction he was in business he kept sunamihelpcom for himself the po box turned out to be a dead address but wunderlich was undeterred he floated a balloon meaning he made a controlled purchase or in this case a controlled donation the credit card number the detective provided while making a twentydollar donation would be monitored twentyfour hours a day by the visa fraud unit and he would be informed instantly of any purchase made on the account within three days of the donation the credit card was used to purchase an elevendollar lunch at the gumbo pot restaurant in the farmers market at fairfax and third wunderlich knew that it had simply been a test purchase something small and easily coverable with cash if the user of the counterfeit credit card encountered a problem at the point of purchase the restaurant purchase was allowed to go through and wunderlich and four other detectives from the trick unit were dispatched to the farmers market a sprawling blend of old and new shops and restaurants that was always crowded and therefore a perfect place for credit card con artists to operate the investigators would spread out in the complex and wait while wunderlich continued to monitor the cards use by phone two hours after the first purchase the control number was used again to purchase a sixhundreddollar leather jacket at the nordstrom in the market the credit card approval was delayed but not stopped the detectives moved in and arrested a young woman as she was completing the purchase of the jacket the case then became what is known as a snitch chain the police following one suspect to the next as they snitched each other off and the arrests moved up the ladder eventually they came to the man sitting at the top of that ladder sam scales when the story broke in the press wunderlich referred to him as the tsunami svengali because so many victims of the scam turned out to be women who had wanted to help the handsome minister pictured on the website the nickname angered scales and in my discussions with him he took to referring to the detective who had brought him down as wunder boy i got to department on the thirteenth floor of the criminal courts building by but the courtroom was empty except for marianne the judges clerk i went through the bar and approached her station you guys still doing the calendar i asked just waiting on you ill call everybody and tell the judge she mad at me marianne shrugged she wouldnt answer for the judge especially to a defense attorney but in a way she was telling me that the judge wasnt happy is scales still back there should be i dont know where joe went i turned and went over to the defense table and sat down and waited eventually the door to the lockup opened and joe frey the bailiff assigned to stepped out you still got my guy back there just barely we thought you were a noshow again you want to go back he held the steel door open for me and i stepped into a small room with a stairwell going up to the courthouse jail on the fourteenth floor and two doors leading to the smaller holding rooms for one of the doors had a glass panel it was for attorneyclient meetings and i could see sam scales sitting by himself at a table behind the glass he was wearing an orange jumpsuit and had steel cuffs on his wrists he was being held without bail because his latest arrest violated his probation on the trimslim conviction the sweet deal i had gotten him on that was about to go down the tubes finally scales said as i walked in like youre going anywhere you ready to do this if i have no choice i sat down across from him sam you always have a choice but let me explain it again theyve got you cold on this okay you were caught ripping off people who wanted to help the people caught in one of the worst natural disasters in recorded history theyve got three coconspirators who took deals to testify against you they have the list of card numbers found in your possession what i am saying is that at the end of the day you are going to get about as much sympathy from the judge and a juryif it should come to thatas they would give a child raper maybe even less i know all of that but i am a useful asset to society i could educate people put me in the schools put me in the country clubs put me on probation and ill tell people what to watch out for out there you are who they have to watch out for you blew your chance with the last one and the prosecution said this is the final offer on this one you dont take it and theyre going to go to the wall on this the one thing i can guarantee you is that there will be no mercy so many of my clients are like sam scales they hopelessly believe there is a light behind the door and im the one who has to tell them the door is locked and that the bulb burned out long ago anyway then i guess i have to do it scales said looking at me with eyes that blamed me for not finding a way out for him its your choice you want a trial well go to trial your exposure will be ten years plus the one youve got left on the probation you make em real mad and they can also ship you over to the fbi so the feds can take a swing at you on interstate wire fraud if they want let me ask you something if we go to trial could we win i almost laughed but i still had some sympathy left for him no sam we cant win havent you been listening to what ive been telling you for two months they got you you cant win but im here to do what you want like i said if you want a trial well go to trial but i gotta tell you that if we go youll have to get your mother to pay me again im only good through today how much did she pay you already eight thousand eight grand thats her fucking retirement account money im surprised she has anything left in the account with you for a son he looked at me sharply im sorry sam i shouldnt have said that from what she told me youre a good son jesus christ i should have gone to fucking law school youre a con no different from me you know that haller only that paper they give you makes you street legal thats all they always blame the lawyer for making a living as if its a crime to want to be paid for doing a days work what scales had just said to me would have brought a near violent reaction back when i was maybe a year or two out of law school but id heard the same insult too many times by now to do anything but roll with it what can i say sam weve already had this conversation he nodded and didnt say anything i took it to mean he would take the das offer four years in the state penal system and a tenthousanddollar fine followed by five years parole hed be out in two and a half but the parole would be a killer for a naturalborn con man to make it through unscathed after a few minutes i got up and left the room i knocked on the outer door and deputy frey let me back into the courtroom hes good to go i said i took my seat at the defense table and soon frey brought scales out and sat him next to me he still had the cuffs on he said nothing to me in another few minutes glenn bernasconi the prosecutor who worked came down from his office on the fifteenth floor and i told him we were ready to accept the case disposition at am judge judith champagne came out of chambers and onto the bench and frey called the courtroom to order the judge was a diminutive attractive blonde and exprosecutor who had been on the bench at least as long as id had my ticket she was old school all the way fair but tough running her courtroom as a fiefdom sometimes she even brought her dog a german shepherd named justice to work with her if the judge had had any kind of discretion in the sentence when sam scales faced her he would have gone down hard that was what i did for sam scales whether he knew it or not with this deal i had saved him from that good morning the judge said i am glad you could make it today mr haller i apologize your honor i got held up in judge flynns court in compton that was all i had to say the judge knew about flynn everybody did and on st patricks day no less she said yes your honor i understand we have a disposition in the tsunami svengali matter she immediately looked over at her court reporter michelle strike that she looked back at the lawyers i understand we have a disposition in the scales case is that correct that is correct i said were ready to go on that good bernasconi half read half repeated from memory the legalese needed to take a plea from the defendant scales waived his rights and pleaded guilty to the charges he said nothing other than the word the judge accepted the disposition agreement and sentenced him accordingly youre a lucky man mr scales she said when it was over i believe mr bernasconi was quite generous with you i would not have been i dont feel so lucky judge scales said deputy frey tapped him on the shoulder from behind scales stood up and turned to me i guess this is it he said good luck sam i said he was led off through the steel door and i watched it close behind them i had not shaken his hand thirteen the van nuys civic center is a long concrete plaza enclosed by government buildings anchoring one end is the van nuys division of the lapd along one side are two courthouses sitting opposite a public library and a city administration building at the end of the concrete and glass channel is a federal administration building and post office i waited for louis roulet in the plaza on one of the concrete benches near the library the plaza was largely deserted despite the great weather not like the day before when the place was overrun with cameras and the media and the gadflies all crowding around robert blake and his lawyers as they tried to spin a notguilty verdict into innocence it was a nice quiet afternoon and i usually liked being outside most of my work is done in windowless courtrooms or the backseat of my town car so i take it outside whenever i can but i wasnt feeling the breeze or noticing the fresh air this time i was annoyed because louis roulet was late and because what sam scales had said to me about being a streetlegal con was festering like cancer in my mind when finally i saw roulet crossing the plaza toward me i got up to meet him whereve you been i said abruptly i told you id get here as soon as i could i was in the middle of a showing when you called lets walk i headed toward the federal building because it would give us the longest stretch before we would have to turn around to cross back i had my meeting with minton the new prosecutor assigned to his case in twentyfive minutes in the older of the two courthouses i realized that we didnt look like a lawyer and his client discussing a case maybe a lawyer and his realtor discussing a land grab i was in my hugo boss and roulet was in a tan suit over a green turtleneck he had on loafers with small silver buckles there wont be any showings up in pelican bay i said to him whats that supposed to mean wheres that its a pretty name for a super max prison where they send violent sex offenders youre going to fit in there pretty good in your turtleneck and loafers look whats the matter whats this about its about a lawyer who cant have a client who lies to him in twenty minutes im about to go up to see the guy who wants to send you to pelican bay i need everything i can get my hands on to try to keep you out of there and it doesnt help when i find out youre lying to me roulet stopped and turned to me he raised his hands out palms open i havent lied to you i did not do this thing i dont know what that woman wants but i let me ask you something louis you and dobbs said you took a year of law at ucla right did they teach you anything at all about the lawyerclient bond of trust i dont know i dont remember i wasnt there long enough i took a step toward him invading his space you see you are a fucking liar you didnt go to ucla law school for a year you didnt even go for a goddamn day he brought his hands down and slapped them against his sides is that what this is all about mickey yeah thats right and from now on dont call me mickey my friends call me that not my lying clients what does whether or not i went to law school ten years ago have to do with this case i dont because if you lied to me about that then youd lie to me about anything and i cant have that and be able to defend you i said it too loud i saw a couple of women on a nearby bench watching us they had juror badges on their blouses come on this way i started walking back the other way heading toward the police station look roulet said in a weak voice i lied because of my mother okay no not okay explain it to me look my mother and cecil think i went to law school for a year i want them to continue to believe that he brought it up with you and so i just sort of agreed but it was ten years ago what is the harm the harm is in lying to me i said you can lie to your mother to dobbs to your priest and to the police but when i ask you something directly do not lie to me i need to operate from the standpoint of having facts from you incontrovertible facts so when i ask you a question tell me the truth all the rest of the time you can say what you want and whatever makes you feel good okay okay if you werent in law school where were you roulet shook his head nowhere i just didnt do anything for a year most of the time i stayed in my apartment near campus and read and thought about what i really wanted to do with my life the only thing i knew for sure was that i didnt want to be a lawyer no offense intended none taken so you sat there for a year and came up with selling real estate to rich people no that came later he laughed in a selfdeprecating way i actually decided to become a writeri had majored in english litand i tried to write a novel it didnt take me long to figure out that i couldnt do it i eventually went to work for mother she wanted me to i calmed down most of my anger had been a show anyway i was trying to soften him up for the more important questioning i thought he was now ready for it well now that you are coming clean and confessing everything louis tell me about reggie campo what about her you were going to pay her for sex werent you what makes you say i shut him up when i stopped again and grabbed him by one of his expensive lapels he was taller than me and bigger but i had the power in this conversation i was pushing him answer the fucking question all right yes i was going to pay but how did you know that because im a good goddamn lawyer why didnt you tell me this on that first day dont you see how that changes the case my mother i didnt want my mother to know i you know louis lets sit down i walked him over to one of the long benches by the police station there was a lot of space and no one could overhear us i sat in the middle of the bench and he sat to my right your mother wasnt even in the room when we were talking about the case i dont even think she was in there when we talked about law school but cecil was and he tells her everything i nodded and made a mental note to cut cecil dobbs completely out of the loop on case matters from now on okay i think i understand but how long were you going to let it go without telling me dont you see how this changes everything im not a lawyer louis let me tell you a little bit about how this works you know what i am im a neutralizer my job is to neutralize the states case take each piece of evidence or proof and find a way to eliminate it from contention think of it like one of those street entertainers you see on the venice boardwalk you ever gone down there and seen the guy spinning all those plates on those little sticks i think so i havent been down there in a long time doesnt matter the guy has these thin little sticks and he puts a plate on each one and starts spinning the plate so it will stay balanced and upright he gets a lot of them going at once and he moves from plate to plate and stick to stick making sure everything is spinning and balanced and staying up you with me yes i understand well thats the states case louis a bunch of spinning plates and every one of those plates is an individual piece of evidence against you my job is to take each plate stop it from spinning and knock it to the ground so hard that it shatters and cant be used anymore if the blue plate contains the victims blood on your hands then i need to find a way to knock it down if the yellow plate has a knife with your bloody fingerprints on it then once again i need to knock that sucker down neutralize it you follow yes i follow i now in the middle of this field of plates is a big one its a fucking platter louis and if that baby falls over its going to take everything down with it every plate the whole case goes down do you know what that platter is louis he shook his head no that big platter is the victim the chief witness against you if we can knock that platter over then the whole act is over and the crowd moves on i waited a moment to see if he would react he said nothing louis for almost two weeks you have concealed from me the method by which i could knock the big platter down it asks the question why why would a guy with money at his disposal a rolex watch on his wrist a porsche out in the parking lot and a holmby hills address need to use a knife to get sex from a woman who sells it anyway when you boil it all down to that question the case starts to collapse louis because the answer is simple he wouldnt common sense says he wouldnt and when you come to that conclusion all the plates stop spinning you see the setup you see the trap and now its the defendant who starts to look like the victim i looked at him he nodded im sorry he said you should be i said the case would have started coming apart almost two weeks ago and we probably wouldnt be sitting here right now if you had been upfront with me from the start in that moment i realized where my anger was truly coming from and it wasnt because roulet had been late or had lied or because of sam scales calling me a streetlegal con it was because i saw the franchise slipping away there would be no trial in this case no sixfigure fee id be lucky just to keep the retainer id gotten at the start the case was going to end today when i walked into the das office and told ted minton what i knew and what i had im sorry roulet said again in a whiny voice i didnt mean to mess things up i was looking down at the ground between my feet now without looking at him i reached over and put my hand on his shoulder im sorry i yelled at you before louis what do we do now i have a few more questions to ask you about that night and then im going to go up into that building over there and meet the prosecutor and knock down all his plates i think that by the time i come out of there this may all be over and youll be free to go back to showing your mansions to rich people just like that well formally he may want to go into court and ask a judge to dismiss the case roulet opened his mouth in shock mr haller i cant begin to tell you how you can call me mickey sorry about that before no problem thank you what questions do you want to ask i thought for a moment i really didnt need anything else to go into the meeting with minton i was locked and loaded i had walking proof what did the note say i asked what note the one she gave you at the bar in morgans oh it said her address and then underneath she wrote four hundred dollars and then under that she wrote come after ten too bad we dont have that but i think we have enough i nodded and looked at my watch i still had fifteen minutes until the meeting but i was finished with roulet you can go now louis ill call you when its all over you sure i could wait out here if you want i dont know how long it will take im going to have to lay it all out for him hell probably have to take it to his boss it could be a while all right well i guess ill go then but youll call me right yes i will well probably go in to see the judge monday or tuesday then it will all be over he put his hand out and i shook it thanks mick youre the best i knew i had the best lawyer when i got you i watched him walk back across the plaza and go between the two courthouses toward the public parking garage yeah im the best i said to myself i felt the presence of someone and turned to see a man sit down on the bench next to me he turned and looked at me and we recognized each other at the same time it was howard kurlen a homicide detective from the van nuys division we had bumped up against each other on a few cases over the years well well well kurlen said the pride of the california bar youre not talking to yourself are you maybe that could be bad for a lawyer if that got around im not worried how are you doing detective kurlen was unwrapping a sandwich he had taken out of a brown bag busy day late lunch he produced a peanut butter sandwich from the wrap there was a layer of something else besides peanut butter in it but it wasnt jelly i couldnt identify it i looked at my watch i still had a few minutes before i needed to get in line for the metal detectors at the courthouse entrance but i wasnt sure i wanted to spend them with kurlen and his horriblelooking sandwich i thought about bringing up the blake verdict sticking it to the lapd a little bit but kurlen stuck one in me first hows my man jesus doin the detective asked kurlen had been lead detective on the jesus menendez case he had wrapped him up so tightly that menendez had no choice but to plead and hope for the best he still got life i dont know i answered i dont talk to jesus anymore yeah i guess once they plead out and go upstate theyre not much use to you no appeal work no nothing i nodded every cop had a jaundiced eye when it came to defense lawyers it was as if they believed their own actions and investigations were beyond questioning or reproach they didnt believe in a justice system based on checks and balances just like you i guess i said on to the next one i hope your busy day means youre working on getting me a new client i dont look at it that way but i was wondering do you sleep well at night you know what i was wondering what the hell is in that sandwich he held what was left of the sandwich up on display peanut butter and sardines lots of good protein to get me through another day of chasing scumbags talking to them too you didnt answer my question i sleep fine detective you know why because i play an important part in the system a needed partjust like your part when somebody is accused of a crime they have the opportunity to test the system if they want to do that they come to me thats all any of this is about when you understand that you have no trouble sleeping good story when you close your eyes i hope you believe it how about you detective you ever put your head on the pillow and wonder whether youve put innocent people away nope he said quickly his mouth full of sandwich never happened never will must be nice to be so sure a guy told me once that when you get to the end of your road you have to look at the community woodpile and decide if you added to it while you were here or whether you just took from it well i add to the woodpile haller i sleep good at night but i wonder about you and your kind you lawyers are all takers from the woodpile thanks for the sermon ill keep it in mind next time im chopping wood you dont like that then ive got a joke for you whats the difference between a catfish and a defense attorney hmmm i dont know detective ones a bottomfeeding scum sucker and ones a fish he laughed uproariously i stood up it was time to go i hope you brush your teeth after you eat something like that i said id hate to be your partner if you dont i walked away thinking about what he had said about the woodpile and what sam scales had said about my being a streetlegal con i was getting it from all sides today thanks for the tip kurlen called after me fourteen ted minton had arranged for us to discuss the roulet case in private by scheduling our conference at a time he knew the deputy district attorney he shared space with had a hearing in court minton met me in the waiting area and walked me back he did not look to me to be older than thirty but he had a selfassured presence i probably had ten years and a hundred trials on him yet he showed no sign of deference or respect he acted as though the meeting was a nuisance he had to put up with that was fine that was the usual and it put more fuel in my tank when we got to his small windowless office he offered me his office partners seat and closed the door we sat down and looked at each other i let him go first okay he said first off i wanted to meet you im sort of new up here in the valley and havent met a lot of the members of the defense bar i know youre one of those guys that covers the whole county but we havent run across each other before maybe thats because you havent worked many felony trials before he smiled and nodded like i had scored a point of some kind that might be true he said anyway i gotta tell you when i was in law school at sc i read a book about your father and his cases i think it was called haller for the defense something like that interesting guy and interesting times i nodded back he was gone before i really knew him but there were a few books about him and i read them all more than a few times its probably why i ended up doing this that must have been hard getting to know your father through books i shrugged i didnt think that minton and i needed to know each other that well particularly in light of what i was about to do to him i guess it happens he said yeah he clapped his hands together once a letsgetdowntobusiness gesture okay so were here to talk about louis roulet arent we its pronounced roolay roooolaygot it so lets see i have some things for you here he swiveled his seat to turn back to his desk he picked up a thin file and turned back to hand it to me i want to play fair thats the uptotheminute discovery for you i know i dont have to give it to you until after the arraignment but hell lets be cordial my experience is that when prosecutors tell you they are playing fair or better than fair then you better watch your back i fanned through the discovery file but didnt really read anything the file levin had gathered for me was at least four times as thick i wasnt thrilled because minton had so little i was suspicious that he was holding back on me most prosecutors made you work for the discovery by having to demand it repeatedly to the point of going to court to complain to the judge about it but minton had just casually handed at least some of it over either he had more to learn than i imagined about felony prosecutions or there was some sort of play here this is everything i asked everything ive gotten that was always the way if the prosecutor didnt have it then he could stall its release to the defense i knew for a factas in having been married to a prosecutorthat it was not out of the ordinary for a prosecutor to tell the police investigators on a case to take their time getting all the paperwork in they could then turn around and tell the defense lawyer they wanted to play fair and hand over practically nothing the rules of discovery were often referred to by defense pros as the rules of dishonesty this of course went both ways discovery was supposed to be a twoway street and youre going to trial with this i waved the file as if to say its thin contents were as thin as the case im not worried about it but if you want to talk about a disposition ill listen no no disposition on this were going balls out were going to waive the prelim and go right to trial no delays he wont waive speedy nope youve got sixty days from monday to put up or shut up minton pursed his lips as though what i had just told him were only a minor inconvenience and surprise it was a good coverup i knew i had landed a solid punch well then i guess we ought to talk about unilateral discovery what do you have for me he had dropped the pleasant tone im still putting it together i said but ill have it at the arraignment monday but most of what ive got is probably already in this file you gave me dont you think most likely you have that the supposed victim is a prostitute who had solicited my client in here right and that she has continued that line of work since the alleged incident right mintons mouth opened maybe a half inch and then closed but it was a good tell i had hit him with another solid shot but then he recovered quickly as a matter of fact he said i am aware of her occupation but what surprises me is that you know this already i hope you arent sniffing around my victim mr haller call me mickey and what i am doing is the least of your problems you better take a good look at this case ted i know youre new to felony trials and you dont want to come out of the box with a loser like this especially after the blake fiasco but this ones a dog and its going to bite you on the ass really how so i looked past his shoulder at the computer on his desk does that thing play dvds minton looked back at the computer it looked ancient it should what have you got i realized that showing him the surveillance video from the bar at morgans would be giving an early reveal of the biggest ace that i held but i was confident that once he saw it there would be no arraignment monday and no case my job was to neutralize the case and get my client out from under the governments weight this was the way to do it i dont have all my discovery together but i do have this i said i handed minton the dvd i had gotten earlier from levin the prosecutor put it into his computer this is from the bar at morgans i told him as he tried to get it playing your guys never went there but my guy did this is the sunday night of the supposed attack and this could have been doctored it could have been but it wasnt you can have it checked my investigator has the original and i will tell him to make it available after the arraignment after a short struggle minton got the dvd to play he watched silently as i pointed out the time code and all the same details levin had pointed out to me including mr x and his lefthandedness minton fastforwarded as i instructed and then slowed it to watch the moment when reggie campo approached my client at the bar he had a frown of concentration on his face when it was over he ejected the disc and held it up can i keep this until i get the original be my guest minton put the disc back in its case and placed it on top of a stack of files on his desk okay what else he asked now my mouth let some light in what do you mean what else isnt that enough enough for what look ted why dont we cut the bullshit please do what are we talking about here that disc blows this case out of the water lets forget about arraignment and trial and talk about going into court next week with a joint motion to dismiss i want this shitcanned with prejudice ted no coming back at my guy if somebody in here decides to change their mind minton smiled and shook his head cant do that mickey this woman was injured quite badly she was victimized by an animal and im not going to dismiss anything against quite badly shes been turning tricks again all week you how do you know that i shook my head man i am trying to help you here save you some embarrassment and all youre worried about is whether ive crossed some line with the victim well ive got news for you she aint the victim dont you see what you have here if this thing gets to a jury and they see that disc all the plates fall ted your case is over and you have to come back in here and explain to your boss smithson why you didnt see it coming i dont know smithson all that well but i do know one thing about him he doesnt like to lose and after what happened yesterday i would say that he feels a little more urgent about that prostitutes can be victims too even amateurs i shook my head i decided to show my whole hand she set him up i said she knew he had money and she laid a trap she wants to sue him and cash in she either hit herself or she had her boyfriend from the bar the lefthanded man do it no jury in the world is going to buy what youre selling blood on the hand or fingerprints on the knifeit was all staged after he was knocked out minton nodded as if he followed the logic but then came out with something from left field im concerned that you may be trying to intimidate my victim by following her and harassing her what you know the rules of engagement leave the victim alone or well next talk about it with a judge i shook my head and spread my hands wide are you listening to anything im saying here yes i have listened to it all and it doesnt change the course i am taking i do have an offer for you though and it will be good only until mondays arraignment after that all bets are off your client takes his chances with a judge and jury and im not intimidated by you or the sixty days i will be ready and waiting i felt like i was underwater and everything that i said was trapped in bubbles that were drifting up and away no one could hear me correctly then i realized that there was something i was missing something important it didnt matter how green minton was he wasnt stupid and i had just mistakenly thought he was acting stupid the la county da s office got some of the best of the best out of law school he had already mentioned southern cal and i knew that was a law school that turned out topnotch lawyers it was only a matter of experience minton might be short on experience but it didnt mean he was short on legal intelligence i realized that i should be looking at myself not minton for understanding what am i missing here i asked i dont know minton said youre the one with the highpowered defense what could you be missing i stared at him for a moment and then knew there was a glitch in the discovery there was something in his thin file that was not in the thick one levin had put together something that would get the prosecution past the fact that reggie campo was selling it minton had so much as told me already prostitutes can be victims too i wanted to stop everything and look through the states discovery file to compare it with everything about the case that i knew but i could not do it now in front of him okay i said whats your offer he wont take it but ill present it well hes got to do prison time thats a given were willing to drop it all down to an adw and attempted sexual battery well go to the middle of the guidelines which would put him at about seven years i nodded assault with a deadly weapon and attempted sexual battery a sevenyear sentence would likely mean four years actual it wasnt a bad offer but only from the standpoint of roulet having committed the crime if he was innocent then no offer was acceptable i shrugged ill take it to him i said remember only until the arraignment so if he wants it you better call me monday morning first thing right i closed my briefcase and stood up to go i was thinking about how roulet was probably waiting for a phone call from me telling him the nightmare was over instead i would be calling about a sevenyear deal minton and i shook hands and i said i would call him then i headed out in the hallway leading to the reception area i ran into maggie mcpherson hayley had a great time saturday she said about our daughter shes still talking about it she said you were going to see her this weekend too yeah if thats okay are you all right you look like youre in a daze its turning into a long week im glad i have an empty calendar tomorrow which works better for hayley saturday or sunday eithers fine were you just meeting ted on the roulet thing yeah i got his offer i raised my briefcase to show i was taking the prosecutions plea offer with me now i have to go try to sell it i added thats going to be tough guy says he didnt do it i thought they all said that not like this guy well good luck thanks we headed opposite ways in the hallway and then i remembered something and called back to her hey happy st patricks oh she turned and came back toward me staceys staying a couple hours late with hayley and a bunch of us are going over to four green fields after work you feel like a pint of green beer four green fields was an irish pub not far from the civic center it was frequented by lawyers from both sides of the bar animosities grew slack under the taste of roomtemperature guinness i dont know i said i think i have to head over the hill to see my client but you never know i might come back well i only have till eight and then i have to go relieve stacey okay we parted again and i left the courthouse the bench where i had sat with roulet and then kurlen was empty i sat down opened my case and pulled out the discovery file minton had given me i flipped through reports i already had gotten copies of through levin there seemed to be nothing new until i came to a comparative fingerprint analysis report that confirmed what we had thought all along the bloody fingerprints on the knife belonged to my client louis roulet it still wasnt enough to justify mintons demeanor i kept looking and then i found it in the weapon analysis report the report i had gotten from levin was completely different as if from another case and another weapon as i quickly read it i felt perspiration popping in my hair i had been set up i had been embarrassed in the meeting with minton and worse yet had tipped him early to my hole card he had the video from morgans and had all the time he would need to prepare for it in court finally i slapped the folder closed and pulled out my cell phone levin answered after two rings howd it go he asked bonuses for everybody not quite do you know where roulets office is yeah on canon in beverly hills ive got the exact address in the file meet me there now ill be there in thirty minutes i punched the button ending the call without further discussion and then called earl on speed dial he must have had his ipod plugs in his ears because he didnt answer until the seventh ring come get me i said were going over the hill i closed the phone and got off the bench walking toward the opening between the two courthouses and the place where earl would pick me up i felt angry at roulet at levin and most of all at myself but i also was aware of the positive side of this the one thing that was certain now was that the franchiseand the big payday that came with itwas back in play the case was going to go the distance to trial unless roulet took the states offer and i thought the chances of that were about the same as the chances for snow in la it could happen but i wouldnt believe it until i saw it fifteen when the rich in beverly hills want to drop small fortunes on clothes and jewelry they go to rodeo drive when they want to drop larger fortunes on houses and condominiums they walk a few blocks over to canon drive where the highline real estate companies roost photographs of their multimilliondollar offerings presented in showroom windows on ornate gold easels like picassos and van goghs this is where i found windsor residential estates and louis roulet on thursday afternoon by the time i got there raul levin was already waitingand i mean waiting he had been kept in the showroom with a fresh bottle of water while louis worked the phone in his private office the receptionist an overly tanned blonde with a haircut that hung down one side of her face like a scythe told me it would be just a few minutes more and then we both could go in i nodded and stepped away from her desk you want to tell me whats going on levin asked yeah when we get in there with him the showroom was lined on both sides with steel wires that ran from ceiling to floor and on which were attached frames containing the photos and pedigrees of the estates offered for sale acting like i was studying the rows of houses i couldnt hope to afford in a hundred years i moved toward the back hallway that led to the offices when i got there i noticed an open door and heard louis roulets voice it sounded like he was setting up a showing of a mulholland drive mansion for a client he told the realtor on the other end of the phone wanted his name kept confidential i looked back at levin who was still near the front of the showroom this is bullshit i said and signaled him back i walked down the hallway and into roulets plush office there was the requisite desk stacked with paperwork and thick multiplelisting catalogs but roulet wasnt there he was in a sitting area to the right of the desk slouched on a sofa with a cigarette in one hand and the phone in the other he looked shocked to see me and i thought maybe the receptionist hadnt even told him he had visitors levin came into the office behind me followed by the receptionist the hair scythe swinging back and forth as she hurried to catch up i was worried that the blade might cut off her nose mr roulet im sorry these men just came back here lisa i have to go roulet said into the phone ill call you back he put the phone down in its cradle on the glass coffee table its okay robin he said you can go now he made a dismissive gesture with the back of his hand robin looked at me like i was wheat she wanted to cut down with that blond blade and then left the room i closed the door and looked back at roulet what happened he said is it over not by a long shot i said i was carrying the states discovery file the weapon report was front and center i stepped over and dropped it onto the coffee table i only succeeded in embarrassing myself in the das office the case against you still stands and well probably be going to trial roulets face dropped i dont understand he said you said you were going to tear that guy a new asshole turns out the only asshole in there was me because once again you didnt level with me then turning to look at levin i said and because you got us set up roulet opened the file on the top page was a color photograph of a knife with blood on its black handle and the tip of its blade it was not the same knife that was photocopied in the records levin got from his police sources and that he had showed us in the meeting in dobbss office the first day of the case what the hell is that said levin looking down at the photo that is a knife the real one the one roulet had with him when he went to reggie campos apartment the one with her blood and his initials on it levin sat down on the couch on the opposite side from roulet i stayed standing and they both looked up at me i started with levin i went in to see the da to kick his ass today and he ended up kicking mine with that who was your source raul because he gave you a marked deck wait a minute wait a minute thats not no you wait a minute the report you had on the knife being untraceable was bogus it was put in there to fuck us up to trick us and it worked perfectly because i waltzed in there thinking i couldnt lose today and just gave him the morgans bar video just trotted it out like it was the hammer only it wasnt goddamn it it was the runner levin said what the runner the guy who runs the reports between the police station and the das office i tell him which cases im interested in and he makes extra copies for me well theyre onto his ass and they worked it perfectly you better call him and tell him if he needs a good criminal defense attorney im not available i realized i was pacing in front of them on the couch but i didnt stop and you i said to roulet i now get the real weapon report and find out not only is the knife a custommade job but it is traceable right back to you because it has your fucking initials on it you lied to me again i didnt lie roulet yelled back i tried to tell you i said it wasnt my knife i said it twice but nobody listened to me then you should have clarified what you meant just saying it wasnt your knife was like saying you didnt do it you should have said hey mick there might be a problem with the knife because i did have a knife but this picture isnt it what did you think that it was just going to go away please can you keep it down roulet protested there might be customers out there i dont care fuck your customers youre not going to need customers anymore where youre going dont you see that this knife trumps everything weve got you took a murder weapon to a meeting with a prostitute the knife was no plant it was yours and that means we no longer have the setup how can we claim she set you up when the prosecutor can prove you had that knife with you when you walked through the door he didnt answer but i didnt give him a lot of time to you fucking did this thing and theyve got you i said pointing at him no wonder they didnt bother with any followup investigation at the bar no followup needed when theyve got your knife and your fingerprints in blood on it i didnt do it its a setup im telling you it was whos yelling now look i dont care what youre telling me i cant deal with a client who doesnt level who doesnt see the percentage in telling his own attorney what is going on so the da has made an offer to you and i think you better take it roulet sat up straight and grabbed the pack of cigarettes off the table he took one out and lit it off the one he already had going im not pleading guilty to something i didnt do he said his voice suddenly calm after a deep drag off the fresh smoke seven years youll be out in four you have till court time monday and then it disappears think about it then tell me you want to take it i wont take it i didnt do this thing and if you wont take it to trial then i will find somebody who will levin was holding the discovery file i reached down and rudely grabbed it out of his hands so i could read directly from the weapon report you didnt do it i said to roulet okay if you didnt do it then would you mind telling me why you went to see this prostitute with a custommade black ninja knife with a fiveinch blade complete with your initials engraved not once but twice on both sides of the blade finished reading from the report i threw it back to levin it went through his hands and slapped against his chest because i always carry it the force of roulets response quieted the room i paced back and forth once staring at him you always carry it i said not a question thats right im a realtor i drive expensive cars i wear expensive jewelry and i often meet strangers alone in empty houses again he gave me pause as hyped up as i was i still knew a glimmer when i saw one levin leaned forward and looked at roulet and then at me he saw it too what are you talking about i said you sell homes to rich people how do you know they are rich when they call you up and say they want to see a place i stretched my hands out in confusion you must have some sort of system for checking them out right sure we can run a credit report and we can ask for references but it still comes down to what they give us and these kind of people dont like to wait when they want to see a piece of property they want to see it there are a lot of realtors out there if we dont act quickly there will be somebody else who will i nodded the glimmer was getting brighter there might be something here i could work with there have been murders you know roulet said over the years every realtor knows the danger exists when you go to some of these places alone for a while there was somebody out there called the real estate rapist he attacked and robbed women in empty houses my mother he didnt finish i waited nothing what about your mother roulet hesitated before answering she was showing a place in belair once she was alone and she thought it was safe because it was belair the man raped her he left her tied up when she didnt come back to the office i went to the house i found her roulets eyes were staring at the memory how long ago was this i asked about four years she stopped selling after it happened just stayed in her office and never showed another property again i did the selling and thats when and why i got the knife ive had it for four years and carry it everywhere but on planes it was in my pocket when i went to that apartment i didnt think anything about it i dropped into the chair across the table from the couch my mind was working i was seeing how it could work it was still a defense that relied on coincidence roulet was set up by campo and the setup was aided coincidentally when she found the knife on him after knocking him out it could work did your mother file a police report levin asked was there an investigation roulet shook his head as he stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray no she was too embarrassed she was afraid it would get into the paper who else knows about it i asked uh me and cecil im sure knows probably nobody else you cant use this she would i wont use it without her permission i said but it could be important ill have to talk to her about it no i dont want you your life and livelihood are on the line here louis you get sent to prison and youre not going to make it dont worry about your mother a mother will do what she has to do to protect her young roulet looked down and shook his head i dont know he said i exhaled trying to lose all my tension with the breath disaster may have been averted i know one thing i said im going to go back to the da and say pass on the deal well go to trial and take our chances sixteen the hits kept coming the other shoe didnt drop on the prosecutions case until after id dropped earl off at the commuter lot where he parked his own car every morning and i drove the lincoln back to van nuys and four green fields it was a shotgun pub on victory boulevardmaybe that was why lawyers liked the placewith the bar running down the left side and a row of scarred wooden booths down the right it was crowded as only an irish bar can be the night of st patricks day my guess was that the crowd was swollen even bigger than in previous years because of the fact that the drinkers holiday fell on a thursday and many revelers were kicking off a long weekend i had made sure my own calendar was clear on friday i always clear the day after st pats as i started to fight my way through the mass in search of maggie mcpherson the required danny boy started blaring from a jukebox somewhere in the back but it was a punk rock version from the early eighties and its driving beat obliterated any chance i had of hearing anything when i saw familiar faces and said hello or asked if they had seen my exwife the small snippets of conversation i overheard as i pushed through seemed to all be about robert blake and the stunning verdict handed down the day before i ran into robert gillen in the crowd the cameraman reached into his pocket and pulled out four crisp hundreddollar bills and handed them to me the bills were probably four of the original ten i had paid him two weeks earlier in the van nuys courthouse as i tried to impress cecil dobbs with my media manipulation skills i had already expensed the thousand to roulet the four hundred was profit i thought id run into you here he yelled in my ear thanks sticks i replied itll go toward my bar tab he laughed i looked past him into the crowd for my exwife anytime my man he said he slapped me on the shoulder as i squeezed by him and pushed on i finally found maggie in the last booth in the back it was full of six women all prosecutors or secretaries from the van nuys office most i knew at least in passing but the scene was awkward because i had to stand and yell over the music and the crowd plus the fact that they were prosecutors and viewed me as being in league with the devil they had two pitchers of guinness on the table and one was full but my chances of getting through the crowd to the bar to get a glass were negligible maggie noticed my plight and offered to share her glass with me its all right she yelled weve swapped spit before i smiled and knew the two pitchers on the table had not been the first two i took a long drink and it tasted good guinness always gave me a solid center maggie was in the middle on the left side of the booth and between two young prosecutors whom i knew she had taken under her wing in the van nuys office many of the younger females gravitated toward my exwife because the man in charge smithson surrounded himself with attorneys like minton still standing at the side of the booth i raised the glass in toast to her but she couldnt respond because i had her glass she reached over and raised the pitcher cheers she didnt go so far as to drink from the pitcher she put it down and whispered to the woman on the outside of the booth she got up to let maggie out my exwife stood up and kissed me on the cheek and said its always easier for a lady to get a glass in these sorts of situations especially beautiful ladies i said she gave me one of her looks and turned toward the crowd that was five deep between us and the bar she whistled shrilly and it caught the attention of one of the purebred irish guys who worked the tap handles and could etch a harp or an angel or a naked lady in the foam at the top of the glass i need a pint glass she yelled the bartender had to read her lips and like a teenager being passed over the heads of the crowd at a pearl jam concert a clean glass made its way back to us hand to hand she filled it from the freshest pitcher on the booths table and then we clicked glasses so she said are you feeling a little better than when i saw you today i nodded a little did minton sandbag you i nodded again him and the cops did yeah with that guy corliss i told them he was full of shit they all are i didnt respond and tried to act like what she had just said was not news to me and that corliss was a name i already knew i took a long and slow drink from my glass i guess i shouldnt have said that she said but my opinion doesnt matter if minton is dumb enough to use him then youll take the guys head off im sure i guessed that she was talking about a witness but i had seen nothing in my review of the discovery file that mentioned a witness named corliss the fact that it was a witness she didnt trust led me further to believe that corliss was a snitch most likely a jailhouse snitch how come you know about him i finally asked minton talked to you about him no im the one who sent him to minton doesnt matter what i think of what he said it was my duty to send him to the right prosecutor and it was up to minton to evaluate him i mean why did he come to you she frowned at me because the answer was so obvious because i handled the first appearance he was there in the pen he thought the case was still mine now i understood corliss was a c roulet was taken out of alphabetical order and called first corliss must have been in the group of inmates taken into the courtroom with him he had seen maggie and me argue over roulets bail he therefore thought maggie still had the case he must have made a snitch call to her when did he call you i asked i am telling you too much haller im not just tell me when he called you that hearing was on a monday so was it later that day the case did not make any notice in the newspapers or on tv so i was curious as to where corliss would have gotten the information he was trying to trade to prosecutors i had to assume it didnt come from roulet i was pretty sure i had scared him silent without a media information point corliss would have been left with the information gleaned in court when the charges were read and maggie and i argued bail it was enough i realized maggie had been specific in detailing regina campos injuries as she was trying to impress the judge to hold roulet without bail if corliss had been in court hed have been privy to all the details he would need to make up a jailhouse confession from my client add that to his proximity to roulet and a jailhouse snitch is born yes he called me late monday maggie finally answered so why did you think he was full of shit hes done it before hasnt he the guys a professional snitch right i was fishing and she knew it she shook her head i am sure you will find out all you need to know during discovery can we just have a friendly pint of guinness here i have to leave in about an hour i nodded but wanted to know more tell you what i said youve probably had enough guinness for one st patricks day how about we get out of here and get something to eat why so you can keep asking me about your case no so we can talk about our daughter her eyes narrowed is something wrong she asked not that i know of but i want to talk to you about her where are you taking me to dinner i mentioned an expensive italian restaurant on ventura in sherman oaks and her eyes got warm it had been a place we had gone to celebrate anniversaries and getting pregnant our apartment which she still had was a few blocks away on dickens think we can eat there in an hour she asked if we leave right now and order without looking youre on let me just say some quick goodbyes ill drive and it was a good thing i drove because she was unsteady on her feet we had to walk hip to hip to the lincoln and then i helped her get in i took van nuys south to ventura after a few moments maggie reached beneath her legs and pulled out a cd case she had been uncomfortably sitting on it was earls one of the cds he listened to on the car stereo when i was in court it saved juice on his ipod the cd was by a dirty south performer named ludacris no wonder i was so uncomfortable she said is this what youre listening to while driving between courthouses actually no thats earls hes been doing the driving lately ludacris isnt really to my liking im more of an old school guy tupac and dre and people like that she laughed because she thought i was kidding a few minutes later we drove down the narrow alley that led to the door of the restaurant a valet took the car and we went in the hostess recognized us and acted like it had only been a couple weeks since the last time we had been in the truth was we had probably both been in there recently but each with other partners i asked for a bottle of singe shiraz and we ordered pasta dishes without looking at a menu we skipped salads and appetizers and told the waiter not to delay bringing the food out after he left i checked my watch and saw we still had fortyfive minutes plenty of time the guinness was catching up with maggie she smiled in a fractured sort of way that told me she was drunk beautifully drunk she never got mean under a buzz she always got sweeter it was probably how wed ended up having a child together you should probably lay off the wine i told her or youll have a headache tomorrow dont worry about me ill lay what i want and lay off what i want she smiled at me and i smiled back so how you been haller i mean really fine you and i mean really never better are you past lorna now yeah were even friends and what are we i dont know sometimes adversaries i guess she shook her head we cant be adversaries if we cant stay on the same case together besides im always looking out for you like with that dirtbag corliss thanks for trying but he still did the damage i just have no respect for a prosecutor who would use a jailhouse snitch doesnt matter that your client is an even bigger dirtbag he wouldnt tell me exactly what corliss said my guy said what are you talking about he just said he had a snitch he wouldnt reveal what he said thats not fair thats what i said its a discovery issue but we dont get a judge assigned until after the arraignment monday so theres nobody i can really complain to yet minton knows that its like you warned me he doesnt play fair her cheeks flushed i had pushed the right buttons and she was angry for maggie winning fair was the only way to win that was why she was a good prosecutor we were sitting at the end of the banquette that ran along the back wall of the restaurant we were on both sides of a corner maggie leaned toward me but went too far and we banged heads she laughed but then tried again she spoke in a low voice he said that he asked your guy what he was in for and your guy said for giving a bitch exactly what she deserved he said your client told him he punched her out as soon as she opened her door she leaned back and i could tell she had moved too quickly bringing on a swoon of vertigo you okay yes but can we change the subject i dont want to talk about work anymore there are too many assholes and its too frustrating sure just then the waiter brought our wine and our dinners at the same time the wine was good and the food was like home comfort we started out eating quietly then maggie hit me with a pitch right out of the blue you didnt know anything about corliss did you not till i opened my big mouth i knew minton was hiding something i thought it was a jailhouse bullshit you got me drunk so you could find out what i knew uh i think you were already drunk when i hooked up with you tonight she was poised with her fork up over her plate a long string of linguine with pesto sauce hanging off it she then pointed the fork at me good point so what about our daughter i wasnt expecting her to remember that i shrugged i think what you said last week is right she needs her father more in her life and and i want to play a bigger part i like watching her like when i took her to that movie on saturday i was sort of sitting sideways so i could watch her watching the movie watch her eyes you know welcome to the club so i dont know i was thinking maybe we should set up a schedule you know like make it a regular thing she could even stay overnight sometimesi mean if she wanted are you sure about all of that this is new from you its new because i didnt know about it before when she was smaller and i couldnt really communicate with her i didnt really know what to do with her i felt awkward now i dont i like talking to her being with her i learn more from her than she does from me thats for sure i suddenly felt her hand on my leg under the table this is great she said i am so happy to hear you say that but lets move slow you havent been around her much for four years and i am not going to let her build up her hopes only to have you pull a disappearing act i understand we can take it any way you want im just telling you i am going to be there i promise she smiled wanting to believe and i made the same promise i just made to her to myself well great she said im really glad you want to do this lets get a calendar and work out some dates and see how it goes she took her hand away and we continued eating in silence until we both had almost finished then maggie surprised me once again i dont think i can drive my car tonight she said i nodded i was thinking the same thing you seem all right you only had half a pint at no i mean i was thinking the same thing about you but dont worry ill drive you home thank you then she reached across the table and put her hand on my wrist and will you take me back to get my car in the morning she smiled sweetly at me i looked at her trying to read this woman who had told me to hit the road four years before the woman i had never been able to get by or get over whose rejection sent me reeling into a relationship i knew from the beginning couldnt go the distance sure i said ill take you friday march seventeen in the morning i awoke to find my eightyearold daughter sleeping between me and my exwife light was leaking in from a cathedral window high up on the wall when i had lived here that window had always bothered me because it let in too much light too early in the mornings looking up at the pattern it threw on the inclined ceiling i reviewed what had happened the night before and remembered that i had ended up drinking all but one glass of the bottle of wine at the restaurant i remembered taking maggie home to the apartment and coming in to find our daughter had already fallen asleep for the nightin her own bed after the babysitter had been released maggie opened another bottle of wine when we finished it she took me by the hand and led me to the bedroom we had shared for four years but not in four years what bothered me now was that my memory had absorbed all the wine and i could not remember whether it had been a triumphant return to the bedroom or a failure i also could not remember what words had been spoken what promises had possibly been made this is not fair to her i turned my head on the pillow maggie was awake she was looking at our sleeping daughters angelic face what isnt fair her waking up and finding you here she might get her hopes up or just get the wrong idea howd she get in here i carried her in she had a nightmare how often does she have nightmares usually when she sleeps alone in her room so she sleeps in here all the time something about my tone bothered her dont start you have no idea what its like to raise a child by yourself i know im not saying anything so what do you want me to do leave before she wakes up i could get dressed and act like i just came by to get you and drive you back to your car i dont know get dressed for now try not to wake her up i slipped out of the bed grabbed my clothes and went down the hall to the guest bathroom i was confused by how much maggies demeanor toward me had changed overnight alcohol i decided or maybe something i did or said after wed gotten back to the apartment i quickly got dressed and went back up the hallway to the bedroom and peeked in hayley was still asleep with her arms spread across two pillows she looked like an angel with wings maggie was pulling a longsleeve tshirt over an old pair of sweats shed had since back when we were married i walked in and stepped over to her im going to go and come back i whispered what she said with annoyance i thought we were going to get the car but i thought you didnt want her to wake up and see me so let me go and ill have some coffee or something and be back in an hour we can all go together and get your car and then ill take hayley to school ill even pick her up later if you want my calendars clear today just like that youre going to start driving her to school shes my daughter dont you remember anything i told you last night she shifted the line of her jaw and i knew from experience that this was when the heavy artillery came out i was missing something maggie had shifted gears well yes but i thought you were just saying that she said what do you mean i just thought you were trying to get into my head on your case or just plain get me into bed i dont know i laughed and shook my head any fantasies about us that id had the night before were vanishing quickly i wasnt the one who led the other up the steps to the bedroom i said oh so it was really about the case you wanted what i knew about your case i just stared at her for a long moment i cant win with you can i not when youre underhanded when you act like a criminal defense attorney she was always the better of the two of us when it came to verbal knife throwing the truth was i was thankful we had a builtin conflict of interest and i would never have to face her in trial over the years some peoplemostly defense pros who suffered at her handshad gone so far as to say that was the reason i had married her to avoid her professionally tell you what i said ill be back in an hour if you want a ride to the car that you were too drunk to drive last night be ready and have her ready its okay well take a cab i will drive you no well take a cab and keep your voice down i looked over at my daughter still asleep despite her parents verbal sparring what about her do you want me to take her tomorrow or sunday i dont know call me tomorrow fine goodbye i left her there in the bedroom outside the apartment building i walked a block and a half down dickens before finding the lincoln parked awkwardly against the curb there was a ticket on the windshield citing me for parking next to a fire hydrant i got in the car and threw it into the backseat id deal with it the next time i was riding back there i wouldnt be like louis roulet letting my tickets go to warrant there was a county full of cops out there who would love to book me on a warrant fighting always made me hungry and i realized i was starved i worked my way back to ventura and headed toward studio city it was early especially for the morning after st patricks day and i got to the dupars by laurel canyon boulevard before it was crowded i got a booth in the back and ordered a short stack of pancakes and coffee i tried to forget about maggie mcfierce by opening up my briefcase and pulling out a legal pad and the roulet files before diving into the files i made a call to raul levin waking him up at his home in glendale ive got something for you to do i said cant this wait till monday i just got home a couple hours ago i was going to start the weekend today no it cant wait and you owe me one after yesterday besides youre not even irish i need you to background somebody all right wait a minute i heard him put down the phone while he probably grabbed pen and paper to take notes okay go ahead theres a guy named corliss who was arraigned right after roulet back on the seventh he was in the first group out and they were in the holding pen at the same time hes now trying to snitch roulet off and i want to know everything there is to know about the guy so i can put his dick in the dirt got a first name nope do you know what hes in there for no and i dont even know if he is still in there thanks for the help whats he saying roulet told him that he beat up some bitch who had it coming words to that effect okay what else you got thats it other than i got a tip that hes a repeat snitch find out who hes crapped on in the past and there might be something there i can use go back as far as you can go with this guy the das people usually dont theyre afraid of what they might find theyd rather be ignorant okay ill get on it let me know when you know i closed the phone just as my pancakes arrived i doused them liberally with maple syrup and started eating while looking through the file containing the states discovery the weapon report remained the only surprise everything else in the file except the color photos i had already seen in levins file i moved on to that as expected with a contract investigator levin had larded the file with everything found in the net he had cast he even had copies of the parking tickets and speeding citations roulet had accumulated and failed to pay in recent years it annoyed me at first because there was so much to weed through to get to what was going to be germane to roulets defense i was nearly through it all when the waitress swung by my booth with a coffee pot looking to refill my mug she recoiled when she saw the battered face of reggie campo in one of the color photos i had put to the side of the files sorry about that i said i covered the photo with one of the files and signaled her back the waitress came back hesitantly and poured the coffee its work i said in feeble explanation i didnt mean to do that to you all i can say is i hope you get the bastard that did that to her i nodded she thought i was a cop probably because i hadnt shaved in twentyfour hours im working on it i said she went away and i went back to the file as i slid the photo of reggie campo out from underneath it i saw the undamaged side of her face first the left side something struck me and i held the file in position so that i was only looking at the good half of her face the wave of familiarity came over me again but again i could not place its origin i knew this woman looked like another woman i knew or was at least familiar with but who i also knew it was going to bother me until i figured it out i thought about it for a long time sipping my coffee and drumming my fingers on the table and then decided to try something i took the face shot of campo and folded it lengthwise down the middle so that one side of the crease showed the damaged right side of her face and the other showed the unblemished left side i then slipped the folded photo into the inside pocket of my jacket and got up from the booth there was no one in the restroom i quickly went to the sink and took out the folded photo i leaned over the sink and held the crease of the photo against the mirror with the undamaged side of reggie campos face on display the mirror reflected the image creating a full and undamaged face i stared at it for a long time and then finally realized why the face was familiar martha renteria i said the door to the restroom suddenly burst open and two teenagers stormed in their hands already tugging on their zippers i quickly pulled the photo back from the mirror and shoved it inside my jacket i turned and walked toward the door i heard them burst into laughter as i left i couldnt imagine what it was they thought i was doing back at the booth i gathered my files and photos and put them all back into my briefcase i left a more than adequate amount of cash on the table for tab and tip and left the restaurant in a hurry i felt like i was having a strange food reaction my face felt flushed and i was hot under the collar i thought i could hear my heart pounding beneath my shirt fifteen minutes later i was parked in front of my storage warehouse on oxnard avenue in north hollywood i have a fifteenhundredsquarefoot space behind a doublewide garage door the place is owned by a man whose son i defended on a possession case getting him out of jail and into pretrial intervention in lieu of a fee the father gave me the warehouse rentfree for a year but his son the drug addict kept getting into trouble and i kept getting free years of warehouse rent i keep the boxes of files from dead cases in the warehouse as well as two other lincoln town cars last year when i was flush i bought four lincolns at once so i could get a fleet rate the plan was to use each one until it hit sixty thousand on the odometer and then dump it on a limousine service to be used to ferry travelers to and from the airport the plan was working out so far i was on the second lincoln and it would soon be time for the third once i got one of the garage doors up i went to the archival area where the file boxes were arranged by year on industrial shelving i found the section of shelves for boxes from two years earlier and ran my finger down the list of client names written on the side of each box until i found the name jesus menendez i pulled the box off the shelf and squatted down and opened it on the floor the menendez case had been shortlived he took a plea early before the da pulled it back off the table so there were only four files and these mostly contained copies of the documents relating to the police investigation i paged through the files looking for photographs and finally saw what i was looking for in the third file martha renteria was the woman jesus menendez had pleaded guilty to murdering she was a twentyfouryearold dancer who had a dark beauty and a smile of big white teeth she had been found stabbed to death in her panorama city apartment she had been beaten before she was stabbed and her facial injuries were to the left side of her face the opposite of reggie campo i found the closeup shot of her face contained in the autopsy report once more i folded the photo lengthwise one side of her face damaged one side untouched on the floor i took the two folded photographs one of reggie and one of martha and fitted them together along the fold lines putting aside the fact that one woman was dead and one wasnt the half faces damn near formed a perfect match the two women looked so much alike they could have passed for sisters eighteen jesus menendez was serving a life sentence in san quentin because he had wiped his penis on a bathroom towel no matter how you looked at it that is what it really came down to that towel had been his biggest mistake sitting spreadlegged on the concrete floor of my warehouse the contents of menendez files fanned out around me i was reacquainting myself with the facts of the case i had worked two years before menendez was convicted of killing martha renteria after following her home to panorama city from a strip club in east hollywood called the cobra room he raped her and then stabbed her more than fifty times causing so much blood to leave her body that it seeped through the bed and formed a puddle on the wood floor below it in another day it seeped through cracks in the floor and formed a drip from the ceiling in the apartment below that is when the police were called the case against menendez was formidable but circumstantial he had also hurt himself by admitting to policebefore i was on the casethat he had been in her apartment on the night of the murder but it was the dna on the fluffy pink towel in the victims bathroom that ultimately did him in it couldnt be neutralized it was a spinning plate that couldnt be knocked down defense pros call a piece of evidence like this the iceberg because it is the evidence that sinks the ship i had taken on the menendez murder case as what i would call a loss leader menendez had no money to pay for the kind of time and effort it would take to mount a thorough defense but the case had garnered substantial publicity and i was willing to trade my time and work for the free advertising menendez had come to me because just a few months before his arrest i had successfully defended his older brother fernando in a heroin case at least in my opinion i had been successful i had gotten a possession and sales charge knocked down to a simple possession he got probation instead of prison those good efforts resulted in fernando calling me on the night jesus was arrested for the murder of martha renteria jesus had gone to the van nuys division to voluntarily talk to detectives a drawing of his face had been shown on every television channel in the city and was getting heavy rotation in particular on the spanish channels he had told his family that he would go to the detectives to straighten things out and be back but he never came back so his brother called me i told the brother that the lesson to be learned was never to go to the detectives to straighten things out until after youve consulted an attorney i had already seen numerous television news reports on the murder of the exotic dancer as renteria had been labeled when menendezs brother called me the reports had included the police artists drawing of the latin male believed to have followed her from the club i knew that the prearrest media interest meant the case would likely be carried forward in the public consciousness by the television news and i might be able to get a good ride out of it i agreed to take the case on the come line for free pro bono for the good of the system besides murder cases are few and far between i take them when i can get them menendez was the twelfth accused murderer i had defended the first eleven were still in prison but none of them were on death row i considered that a good record by the time i got to menendez in a holding cell at van nuys division he had already given a statement that implicated him to the police he had told detectives howard kurlen and don crafton that he had not followed renteria home as suggested by the news reports but had been an invited guest to her apartment he explained that earlier in the day he had won eleven hundred dollars on the california lotto and had been willing to trade some of it to renteria for some of her attention he said that at her apartment they had engaged in consensual sexalthough he did not use those wordsand that when he left she was alive and five hundred dollars in cash richer the holes kurlen and crafton punched in menendezs story were many first of all there had been no state lotto on the day of or day before the murder and the neighborhood minimarket where he said he had cashed his winning ticket had no record of paying out an elevenhundreddollar win to menendez or anyone else additionally no more than eighty dollars in cash was found in the victims apartment and lastly the autopsy report indicated that bruising and other damage to the interior of the victims vagina precluded what could be considered consensual sexual relations the medical examiner concluded that she had been brutally raped no fingerprints other than the victims were found in the apartment the place had been wiped clean no semen was found in the victims body indicating her rapist had used a condom or had not ejaculated during the assault but in the bathroom off the bedroom where the attack and murder had taken place a crime scene investigator using a black light found a small amount of semen on a pink towel hanging on a rack near the toilet the theory that came into play was that after the rape and murder the killer had stepped into the bathroom removed the condom and flushed it down the toilet he had then wiped his penis with the nearby towel and then hung the towel back on the rack when cleaning up after the crime and wiping surfaces he might have touched he forgot about that towel the investigators kept the discovery of the dna deposit and their attendant theory secret it never made it into the media it would become kurlen and craftons hole card based on menendezs lies and the admission that he had been in the victims apartment he was arrested on suspicion of murder and held without bail detectives got a search warrant and oral swabs were collected from menendez and sent to the lab for dna typing and comparison to the dna recovered from the bathroom towel that was about when i entered the case as they say in my profession by then the titanic had already left the dock the iceberg was out there waiting menendez had badly hurt himself by talkingand lyingto the detectives still unaware of the dna comparison that was under way i saw a glimmer of light for jesus menendez there was a case to be made for neutralizing his interview with detectiveswhich by the way became a fullblown confession by the time it got reported by the media menendez was mexican born and had come to this country at age eight his family spoke only spanish at home and he had attended a school for spanish speakers until dropping out at age fourteen he spoke only rudimentary english and his cognition level of the language seemed to me to be even lower than his speaking level kurlen and crafton made no effort to bring in a translator and according to the taped interview not once asked if menendez even wanted one this was the crack i would work my way into the interview was the foundation of the case against menendez it was the spinning platter if i could knock it down most of the other plates would come down with it my plan was to attack the interview as a violation of menendezs rights because he could not have understood the miranda warning he had been read by kurlen or the document listing these rights in english that he had signed at the detectives request this is where the case stood until two weeks after menendezs arrest when the lab results came back matching his dna to that found on the towel in the victims bathroom after that the prosecution didnt need the interview or his admissions the dna put menendez directly on the scene of a brutal rape and murder i could try an oj defenseattack the credibility of the dna match but prosecutors and lab techs had learned so much from that debacle and in the years since that i knew i was unlikely of prevailing with a jury the dna was the iceberg and the momentum of the ship made it impossible to steer around it in time the district attorney himself revealed the dna findings at a press conference and announced that his office would seek the death penalty for menendez he added that detectives had also located three eyewitnesses who had seen menendez throw a knife into the los angeles river the da said the river was searched for the weapon but it was not recovered regardless he characterized the witness accounts as solidthey were menendezs three roommates based on the prosecutions case coming together and the threat of the death penalty i decided the oj defense would be too risky using fernando menendez as my translator i went to the van nuys jail and told jesus that his only hope was for a deal the da had floated by me if menendez would plead guilty to murder i could get him a life sentence with the possibility of parole i told him hed be out in fifteen years i told him it was the only way it was a tearful discussion both brothers cried and beseeched me to find another way jesus insisted that he did not kill martha renteria he said he had lied to the detectives to protect fernando who had given him the money after a good month selling tar heroin jesus thought that revealing his brothers generosity would lead to another investigation of fernando and his possible arrest the brothers urged me to investigate the case jesus told me renteria had had other suitors that night in the cobra room the reason he had paid her so much money was because she had played him off another bidder for her services lastly jesus told me it was true that he had thrown a knife into the river but it was because he was afraid it wasnt the murder weapon it was just a knife he used on day jobs he picked up in pacoima it looked like the knife they were describing on the spanish channel and he got rid of it before going to the police to straighten things out i listened and then told them that none of their explanations mattered the only thing that mattered was the dna jesus had a choice he could take the fifteen years or go to trial and risk getting the death penalty or life without the possibility of parole i reminded jesus that he was a young man he could be out by age forty he could still have a life by the time i left the jailhouse meeting i had jesus menendezs consent to make the deal i only saw him one more time after that at his pleaandsentencing hearing when i stood next to him in front of the judge and coached him through the guilty plea he was shipped off to pelican bay initially and then down to san quentin after that i had heard through the courthouse grapevine that his brother had gotten himself popped againthis time for using heroin but he didnt call me he went with a different lawyer and i didnt have to wonder why on the warehouse floor i opened the report on the autopsy of martha renteria i was looking for two specific things that had probably not been looked at very closely by anyone else before the case was closed it was a dead file nobody cared anymore the first was the part of the report that dealt with the fiftythree stab wounds renteria suffered during the attack on her bed under the heading wound profile the unknown weapon was described as a blade no longer than five inches and no wider than an inch its thickness was placed at oneeighth of an inch also noted in the report was the occurrence of jagged skin tears at the top of the victims wounds indicating that the top of the blade had an uneven line to wit it was designed as a weapon that would inflict damage going in as well as coming out the shortness of the blade suggested that the weapon might be a folding knife there was a crude drawing in the report that depicted the outline of the blade without a handle it looked familiar to me i pulled my briefcase across the floor from where i had put it down and opened it up from the states discovery file i pulled the photo of the open folding knife with louis roulets initials etched on the blade i compared the blade to the outline drawn on the page in the autopsy report it wasnt an exact match but it was damn close i then pulled out the recovered weapon analysis report and read the same paragraph i had read during the meeting in roulets office the day before the knife was described as a custommade black ninja folding knife with a blade measuring five inches long one inch wide and oneeighth of an inch thickthe same measurements belonging to the unknown knife used to kill martha renteria the knife jesus menendez supposedly threw into the la river i knew that a fiveinch blade wasnt unique nothing was conclusive but my instincts told me i was moving toward something i tried not to let the burn that was building in my chest and throat distract me i tried to stay on point i moved on i needed to check for a specific wound but i didnt want to look at the photos contained in the back of the report the photos that coldly documented the horribly violated body of martha renteria instead i went to the page that had two sidebyside generic body profiles one for the front and one for the back on these the medical examiner had marked the wounds and numbered them only the front profile had been used dots and numbers through it looked like a macabre connectthedots puzzle and i didnt doubt that kurlen or some detective looking for anything in the days before menendez walked in had connected them hoping the killer had left his initials or some other bizarre clue behind i studied the front profiles neck and saw two dots on either side of the neck they were numbered and i turned the page and looked at the list of individual wound descriptions the description for wound number read superficial puncture on the lower right neck with antemortem histamine levels indicative of coercive wound the description for wound number read superficial puncture on the lower left neck with antemortem histamine levels indicative of coercive wound this puncture measures cm larger than wound no the descriptions meant the wounds had been inflicted while martha renteria was still alive and that was likely why they had been the first wounds listed and described the examiner had suggested it was likely that the wounds resulted from a knife being held to the victims neck in a coercive manner it was the killers method of controlling her i turned back to the states discovery file for the campo case i pulled the photographs of reggie campo and the report on her physical examination at holy cross medical center campo had a small puncture wound on the lower left side of her neck and no wounds on her right side i next scanned through her statement to the police until i found the part in which she described how she got the wound she said that her attacker pulled her up off the floor of the living room and told her to lead him toward the bedroom he controlled her from behind by gripping the bra strap across her back with his right hand and holding the knife point against the left side of her neck with his left hand when she felt him momentarily rest his wrist on her shoulder she made her move suddenly pivoting and pushing backwards knocking her attacker into a large floor vase and then breaking away i thought i understood now why reggie campo had only one wound on her neck compared with the two martha renteria ended up with if campos attacker had gotten her to the bedroom and put her down on the bed he would have been facing her when he climbed on top of her if he kept his knife in the same handthe leftthe blade would shift to the other side of her neck when they found her dead in the bed shed have coercive punctures on both sides of her neck i put the files aside and sat crosslegged on the floor without moving for a long time my thoughts were whispers in the darkness inside in my mind i held the image of jesus menendezs tearstreaked face when he had told me that he was innocentwhen hed begged me to believe himand i had told him that he must plead guilty it had been more than legal advice i was dispensing he had no money no defense and no chancein that orderand i told him he had no choice and though ultimately it was his decision and from his mouth that the word guilty was uttered in front of the judge it felt to me now as though it had been me his own attorney holding the knife of the system against his neck and forcing him to say it nineteen igot out of the huge new rentacar facility at san francisco international by one oclock and headed north to the city the lincoln they gave me smelled like it had last been used by a smoker maybe the renter or maybe just the guy who cleaned it up for me i dont know how to get anywhere in san francisco i just know how to drive through it three or four times a year i need to go to the prison by the bay san quentin to talk to clients or witnesses i could tell you how to get there no sweat but ask me how to get to coit tower or fishermans wharf and we have a problem by the time i got through the city and over the golden gate it was almost two i was in good shape i knew from past experience that attorney visiting hours ended at four san quentin is over a century old and looks as though the soul of every prisoner who lived or died there is etched on its dark walls it was as foreboding a prison as i had ever visited and at one time or another i had been to every one in california they searched my briefcase and made me go through a metal detector after that they still passed a wand over me to make extra sure even then i wasnt allowed direct contact with menendez because i had not formally scheduled the interview the required five days in advance so i was put in a nocontact rooma plexiglas wall between us with dimesize holes to speak through i showed the guard the sixpack of photos i wanted to give menendez and he told me i would have to show him the pictures through the plexiglas i sat down put the photos away and didnt have to wait long until they brought menendez in on the other side of the glass two years ago when he was shipped off to prison jesus menendez had been a young man now he looked like he was already the forty years old i told him he could beat if he pleaded guilty he looked at me with eyes as dead as the gravel stones out in the parking lot he saw me and sat down reluctantly he didnt have much use for me anymore we didnt bother with hellos and i got right into it look jesus i dont have to ask you how youve been i know but somethings come up and it could affect your case i need to ask you a few questions you understand me why questions now man you had no questions before i nodded youre right i shouldve asked you more questions back then and i didnt i didnt know then what i know now or at least what i think i know now i am trying to make things right what do you want i want you to tell me about that night at the cobra room he shrugged the girl was there and i talked she tol me to follow her home he shrugged again i went to her place man but i didnt kill her like that go back to the club you told me that you had to impress the girl that you had to show her the money and you spent more than you wanted to you remember is right you said there was another guy trying to get with her you remember that si he was there talking she went to him but she came back to me you had to pay her more right like that okay do you remember that guy if you saw a picture of him would you remember him the guy who talked big i think i member okay i opened my briefcase and took out the spread of mug shots there were six photos and they included the booking photo of louis ross roulet and five other men whose mug shots i had culled out of my archive boxes i stood up and one by one started holding them up on the glass i thought that by spreading my fingers i would be able to hold all six against the glass menendez stood up to look closely at the photos almost immediately a voice boomed from an overhead speaker step back from the glass both of you step back from the glass and remain seated or the interview will be terminated i shook my head and cursed i gathered the photos together and sat down menendez sat back down as well guard i said loudly i looked at menendez and waited the guard didnt enter the room guard i called again louder finally the door opened and the guard stepped into my side of the interview room you done no i need him to look at these photos i held up the stack show him through the glass hes not allowed to receive anything from you but im going to take them right back doesnt matter you cant give him anything but if you dont let him come to the glass how is he going to see them its not my problem i waved in surrender all right okay then can you stay here for a minute what for i want you to watch this im going to show him the photos and if he makes an id i want you to witness it dont drag me into your bullshit he walked to the door and left goddamn it i said i looked at menendez all right jesus im going to show you anyway see if you recognize any of them from where you are sitting one by one i held the photos up about a foot from the glass menendez leaned forward as i showed each of the first five he looked thought about it and then shook his head no but on the sixth photo i saw his eyes flare it seemed as though there was some life in them after all that one he said is him i turned the photo toward me to be sure it was roulet i member menendez said hes the one and youre sure menendez nodded what makes you so sure because i know in here i think on that night all of my time i nodded who is the man he asked i cant tell you right now just know that i am trying to get you out of here what do i do what you have been doing sit tight be careful and stay safe safe i know but as soon as i have something you will know about it im trying to get you out of here jesus but it might take a little while you were the one who tol me to come here at the time i didnt think there was a choice how come you never ask me did you murder this girl you my lawyer man you dint care you dint listen i stood up and loudly called for the guard then i answered his question to legally defend you i didnt need to know the answer to that question if i asked my clients if they were guilty of the crimes they were charged with very few would tell me the truth and if they did i might not be able to defend them to the best of my ability the guard opened the door and looked in at me im ready to go i said i checked my watch and figured that if i was lucky in traffic i might be able to catch the five oclock shuttle back to burbank the six oclock at the latest i dropped the photos into my briefcase and closed it i looked back at menendez who was still in his chair on the other side of the glass can i just put my hand on the glass i asked the guard hurry up i leaned across the counter and put my hand on the glass fingers spread i waited for menendez to do the same creating a jailhouse handshake menendez stood leaned forward and spit on the glass where my hand was you never shake my hand he said i dont shake yours i nodded i thought i understood just where he was coming from the guard smirked and told me to step through the door in ten minutes i was out of the prison and crunching across the gravel to my rental car i had come four hundred miles for five minutes but those minutes were devastating i think the lowest point of my life and professional career came an hour later when i was on the rentacar train being delivered back to the united terminal no longer concentrating on the driving and making it back in time i had only the case to think about cases actually i leaned down elbows on my knees and my face in my hands my greatest fear had been realized realized for two years but i hadnt known it not until now i had been presented with innocence but i had not seen it or grasped it instead i had thrown it into the maw of the machine like everything else now it was a cold gray innocence as dead as gravel and hidden in a fortress of stone and steel and i had to live with it there was no solace to be found in the alternative the knowledge that had we rolled the dice and gone to trial jesus would likely be on death row right now there could be no comfort in knowing that fate was avoided because i knew as sure as i knew anything else in the world that jesus menendez had been innocent something as rare as a true miraclean innocent manhad come to me and i hadnt recognized it i had turned away bad day i looked up there was a man across from me and a little bit further down the train car we were the only ones on this link he looked to be a decade older and had receding hair that made him look wise maybe he was even a lawyer but i wasnt interested im fine i said just tired and i held up a hand palm out a signal that i did not want conversation i usually travel with a set of earbuds like earl uses i put them in and run the wire into a jacket pocket it connects with nothing but it keeps people from talking to me i had been in too much of a hurry this morning to think about them too much of a hurry to reach this point of desolation the man across the train got the message and said nothing else i went back to my dark thoughts about jesus menendez the bottom line was that i believed that i had one client who was guilty of the murder another client was serving a life sentence for i could not help one without hurting the other i needed an answer i needed a plan i needed proof but for the moment on the train i could only think of jesus menendezs dead eyes because i knew i was the one who had killed the light in them twenty as soon as i got off the shuttle at burbank i turned on my cell i had not come up with a plan but i had come up with my next step and that started with a call to raul levin the phone buzzed in my hand which meant i had messages i decided i would get them after i set levin in motion he answered my call and the first thing he asked was whether i had gotten his message i just got off a plane i said i missed it a plane where were you up north what was the message just an update on corliss if you werent calling about that what were you calling about what are you doing tonight just hanging out i dont like going out on fridays and saturdays its amateur hour too many drunks on the road well i want to meet ive got to talk to somebody bad things are happening levin apparently sensed something in my voice because he immediately changed his stayathomeonfridaynight policy and we agreed to meet at the smoke house over by the warner studios it was not far from where i was and not far from his home at the airport valet window i gave my ticket to a man in a red jacket and checked messages while waiting for the lincoln three messages had come in all during the hour flight down from san francisco the first was from maggie mcpherson michael i just wanted to call and say im sorry about how i was this morning to tell you the truth i was mad at myself for some of the things i said last night and the choices i made i took it out on you and i should not have done that um if you want to take hayley out tomorrow or sunday she would love it and who knows maybe i could come too either way just let me know she didnt call me michael too often even when we were married she was one of those women who could use your last name and turn it into an endearment that is if she wanted to she had always called me haller from the day we met in line to go through a metal detector at the ccb she was headed to orientation at the das office and i was headed to misdemeanor arraignment court to handle a dui i saved the message to listen to again sometime and went on to the next i was expecting it to be from levin but the automated voice reported the call came from a number with a area code the next voice i heard was louis roulets its me louis i was just checking in i was just wondering after yesterday where things stood i also have something i want to tell you i hit the erase button and moved on to the third and last message this was levins hey bossman give me a call i have some stuff on corliss anyway the name is dwayne jeffery corliss thats dwayne with a dw hes a hype and hes done the snitch thing a couple other times here in la whats new right anyway he was actually arrested for stealing a bike he probably planned to trade for a little mexican tar he has parlayed snitching off roulet into a ninetyday lockdown program at countyusc so we wont be able to get to him and talk to him unless you got a judge that will set it up pretty shrewd move by the prosecutor anyway im still running him down something came up on the internet in phoenix that looks pretty good for us if it was the same guy something that blew up in his face i should be able to confirm it by monday so thats it for now give me a call over the weekend im just hanging out i erased the message and closed the phone say no more i said to myself once i heard that corliss was a hype i needed to know nothing else i understood why maggie had not trusted the guy hypesneedle addictswere the most desperate and unreliable people you could come across in the machine given the opportunity they would snitch off their own mothers to get the next injection or into the next methadone program every one of them was a liar and every one of them could easily be shown as such in court i was however puzzled by what the prosecutor was up to the name dwayne corliss was not in the discovery material minton had given me yet the prosecutor was making the moves he would make with a witness he had stuck corliss into a ninetyday program for safekeeping the roulet trial would come and go in that time was he hiding corliss or was he simply putting the snitch on a shelf in the closet so he would know exactly where he was and where hed been in case the time came in trial that his testimony would be needed he was obviously operating under the belief that i didnt know about corliss and if it hadnt been for a slip by maggie mcpherson i wouldnt it was still a dangerous move nevertheless judges do not look kindly on prosecutors who so openly flout the rules of discovery it led me to thinking of a possible strategy for the defense if minton was foolish enough to try to spring corliss in trial i might not even object under the rules of discovery i might let him put the heroin addict on the stand so i would get the chance to shred him in front of the jury like a credit card receipt it would all depend on what levin could come up with i planned to tell him to continue to dig into dwayne jeffery corliss to hold nothing back i also thought about corliss being in a lockdown program at countyusc levin was wrong and so was minton if he was thinking i couldnt reach his witness in lockdown by coincidence my client gloria dayton had been placed in a lockdown program at countyusc after she snitched off her drugdealing client while there were a number of such programs at county it was likely that she shared group therapy sessions or even mealtime with corliss i might not be able to get directly to corliss but as dayton s attorney i could get to her and she in turn could get a message to corliss the lincoln pulled up and i gave the man in the red jacket a couple dollars i exited the airport and drove south on hollywood way toward the center of burbank where all the studios were i got to the smoke house ahead of levin and ordered a martini at the bar on the overhead tv was an update on the start of the college basketball tournament florida had defeated ohio in the first round the headline on the bottom of the screen said march madness and i toasted my glass to it i knew what real march madness was beginning to feel like levin came in and ordered a beer before we sat down to dinner it was still green left over from the night before must have been a slow night maybe everybody had gone to four green fields nothing like hair of the dog that bit ya as long as its green hair he said in that brogue that was getting old he sipped the level of the glass down so he could walk with it and we stepped out to the hostess station so we could go to a table she led us to a red padded booth that was shaped like a u we sat across from each other and i put my briefcase down next to me when the waitress came for a cocktail order we ordered the whole shooting match salads steaks and potatoes i also asked for an order of the restaurants signature garlic cheese bread good thing you dont like going out on weekends i said to levin after she was gone you eat the cheese bread and your breath will probably kill anybody you come in contact with after this ill have to take my chances we were quiet for a long moment after that i could feel the vodka working its way into my guilt i would be sure to order another when the salads came so levin finally said you called the meeting i nodded i want to tell you a story not all of the details are set or known but ill tell it to you in the way i think it goes and then you tell me what you think and what i should do okay i like stories go ahead i dont think youll like this one it starts two years ago with i stopped and waited while the waitress put down our salads and the cheese bread i asked for another vodka martini even though i was only halfway through the one i had i wanted to make sure there was no gap so i said after she was gone this whole thing starts two years ago with jesus menendez you remember him right yeah we mentioned him the other day the dna hes the client you always say is in prison because he wiped his prick on a fluffy pink towel he smiled because it was true that i had often reduced menendezs case to such an absurdly vulgar basis i had often used it to get a laugh when trading war stories at four green fields with other lawyers that was before i knew what i now knew i did not return the smile yeah well it turns out jesus didnt do it what do you mean somebody else wiped his prick on the towel this time levin laughed out loud no you dont get it im telling you jesus menendez was innocent levins face grew serious he nodded putting something together hes in san quentin you were up at the q today i nodded let me back up and tell the story i said you didnt do much work for me on menendez because there was nothing to be done they had the dna his own incriminating statement and three witnesses who saw him throw a knife into the river they never found the knife but they had the witnesseshis own roommates it was a hopeless case truth is i took it on the come line for publicity value so basically all i did was walk him to a plea he didnt like it said he didnt do it but there was no choice the da was going for the death penalty hed have gotten that or life without i got him life with and i made the little fucker take it i made him i looked down at my untouched salad i realized i didnt feel like eating i just felt like drinking and pickling the cork in my brain that contained all the guilt cells levin waited me out he wasnt eating either in case you dont remember the case was about the murder of a woman named martha renteria she was a dancer at the cobra room on east sunset you didnt end up going there on this did you levin shook his head they dont have a stage i said they have like a pit in the center and for each number these guys dressed like aladdin come out carrying this big cobra basket between two bamboo poles they put it down and the music starts then the top comes off the basket and the girl comes up dancing then her top comes off too kind of a new take on the dancer coming out of the cake its hollywood baby levin said you gotta have a show well jesus menendez liked the show he had eleven hundred dollars his brother the drug dealer gave him and he took a fancy to martha renteria maybe because she was the only dancer who was shorter than him maybe because she spoke spanish to him after her set they sat and talked and then she circulated a little bit and came back and pretty soon he knew he was in competition with another guy in the club he trumped the other guy by offering her five hundred if shed take him home but he didnt kill her when he got there uhuh he followed her car in his got there had sex flushed the condom wiped his prick on the towel and then he went home the story starts after he left the real killer the real killer knocks on the door maybe fakes like its jesus and that hes forgotten something she opens the door or maybe it was an appointment she was expecting the knock and she opens the door the guy from the club the one menendez was bidding against i nodded exactly he comes in punches her a few times to soften her up and then takes out his folding knife and holds it against her neck while he walks her to the bedroom sound familiar only she isnt lucky like reggie campo would be in a couple years he puts her on the bed puts on a condom and climbs on top now the knife is on the other side of her neck and he keeps it there while he rapes her and when hes done he kills her he stabs her with that knife again and again its a case of overkill if there ever was one hes working out something in his sick fucking mind while hes doing it my second martini came and i took it right from the waitresss hand and gulped half of it down she asked if we were finished with our salads and we both waved them away untouched your steaks will be right out she said or do you want me to just dump them in the garbage and save you the time i looked up at her she was smiling but i was so caught up in the story i was telling that i had missed what it was she had said never mind she said theyll be right out i got right back to the story levin said nothing after shes dead the killer cleans up he takes his time because whats the hurry shes not going anywhere or calling anybody he wipes the place down to take care of any fingerprints he might have left and in the process he wipes away menendezs prints this will look bad for menendez when he later goes to the police to explain that he is the guy in the sketches but he didnt kill martha theyll look at him and say then whyd you wear gloves when you were there levin shook his head oh man if this is true dont worry its true menendez gets a lawyer who once did a good job for his brother but this lawyer wouldnt know an innocent man if he kicked him in the nuts this lawyer is all about the deal he never even asks the kid if he did it he just assumes he did it because they got his fucking dna on the towel and the witnesses who saw him toss the knife the lawyer goes to work and gets the best possible deal he could get he actually feels pretty good about it because hes going to keep menendez off death row and get him a shot at parole someday so he goes to menendez and brings down the hammer he makes him take the deal and stand up there in court and say guilty jesus then goes off to prison and everybodys happy the states happy because it saves money on a trial and martha renterias family is happy because they dont have to face a trial with all those autopsy photos and stories about their daughter dancing naked and taking men home for money and the lawyers happy because he got on tv with the case at least six times plus he kept another client off death row i gulped down the rest of the martini and looked around for our waitress i wanted another jesus menendez goes off to prison a young man i just saw him and hes twentysix going on forty hes a small guy you know what happens to the little ones up there i was looking straight down at the empty space on the table in front of me when an eggshaped platter with a sizzling steak and steaming potato was put down i looked up at the waitress and told her to bring me another martini i didnt say please you better take it easy levin said after she was gone there probably isnt a cop in this county who wouldnt love to pull you over on a deuce take you back to lockup and put the flashlight up your ass i know i know it will be my last and if its too much i wont drive they always have a cab out front of this place deciding that food might help i cut into my steak and ate a piece i then took a piece of cheese bread out of the napkin it was folded into a basket with but it was no longer warm i dropped it on my plate and put my fork down look i know youre beating yourself up over this but you are forgetting something levin said yeah whats that his exposure he was facing the needle man and the case was a dog i didnt work it for you because there was nothing to work they had him and you saved him from the needle thats your job and you did it well so now you think you know what really went down you cant beat yourself up for what you didnt know then i held my hand up in a stop there gesture the guy was innocent i shouldve seen it i shouldve done something about it instead i just did my usual thing and went through the motions with my eyes closed bullshit no no bullshit okay go back to the story who was the second guy who came to her door i opened my briefcase next to me and reached into it i went up to san quentin today and showed menendez a sixpack all mug shots of my clients mostly former clients menendez picked one out in less than ten seconds i tossed the mug shot of louis roulet across the table it landed facedown levin picked it up and looked at it for a few moments then put it back facedown on the table let me show you something else i said my hand went back into the briefcase and pulled out the two folded photographs of martha renteria and reggie campo i looked around to make sure the waitress wasnt about to deliver my martini and then handed them across the table its like a puzzle i said put them together and see what you get levin put the one face together from the two and nodded as he understood the significance the killerrouletzeroed in on women that fit a model or profile he desired i next showed him the weapon sketch drawn by the medical examiner on the renteria autopsy and read him the description of the two coercive wounds found on her neck you know that video you got from the bar i asked what it shows is a killer at work just like you he saw that mr x was lefthanded when he attacked reggie campo he punched with his left and then held the knife with his left this guy knows what he is doing he saw an opportunity and took it reggie campo is the luckiest woman alive you think there are others other murders i mean maybe thats what i want you to look into check out all the knife murders of women in the last few years then get the victims pictures and see if they match the physical profile and dont look at unsolved cases only martha renteria was supposedly among the closed cases levin leaned forward look man im not going to throw a net over this like the police can you have to bring the cops in on this or go to the fbi they got their serial killer specialists i shook my head cant hes my client menendez is your client too and you have to get him out im working on that and thats why i need you to do this for me mish we both knew that i called him mish whenever i needed something that crossed the lines of our professional relationship into the friendship that was underneath it what about a hitman levin said that would solve our problems i nodded knowing he was being facetious yeah that would work i said it would make the world a better place too but it probably wouldnt spring menendez levin leaned forward again now he was serious ill do what i can mick but i dont think this is the right way to go you can declare conflict of interest and dump roulet then work on jumping menendez out of the q jump him out with what the id he made on the sixpack that was solid he didnt know roulet from a hole in the ground and he goes and picks him out of the pack who is going to believe that im his lawyer nobody from the cops to the clemency board is going to believe i didnt set that up this is all theory raul you know it and i know it to be true but we cant prove a damn thing what about the wounds they could match the knife they got from the campo case to martha renterias wounds i shook my head she was cremated all they have is the descriptions and photos from the autopsy and it wouldnt be conclusive its not enough besides i cant be seen as the guy pushing this on my own client if i turn against a client then i turn against all my clients it cant look that way or ill lose them all i have to figure something else out i think youre wrong i think for now i go along as if i dont know any of this you understand but you look into it all of it keep it separate from roulet so i dont have a discovery issue file it all under jesus menendez and bill the time to me on that case you understand before levin could answer the waitress brought my third martini i waved it away i dont want it just the check well i cant pour it back into the bottle she said dont worry ill pay for it i just dont want to drink it give it to the guy who makes the cheese bread and just bring me the check she turned and walked away probably annoyed that i hadnt offered the drink to her i looked back at levin he looked like he was pained by everything that had been revealed to him i knew just how he felt some franchise i got huh yeah how are you going to be able to act straight with this guy when you have to deal with him and meantime youre digging out this other shit on the side with roulet i plan to see him as little as possible only when its necessary he left me a message today has something to tell me but im not calling back why did he pick you i mean why would he pick the one lawyer who might put this thing together i shook my head i dont know i thought about it the whole plane ride down i think maybe he was worried i might hear about the case and put it together anyway but if he was my client then he knew id be ethically bound to protect him at least at first plus theres the money what money the money from mother the franchise he knows how big a payday this is for me my biggest ever maybe he thought id look the other way to keep the money coming in levin nodded maybe i should huh i said it was a vodkaspurred attempt at humor but levin didnt smile and then i remembered jesus menendezs face behind the prison plexiglas and i couldnt even bring myself to smile listen theres one other thing i need you to do i said i want you to look at him too roulet find out all you can without getting too close and check out that story about the mother about her getting raped in a house she was selling in belair levin nodded im on it and dont farm it out this was a running joke between us like me levin was a oneman shop he had no one to farm it out to i wont ill handle it myself it was his usual response but this time it lacked the false sincerity and humor he usually gave it hed answered by habit the waitress moved by the table and put our check down without a thank you i dropped a credit card on it without even looking at the damage i just wanted to leave you want her to wrap up your steak i asked thats okay levin said ive kind of lost my appetite for right now what about that attack dog youve got at home thats an idea i forgot about bruno he looked around for the waitress to ask for a box take mine too i said i dont have a dog twentyone despite the vodka glaze i made it through the slalom that was laurel canyon without cracking up the lincoln or getting pulled over by a cop my house is on fareholm drive which terraces up off the southern mouth of the canyon all the houses are built to the street line and the only problem i had coming home was when i found that some moron had parked his suv in front of my garage and i couldnt get in parking on the narrow street is always difficult and the opening in front of my garage door was usually just too inviting especially on a weekend night when invariably someone on the street was throwing a party i motored by the house and found a space big enough for the lincoln about a block and a half away the further i had gotten from my house the angrier i had gotten with the suv the fantasy grew from spitting on the windshield to breaking off the side mirror flattening the tires and kicking in the side panels but instead i wrote a sedate little note on a page of yellow legal paper this is not a parking space next time you will be towed after all you never know whos driving an suv in la and if you threaten someone for parking in front of your garage then they know where you live i walked back and was placing the note under the violators windshield wiper when i noticed the suv was a range rover i put my hand on the hood and it was cool to the touch i looked up above the garage to the windows of my house that i could see but they were dark i slapped the folded note under the windshield wiper and started up the stairs to the front deck and door i half expected louis roulet to be sitting in one of the tall director chairs taking in the twinkling view of the city but he was not there instead i walked to the corner of the porch and looked out on the city it was this view that had made me buy the place everything about the house once you went through the door was ordinary and outdated but the front porch and the view right above hollywood boulevard could launch a million dreams i had used money from the last franchise case for a down payment but once i was in and there wasnt another franchise i took the equity out in a second mortgage the truth was i struggled every month just to pay the nut i needed to get out from under it but that view off the front deck paralyzed me id probably be staring out at the city when they came to take the key and foreclose on the place i know the question my house prompts even with my struggles to stay afloat with it how fair is it that when a prosecutor and defense attorney divorce the defense attorney gets the house on the hill with a milliondollar view while the prosecutor with the daughter gets the twobedroom apartment in the valley the answer is that maggie mcpherson could buy a house of her choosing and i would help her to my maximum ability but she had refused to move while she waited to be tapped for a promotion to the downtown office buying a house in sherman oaks or anywhere else would send the wrong message one of sedentary contentment she was not content to be maggie mcfierce of the van nuys division she was not content to be passed over by john smithson or any of his young guns she was ambitious and wanted to get downtown where supposedly the best and brightest prosecuted the most important crimes she refused to accept the simple truism that the better you were the bigger threat you were to those at the top especially if they are elected i knew that maggie would never be invited downtown she was too damn good every now and then this realization would seep through and she would lash out in unexpected ways she would make a cutting remark at a press conference or she would refuse to cooperate with a downtown investigation or she would drunkenly reveal to a criminal defense attorney and exhusband something about a case he shouldnt be told the phone started to ring from inside the house i moved to the front door and fumbled with my keys to unlock it and get inside in time my phone numbers and who has them could form a pyramid chart the number in the yellow pages everybody has or could have next up the pyramid is my cell phone which has been disseminated to key colleagues investigators bondsmen clients and other cogs in the machine my home phonethe land linewas the top of the pyramid very few had the number no clients and no other lawyers except for one i got in and grabbed the phone off the kitchen wall before it went to message the caller was that one other lawyer with the number maggie mcpherson did you get my messages i got the one on my cell whats wrong nothings wrong i left one on this number a lot earlier oh ive been gone all day i just got in where have you been well ive been up to san francisco and back and i just got in from having dinner with raul levin is all of that all right with you im just curious what was in san francisco a client so what you really mean is you were up to san quentin and back you were always too smart for me maggie i can never fool you is there a reason for this call i just wanted to see if you got my apology and i also wanted to find out if you were going to do something with hayley tomorrow yes and yes but maggie no apology is necessary and you should know that i am sorry for the way i acted before i left and if my daughter wants to be with me tomorrow then i want to be with her tell her we can go down to the pier or to a movie if she wants whatever she wants well she actually wants to go to the mall she said it as if she were stepping on glass the mall the mall is fine ill take her whats wrong with the mall is there something in particular she wants i suddenly noticed a foreign odor in the house the smell of smoke while standing in the middle of the kitchen i checked the oven and the stove they were off i was tethered to the kitchen because the phone wasnt cordless i stretched it to the door and flicked on the light to the dining room it was empty and its light was cast into the next room the living room through which i had passed when i had entered it looked empty as well they have a place there where you make your own teddy bear and you pick the style and its voice box and you put a little heart in with the stuffing its all very cute i now wanted to get off the line and explore further into my house fine ill take her what time is good i was thinking about noon maybe we could have lunch first we would that bother you no maggie not at all how about i come by at noon great see you then i hung the phone up before she could say goodbye i owned a gun but it was a collector piece that hadnt been fired in my lifetime and was stored in a box in my bedroom closet at the rear of the house so i quietly opened a kitchen drawer and took out a short but sharp steak knife i then walked through the living room toward the hallway that led to the rear of the house there were three doorways in the hall they led to my bedroom a bathroom and another bedroom i had turned into a home office the only real office i had the desk light was on in the office it was not visible from the angle i had in the hallway but i could tell it was on i had not been home in two days but i did not remember leaving it on i approached the open door to the room slowly aware that this is what i may have been meant to do focus on the light in one room while the intruder is waiting in the darkness of the bedroom or bathroom come on back mick its just me i knew the voice but it didnt make me feel at ease louis roulet was waiting in the room i stepped to the threshold and stopped he was sitting in the black leather desk seat he swiveled it around so that he was facing me and crossed his legs his pants rode up on his left leg and i could see the tracking bracelet that fernando valenzuela had made him wear i knew that if roulet had come to kill me at least he would leave a trail it wasnt all that comforting though i leaned against the door frame so that i could hold the knife behind my hip without being too obvious about it so this is where you do your great legal work roulet asked some of it what are you doing here louis i came to see you you didnt return my call and so i wanted to make sure we were still a team you know i was out of town i just got back what about dinner with raul isnt that what you said to your caller hes a friend i had dinner on my way in from burbank airport how did you find out where i live louis he cleared his throat and smiled i work in real estate mick i can find out where anybody lives in fact i used to be a source for the national enquirer did you know that i could tell them where any celebrity lived no matter what fronts and corporations they hid their purchases behind but i gave it up after a while the money was good but it was so tawdry you know what i mean mick anyway i stopped but i can still find out where anyone lives i can also find out whether theyve maxed the mortgage value out and even if theyre making their payments on time he looked at me with a knowing smile he was telling me he knew the house was a financial shell that i had nothing in the place and usually ran a month behind on the two mortgages fernando valenzuela probably wouldnt even accept the place as collateral on a fivethousanddollar bond howd you get in i asked well thats the funny thing about this it turns out i had a key back when this place was for salewhat was that about eighteen months ago anyway i wanted to see it because i thought i had a client who might be interested because of the view so i came and got the key out of the realtors combo box i came in and looked around and knew immediately it wasnt right for my clienthe wanted something nicerso i left and i forgot to put the key back i have a bad habit of doing that isnt that strange that all this time later my lawyer would be living in this house and by the way i see you havent done a thing with it you have the view of course but you really need to do some updating i knew then that he had been keeping tabs on me since the menendez case and that he probably knew i had just been up to san quentin visiting him i thought about the man on the carrental train bad day i had later seen him on the shuttle to burbank had he been following me was he working for roulet was he the investigator cecil dobbs had tried to push onto the case i didnt know all the answers but i knew that the only reason roulet would be in my house waiting for me was because he knew what i knew what do you really want louis are you trying to scare me no no im the one who should be scared i assume you have a weapon of some sort behind your back there what is it a gun i gripped the knife tighter but did not display it what is it you want i repeated i want to make you an offer not on the house on your services you already have my services he swiveled back and forth in the chair before responding my eyes scanned the desk checking if anything was missing i noticed he had used a little pottery dish my daughter had made for me as an ashtray it was supposed to be for paperclips i was thinking about our fee arrangement and the difficulties the case presents he said frankly mick i think you are underpaid so i want to set up a new fee schedule you will be paid the amount already agreed upon and you will be paid in full before the trial begins but i am now going to add a performance bonus when i am found by a jury of my peers to be not guilty of this ugly crime your fee automatically doubles i will write the check in your lincoln as we drive away from the courthouse thats nice louis but the california bar refuses to allow defense attorneys to accept bonuses based on results i couldnt accept it its more than generous but i cant but the california bar isnt here mick and we dont have to treat it as a performance bonus its just part of the fee schedule because after all you will be successful in defending me wont you he looked intently at me and i read the threat there are no guarantees in the courtroom things can always go badly but i still think it looks good roulets face slowly broke into a smile what can i do to make it look even better i thought about reggie campo still alive and ready to go to trial she had no idea whom she would be testifying against nothing i answered just sit tight and wait it out dont get any ideas dont do anything the case is coming together and well be all right he didnt respond i wanted to get him away from thoughts about the threat reggie campo presented there is one thing that has come up though i said really whats that i dont have the details what i know i only know from a source who cant tell me any more but it looks like the da has a snitch from the jail you didnt talk to anybody about the case when you were in there did you remember i told you not to talk to anybody and i didnt whoever they have he is a liar most of them are i just wanted to be sure ill deal with it if it comes up good one other thing have you talked to your mother about testifying about the attack in the empty house we need it to set up the defense of you carrying the knife roulet pursed his lips but didnt answer i need you to work on her i said it could be very important to establish that solidly with the jury besides that it could swing sympathy toward you roulet nodded he saw the light can you please ask her i asked i will but shell be tough she never reported it she never told anyone but cecil we need her to testify and then we can get cecil to testify and back her up its not as good as a police report but it will work we need her louis i think if she testifies she can convince them juries like old ladies okay did she ever tell you what the guy looked like or how old he was anything like that he shook his head she couldnt tell he wore a ski mask and goggles he jumped on her as soon as she came in the door he had been hiding behind it it was very quick and very brutal his voice quavered as he described it i became puzzled i thought you said the attacker was a prospective buyer she was supposed to meet there i said he was already in the house he brought his eyes up to mine yes somehow he had already gotten in and was waiting for her it was terrible i nodded i didnt want to go further with him at the moment i wanted him out of my house listen thank you for your offer louis now if you would excuse me i want to go to bed its been a long day i gestured with my free hand toward the hallway leading to the front of the house roulet got up from the desk chair and came toward me i backed into the hallway and then into the open door of my bedroom i kept the knife behind me and ready but roulet passed by without incident and tomorrow you have your daughter to entertain he said that froze me he had listened to the call from maggie i didnt say anything he did i didnt know you had a daughter mick that must be nice he glanced back at me smiling as he moved down the hall shes beautiful he said my inertia turned to momentum i stepped into the hall and started following him anger building with each step i gripped the knife tightly how do you know what she looks like i demanded he stopped and i stopped he looked down at the knife in my hand and then at my face he spoke calmly the picture of her on your desk i had forgotten about the photo a small framed shot of her in a teacup at disneyland oh i said he smiled knowing what i had been thinking good night mick enjoy your daughter tomorrow you probably dont get to see her enough he turned and crossed the living room and opened the front door he looked back at me before stepping out what you need is a good lawyer he said one that will get you custody no shes better off with her mother good night mick thanks for the conversation good night louis i stepped forward to close the door nice view he said from out on the front porch yeah i said as i closed and locked the door i stood there with my hand on the knob waiting to hear his steps going down the stairs to the street but a few moments later he knocked on the door i closed my eyes held the knife at the ready and opened it roulet raised his hand out i took a step back your key he said i figured you should have it i took the key off his outstretched palm thanks dont mention it i closed the door and locked it once again tuesday april twentytwo the day started better than any defense attorney could ask for i had no courtroom to be in no client to meet i slept late spent the morning reading the newspaper cover to cover and had a box ticket to the home opener of the los angeles dodgers baseball season it was a day game and a timehonored tradition among those on the defense side of the aisle to attend my ticket had come from raul levin who was taking five of the defense pros he did work for to the game as a gesture of thanks for their business i was sure the others would grumble and complain at the game about how i was monopolizing levin as i prepared for the roulet trial but i wasnt going to let it bother me we were in the outwardly slow time before trial when the machine moves with a steady quiet momentum louis roulets trial was set to begin in a month as it was growing nearer i was taking on fewer and fewer clients i needed the time to prepare and strategize though the trial was weeks away it would likely be won or lost with the information gathered now i needed to keep my schedule clear for this i took cases from repeat customers onlyand only if the money was right and it came up front a trial was a slingshot the key was in the preparation pretrial is when the sling is loaded with the proper stone and slowly the elastic is pulled back and stretched to its limit finally at trial you let it go and the projectile shoots forward unerringly at the target the target is acquittal not guilty you only hit that target if you have properly chosen the stone and pulled back carefully on the sling stretching it as far as possible levin was doing most of the stretching he had continued to dig into the lives of the players in both the roulet and menendez cases we had hatched a strategy and plan we were calling a double slingshot because it had two intended targets i had no doubt that when the trial began in may we would be stretched back to the limit and ready to let go the prosecution did its part to help us load the slingshot as well in the weeks since roulets arraignment the states discovery file grew thicker as scientific reports filtered in further police investigations were carried out and new developments occurred among the new developments of note was the identification of mr x the lefthanded man who had been with reggie campo at morgans the night of the attack lapd detectives using the video i had alerted the prosecution to were able to identify him by showing a frame taken off the video to known prostitutes and escorts when they were arrested by the administrative vice section mr x was identified as charles talbot he was known to many of the sex providers as a regular some said that he owned or worked at a convenience store on reseda boulevard the investigative reports forwarded to me through discovery requests revealed that detectives interviewed talbot and learned that on the night of march he left reggie campos apartment shortly before ten and went to the previously mentioned twentyfourhour convenience store talbot owned the business he went to the store so that he could check on things and open a cigarette storage cabinet that only he carried the key for tape from surveillance cameras in the store confirmed that he was there from to pm restocking the cigarette bins beneath the front counter the investigators summary dismissed talbot as having no bearing or part in the events that occurred after he left campos apartment he was just one of her customers nowhere in the states discovery was there mention of dwayne jeffery corliss the jailhouse snitch who had contacted the prosecution with a tale to tell about louis roulet minton had either decided not to use him as a witness or was keeping him under wraps for emergency use only i tended to think it was the latter minton had sequestered him in the lockdown program he wouldnt have gone to the trouble unless he wanted to keep corliss offstage but ready this was fine with me what minton didnt know was that corliss was the stone i was going to put into the slingshot and while the states discovery contained little information on the victim of the crime raul levin was vigorously pursuing reggie campo he located a website called pinkminkcom on which she advertised her services what was important about the discovery was not necessarily that it further established that she was engaged in prostitution but that the ad copy stated that she was very openminded and liked to get wild and was available for s ampm role playyou spank me or ill spank you it was good ammunition to have it was the kind of stuff that could help color a victim or witness in a jurys eyes and she was both levin also was digging deeper into the life and times of louis roulet and had learned that he had been a poor student whod attended five different private schools in and around beverly hills as a youth he did go on to attend and graduate from ucla with a degree in english literature but levin located fellow classmates who had said roulet paid his way through by purchasing from other students completed class assignments test answers and even a ninetypage senior thesis on the life and work of john fante a far darker profile emerged of roulet as an adult levin found numerous female acquaintances who said roulet had mistreated them either physically or mentally or both two women who had known roulet while they were students at ucla told levin that they suspected that roulet had spiked their drinks at a fraternity party with a daterape drug and then took sexual advantage of them neither reported their suspicions to authorities but one woman had her blood tested the day after the party she said traces of ketamine hydrochloride a veterinary sedative were found luckily for the defense neither woman had so far been located by investigators for the prosecution levin took a look at the socalled real estate rapist cases of five years before as well four womenall realtorsreported being overpowered and raped by a man who was waiting inside when they entered homes they believed had been vacated by their owners for a showing the attacks went unsolved but stopped eleven months after the first one was reported levin spoke to an lapd sex crimes expert who worked the cases he said that his gut instinct had always been that the rapist wasnt an outsider the assailant seemed to know how to get into the houses and how to draw the female sales agents to them alone the investigator was convinced the rapist was in the real estate community but with no arrest ever made he never proved his theory added to this branch of his investigation levin could find little to confirm that mary alice windsor had been one of the unreported victims of the rapist she had granted us an interview and agreed to testify about her secret tragedy but only if her testimony was vitally needed the date of the attack she provided fell within the dates of the documented assaults attributed to the real estate rapist and windsor provided an appointment book and other documentation showing she was indeed the realtor on record in regard to the sale of the belair home where she said she was attacked but ultimately we only had her word for it there were no medical or hospital records indicative of treatment for a sexual assault and no police record still when mary windsor recounted her story it matched roulets telling of it in almost all details afterward it had struck both levin and me as odd that louis had known so much about the attack if his mother had decided to keep it secret and unreported then why would she share so many details of her harrowing ordeal with her son that question led levin to postulate a theory that was as repulsive as it was intriguing i think he knows all the details because he was there levin had said after the interview and we were by ourselves you mean he watched it without doing anything to stop it no i mean i think he was the man in the ski mask and goggles i was silent i think on a subliminal level i may have been thinking the same thing but the idea was too creepy to have broken through to the surface oh man i said levin thinking i was disagreeing pressed his case forward this is a very strong woman he said she built that company from nothing and real estate in this town is cutthroat shes a tough lady and i cant see her not reporting this not wanting the guy who did it to be caught i view people two ways theyre either eyeforaneye people or they are turnthecheek people shes definitely an eyeforaneye person and i cant see her keeping it quiet unless she was protecting that guy unless that guy was our guy im telling you man roulet is evil i dont know where it comes from or how he got it but the more i look at him the more i see the devil all of this backgrounding was completely sub rosa it obviously was not the kind of background that would in any way be brought forward as a means of defense it had to be hidden from discovery so little of what levin or i found was put down on paper but it was still information that i had to know as i made my decisions and set up the trial and the play within it at my home phone rang as i was standing in front of a mirror and fitting a dodgers cap onto my head i checked the caller id before answering and saw that it was lorna taylor why is your cell phone off she asked because im off i told you no calls today im going to the ballgame with mish and im supposed to get going to meet him early whos mish i mean raul why are you bothering me i said it goodnaturedly because i think you are going to want to be bothered with this the mail came in a little early today and with it you got a notice from the second the second district court of appeal reviewed all cases emanating from la county they were the first appellate hurdle on the way to the supreme court but i didnt think lorna would be calling me to tell me i had lost an appeal which case at any given time i usually have four or five cases on appeal to the second one of your road saints harold casey you won i was shocked not at winning but at the timing i had tried to move quickly with the appeal i had written the brief before the verdict had come in and paid extra for expedited daily transcripts from the trial i filed the notice of appeal the day after the verdict and asked for an expedited review even still i wasnt expecting to hear anything on casey for another two months i asked lorna to read the opinion and a smile widened on my face the summary was literally a rewrite of my brief the threejudge panel had agreed with me right down the line on my contention that the low flyover of the sheriffs surveillance helicopter above caseys ranch constituted an invasion of privacy the court overturned caseys conviction saying that the search that led to the discovery of the hydroponic pot farm was illegal the state would now have to decide whether to retry casey and realistically a retrial was out of the question the state would have no evidence since the appeals court ruled everything garnered during the search of the ranch was inadmissible the seconds ruling was clearly a victory for the defense and they dont come that often man what a day for the underdog where is he anyway lorna asked he may still be at the reception center but they were moving him to corcoran heres what you do make about ten copies of the ruling and put them in an envelope and send it to casey at corcoran you should have the address well wont they be letting him go not yet his parole was violated after his arrest and the appeal doesnt affect that he wont get out until he goes to the parole board and argues fruit of the poisonous tree that he got violated because of an illegal search it will probably take about six weeks for all that to work itself out six weeks thats unbelievable dont do the crime if you cant do the time i sang it like sammy davis did on that old television show please dont sing to me mick sorry why are we sending ten copies to him isnt one enough because hell keep one for himself and spread the other nine around the prison and then your phone will start ringing an attorney who can win on appeal is like gold in prison theyll come calling and youre going to have to weed em out and find the ones who have family and can pay you always have an angle dont you i try to anything else happening just the usual the calls you told me you didnt want to hear about did you get in to see glory days yesterday at county its gloria dayton and yes i got in to see her she looks like shes over the hump shes still got more than a month to go the truth was gloria dayton looked better than over the hump i hadnt seen her so sharp and brighteyed in years id had a purpose for going down to countyusc medical center to talk to her but seeing her on the downhill side of recovery was a nice bonus as expected lorna was the doomsayer and how long will it last this time before she calls your number again and says im in jail i need mickey she said the last part with a whiny nasal impression of gloria dayton it was quite accurate but it annoyed me anyway then she topped it with a little song to the tune of the disney classic mic see you real soon key why because you never charge me mouth mickey mouth mickey mouth the lawyer every please dont sing to me lorna she laughed into the phone im just making a point i was smiling but trying to keep it out of my voice fine i get it i have to get going now well have a great time mickey mouth you could sing that song all day and the dodgers could lose twentyzip to the giants and id still have a great time after hearing the news from you what could go wrong after ending the call i went into my home office and got a cell number for teddy vogel the outside leader of the saints i gave him the good news and suggested that he could probably pass it on to hard case faster than i could there are road saints in every prison they have a communication system the cia and fbi might be able to learn something from vogel said hed handle it then he said the ten grand he gave me the month before on the side of the road near vasquez rocks was a worthy investment i appreciate that ted i said keep me in mind next time you need an attorney will do counselor he clicked off and i clicked off i then grabbed my first basemans glove out of the hallway closet and headed out the front door having given earl the day off with pay i drove myself toward downtown and dodger stadium traffic was light until i got close the home opener is always a sellout even though it is a day game on a weekday the start of baseball season is a rite of spring that draws downtown workers by the thousands its the only sporting event in laidback la where you see men all in stiff white shirts and ties theyre all playing hooky there is nothing like the start of a season before all the onerun losses pitching breakdowns and missed opportunities before reality sets in i was the first one to the seats we were three rows from the field in seats added to the stadium during the offseason levin must have busted a nut buying the tickets from one of the local brokers at least it was probably deductible as a business entertainment expense the plan was for levin to get there early as well he had called the night before and said he wanted some private time with me besides watching batting practice and checking out all the improvements the new owner had made to the stadium we would discuss my visit with gloria dayton and raul would give me the latest update on his various investigations relating to louis roulet but levin never made it for bp the other four lawyers showed upthree of them in ties having come from courtand we missed our chance to talk privately i knew the other four from some of the boat cases we had tried together in fact the tradition of defense pros taking in dodgers games together started with the boat cases under a wideranging mandate to stop drug flow to the united states the us coast guard had taken to stopping suspect vessels anywhere on the oceans when they struck goldor that is cocainethey seized the vessels and crews many of the prosecutions were funneled to the us district court in los angeles this resulted in prosecutions of sometimes twelve or more defendants at a time every defendant got his own lawyer most of them appointed by the court and paid by uncle sugar the cases were lucrative and steady and we had fun somebody had the idea of having case meetings at dodger stadium one time we all pitched in and bought a private suite for a cubs game we actually did talk about the case for a few minutes during the seventhinning stretch the pregame ceremonies started and there was no sign of levin hundreds of doves were released from baskets on the field and they formed up circled the stadium to loud cheering and then flew up and away shortly after a b stealth bomber buzzed the stadium to even louder applause that was la something for everyone and a little irony to boot the game started and still no levin i turned my cell phone on and tried to call him even though it was hard to hear the crowd was loud and boisterous hopeful of a season that would not end in disappointment again the call went to a message mish where you at man were at the game and the seats are fantastic but we got one empty one were waiting on you i closed the phone looked at the others and shrugged i dont know i said he didnt answer his cell i left my phone on and put it back on my belt before the first inning was over i was regretting what i had said to lorna about not caring if the giants drilled us zip they built a lead before the dodgers even got their first bats of the season and the crowd grew frustrated early i heard people complaining about the prices the renovation and the overcommercialization of the stadium one of the lawyers roger mills surveyed the surfaces of the stadium and remarked that the place was more crowded with corporate logos than a nascar race car the dodgers were able to bite into the lead but in the fourth inning the wheels came off and the giants chased jeff weaver with a threerun shot over the centerfield wall i used the downtime during the pitching change to brag about how fast i had heard from the second on the casey case the other lawyers were impressed though one of them dan daly suggested that i had only received the quick appellate review because the three judges were on my christmas list i remarked to daly that he had apparently missed the bar memo regarding juries distrust of lawyers with ponytails his went halfway down his back it was also during this lull in the game that i heard my phone ringing i grabbed it off my hip and flipped it open without looking at the screen raul no sir this is detective lankford with the glendale police department is this michael haller yes i said do you have a moment i have a moment but i am not sure how well ill be able to hear you im at the dodgers game can this wait until i can call you back no sir it cant do you know a man named raul aaron levin hes a yes i know him whats wrong im afraid mr levin is dead sir hes been the victim of a homicide in his home my head dropped so low and so forward that i banged it into the back of the man seated in front of me i then pulled back and held one hand to one ear and pressed the phone against the other i blanked out everything around me what happened we dont know lankford said thats why we are here it looks like he was working for you recently is there any chance you could come here to possibly answer some questions and assist us i blew out my breath and tried to keep my voice calm and modulated im on my way i said twentythree raul levins body was in the back room of his bungalow a few blocks off of brand boulevard the room had likely been designed as a sunroom or maybe a tv room but raul had turned it into his home office like me hed had no need for a commercial space his was not a walkin business he wasnt even in the yellow pages he worked for attorneys and got jobs by word of mouth the five lawyers that were to join him at the baseball game were testimony to his skill and success the uniformed cops who had been told to expect me made me wait in the front living room until the detectives could come from the back and talk to me a uniformed officer stood by in the hallway in case i decided to make a mad dash for the back room or the front door he was in position to handle it either way i sat there waiting and thinking about my friend i had decided on the drive from the stadium that i knew who had killed raul levin i didnt need to be led to the back room to see or hear the evidence to know who the killer was deep down i knew that raul had gotten too close to louis roulet and i was the one who had sent him the only question left for me was what was i going to do about it after twenty minutes two detectives came from the back of the house and into the living room i stood up and we talked while standing the man identified himself as lankford the detective who had called me he was older the veteran his partner was a woman named sobel she didnt look like she had been investigating homicides for very long we didnt shake hands they were wearing rubber gloves they also had paper booties over their shoes lankford was chewing gum okay this is what weve got he said gruffly levin was in his office sitting in his desk chair the chair was turned from the desk so he was facing the intruder he was shot one time in the chest something small looks like a twentytwo to me but well wait on the coroner for that lankford tapped his chest dead center i could hear the hard sound of a bulletproof vest beneath his shirt i corrected him he had pronounced the name here and on the phone earlier as levine i said the name rhymed with heaven levin then he said getting it right anyway after the shot he tried to get up or just fell forward to the floor he expired facedown on the floor the intruder ransacked the office and we are currently at a loss to determine what he was looking for or what he might have taken who found him i asked a neighbor who found his dog running loose the intruder must have let the dog out before or after the killing the neighbor found it wandering around recognized it and brought it back she found the front door open came in and found the body it didnt look like much of a watchdog you ask me its one of those little hair balls a shih tzu i said i had seen the dog before and heard levin talk about it but i couldnt remember its name it was something like rex or broncoa name that belied the dogs small stature sobel referred to a notebook she was holding before continuing the questioning we havent found anything that can lead us to next of kin she said do you know if he had any family i think his mother lives back east he was born in detroit maybe shes there i dont think they had much of a relationship she nodded we have found his time and hours calendar hes got your name on almost every day for the last month was he working on a specific case for you i nodded a couple different cases one mostly do you care to tell us about it she asked i have a case about to go to trial next month its an attempted rape and murder he was running down the evidence and helping me to get ready you mean helping you try to backdoor the investigation huh lankford said i realized then that lankfords politeness on the phone was merely sweet talk to get me to come to the house he would be different now he even seemed to be chewing his gum more aggressively than when he had first entered the room whatever you want to call it detective everybody is entitled to a defense yeah sure and theyre all innocent only its their parents fault for taking them off the tit too soon lankford said whatever this guy levin was a cop before right he was back to mispronouncing the name yes he was lapd he was a detective on a crimes against persons squad but he retired after twelve years on the force i think it was twelve years youll have to check and its levin right as in heaven i guess he couldnt hack working for the good guys huh depends on how you look at it i guess can we get back to your case sobel asked what is the name of the defendant louis ross roulet the trials in van nuys superior before judge fullbright is he in custody no hes out on a bond any animosity between roulet and mr levin not that i know of i had decided i was going to deal with roulet in the way i knew how i was sticking with the plan i had concoctedwith the help of raul levin drop a depth charge into the case and make sure to get clear i felt i owed it to my friend mish he would have wanted it this way i wouldnt farm it out i would handle it personally could this have been a gay thing lankford asked what why do you say that prissy dog and then all around the house hes only got pictures of guys and the dog everywhere on the walls next to the bed on the piano look closely detective it is probably one guy his partner died a few years ago i dont think hes been with anybody since then died of aids i bet i didnt confirm that for him i just waited on the one hand i was annoyed with lankfords manner on the other hand i figured that his torchtheground method of investigation would preclude him from being able to tag roulet with this that was fine with me i only needed to stall him for five or six weeks and then i wouldnt care if they put it together or not id be finished with my own play by then did this guy go out patrolling the gay joints lankford asked i shrugged i have no idea but if it was a gay murder why was his office ransacked and not the rest of the house lankford nodded he seemed to be momentarily taken aback by the logic of my question but then he hit me with a surprise punch so where were you this morning counselor what its just routine the scene indicates the victim knew his killer he let the shooter right into the back room as i said before he was probably sitting in his desk chair when he took the bullet looks to me like he was quite comfortable with his killer we are going to have to clear all acquaintances professional and social are you saying im a suspect in this no im just trying to clear things up and tighten the focus i was home all morning i was getting ready to meet raul at dodger stadium i left for the stadium about twelve and thats where i was when you called what about before that like i said i was home i was alone but i got a phone call about eleven that will put me in my house and im at least a half hour from here if he was killed after eleven then im clear lankford didnt rise to the bait he didnt give me the time of death maybe it was unknown at the moment when was the last time you spoke to him he asked instead last night by telephone who called who and why he called me and asked if i could get to the game early i said i could how come he likes tohe liked to watch batting practice he said we could jaw over the roulet case a little bit nothing specific but he hadnt updated me in about a week thank you for your cooperation lankford said sarcasm heavy in his voice you realize that i just did what i tell every client and anybody who will listen not to do i talked to you without a lawyer present gave you my alibi i must be out of my mind i said thank you sobel spoke up is there anything else you can tell us mr haller about mr levin or his work yeah there is one other thing something you should probably check out but i want to remain confidential on it i looked past them at the uniformed officer still standing in the hallway sobel followed my eyes and understood i wanted privacy officer you can wait out front please she said the officer left looking annoyed probably because he had been dismissed by a woman okay lankford said what have you got ill have to look up the exact dates but a few weeks ago back in march raul did some work for me on another case that involved one of my clients snitching off a drug dealer he made some calls helped id the guy i heard afterward that the guy was a colombian and he was pretty well connected he could have had friends who i left it for them to fill in the blanks i dont know lankford said this was pretty clean doesnt look like a revenge deal they didnt cut his throat or take his tongue one shot plus they ransacked the office what would the dealers people be looking for i shook my head maybe my clients name the deal i made kept it out of circulation lankford nodded thoughtfully what is the clients name i cant tell you attorneyclient privilege okay here we go with that bullshit how are we going to investigate this if we dont even know your clients name dont you care about your friend in there on the floor with a piece of lead in his heart yes i care im obviously the only one here who does care but i am also bound by the rules and ethics of law your client could be in danger my client is safe my client is in lockdown its a woman isnt it sobel said you keep saying client instead of he or she im not talking to you about my client if you want the name of the dealer its hector arrande moya hes in federal custody i believe the originating charge came out of a dea case in san diego thats all i can tell you sobel wrote it all down i believed i had now given them sufficient reason to look beyond roulet and the gay angle mr haller have you ever been in mr levins office before sobel asked a few times not in a couple months at least do you mind walking back with us anyway maybe youll see something out of place or notice something thats missing is he still back there the victim yes hes still as he was found i nodded i wasnt sure i wanted to see raul levins body in the center of a murder scene i then decided all at once that i must see him and i must not forget the vision i would need it to fuel my resolve and my plan okay ill go back then put these on and dont touch anything while youre back there lankford said were still processing the scene from his pocket he produced a folded pair of paper booties i sat down on rauls couch and put them on then i followed them down the hallway to the death room raul levins body was in situas they had found it he was chestdown on the floor his face turned to his right his mouth and eyes open his body was in an awkward posture one hip higher than the other and his arms and hands beneath him it seemed clear that he had fallen from the desk chair that was behind him i immediately regretted my decision to come into the room i suddenly knew that the final look on rauls face would crowd out all other visual memories i had of him i would be forced to try to forget him so i would not have to look at those eyes in my mind again it was the same with my father my only visual memory was of a man in a bed he was a hundred pounds tops and was being ravaged from the inside out by cancer all the other visuals i carried of him were false they came from pictures in books i had read there were a number of people working in the room crime scene investigators and people from the medical examiners office my face must have shown the horror i was feeling you know why we cant cover him up lankford asked me because of people like you because of oj its what they call evidence transference something you lawyers like to jump all over on so no sheets over the body anymore not till we move it out of here i didnt say anything i just nodded he was right can you step over here to the desk and tell us if you see anything unusual sobel asked apparently having some sympathy for me i was thankful to do it because i could keep my back to the body i walked over to the desk which was a conjoining of three worktables forming a turn in the corner of the room it was furniture i recognized had come from the ikea store in nearby burbank it was nothing fancy it was simple and useful the center table in the corner had a computer on top and a pullout tray for a keyboard the tables to either side looked like twin work spaces and possibly were used by levin to keep separate investigations from mingling my eyes lingered on the computer as i wondered what levin may have put on electronic files about roulet sobel noticed we dont have a computer expert she said too small a department weve got a guy coming from the sheriffs office but it looks to me like the whole drive was pulled out she pointed with her pen under the table to where the pc unit was sitting upright but with one side of its plastic cowling having been removed and placed to the rear probably wont be anything there for us she said what about the desks my eyes moved over the table to the left of the computer first papers and files were spread across it in a haphazard way i looked at some of the tabs and recognized the names some of these are my clients but theyre old cases not active they probably came from the file cabinets in the closet sobel said the killer could have dumped them here to confuse us to hide what he was really looking for or taking what about over here we stepped over to the table to the right of the computer this one was not in as much disarray there was a calendar blotter on which it was clear levin kept a running account of his hours and which attorney he was working for at the time i scanned the blocks and saw my name numerous times going back five weeks it was as they had told me he had practically been working fulltime for me i dont know i said i dont know what to look for i dont see anything that could help well most attorneys arent that helpful lankford said from behind me i didnt bother to turn around to defend myself he was by the body and i didnt want to see what he was doing i reached out to turn the rolodex that was on the table just so i could look through the names on the cards dont touch that sobel said instantly i jerked my hand back sorry i was just going to look through the names i dont i didnt finish i was at sea here i wanted to leave and get something to drink i felt like the dodger dog that had tasted so good back at the stadium was about to come up hey check it out lankford said i turned with sobel and saw that the medical examiners people were slowly turning levins body over blood had stained the front of the dodgers shirt he was wearing but lankford was pointing to the dead mans hands which had not been visible beneath the body before the two middle fingers of his left hand were folded down against the palm while the two outside fingers were fully extended was this guy a texas longhorns fan or what lankford asked nobody laughed what do you think sobel said to me i stared down at my friends last gesture and just shook my head oh i got it lankford said its like a signal a code hes telling us that the devil did it i thought of raul calling roulet the devil of having the proof that he was evil and i knew what my friends last message to me meant as he died on the floor of his office he tried to tell me tried to warn me twentyfour iwent to four green fields and ordered a guinness but quickly escalated to vodka over ice i didnt think there was any sense in delaying things the dodgers game was finishing up on the tv over the bar the boys in blue were rallying down now by just two with the bases loaded in the ninth the bartender had his eyes glued to the screen but i didnt care anymore about the start of new seasons i didnt care about ninthinning rallies after the second vodka assault i brought the cell phone up onto the bar and started making calls first i called the four other lawyers from the game we had all left when i had gotten the word but they went home only knowing that levin was dead none of the details then i called lorna and she cried on the phone i talked her through it for a little while and then she asked the question i was hoping to avoid is this because of your case because of roulet i dont know i lied i told the cops about it but they seemed more interested in him being gay than anything else he was gay i knew it would work as a deflection he didnt advertise it and you knew and didnt tell me there was nothing to tell it was his life if he wanted to tell people he would have told people i guess the detectives said thats what happened what you know that his being gay is how he got murdered i dont know they kept asking about it i dont know what they think theyll look at everything and hopefully it will lead to something there was silence i looked up at the tv just as the winning run crossed the plate for the dodgers and the stadium erupted in bedlam and joy the bartender whooped and used a remote to turn up the broadcast i looked away and put a hand over my free ear makes you think doesnt it lorna said about what about what we do mickey when they catch the bastard who did this he might call me to hire you i got the bartenders attention by shaking the ice in my empty glass i wanted a refill what i didnt want was to tell lorna that i believed i was already working for the bastard who had killed raul lorna take it easy youre getting it could happen look raul was my colleague and he was also my friend but im not going to change what i do or what i believe in because maybe you should maybe we all should thats all im saying she started crying again the bartender brought my fresh drink and i took a third of it down in one gulp lorna do you want me to come over there no i dont want anything i dont know what i want this is just so awful can i tell you something what of course you can you remember jesus menendez my client yes but whats he have he was innocent and raul was working on it we were working on it were going to get him out why are you telling me this im telling you because we cant take what happened to raul and just stop in our tracks what we do is important its necessary the words sounded hollow as i said them she didnt respond i had probably confused her because i had confused myself okay i asked okay good i have to make some more calls lorna will you tell me when you find out about the services i will after closing my phone i decided to take a break before making another call i thought about lornas last question and realized i might be the one organizing the services she asked about unless an old woman in detroit who had disowned raul levin twentyfive years ago stepped up to the plate i pushed my glass to the edge of the bar gutter and said to the bartender gimme a guinness and give yourself one too i decided it was time to slow down and one way was to drink guinness since it took so long to fill a glass out of the tap when the bartender finally brought it to me i saw that he had etched a harp in the foam with the tap nozzle an angels harp i hoisted the glass before drinking from it god bless the dead i said god bless the dead the bartender said i drank heavily from the glass and the thick ale was like mortar i was sending down to hold the bricks together inside all at once i felt like crying but then my phone rang i grabbed it up without looking at the screen and said hello the alcohol had bent my voice into an unrecognizable shape is this mick a voice asked yeah whos this its louis i just heard the news about raul im so sorry man i pulled the phone away from my ear as if it were a snake about to bite me i pulled my arm back ready to throw it at the mirror behind the bar where i saw my own reflection then i stopped and brought it back yeah motherfucker how did you i broke off and started laughing as i realized what i had just called him and what raul levins theory about roulet had been excuse me roulet said are you drinking youre damn right im drinking i said how the fuck do you already know what happened to mish if by mish you mean mr levin i just got a call from the glendale police a detective said she wanted to speak to me about him that answer squeezed at least two of the vodkas right out of my liver i straightened up on my stool sobel is that who called yeah i think so she said she got my name from you she said it would be routine questions shes coming here where the office i thought about it for a moment but didnt think sobel was in any kind of danger even if she came without lankford roulet wouldnt try anything with a cop especially in his own office my greater concern was that somehow sobel and lankford were already onto roulet and i would be robbed of my chance to personally avenge raul levin and jesus menendez had roulet left a fingerprint behind had a neighbor seen him go into levins house thats all she said yes she said they were talking to all of his recent clients and i was the most recent dont talk to them you sure not without your lawyer present wont they get suspicious if i dont talk to them like give them an alibi or something it doesnt matter they dont talk to you unless i give my permission and im not giving it i gripped my free hand into a fist i couldnt stand the idea of giving legal advice to the man i was sure had killed my friend that very morning okay roulet said ill send her on her way where were you this morning me i was here at the office why did anybody see you well robin came in at ten not before that i pictured the woman with the hair cut like a scythe i didnt know what to tell roulet because i didnt know what the time of death was i didnt want to mention anything about the tracking bracelet he supposedly had on his ankle call me after detective sobel leaves and remember no matter what she or her partner says to you do not talk to them they can lie to you as much as they want and they all do consider anything they tell you to be a lie theyre just trying to trick you into talking to them if they tell you i said it was okay to talk that is a lie pick up the phone and call me i will tell them to get lost all right mick thats how ill play it thanks he ended the call i closed my phone and dropped it on the bar like it was something dirty and discarded yeah dont mention it i said i drained a good quarter of my pint then picked up the phone again using speed dial i called fernando valenzuelas cell number he was at home having just gotten in from the dodgers game that meant that he had left early to beat the traffic typical la fan do you still have a tracking bracelet on roulet yeah hes got it hows it work can you track where hes been or only where hes at its global positioning it sends up a signal you can track it backwards to tell where somebodys been you got it there or is it at the office its on my laptop man whats up i want to see where hes been today well let me boot it up hold on i held on finished my guinness and had the bartender start filling another before valenzuela had his laptop fired up wherere you at mick four green fields anything wrong yeah somethings wrong do you have it up or what yeah im looking at it right here how far back do you want to check start at this morning okay he uh he hasnt done much today i track it from his home to his office at eight looks like he took a little trip nearbya couple blocks probably for lunchand then back to the office hes still there i thought about this for a few moments the bartender delivered my next pint val how do you get that thing off your ankle you mean if you were him you dont you cant it bolts on and the little wrench you use is unique its like a key i got the only one youre sure about that im sure i got it right here on my key chain man no copieslike from the manufacturer not supposed to be besides it doesnt matter if the ring is brokenlike even if he did open iti get an alarm on the system it also has whats called a mass detector once i put that baby around his ankle i get an alarm on the computer the moment it reads that there is nothing there that didnt happen mick so you are talking about a saw being the only way cut off the leg leave the bracelet on the ankle thats the only way i drank the top off my new beer the bartender hadnt bothered with any artwork this time what about the battery what if the batterys dead you lose the signal no mick i got that covered too hes got a charger and a receptacle on the bracelet every few days hes got to plug it in for a couple hours to juice it you know while hes at his desk or something or taking a nap if the battery goes below twenty percent i get an alarm on my computer and i call him and say plug it in if he doesnt do it then i get another alarm at fifteen percent and then at ten percent he starts beeping and hes got no way to take it off or turn it off doesnt make for a good getaway and that last ten percent still gives me five hours of tracking i can find him in five hours no sweat okay okay i was convinced by the science whats going on i told him about levin and told him that the police would likely have to check out roulet and the ankle bracelet and tracking system would likely be our clients alibi valenzuela was stunned by the news he might not have been as close to levin as i had been but he had known him just as long what do you think happened mick he asked me i knew that he was asking if i thought roulet was the killer or somehow behind the killing valenzuela was not privy to all that i knew or that levin had found out i dont know what to think i said but you should watch yourself with this guy and you watch yourself i will i closed the phone wondering if there was something valenzuela didnt know if roulet had somehow found a way to take the ankle bracelet off or to subvert the tracking system i was convinced by the science of it but not the human side of it there are always human flaws the bartender sauntered over to my spot at the bar hey buddy did you lose your car keys he said i looked around to make sure he was talking to me and then shook my head no i said are you sure somebody found keys in the parking lot you better check i reached into the pocket of my suit jacket then brought my hand out and extended it palm up my key ring was displayed on my hand see i tol in a quick and unexpected move the bartender grabbed the keys off my hand and smiled falling for that should be a sobriety test in and of itself he said anyway pal youre not drivingnot for a while when youre ready to go ill call you a taxi he stepped back from the bar in case i had a violent objection to the ruse but i just nodded you got me i said he tossed my keys onto the back counter where the bottles were lined up i looked at my watch it wasnt even five oclock embarrassment burned through the alcohol padding i had taken the easy way out the cowards way getting drunk in the face of a terrible occurrence you can take it i said pointing to my glass of guinness i picked up the phone and punched in a speeddial number maggie mcpherson answered right away the courts usually closed by fourthirty the prosecutors were usually at their desks in that last hour or two before the end of the day hey is it quitting time yet haller yeah whats going on are you drinking your voice is different i think i might need you to drive me home this time where are you for greedy fucks what four green fields ive been here awhile michael what is raul levin is dead oh my god what murdered so this time can you drive me home ive had too much let me call stacey and get her to stay late with hayley then ill be on my way do not try to leave there okay just dont leave dont worry the bartender isnt gonna let me twentyfive after closing my phone i told the bartender i had changed my mind and id have one more pint while waiting for my ride i took out my wallet and put a credit card on the bar he ran my tab first then got me the guinness he took so long filling the glass spooning foam over the side to give me a full pour that i had barely tasted it by the time maggie got there that was too quick i said you want a drink no its too early lets just get you home okay i got off the stool remembered to collect my credit card and phone and left the bar with my arm around her shoulders and feeling like i had poured more guinness and vodka down the drain than my own throat im right out front maggie said four greedy fucks how did you come up with that do four people own this place no for as in for the people as in haller for the defense not the number four greedy fucks as in lawyers thank you not you youre not a lawyer youre a prosecutor how much did you drink haller somewhere between too much and a lot dont puke in my car i promise we got to the car one of the cheap jaguar models it was the first car she had ever bought without me holding her hand and being involved in running down the choices shed gotten the jag because it made her feel classy but anybody who knew cars knew it was just a dressedup ford i didnt spoil it for her whatever made her happy made me happyexcept the time she thought divorcing me would make her life happier that didnt do much for me she helped me in and then we were off dont pass out either she said as she pulled out of the parking lot i dont know the way just take laurel canyon over the hill after that its just a left turn at the bottom even though it was supposed to be a reverse commute it took almost fortyfive minutes in endoftheday traffic to get to fareholm drive along the way i told her about raul levin and what had happened she didnt react like lorna had because she had never known levin though i had known him and used him as an investigator for years he didnt become a friend until after we had divorced in fact it was raul who had driven me home on more than one night from four green fields as i was getting through the end of my marriage my garage opener was in the lincoln back at the bar so i told her to just park in the opening in front of the garage i also realized my front door key was on the ring that had the lincoln s key and that had been confiscated by the bartender we had to go down the side of the house to the back deck and get the spare keythe one roulet had given mefrom beneath an ashtray on the picnic table we went in the back door which led directly into my office this was good because even in my inebriated state i was pleased that we avoided climbing the stairs to the front door not only would it have worn me out but she would have seen the view and been reminded of the inequities between life as a prosecutor and life as a greedy fuck ah thats nice she said our little teacup i followed her eyes and saw she was looking at the photo of our daughter i kept on the desk i thrilled at the idea i had inadvertently scored a point of some kind with her yeah i said fumbling any chance of capitalizing which way to the bedroom she asked well arent you being forward to the right sorry haller im not staying long i only got a couple extra hours out of stacey and with that traffic ive got to turn around and head back over the hill soon she walked me into the bedroom and we sat down next to each other on the bed thank you for doing this i said one good turn deserves another i guess she said i thought i got my good turn that night i took you home she put her hand on my cheek and turned my face toward hers she kissed me i took this as confirmation that we actually had made love that night i felt incredibly left out at not remembering guinness she said tasting her lips as she pulled away and some vodka good combination youll be hurting in the morning its so early ill be hurting tonight tell you what why dont we go get dinner at dan tanas craigs on the door now and no mick i have to go home to hayley and you have to go to sleep i made a gesture of surrender okay okay call me in the morning i want to talk to you when youre sober okay you want to get undressed and get under the covers no im all right ill just i leaned back on the bed and kicked my shoes off i then rolled over to the edge and opened a drawer in the night table i took out a bottle of tylenol and a cd that had been given to me by a client named demetrius folks he was a banger from norwalk known on the street as lil demon he had told me once that hed had a vision one night and that he knew he was destined to die young and violently he gave me the cd and told me to play it when he was dead and i did demetriuss prophecy came true he was killed in a driveby shooting about six months after he had given me the disc in magic marker he had written wreckrium for lil demon on it it was a collection of ballads he had burned off of tupac cds i loaded the cd into the bose player on the night table and soon the rhythmic beat of god bless the dead started to play the song was a salute to fallen comrades you listen to this stuff maggie asked her eyes squinting at me in disbelief i shrugged as best i could while leaning on an elbow sometimes it helps me understand a lot of my clients better these are the people who should be in jail maybe some of them but a lot of them have something to say some are true poets and this guy was the best of them was who is it the one that got shot outside the car museum on wilshire no youre talking about biggie smalls this is the late great tupac shakur i cant believe you listen to this stuff i told you it helps me do me a favor do not listen to this around hayley dont worry about it i wont ive gotta go just stay a little bit she complied but she sat stiffly on the edge of the bed i could tell she was trying to pick up the lyrics you needed an ear for it and it took some time the next song was life goes on and i watched her neck and shoulders tighten as she caught some of the words can i please go now she asked maggie just stay a few minutes i reached over and turned it down a little hey ill turn it off if youll sing to me like you used to not tonight haller nobody knows the maggie mcfierce i know she smiled a little and i was quiet for a moment while i remembered those times maggie why do you stay with me i told you i cant stay no i dont mean tonight im talking about how you stick with me how you dont run me down with hayley and how youre there when i need you like tonight i dont know many people who have exwives who still like them she thought a little bit before answering i dont know i guess because i see a good man and a good father in there waiting to break out one day i nodded and hoped she was right tell me something what would you do if you couldnt be a prosecutor are you serious yeah what would you do ive never really thought about it right now i get to do what ive always wanted to do im lucky why would i want to change i opened the tylenol bottle and popped two without a chaser the next song was so many tears another ballad for all of those lost it seemed appropriate i think id be a teacher she finally said grade school little girls like hayley i smiled mrs mcfierce mrs mcfierce my dog ate my homework she slugged me on the arm actually thats nice i said youd be a good teacher except when youre sending kids off to detention without bail funny what about you i shook my head i wouldnt be a good teacher i mean what would you do if you werent a lawyer i dont know but ive got three town cars i guess i could start a limo service take people to the airport now she smiled at me id hire you good theres one customer give me a dollar and ill tape it to the wall but the banter wasnt working i leaned back put my palms against my eyes and tried to push away the day to push out the memory of raul levin on the floor of his house eyes staring at a permanent black sky you know what i used to be afraid of i asked what that i wouldnt recognize innocence that it would be there right in front of me and i wouldnt see it im not talking about guilty or not guilty i mean innocence just innocence she didnt say anything but you know what i should have been afraid of what haller evil pure evil what do you mean i mean most of the people i defend arent evil mags theyre guilty yeah but they arent evil you know what i mean theres a difference you listen to them and you listen to these songs and you know why they make the choices they make people are just trying to get by just to live with what theyre given and some of them arent given a damn thing in the first place but evil is something else its different its like i dont know its out there and when it shows up i dont know i cant explain it youre drunk thats why all i know is i should have been afraid of one thing but i was afraid of the complete opposite she reached over and rubbed my shoulder the last song was to live amp die in la and it was my favorite on the homespun cd i started to softly hum and then i sang along with the refrain when it came up on the track to live amp die in la its the place to be you got to be there to know it evybody wanna see pretty soon i stopped singing and pulled my hands down from my face i fell asleep with my clothes on i never heard the woman i had loved more than anyone else in my life leave the house she would tell me later that the last thing i had mumbled before passing out was i cant do this anymore i wasnt talking about my singing wednesday april twentysix islept almost ten hours but i still woke up in darkness it said on the bose i tried to go back to the dream but the door was closed by i rolled out of bed struggled for equilibrium and hit the shower i stayed under the spray until the hotwater tank ran cold then i got out and got dressed for another day of fighting the machine it was still too early to call lorna to check on the days schedule but i keep a calendar on my desk that is usually uptodate i went into the home office to check it and the first thing i noticed was a dollar bill taped to the wall over the desk my adrenaline jogged up a couple notches as my mind raced and i thought an intruder had left the money on the wall as some sort of threat or message then i remembered maggie i said out loud i smiled and decided to leave the dollar bill taped to the wall i got the calendar out of the briefcase and checked my schedule it looked like i had the morning free until an am hearing in san fernando superior the case was a repeat client charged with possession of drug paraphernalia it was a bullshit charge hardly worth the time and money but melissa menkoff was already on probation for a variety of drug offenses if she took a fall for something as minor as drug paraphernalia her probated sentence would kick in and she would end up behind a steel door for six to nine months that was all i had on the calendar after san fernando my day was clear and i silently congratulated myself for the foresight i must have used in keeping the day after opening day clear of course i didnt know when i set up the schedule that the death of raul levin would send me into four green fields so early but it was good planning just the same the hearing on the menkoff matter involved my motion to suppress the crack pipe found during a search of her vehicle after a reckless driving stop in northridge the pipe had been found in the closed center console of her car she had told me that she had not given permission to the police to search the car but they did anyway my argument was that there was no consent to search and no probable cause to search if menkoff had been pulled over by police for driving erratically then there was no reason to search the closed compartments of her car it was a loser and i knew it but menkoffs father paid me well to do the best i could for his troubled daughter and that was exactly what i was going to do at eleven oclock in san fernando court for breakfast i had two tylenols and chased them with fried eggs toast and coffee i doused the eggs liberally with pepper and salsa it all hit the right spots and gave me the fuel to carry on the battle i turned the pages of the times as i ate looking for a story on the murder of raul levin inexplicably there was no story i didnt understand this at first why would glendale keep the wraps on this then i remembered that the times put out several regional editions of the paper each morning i lived on the westside and glendale was considered part of the san fernando valley news of a murder in the valley may have been deemed by times editors as unimportant to westside readers who had their own regions murders to worry about i got no story on levin i decided i would have to buy a second copy of the times off a newsstand on the way to san fernando court and check again thoughts about which newsstand i would direct earl briggs to reminded me that i had no car the lincoln was in the parking lot at four green fieldsunless it had been stolen during the nightand i couldnt get my keys until the pub opened at eleven for lunch i had a problem i had seen earls car in the commuter lot where i picked him up each morning it was a pimpedout toyota with a lowrider profile and spinning chrome rims my guess was that it had the permanent stink of weed in it too i didnt want to ride in it in the north county it was an invitation to a police stop in the south county it was an invitation to get shot at i also didnt want earl to pick me up at the house i never let my drivers know where i live the plan i came up with was to take a cab to my warehouse in north hollywood and use one of the new town cars the lincoln at four green fields had over fifty thousand miles on it anyway maybe breaking out the new wheels would help me get past the depression sure to set in because of raul levin after i had cleaned the frying pan and the dish in the sink i decided it was late enough to risk waking lorna with a call to confirm my days schedule i went back into the home office and when i picked up the house phone to make the call i heard the broken dial tone that told me i had at least one message waiting i called the retrieval number and was told by an electronic voice that i had missed a call at am the day before when the voice recited the number that the missed call had come from i froze the number was raul levins cell phone i had missed his last call hey its me you probably left for the game already and i guess you got your cell turned off if you dont get this ill just catch you there but ive got another ace for you i guess you he broke off for a moment at the background sound of a dog barking could say ive got jesuss ticket out of the q ive gotta go lad that was it he hung up without a goodbye and had used that stupid brogue at the end the brogue had always annoyed me now it sounded endearing i missed it already i pushed the button to replay the message and listened again and then did it three more times before finally saving the message and hanging up i then sat there in my desk chair and tried to apply the message to what i knew the first puzzle involved the time of the call i did not leave for the game until at least yet i had somehow missed the call from levin that had come in more than twenty minutes earlier this made no sense until i remembered the call from lorna at i had been on the phone with lorna my home phone was used so infrequently and so few people had the number that i did not bother to have call waiting installed on the line this meant that levins last call would have been kicked over to the voicemail system and i would have never known about it as i spoke to lorna that explained the circumstances of the call but not its contents levin had obviously found something he was no lawyer but he certainly knew evidence and how to evaluate it he had found something that could help me get menendez out of prison he had found jesuss ticket out the last thing left to consider was the interruption of the dog barking and that was easy i had been to levins home before and i knew the dog was a highstrung yapper every time i had come to the house i had heard the dog start barking before i had even knocked on the door the barking in the background on the phone message and levin hurriedly ending the call told me someone was coming to his door he had a visitor and it may very well have been his killer i thought about things for a few moments and decided that the timing of the call was something i could not in good conscience keep from the police the contents of the message would raise new questions that i might have difficulty answering but that was outweighed by the value of the calls timing i went into the bedroom and dug through the pockets of the blue jeans i had worn the day before to the game in one of the back pockets i found the ticket stub from the game and the business cards lankford and sobel had given me at the end of my visit to levins house i chose sobels card and noticed it only said detective sobel on it no first name i wondered why that was as i made the call maybe she was like me with two different business cards in alternate pockets one with her complete name in one one with the more formal name in the other she answered the call right away and i decided to see what i could get from her before i gave her what i had anything new on the investigation i asked not a lot not a lot that i can share with you we are sort of organizing the evidence we have we got some ballistics back and they already did an autopsy i said that was quick no the autopsy wont be until tomorrow then howd you get ballistics already she didnt answer but then i figured it out you found a casing he was shot with an automatic that ejected the shell youre good mr haller yes we found a cartridge ive done a lot of trials and call me mickey its funny the killer ransacked the place but didnt pick up the shell maybe thats because it rolled across the floor and fell into a heating vent the killer would have needed a screwdriver and a lot of time i nodded it was a lucky break i couldnt count the number of times clients had gone down because the cops had caught a lucky break then again there were a lot of clients who walked because they caught the break it all evened out in the end so was your partner right about it being a twentytwo she paused before answering deciding whether to cross some threshold of revealing case information to me an involved party in the case but the enemya defense lawyernonetheless he was right and thanks to the markings on the cartridge we even know the exact gun we are looking for i knew from questioning ballistics experts and firearms examiners in trials over the years that marks left on bullet casings during the firing process could identify the weapon even without the weapon in hand with an automatic the firing pin breech block ejector and extractor all leave signature marks on the bullet casing in the split second the weapon is fired analyzing the four markings in unison can lead to a specific make and model of the weapon being identified it turns out that mr levin owned a twentytwo himself sobel said but we found it in a closet safe in the house and its not a woodsman the one thing we have not found is his cell phone we know he had one but we he was talking to me on it right before he was killed there was a moment of silence you told us yesterday that the last time you spoke to him was friday night thats right but thats why i am calling raul called me yesterday morning at elevenohseven and left me a message i didnt get it until today because after i left you people yesterday i just went out and got drunk then i went to sleep and didnt realize i had a message from him till right now he called about one of the cases he was working on for me sort of on the side its an appellate thing and the clients in prison a norush thing anyway the content of the message isnt important but the call helps with the timing and get this while hes leaving the message you hear the dog start to bark it did that whenever somebody came to the door i know because id been there before and the dog always barked again she hit me with some silence before responding i dont understand something mr haller whats that you told us yesterday you were at home until around noon before you left for the game and now you say that mr levin left a message for you at elevenohseven why didnt you answer the phone because i was on it and i dont have call waiting you can check my records youll see i got a call from my office manager lorna taylor i was talking to her when raul called without call waiting i didnt know and of course he thought i had already left for the game so he just left a message okay i understand well probably want your permission in writing to look at those records no problem where are you now im at home i gave her the address and she said that she and her partner were coming make it soon i have to leave for court in about an hour were coming right now i closed the phone feeling uneasy i had defended a dozen murderers over the years and that had brought me into contact with a number of homicide investigators but i had never been questioned myself about a murder before lankford and now sobel seemed to be suspicious of every answer i could give it made me wonder what they knew that i didnt i straightened up things on the desk and closed my briefcase i didnt want them seeing anything i didnt want them to see i then walked through my house and checked every room my last stop was the bedroom i made the bed and put the cd case for wreckrium for lil demon back in the night table drawer and then it hit me i sat on the bed as i remembered something sobel had said she had made a slip and at first it had gone right by me she had said that they had found raul levins caliber gun but it was not the murder weapon she said it was not a woodsman she had inadvertently revealed to me the make and model of the murder weapon i knew the woodsman was an automatic pistol manufactured by colt i knew this because i owned a colt woodsman sport model it had been bequeathed to me many years ago by my father upon his death once old enough to handle it i had never even taken it out of its wooden box i got up from the bed and went to the walkin closet i moved as if in a heavy fog my steps were tentative and i put my hand out to the wall and then the door casement as if needing my bearings the polished wooden box was on the shelf where it was supposed to be i reached up with both hands to bring it down and then walked it out to the bedroom i put the box down on the bed and flipped open the brass latch i raised the lid and pulled away the oilcloth covering the gun was gone part two a world without truth monday may twentyseven the check from roulet cleared on the first day of trial i had more money in my bank account than id ever had in my life if i wanted i could drop the bus benches and go with billboards i could also take the back cover of the yellow pages instead of the half page i had inside i could afford it i finally had a franchise case and it had paid off in terms of money that is the loss of raul levin would forever make this franchise a losing proposition we had been through three days of jury selection and were now ready to put on the show the trial was scheduled for another three days at the mosttwo for the prosecution and one for the defense i had told the judge that i would need a day to put my case before the jury but the truth was most of my work would be done during the prosecutions presentation theres always an electric feel to the start of a trial a nervousness that attacks deep in the gut so much is on the line reputation personal freedom the integrity of the system itself something about having those twelve strangers sit in judgment of your life and work always jumps things up inside and i am referring to me the defense attorneythe judgment of the defendant is a whole other thing ive never gotten used to it and the truth is i never want to i can only liken it to the anxiety and tension of standing at the front of a church on your wedding day id had that experience twice and i was reminded of it every time a judge called a trial to order though my experience in trial work severely outweighed my opponents there was no mistake about where i stood i was one man standing before the giant maw of the system without a doubt i was the underdog yes it was true that i faced a prosecutor in his first major felony trial but that advantage was evened and then some by the power and might of the state at the prosecutors command were the forces of the entire justice system and against this all i had was myself and a guilty client i sat next to louis roulet at the defense table we were alone i had no second and no investigator behind meout of some strange loyalty to raul levin i had not hired a replacement i didnt really need one either levin had given me everything i needed the trial and how it played out would serve as a last testament to his skills as an investigator in the first row of the gallery sat c c dobbs and mary alice windsor in accordance with a pretrial ruling the judge was allowing roulets mother to be in the courtroom during opening statements only because she was listed as a defense witness she would not be allowed to listen to any of the testimony that followed she would remain in the hallway outside with her loyal lapdog dobbs at her side until i called her to the stand also in the first row but not seated next to them was my own support section my exwife lorna taylor she had gotten dressed up in a navy suit and white blouse she looked beautiful and could have blended in easily with the phalanx of female attorneys who descended on the courthouse every day but she was there for me and i loved her for it the rest of the rows in the gallery were sporadically crowded there were a few print reporters there to grab quotes from the opening statements and a few attorneys and citizen onlookers no tv had shown up the trial had not yet drawn more than cursory attention from the public and this was good this meant our strategy of publicity containment had worked well roulet and i were silent as we waited for the judge to take the bench and order the jury into the box so that we could begin i was attempting to calm myself by rehearsing what i wanted to say to the jurors roulet was staring straight ahead at the state of california seal affixed to the front of the judges bench the courtroom clerk took a phone call said a few words and then hung up two minutes people he said loudly two minutes when a judge called ahead to the courtroom that meant people should be in their positions and ready to go we were i glanced over at ted minton at the prosecutions table and saw he was doing the same thing that i was doing calming himself by rehearsing i leaned forward and studied the notes on the legal pad in front of me then roulet unexpectedly leaned forward and almost right into me he spoke in a whisper even though it wasnt necessary yet this is it mick i know since the death of raul levin my relationship with roulet had been one of cold endurance i put up with him because i had to but i saw him as little as possible in the days and weeks before the trial and spoke to him as little as possible once it started i knew the one weakness in my plan was my own weakness i feared that any interaction with roulet could lead me into acting out my anger and desire to personally physically avenge my friend the three days of jury selection had been torture day after day i had to sit right next to him and listen to his condescending comments about prospective jurors the only way i got through it was to pretend he wasnt there you ready he asked me trying to be i said are you im ready but i wanted to tell you something before we began i looked at him he was too close to me it would have been invasive even if i loved him and not hated him i leaned back what he followed me leaning back next to me youre my lawyer right i leaned forward trying to get away louis what is this weve been together on this more than two months and now were sitting here with a jury picked and ready for trial you have paid me more than a hundred and fifty grand and you have to ask if im your lawyer of course im your lawyer what is it what is wrong nothings wrong he leaned forward and continued i mean like if youre my lawyer i can tell you stuff and you have to hold it as a secret even if its a crime i tell you about more than one crime its covered by the attorneyclient relationship right i felt the low rumbling of upset in my stomach yes louis thats rightunless you are going to tell me about a crime about to be committed in that case i can be relieved of the code of ethics and can inform the police so they can stop the crime in fact it would be my duty to inform them a lawyer is an officer of the court so what is it that you want to tell me you just heard we got the twominute warning were about to start here ive killed people mick i looked at him for a moment what you heard me he was right i had heard him and i shouldnt have acted surprised i already knew he had killed people raul levin was among them and he had even used my gunthough i hadnt figured out how he had defeated the gps bracelet on his ankle i was just surprised he had decided to tell me in such a matteroffact manner two minutes before his trial was called to order why are you telling me this i asked im about to try to defend you in this thing and you because i know you already know and because i know what your plan is my plan what plan he smiled slyly at me come on mick its simple you defend me on this case you do your best you get paid the big bucks you win and i walk away but then once its all over and youve got your money in the bank you turn against me because im not your client anymore you throw me to the cops so you can get jesus menendez out and redeem yourself i didnt respond well i cant let that happen he said quietly now i am yours forever mick i am telling you ive killed people and guess what martha renteria was one of them i gave her just what she deserved and if you go to the cops or use what ive told you against me then you wont be practicing law for very long yes you might succeed in raising jesus from the dead but ill never be prosecuted because of your misconduct i believe it is called fruit of the poisonous tree and you are the tree mick i still couldnt respond i just nodded again roulet had certainly thought it through i wondered how much help he had gotten from cecil dobbs he had obviously had somebody coach him on the law i leaned toward him and whispered follow me i got up and walked quickly through the gate and toward the rear door of the courtroom from behind i heard the clerks voice mr haller were about to start the judge one minute i called out without turning around i held one finger up as well i then pushed through the doors into the dimly lit vestibule designed as a buffer to keep hallway sounds from the courtroom a set of double doors on the other side led to the hallway i moved to the side and waited for roulet to step into the small space as soon as he came through the door i grabbed him and spun him into the wall i held him pressed against it with both of my hands on his chest what the fuck do you think you are doing take it easy mick i just thought we should know where we both you son of a bitch you killed raul and all he was doing was working for you he was trying to help you i wanted to bring my hands up to his neck and choke him out on the spot youre right about one thing i am a son of a bitch but you are wrong about everything else mick levin wasnt trying to help me he was trying to bury me and he was getting too close he got what he deserved for that i thought about levins last message on my phone at home ive got jesuss ticket out of the q whatever it was that he had found it had gotten him killed and it had gotten him killed before he could deliver the information to me how did you do it youre confessing everything to me here then i want to know how you did it howd you beat the gps your bracelet showed you werent even near glendale he smiled at me like a boy with a toy he wasnt going to share lets just say that is proprietary information and leave it at that you never know i may have to pull the old houdini act again in his words i heard the threat and in his smile i saw the evil that raul levin had seen dont get any ideas mick he said as you probably know i do have an insurance policy i pressed harder against him and leaned in closer listen you piece of shit i want the gun back you think you have this thing wired you dont have shit ive got it wired and you wont make it through the week if i dont get that gun back you got that roulet slowly reached up grabbed my wrists and pulled my hands off his chest he started straightening his shirt and tie might i suggest an agreement he said calmly at the end of this trial i walk out of the courtroom a free man i continue to maintain my freedom and in exchange for this the gun never falls into shall we say the wrong hands meaning lankford and sobel because id really hate to see that happen mick a lot of people depend on you a lot of clients and you of course wouldnt want to go where they are going i stepped back from him using all my will not to raise my fists and attack i settled for a voice that quietly seethed with all of my anger and hate i promise you i said if you fuck with me you will never be free of me are we clear on that roulet started to smile but before he could respond the door from the courtroom opened and deputy meehan the bailiff looked in the judge is on the bench he said sternly she wants you in here now i looked back at roulet i said are we clear yes mick he said goodnaturedly were crystal clear i stepped away from him and entered the courtroom striding up the aisle to the gate judge constance fullbright was staring me down every step of the way so nice of you to consider joining us this morning mr haller where had i heard that before i am sorry your honor i said as i came through the gate i had an emergency situation with my client we had to conference client conferences can be handled right at the defense table she responded yes your honor i dont think we are starting off correctly here mr haller when my clerk announces that we will be in session in two minutes then i expect everyoneincluding defense attorneys and their clientsto be in place and ready to go i apologize your honor thats not good enough mr haller before the end of court today i want you to pay a visit to my clerk with your checkbook i am fining you five hundred dollars for contempt of court you are not in charge of this courtroom sir i am your honor now can we please have the jury she ordered cutting off my protest the bailiff opened the jury room door and the twelve jurors and two alternates started filing into the jury box i leaned over to roulet who had just sat down and whispered you owe me five hundred dollars twentyeight ted mintons opening statement was a bythenumbers model of prosecutorial overkill rather than tell the jurors what evidence he would present and what it would prove the prosecutor tried to tell them what it all meant he was going for a big picture and this was almost always a mistake the big picture involves inferences and suggestions it extrapolates givens to the level of suspicions any experienced prosecutor with a dozen or more felony trials under his belt will tell you to keep it small you want them to convict not necessarily to understand what this case is about is a predator he told them louis ross roulet is a man who on the night of march sixth was stalking prey and if it were not for the sheer determination of a woman to survive we would be here prosecuting a murder case i noticed early on that minton had picked up a scorekeeper this is what i call a juror who incessantly takes notes during trial an opening statement is not an offer of evidence and judge fullbright had so admonished the jury but the woman in the first seat in the front row had been writing since the start of mintons statement this was good i like scorekeepers because they document just what the lawyers say will be presented and proved at trial and at the end they go back to check they keep score i looked at the jury chart i had filled in the week before and saw that the scorekeeper was linda truluck a homemaker from reseda she was one of only three women on the jury minton had tried hard to keep the female content to a minimum because i believe he feared that once it was established in trial that regina campo had been offering sexual services for money he might lose the females sympathy and ultimately their votes on a verdict i believed he was probably correct in that assumption and i worked just as diligently to get women on the panel we both ended up using all of our twenty challenges and it was probably the main reason it took three days to seat a jury in the end i got three women on the panel and only needed one to head off a conviction now you are going to hear testimony from the victim herself about her lifestyle being one that we would not condone minton told the jurors the bottom line is she was selling sex to the men she invited to her home but i want you to remember that what the victim in this case did for a living is not what this trial is about anyone can be a victim of a violent crime anyone no matter what someone does for a living the law does not allow for them to be beaten to be threatened at knifepoint or to be put in fear of their lives it doesnt matter what they do to make money they enjoy the same protections that we all do it was pretty clear to me that minton didnt even want to use the word prostitution or prostitute for fear it would hurt his case i wrote the word down on the legal pad i would take with me to the lectern when i made my statement i planned to make up for the prosecutors omissions minton gave an overview of the evidence he spoke about the knife with the defendants initials on the blade he talked about the blood found on his left hand and he warned the jurors not to be fooled by the defenses efforts to confuse or muddle the evidence this is a very clearcut and straightforward case he said as he was winding up you have a man who attacked a woman in her home his plan was to rape and then kill her it is only by the grace of god that she will be here to tell you the story with that he thanked them for their attention and took his seat at the prosecution table judge fullbright looked at her watch and then looked at me it was and she was probably weighing whether to go to a break or let me proceed with my opener one of the judges chief jobs during trial is jury management the judges duty is to make sure the jury is comfortable and engaged lots of breaks short and long is often the answer i had known connie fullbright for at least twelve years since long before she was a judge she had been both a prosecutor and defense lawyer she knew both sides aside from being overly quick with contempt citations she was a good and fair judgeuntil it came to sentencing you went into fullbrights court knowing you were on an even level with the prosecution but if the jury convicted your client be prepared for the worst fullbright was one of the toughest sentencing judges in the county it was as if she were punishing you and your client for wasting her time with a trial if there was any room within the sentencing guidelines she always went to the max whether it was prison or probation it had gotten her a telling sobriquet among the defense pros who worked the van nuys courthouse they called her judge fullbite mr haller she said are you planning to reserve your statement no your honor but i believe i am going to be pretty quick very good she said then well hear from you and then well take lunch the truth was i didnt know how long i would be minton had been about forty minutes and i knew i would take close to that but i had told the judge id be quick simply because i didnt like the idea of the jury going to lunch with only the prosecutors side of the story to think about as they chewed their hamburgers and tuna salads i got up and went to the lectern located between the prosecution and defense tables the courtroom was one of the recently rehabbed spaces in the old courthouse it had twin jury boxes on either side of the bench everything was done in a blond wood including the rear wall behind the bench the door to the judges chambers was almost hidden in the wall its lines camouflaged in the lines and grain of the wood the doorknob was the only giveaway fullbright ran her trials like a federal judge attorneys were not allowed to approach witnesses without permission and never allowed to approach the jury box they were required to speak from the lectern only standing now at the lectern the jury was in the box to my right and closer to the prosecution table than to the defenses this was fine with me i didnt want them to get too close a look at roulet i wanted him to be a bit of a mystery to them ladies and gentlemen of the jury i began my name is michael haller and i am representing mr roulet during this trial i am happy to tell you that this trial will most likely be a quick one just a few more days of your time will be taken in the long run you will probably see that it took us longer to pick all of you than it will take to present both sides of the case the prosecutor mr minton seemed to spend his time this morning telling you about what he thinks all the evidence means and who mr roulet really is i would advise you to simply sit back listen to the evidence and let your common sense tell you what it all means and who mr roulet is i kept my eyes moving from juror to juror i rarely looked down at the pad i had placed on the lectern i wanted them to think i was shooting the breeze with them talking off the top of my head usually what i like to do is reserve my opening statement in a criminal trial the defense always has the option of giving an opener at the start of the trial just as mr minton did or right before presenting the defenses case normally i would take the second option i would wait and make my statement before trotting out all the defenses witnesses and evidence but this case is different its different because the prosecutions case is also going to be the defenses case youll certainly hear from some defense witnesses but the heart and soul of this case is going to be the prosecutions evidence and witnesses and how you decide to interpret them i guarantee you that a version of the events and evidence far different from what mr minton just outlined is going to emerge in this courtroom and when it comes time to present the defenses case it probably wont even be necessary i checked the scorekeeper and saw her pencil moving across the page of her notebook i think that what you are going to find here this week is that this whole case will come down to the actions and motivations of one person a prostitute who saw a man with outward signs of wealth and chose to target him the evidence will show this clearly and it will be shown by the prosecutions own witnesses minton stood up and objected saying i was going out of bounds in trying to impeach the states main witness with unsubstantiated accusations there was no legal basis for the objection it was just an amateurish attempt to send a message to the jury the judge responded by inviting us to a sidebar we walked to the side of the bench and the judge flipped on a sound neutralizer which sent white noise from a speaker on the bench toward the jury and prevented them from hearing what was whispered in the sidebar the judge was quick with minton like an assassin mr minton i know you are new to felony trial work so i see i will have to school you as we go but dont you ever object during an opening statement in my courtroom this isnt evidence hes presenting i dont care if he says your own mother is the defendants alibi witness you dont object in front of my jury your hon thats it go back she rolled her seat back to the center of the bench and flicked off the white noise minton and i returned to our positions without further word objection overruled the judge said continue mr haller and let me remind you that you said you would be quick thank you your honor that is still my plan i referred to my notes and then looked back at the jury knowing that minton would have been intimidated to silence by the judge i decided to raise the rhetoric up a notch go off notes and get directly to the windup ladies and gentlemen in essence what you will be deciding here is who the real predator was in this case mr roulet a successful businessman with a spotless record or an admitted prostitute with a successful business in taking money from men in exchange for sex you will hear testimony that the alleged victim in this case was engaged in an act of prostitution with another man just moments before this supposed attack occurred and you will hear testimony that within days of this supposedly lifethreatening assault she was back in business once again trading sex for money i glanced at minton and saw he was doing a slow burn he had his eyes downcast on the table in front of him and he was slowly shaking his head i looked up at the judge your honor could you instruct the prosecutor to refrain from demonstrating in front of the jury i did not object or in any way try to distract the jury during his opening statement mr minton the judge intoned please sit still and extend the courtesy to the defense that was extended to you yes your honor minton said meekly the jury had now seen the prosecutor slapped down twice and we werent even past openers i took this as a good sign and it fed my momentum i looked back at the jury and noticed that the scorekeeper was still writing finally you will receive testimony from many of the states own witnesses that will provide a perfectly acceptable explanation for much of the physical evidence in this case i am talking about the blood and about the knife mr minton mentioned taken individually or as a whole the prosecutions own case will provide you with more than reasonable doubt about the guilt of my client you can mark it down in your notebooks i guarantee you will find that you have only one choice at the end of this case and that is to find mr roulet not guilty of these charges thank you as i walked back to my seat i winked at lorna taylor she nodded at me as if to say i had done well my attention was then drawn to the two figures sitting two rows behind her lankford and sobel they had slipped in after i had first surveyed the gallery i took my seat and ignored the thumbsup gesture given me by my client my mind was on the two glendale detectives wondering what they were doing in the courtroom watching me waiting for me the judge dismissed the jury for lunch and everyone stood while the scorekeeper and her colleagues filed out after they were gone minton asked the judge for another sidebar he wanted to try to explain his objection and repair the damage but not in open court the judge said no im hungry mr minton and were past that now go to lunch she left the bench and the courtroom that had been so silent except for the voices of lawyers then erupted in chatter from the gallery and the court workers i put my pad in my briefcase that was really good roulet said i think were already ahead of the game i looked at him with dead eyes its no game i know that its just an expression listen i am having lunch with cecil and my mother we would like you to join us i shook my head i have to defend you louis but i dont have to eat with you i took my checkbook out of my briefcase and left him there i walked around the table to the clerks station so that i could write out a check for five hundred dollars the money didnt hurt as much as i knew the bar review that follows any contempt citation would when i was finished i turned back to find lorna waiting for me at the gate with a smile we planned to go to lunch and then she would go back to manning the phone in her condo in three days i would be back in business and needed clients i was depending on her to start filling in my calendar looks like i better buy you lunch today she said i threw my checkbook into the briefcase and closed it i joined her at the gate that would be nice i said i pushed through the gate and checked the bench where i had seen lankford and sobel sitting a few moments before they were gone twentynine the prosecution began presenting its case to the jury in the afternoon session and very quickly ted mintons strategy became clear to me the first four witnesses were a dispatch operator the patrol officers who responded to regina campos call for help and the paramedic who treated her before she was transported to the hospital in anticipation of the defense strategy it was clear that minton wanted to firmly establish that campo had been brutally assaulted and was indeed the victim in this crime it wasnt a bad strategy in most cases it would get the job done the dispatch operator was essentially used as the warm body needed to introduce a recording of campos call for help printed transcripts of the call were handed out to jurors so they could read along with a scratchy audio playback i objected on the grounds that it was prejudicial to play the audio recording when the transcript would suffice but the judge quickly overruled me before minton even had to counter the recording was played and there was no doubt that minton had started out of the gate strong as the jurors sat raptly listening to campo scream and beg for help she sounded genuinely distraught and scared it was exactly what minton wanted the jurors to hear and they certainly got it i didnt dare question the dispatcher on crossexamination because i knew it might give minton the opportunity to play the recording again on redirect the two patrol officers who followed offered different testimony because they did separate things upon arriving at the tarzana apartment complex in response to the call one primarily stayed with the victim while the other went up to the apartment and handcuffed the man campos neighbors were sitting onlouis ross roulet officer vivian maxwell described campo as disheveled hurt and frightened she said campo kept asking if she was safe and if the intruder had been caught even after she was assured on both questions campo remained scared and upset at one point telling the officer to unholster her weapon and have it ready in case the attacker broke free when minton was through with this witness i stood up to conduct my first crossexamination of the trial officer maxwell i asked did you at any time ask ms campo what had happened to her yes i did what exactly did you ask her i asked what had happened and who did this to her you know who had hurt her what did she tell you she said a man had come to her door and knocked and when she opened it he punched her she said he hit her several times and then took out a knife she said he took the knife out after he punched her thats how she said it she was upset and hurt at the time i understand did she tell you who the man was no she said she didnt know the man you specifically asked if she knew the man yes she said no so she just opened her door at ten oclock at night to a stranger she didnt say it that way but you said she told you she didnt know him right that is correct that is how she said it she said i dont know who he is and did you put this in your report yes i did i introduced the patrol officers report as a defense exhibit and had maxwell read parts of it to the jury these parts involved campo saying that the attack was unprovoked and at the hands of a stranger the victim does not know the man who assaulted her and did not know why she was attacked she read from her own report maxwells partner john santos testified next telling jurors that campo directed him to her apartment where he found a man on the floor near the entrance the man was semiconscious and was being held on the ground by two of campos neighbors edward turner and ronald atkins one man was straddling the mans chest and the other was sitting on his legs santos identified the man being held on the floor as the defendant louis ross roulet santos described him as having blood on his clothes and his left hand he said roulet appeared to be suffering from a concussion or some sort of head injury and initially was not responsive to commands santos turned him over and handcuffed his hands behind his back the officer then put a plastic evidence bag he carried in a compartment on his belt over roulets bloody hand santos testified that one of the men who had been holding roulet handed over a folding knife that was open and had blood on its handle and blade santos told jurors he bagged this item as well and turned it over to detective martin booker as soon as he arrived on the scene on crossexamination i asked santos only two questions officer was there blood on the defendants right hand no there was no blood on his right hand or i would have bagged that one too i see so you have blood on the left hand only and a knife with blood on the handle would it then appear to you that if the defendant had held that knife then he would have to have held it in his left hand minton objected saying that santos was a patrol officer and that the question was beyond the scope of his expertise i argued that the question required only a commonsense answer not an expert the judge overruled the objection and the court clerk read the question back to the witness it would seem that way to me santos answered arthur metz was the paramedic who testified next he told jurors about campos demeanor and the extent of her injuries when he treated her less than thirty minutes after the attack he said that it appeared to him that she had suffered at least three significant impacts to the face he also described a small puncture wound to her neck he described all the injuries as superficial but painful a large blowup of the same photograph of campos face i had seen on the first day i was on the case was displayed on an easel in front of the jury i objected to this arguing that the photo was prejudicial because it had been blown up to largerthanlife size but i was overruled by judge fullbright then when it was my turn to crossexamine metz i used the photo i had just objected to when you tell us that it appeared that she suffered at least three impacts to the face what do you mean by impact i asked she was struck with something either a fist or a blunt object so basically someone hit her three times could you please use this laser pointer and show the jury on the photograph where these impacts occurred from my shirt pocket i unclipped a laser pointer and held it up for the judge to see she granted me permission to carry it to metz i turned it on and handed it to him he then put the red eye of the laser beam on the photo of campos battered face and drew circles in the three areas where he believed she had been struck he circled her right eye her right cheek and an area encompassing the right side of her mouth and nose thank you i said taking the laser back from him and returning to the lectern so if she was hit three times on the right side of her face the impacts would have come from the left side of her attacker correct minton objected once more saying the question was beyond the scope of the witnesss expertise once more i argued common sense and once more the judge overruled the prosecutor if the attacker was facing her he would have punched her from the left unless it was a backhand metz said then it could have been a right he nodded and seemed pleased with himself he obviously thought he was helping the prosecution but his effort was so disingenuous that he was actually probably helping the defense you are suggesting that ms campos attacker hit her three times with a backhand and caused this degree of injury i pointed to the photo on the exhibit easel metz shrugged realizing he had probably not been so helpful to the prosecution anything is possible he said anything is possible i repeated well is there any other possibility you can think of that would explain these injuries as coming from anything other than direct lefthanded punches metz shrugged again he was not an impressive witness especially following two cops and a dispatcher who had been very precise in their testimony what if ms campo were to have hit her face with her own fist wouldnt she have used her right minton jumped up immediately and objected your honor this is outrageous to suggest that this victim did this to herself is not only an affront to this court but to all victims of violent crime everywhere mr haller has sunk to the witness said anything is possible i argued trying to knock minton off the soapbox i am trying to explore what sustained fullbright said ending it mr haller dont go there unless you are making more than an exploratory swing through the possibilities yes your honor i said no further questions i sat down and glanced at the jurors and knew from their faces that i had made a mistake i had turned a positive cross into a negative the point i had made about a lefthanded attacker was obscured by the point i had lost with the suggestion that the injuries to the victims face were selfinflicted the three women on the panel looked particularly annoyed with me still i tried to focus on a positive aspect it was good to know the jurys feelings on this now before campo was in the witness box and i asked the same thing roulet leaned toward me and whispered what the fuck was that without responding i turned my back to him and took a scan around the courtroom it was almost empty lankford and sobel had not returned to the courtroom and the reporters were gone as well that left only a few other onlookers they appeared to be a disparate collection of retirees law students and lawyers resting their feet until their own hearings began in other courtrooms but i was counting on one of these onlookers being a plant from the das office ted minton might be flying solo but my guess was that his boss would have a means of keeping tabs on him and the case i knew i was playing as much to the plant as i was to the jury by the trials end i needed to send a note of panic down to the second floor that would then echo back to minton i needed to push the young prosecutor toward taking a desperate measure the afternoon dragged on minton still had a lot to learn about pacing and jury management knowledge that comes only with courtroom experience i kept my eyes on the jury boxwhere the real judges satand saw the jurors were growing bored as witness after witness offered testimony that filled in small details in the prosecutors linear presentation of the events of march i asked few questions on cross and tried to keep a look on my face that mirrored those i saw in the jury box minton obviously wanted to save his most powerful stuff for day two he would have the lead investigator detective martin booker to bring all the details together and then the victim regina campo to bring it all home to the jury it was a triedandtrue formulaending with muscle and emotionand it worked ninety percent of the time but it was making the first day move like a glacier things finally started to pop with the last witness of the day minton brought in charles talbot the man who had picked up regina campo at morgans and gone with her to her apartment on the night of the sixth what talbot had to offer to the prosecutions case was negligible he was basically hauled in to testify that campo had been in good health and uninjured when he left her that was it but what caused his arrival to rescue the trial from the pit of boredom was that talbot was an honesttogod alternate lifestyle man and jurors always loved visiting the other side of the tracks talbot was fiftyfive years old with dyed blond hair that wasnt fooling anyone he had blurred navy tattoos on both forearms he was twenty years divorced and owned a twentyfourhour convenience store called kwik kwik the business gave him a comfortable living and lifestyle with an apartment in the warner center a latemodel corvette and a nightlife that included a wide sampling of the citys professional sex providers minton established all of this in the early stages of his direct examination you could almost feel the air go still in the courtroom as the jurors plugged into talbot the prosecutor then brought him quickly to the night of march and talbot described hooking up with reggie campo at morgans on ventura boulevard did you know ms campo before you met her in the bar that night no i did not how did it come about that you met her there i just called her up and said i wanted to get together with her and she suggested we meet at morgans i knew the place so i said sure and how did you call her up with the telephone several jurors laughed im sorry i understand that you used a telephone to call her i meant how did you know how to contact her i saw her ad on the website and i liked what i saw and so i went ahead and called her up and we made a date its as simple as that her number is on her website ad and you met at morgans yes thats where she meets her dates she told me so i went there and we had a couple drinks and we talked and we liked each other and that was that i followed her back to her place when you went to her apartment did you engage in sexual relations sure did thats what i was there for and you paid her four hundred bucks it was worth it i saw a male jurors face turning red and i knew i had pegged him perfectly during selection the week before i had wanted him because he had brought a bible with him to read while other prospective jurors were being questioned minton had missed it focusing only on the candidates as they were being questioned but i had seen the bible and asked few questions of the man when it was his turn minton accepted him on the jury and so did i i figured he would be easy to turn against the victim because of her occupation his reddening face confirmed it what time did you leave her apartment minton asked about five minutes before ten talbot answered did she tell you she was expecting another date at the apartment no she didnt say anything about that in fact she was sort of acting like she was done for the night i stood up and objected i dont think mr talbot is qualified here to interpret what ms campo was thinking or planning by her actions sustained the judge said before minton could offer an argument the prosecutor moved right along mr talbot could you please describe the physical state ms campo was in when you left her shortly before ten oclock on the night of march sixth completely satisfied there was a loud blast of laughter in the courtroom and talbot beamed proudly i checked the bible man and it looked like his jaw was tightly clenched mr talbot minton said i mean her physical state was she hurt or bleeding when you left her no she was fine she was okay when i left her she was fit as a fiddle and i know because i had just played her he smiled proud of his use of language this time there was no laughter and the judge had finally had enough of his use of the double entendre she admonished him to keep his more offcolor remarks to himself sorry judge he said mr talbot minton said ms campo was not injured in any way when you left her nope no way she wasnt bleeding no and you didnt strike her or physically abuse her in any way no again what we did was consensual and pleasurable no pain thank you mr talbot i looked at my notes for a few moments before standing up i wanted a break of time to clearly mark the line between direct and crossexamination mr haller the judge prompted do you wish to crossexamine the witness i stood up and moved to the lectern yes your honor i do i put my pad down and looked directly at talbot he was smiling pleasantly at me but i knew he wouldnt like me for very long mr talbot are you right or lefthanded im lefthanded lefthanded i echoed and isnt it true that on the night of the sixth before leaving regina campos apartment she asked you to strike her with your fist repeatedly in the face minton stood up your honor there is no basis for this sort of questioning mr haller is simply trying to muddy the waters by taking outrageous statements and turning them into questions the judge looked at me and waited for a response judge it is part of the defense theory as outlined in my opening statement i am going to allow it just be quick about it mr haller the question was read to talbot and he smirked and shook his head that is not true ive never hurt a woman in my life you struck her with your fist three times didnt you mr talbot no i did not that is a lie you said you have never hurt a woman in your life thats right never do you know a prostitute named shaquilla barton talbot had to think before answering doesnt ring a bell on the website where she advertises her services she uses the name shaquilla shackles does that ring a bell now mr talbot okay yeah i think so have you ever engaged in acts of prostitution with her one time yes when was that wouldve been at least a year ago maybe longer and did you hurt her on that occasion no and if she were to come to this courtroom and say that you did hurt her by punching her with your left hand would she be lying she damn sure would be i tried her out and didnt like that rough stuff im strictly a missionary man i didnt touch her you didnt touch her i mean i didnt punch her or hurt her in any way thank you mr talbot i sat down minton did not bother with a redirect talbot was excused and minton told the judge that he had only two witnesses remaining to present in the case but that their testimony would be lengthy judge fullbright checked the time and recessed court for the day two witnesses left i knew that had to be detective booker and reggie campo it looked like minton was going to go without the testimony of the jailhouse snitch he had stashed in the pti program at countyusc dwayne corlisss name had never appeared on any witness list or any other discovery document associated with the prosecution of the case i thought maybe minton had found out what raul levin had found out about corliss before raul was murdered either way it seemed apparent that corliss had been dropped by the prosecution and that was what i needed to change as i gathered my papers and documents in my briefcase i also gathered the resolve to talk to roulet i glanced over at him he was sitting there waiting to be dismissed by me so what do you think i asked i think you did very well more than a few moments of reasonable doubt i snapped the latches on the briefcase closed today i was just planting seeds tomorrow theyll sprout and on wednesday theyll bloom you havent seen anything yet i stood up and lifted the briefcase off the table it was heavy with all the case documents and my computer see you tomorrow i walked out through the gate cecil dobbs and mary windsor were waiting for roulet in the hallway near the courtroom door as i came out they turned to speak to me but i walked on by see you tomorrow i said wait a minute wait a minute dobbs called to my back i turned around were stuck out here he said as he and windsor walked to me how is it going in there i shrugged right now its the prosecutions case i answered all im doing is bobbing and weaving trying to protect i think tomorrow will be our round and wednesday we go for the knockout ive got to go prepare as i headed to the elevator i saw that a number of the jurors from the case had beaten me to it and were waiting to go down the scorekeeper was among them i went into the restroom next to the bank of elevators so i didnt have to ride down with them i put my briefcase on the counter between the sinks and washed my face and hands as i stared at myself in the mirror i looked for signs of stress from the case and everything associated with it i looked reasonably sane and calm for a defense pro who was playing both his client and the prosecution at the same time the cold water felt good and i felt refreshed as i came out of the restroom hoping the jurors had cleared out the jurors were gone but standing in the hallway by the elevator were lankford and sobel lankford was holding a folded sheaf of documents in one hand there you are he said weve been looking for you thirty the document lankford handed me was a search warrant granting the police the authority to search my home office and car for a caliber colt woodsman sport model pistol with the serial number the authorization said the pistol was believed to have been the murder weapon in the april homicide of raul a levin lankford had handed the warrant to me with a proud smirk on his face i did my best to act like it was business as usual the kind of thing i handled every other day and twice on fridays but the truth was my knees almost buckled howd you get this i said it was a nonsensical response to a nonsensical moment signed sealed and delivered lankford said so where do you want to start you have your car here right that lincoln youre chauffeured around in like a highclass hooker i checked the judges signature on the last page and saw it was a glendale municourt judge i had never heard of they had gone to a local who probably knew hed need the police endorsement come election time i started to recover from the shock maybe the search was a front this is bullshit i said you dont have the pc for this i could have this thing quashed in ten minutes it looked pretty good to judge fullbright lankford said fullbright what does she have to do with this well we knew you were in trial so we figured we ought to ask her if it was okay to drop the warrant on you dont want to get a lady like that mad you know she said after court was over was fine by herand she didnt say shit about the pc or anything else they must have gone to fullbright on the lunch break right after i had seen them in the courtroom my guess was it had been sobels idea to check with the judge first a guy like lankford would have enjoyed pulling me right out of court and disrupting the trial i had to think quickly i looked at sobel the more sympathetic of the two im in the middle of a threeday trial i said any way we can put this on hold until thursday no fucking way lankford answered before his partner could were not letting you out of our sight until we execute the search were not going to give you the time to dump the gun now wheres your car lincoln lawyer i checked the authorization of the warrant it had to be very specific and i was in luck it called for the search of a lincoln with the california license plate nt glty i realized that someone must have written the plate down on the day i was called to raul levins house from the dodgers game because that was the old lincoln the one i was driving that day its at home since im in trial i dont use the driver i got a ride in with my client this morning and i was just going to ride back with him hes probably waiting down there i lied the lincoln i had been driving was in the courthouse parking garage but i couldnt let the cops search it because there was a gun in a compartment in the backseat armrest it wasnt the gun they were looking for but it was a replacement after raul levin was murdered and id found my pistol box empty i asked earl briggs to get me a gun for protection i knew that with earl there would be no tenday waiting period but i didnt know the guns history or registration and i didnt want to find out through the glendale police department but i was in luck because the lincoln with the gun inside wasnt the one described in the warrant that one was in my garage at home waiting on the buyer from the limo service to come by and take a look at and that would be the lincoln that would be searched lankford grabbed the warrant out of my hand and shoved it into an inside coat pocket dont worry about your ride lankford said were your ride lets go on the way down and out of the courthouse we didnt run into roulet or his entourage and soon i was riding in the back of a grand marquis thinking that i had made the right choice when i had gone with the lincoln there was more room in the lincoln and the ride was smoother lankford did the driving and i sat behind him the windows were up and i could hear him chewing gum let me see the warrant again i said lankford made no move im not letting you inside my house until ive had a chance to completely study the warrant i could do it on the way and save you some time or lankford reached inside his jacket and pulled out the warrant he handed it over his shoulder to me i knew why he was hesitant cops usually had to lay out their whole investigation in the warrant application in order to convince a judge of probable cause they didnt like the target reading it because it gave away the store i glanced out the window as we were passing the car lots on van nuys boulevard i saw a new model town car on a pedestal in front of the lincoln dealership i looked back down at the warrant opened it to the summary section and read lankford and sobel had started out doing some good work i had to give them that one of them had taken a shoti was guessing sobeland put my name into the states automated firearm system and hit the lotto the afs computer said i was the registered owner of a pistol of the same make and model as the murder weapon it was a smooth move but it still wasnt enough to make probable cause colt made the woodsman for more than sixty years that meant there were probably a million of them out there and a million suspects who owned them they had the smoke they then rubbed other sticks together to make the required fire the application summary stated that i had hidden from the investigators the fact that i owned the gun in question it said i had also fabricated an alibi when initially interviewed about levins death then attempted to throw detectives off the track by giving them a phony lead on the drug dealer hector arrande moya though motivation was not necessarily a subject needed to obtain a search warrant the pc summary alluded to it anyway stating that the victimraul levinhad been extorting investigative assignments from me and that i had refused to pay him upon completion of those assignments the outrage of such an assertion aside the alibi fabrication was the key point of probable cause the statement said that i had told the detectives i was home at the time of the murder but a message on my home phone was left just before the suspected time of death and this indicated that i was not home thereby collapsing my alibi and proving me a liar at the same time i slowly read the pc statement twice more but my anger did not subside i tossed the warrant onto the seat next to me in some ways its really too bad i am not the killer i said yeah why is that lankford said because this warrant is a piece of shit and you both know it it wont stand up to challenge i told you that message came in when i was already on the phone and that can be checked and proven only you were too lazy or you didnt want to check it because it would have made it a little difficult to get your warrant even with your pocket judge in glendale you lied by omission and commission its a badfaith warrant because i was sitting behind lankford i had a better angle on sobel i watched her for signs of doubt as i spoke and the suggestion that raul was extorting business from me and that i wouldnt pay is a complete joke extorted me with what and what didnt i pay him for i paid him every time i got a bill man i tell you if this is how you work all your cases i gotta open up an office in glendale im going to shove this warrant right up your police chiefs ass you lied about the gun lankford said and you owed levin money its right there in his accounts book four grand i didnt lie about anything you never asked if i owned a gun lied by omission right back at ya bullshit four grand oh yeah the four grandi killed him because i didnt want to pay him four grand i said with all the sarcasm i could muster you got me there detective motivation but i guess it never occurred to you to see if he had even billed me for the four grand yet or to see if i hadnt just paid an invoice from him for six thousand dollars a week before he was murdered lankford was undaunted but i saw the doubt start to creep into sobels face doesnt matter how much or when you paid him lankford said a blackmailer is never satisfied you never stop paying until you reach the point of no return thats what this is about the point of no return i shook my head and what exactly was it that he had on me that made me give him jobs and pay him until i reached the point of no return lankford and sobel exchanged a look and lankford nodded sobel reached down to a briefcase on the floor and took out a file she handed it over the seat to me take a look lankford said you missed it when you were ransacking his place hed hidden it in a dresser drawer i opened the file and saw that it contained several color photos they were taken from afar and i was in each one of them the photographer had trailed my lincoln over several days and several miles each image a frozen moment in time the photos showed me with various individuals whom i easily recognized as clients they were prostitutes street dealers and road saints the photos could be interpreted as suspicious because they showed one split second of time a male prostitute in minishorts alighting from the backseat of the lincoln teddy vogel handing me a thick roll of cash through the back window i closed the file and tossed it back over the seat youre kidding me right youre saying raul came to me with that he extorted me with that those are my clients is this a joke or am i just missing something the california bar might not think its a joke lankford said we hear youre on thin ice with the bar levin knew it he worked it i shook my head incredible i said i knew i had to stop talking i was doing everything wrong with these people i knew i should just shut up and ride it out but i felt an almost overpowering need to convince them i began to understand why so many cases were made in the interview rooms of police stations people just cant shut up i tried to place the photographs that were in the file vogel giving me the roll of cash was in the parking lot outside the saints strip club on sepulveda that happened after harold caseys trial and vogel was paying me for filing the appeal the prostitute was named terry jones and i handled a soliciting charge for him the first week of april id had to find him on the santa monica boulevard stroll the night before a hearing to make sure he was going to show up it became clear that the photos had all been taken between the morning i had caught the roulet case and the day raul levin was murdered they were then planted at the crime scene by the killerall part of roulets plan to set me up so that he could control me the police would have everything they needed to put the levin murder on meexcept the murder weapon as long as roulet had the gun he had me i had to admire the plan and the ingenuity at the same time that it made me feel the dread of desperation i tried to put the window down but the button wouldnt work i asked sobel to open a window and she did fresh air started blowing into the car after a while lankford looked at me in the rearview and tried to jumpstart the conversation we ran the history on that woodsman he said you know who owned it once dont you mickey cohen i answered matteroffactly staring out the window at the steep hillsides of laurel canyon howd you end up with mickey cohens gun i answered without turning from the window my father was a lawyer mickey cohen was his client lankford whistled cohen was one of the most famous gangsters to ever call los angeles home he was from back in the day when the gangsters competed with movie stars for the gossip headlines and what he just gave your old man a gun cohen was charged in a shooting and my father defended him he claimed selfdefense there was a trial and my father got a notguilty verdict when the weapon was returned mickey gave it to my father sort of a keepsake you could say your old man ever wonder how many people the mick whacked with it i dont know i didnt really know my father what about cohen you ever meet him my father represented him before i was even born the gun came to me in his will i dont know why he picked me to have it i was only five years old when he died and you grew up to be a lawyer like dear old dad and being a good lawyer you registered it i thought if it was ever stolen or something i would want to be able to get it back turn here on fareholm lankford did as i instructed and we started climbing up the hill to my home i then gave them the bad news thanks for the ride i said you guys can search my house and my office and my car for as long as you want but i have to tell you you are wasting your time not only am i the wrong guy for this but you arent going to find that gun i saw lankfords head jog up and he was looking at me in the rearview again and why is that counselor you already dumped it because the gun was stolen out of my house and i dont know where it is lankford started laughing i saw the joy in his eyes uhhuh stolen how convenient when did this happen hard to tell i hadnt checked on the gun in years you make a police report on it or file an insurance claim no so somebody comes in and steals your mickey cohen gun and you dont report it even after you just told us you registered it in case this very thing happened you being a lawyer and all doesnt that sound a little screwy to you it does except i knew who stole it it was a client he told me he took it and if i were to report it i would be violating a client trust because my police report would lead to his arrest kind of a catchtwentytwo detective sobel turned and looked back at me i think maybe she thought i was making it up on the spot which i was that sounds like legal jargon and bullshit haller lankford said but its the truth were here just park in front of the garage lankford pulled the car into the space in front of my garage and killed the engine he turned to look back at me before getting out which client stole the gun i told you i cant tell you well roulets your only client right now isnt he i have a lot of clients but i told you i cant tell you think maybe we should run the charts from his ankle bracelet and see if hes been to your place lately do whatever you want he actually has been here we had a meeting here once in my office maybe thats when he took it im not telling you he took it detective yeah well that bracelet gives roulet a pass on the levin thing anyway we checked the gps so i guess that leaves you counselor and that leaves you wasting your time i suddenly realized something about roulets ankle bracelet but tried not to show it maybe a line on the trapdoor to his houdini act it was something i would need to check into later are we just going to sit here lankford turned and got out he then opened my door because the inside handle had been disabled for transporting suspects and custodies i looked at the two detectives you want me to show you the gun box maybe when you see it is empty you can just leave and save us all the time not quite counselor lankford said were going through this whole place ill take the car and detective sobel will start in the house i shook my head not quite detective it doesnt work that way i dont trust you your warrant is bent so as far as im concerned youre bent you stay together so i can watch you both or we wait until i can get a second observer up here my case manager could be here in ten minutes i could bring her up here to watch and you could also ask her about calling me on the morning raul levin got killed lankfords face grew dark with insult and anger that he looked like he was having trouble controlling i decided to push it i took out my cell phone and opened it im going to call your judge right now and see if he fine lankford said well start with the car together well work our way inside the house i closed the phone and put it back in my pocket fine i walked over to a keypad on the wall outside the garage i tapped in the combination and the garage door started to rise revealing the blueblack lincoln awaiting inspection its license plate read nt glty lankford looked at it and shook his head yeah right he stepped into the garage his face still tight with anger i decided to ease things a little bit hey detective i said whats the difference between a catfish and a defense attorney he didnt respond he stared angrily at the license plate on my lincoln ones a bottomfeeding shit sucker i said and the other ones a fish for a moment his face remained frozen then a smile creased it and he broke into a long and hard laugh sobel stepped into the garage having not heard the joke what she said ill tell you later lankford said thirtyone it took them a half hour to search the lincoln and then move into the house where they started with the office i watched the whole time and only spoke when offering explanation about something that gave them pause in their search they didnt talk much to each other and it was becoming increasingly clear that there was a rift between the two partners over the direction lankford had taken the investigation at one point lankford got a call on his cell phone and he went out the front door onto the porch to talk privately i had the shades up and if i stood in the hallway i could look one way and see him out there and the other way and see sobel in my office youre not too happy about this are you i said to sobel when i was sure her partner couldnt hear it doesnt matter how i am were following the case and thats it is your partner always like that or only with lawyers he spent fifty thousand dollars on a lawyer last year trying to get custody of his kids he didnt before that we lost a big casea murderon a legal technicality i nodded and he blamed the lawyer but who broke the rules she didnt respond and that as much as confirmed it had been lankford who had made the technical misstep i get the picture i said i checked on lankford on the porch again he was gesturing impatiently like he was trying to explain something to a moron must have been his custody lawyer i decided to change the subject with sobel do you think you are being manipulated at all on this case what are you talking about the photos stashed in the bureau the bullet casing in the floor vent pretty convenient dont you think what are you saying im not saying anything im asking questions your partner doesnt seem interested in i checked on lankford he was tapping in numbers on his cell making a new call i turned and stepped into the open doorway of the office sobel was looking behind the files in a drawer finding no gun she closed the drawer and stepped over to the desk i spoke in a low voice what about rauls message to me i said about finding jesus menendezs ticket out what do you think he meant we havent figured that out yet too bad i think its important everythings important until it isnt i nodded not sure what she meant by that you know the case im trying is pretty interesting you ought to come back by and watch you might learn something she looked from the desk to me our eyes held for a moment then she squinted with suspicion like she was trying to judge whether a supposed murder suspect was actually coming on to her are you serious yeah why not well for one thing you might have trouble getting to court if youre in lockup hey no gun no case thats why youre here right she didnt answer besides this is your partners thing youre not riding with him on this i can tell typical lawyer you think you know all the angles no not me im finding out i dont know any of them she changed the subject is this your daughter she pointed to the framed photograph on the desk yeah hayley nice alliteration hayley haller named after the comet sort of spelled differently my exwife came up with it lankford came in then talking to sobel loudly about the call he had gotten it had been from a supervisor telling them that they were back in play and would handle the next glendale homicide whether the levin case was still active or not he didnt say anything about the call he had made sobel told him she had finished searching the office no gun im telling you its not here i said you are wasting your time and mine i have court tomorrow and need to prepare for witnesses lets do the bedroom next lankford said ignoring my protest i backed up into the hallway to give them space to come out of one room and go into the next they walked down the sides of the bed to where twin night tables waited lankford opened the top drawer of his table and lifted out a cd wreckrium for lil demon he read you have to be fucking kidding me i didnt respond sobel quickly opened the two drawers of her table and found them empty except for a strip of condoms i looked the other way ill take the closet lankford said after he had finished with his night tableleaving the drawers open in typical police search fashion he walked into the closet and soon spoke from inside it here we go he stepped back out of the closet holding the wooden gun box bingo i said you found an empty gun box you must be a detective lankford shook the box in his hands before putting it down on the bed either he was trying to play with me or the box had a solid heft to it i felt a little charge go down the back of my neck as i realized that roulet could have just as easily snuck back into my house to return the gun it would have been the perfect hiding place for it the last place i might think to check again once i had determined that the gun was gone i remembered the odd smile on roulets face when i had told him i wanted my gun back was he smiling because i already had the gun back lankford flipped the boxs latch and lifted the top he pulled back the oilcloth covering the cork cutout which once held mickey cohens gun was still empty i breathed out so heavily it almost came out as a sigh what did i tell you i said quickly trying to cover up yeah what did you tell us lankford said heidi you got a bag were going to take the box i looked at sobel she didnt look like a heidi to me i wondered if it was some sort of a squad room nickname or maybe it was the reason she didnt put her first name on her business card it didnt sound homicide tough in the car she said go get it lankford said you are going to take an empty gun box i asked what good does it do you all part of the chain of evidence counselor you should know that besides it will come in handy since i have a feeling well never find the gun i shook my head maybe handy in your dreams the box is evidence of nothing its evidence that you had mickey cohens gun says it right on this little brass plaque your daddy or somebody had made so fucking what well i just made a call while i was out on your front porch haller see we had somebody checking on mickey cohens selfdefense case turns out that over there in lapds evidence archive they still have all the ballistic evidence from that case thats a lucky break for us the case being what fifty years old i understood immediately they would take the bullet slugs and casings from the cohen case and compare them with the same evidence recovered in the levin case they would match the levin murder to mickey cohens gun which they would then tie to me with the gun box and the states afs computer i doubted roulet could have realized how the police would be able to make a case without even having the gun when he thought out his scheme to control me i stood there silently sobel left the room without a glance at me and lankford looked up from the box at me with a killer smile whats the matter counselor he asked evidence got your tongue i finally was able to speak how long will ballistics take i managed to ask hey for you were going to put a rush on it so get out there and enjoy yourself while you can but dont leave town he laughed almost giddy with himself man i thought they only said that in movies but there i just said it i wish my partner had been here sobel came back in with a large brown bag and a roll of red evidence tape i watched her put the gun box into the bag and then seal it with the tape i wondered how much time i had and if the wheels had just come off of everything i had put into motion i started to feel as empty as the wooden box sobel had just sealed inside the brown paper bag thirtytwo fernando valenzuela lived out in valencia from my home it was easily an hours drive north in the last remnants of rushhour traffic valenzuela had moved out of van nuys a few years earlier because his three daughters were nearing high school age and he feared for their safety and education he moved into a neighborhood filled with people who had also fled from the city and his commute went from five minutes to fortyfive but he was happy his house was nicer and his children safer he lived in a spanishstyle house with a red tile roof in a planned community full of spanishstyle houses with red tile roofs it was more than a bail bondsman could ever dream of having but it came with a stiff monthly price tag it was almost nine by the time i got there i pulled up to the garage which had been left open one space was taken by a minivan and the other by a pickup on the floor between the pickup and a fully equipped tool bench was a large cardboard box that said sony on it it was long and thin i looked closer and saw it was a box for a fiftyinch plasma tv i got out and went to the front door and knocked valenzuela answered after a long wait mick what are you doing up here do you know your garage door is open holy shit i just had a plasma delivered he pushed by me and ran across the yard to look into the garage i closed his front door and followed him to the garage when i got there he was standing next to his tv smiling oh man you know that wouldve never happened in van nuys he said that sucker woulda been long gone come on well go in through here he headed toward a door that would take us from the garage into the house he hit a switch that made the garage door start to roll down hey val wait a minute i said lets just talk out here its more private but maria probably wants to say hello maybe next time he came back over to me concern in his eyes whats up boss whats up is i spent some time today with the cops working on rauls murder they said they cleared roulet on it because of the ankle bracelet valenzuela nodded vigorously yeah yeah they came to see me a few days after it happened i showed them the system and how it works and i pulled up roulets track for that day they saw he was at work and i also showed them the other bracelet i got and explained how it couldnt be tampered with its got a mass detector bottom line is you cant take it off it would know and then i would know i leaned back against the pickup and folded my arms so did those two cops ask where you were on that saturday it hit valenzuela like a punch what did you say mick my eyes lowered to the plasma tv box and then back up to his somehow some way he killed raul val now my ass is on the line and i want to know how he did it mick listen to me hes clear im telling you that bracelet didnt come off his ankle the machine doesnt lie yeah i know the machine doesnt lie after a moment he got it what are you saying mick he stepped in front of me his body posture stiffening aggressively i stopped leaning on the truck and dropped my hands to my sides im asking val where were you on that tuesday morning you son of a bitch how could you ask me that he had moved into a fight stance i was momentarily taken off guard as i thought about him calling me what i had called roulet earlier in the day valenzuela suddenly lunged at me and shoved me hard against his truck i shoved him back harder and he went backwards into the tv box it tipped over and hit the floor with a loud heavy whump and then he came down on it in a seated position there was a sharp snap sound from inside the box oh fuck he cried oh fuck you broke the screen you pushed me val i pushed back oh fuck he scrambled to the side of the box and tried to lift it back up but it was too heavy and unwieldy i walked over to the other side and helped him right it as the box came upright we heard small bits of material inside it slide down it sounded like glass motherfuck valenzuela yelled the door leading into the house opened and his wife maria looked out hi mickey val what is all the noise just go inside her husband ordered well what is shut the fuck up and go inside she paused for a moment staring at us then closed the door i heard her lock it it looked like valenzuela was sleeping with the broken tv tonight i looked back at him his mouth was spread in shock that was eight thousand dollars he whispered they make tvs that cost eight thousand dollars i was shocked what was the world coming to that was with a discount val whered you get the money for an eightthousanddollar tv he looked at me and the fire came back where the fuck do you think business man thanks to roulet im having a hell of a year but goddamn mick i didnt cut him loose from the bracelet so he could go out and kill raul i knew raul just as long as you did i did not do that i did not put the bracelet on and wear it while he went to kill raul and i did not go and kill raul for him for a fucking tv if you cant believe that then just get the hell out of here and out of my life he said it all with the desperate intensity of a wounded animal a flash thought of jesus menendez came to my mind i had failed to see the innocence in his pleas i didnt want that to ever happen again okay val i said i walked over to the house door and pushed the button that raised the garage door when i turned back i saw he had taken a box cutter from the tool bench and was cutting the tape on the top of the tv box it looked like he was trying to confirm what we already knew about the plasma i walked past him and out of the garage ill split it with you val i said ill have lorna send you a check in the morning dont bother ill tell them it was delivered this way i got to my car door and looked back at him then give me a call when they arrest you for fraud after you bail yourself out i got in the lincoln and backed out of the driveway when i glanced back into the garage i saw valenzuela had stopped cutting open the box and was just standing there looking at me traffic going back into the city was light and i made good time i was just coming in through the front door when the house phone started to ring i grabbed it in the kitchen thinking maybe it was valenzuela calling to tell me he was taking his business to another defense pro at the moment i didnt care instead it was maggie mcpherson everything all right i asked she usually didnt call so late fine wheres hayley asleep i didnt want to call until she went down whats up there was a strange rumor about you floating around the office today you mean the one about me being raul levins murderer haller is this serious the kitchen was too small for a table and chairs i couldnt go far with the phone cord tether so i hoisted myself up onto the counter through the window over the sink i could see the lights of downtown twinkling in the distance and a glow on the horizon that i knew came from dodger stadium i would say yes the situation is serious i am being set up to take the fall for rauls murder oh my god michael how is this possible a lot of different ingredientsevil client cop with a grudge stupid lawyer add sugar and spice and everything nice is it roulet is he the one i cant talk about my clients with you mags well what are you planning to do dont worry ive got it covered ill be okay what about hayley i knew what she was saying she was warning me to keep it away from hayley dont let her go to school and hear kids talking about her father the murder suspect with a face and name splashed across the news hayley will be fine shell never know nobody will ever know if i play this thing right she didnt say anything and there was nothing else i could do to reassure her i changed the subject i tried to sound confident even cheerful how did your boy minton look after court today she didnt answer at first probably reluctant to change the subject i dont know he looked fine but smithson sent an observer up because its his first solo i nodded i was counting on smithson who ran the das van nuys branch having sent somebody to keep a watch on minton any feedback no not yet nothing that i heard look haller i am really worried about this the rumor was that you were served a search warrant in the courthouse is that true yeah but dont worry about it im telling you i have things under control it will all come out okay i promise i knew i had not quelled her fears she was thinking about our daughter and the possible scandal she was probably also thinking a little bit about herself and what having an exhusband disbarred or accused of murder would do to her chances of advancement besides if it all goes to shit youre still going to be my first customer right what are you talking about the lincoln lawyer limousine service youre in right haller it doesnt sound like this is a time to be making jokes its no joke maggie ive been thinking about quitting even before all of this bullshit came up its like i told you that night i cant do this anymore there was a long silence before she responded whatever you want to do is going to be fine by me and hayley i nodded you dont know how much i appreciate that she sighed into the phone i dont know how you do it haller do what youre a sleazy defense lawyer with two exwives and an eightyearold daughter and we all still love you now i was silent despite everything i smiled thank you maggie mcfierce i finally said good night and i hung up the phone tuesday may thirtythree the second day of trial began with a forthwith to the judges chambers for minton and me judge fullbright wanted only to speak to me but the rules of trial made it improper for her to meet privately with me about any matter and exclude the prosecution her chambers were spacious with a desk and separate seating area surrounded by three walls of shelves containing law books she told us to sit in the seats in front of her desk mr minton she began i cant tell you not to listen but im going to have a conversation with mr haller that i dont expect you to join or interrupt it doesnt concern you or as far as i know the roulet case minton taken by surprise didnt quite know how to react other than to drop his jaw a couple inches and let light into his mouth the judge turned in her desk chair toward me and clasped her hands together on the desk mr haller is there anything you need to bring up with me keeping in mind that you are sitting next to a prosecutor no judge everythings fine sorry if you were bothered yesterday i did my best to put a rueful smile on my face as if to show the search warrant had been nothing more than an embarrassing inconvenience it is hardly a bother mr haller weve invested a lot of time on this case the jury the prosecution all of us i am hoping that it is not going to be for naught i dont want to do this again my calendar is already overflowing excuse me judge fullbright minton said could i just ask what no you may not she said cutting him off what we are talking about does not concern the trial other than the timing of it if mr haller is assuring me that we dont have a problem then i will take him at his word you need no further explanation than that she looked pointedly at me do i have your word on this mr haller i hesitated before nodding what she was telling me was that there would be hell to pay if i broke my word and the glendale investigation caused a disruption or mistrial in the roulet case youve got my word i said she immediately stood up and turned toward the hat rack in the corner her black robe hung there on a hanger okay then gentlemen lets get to it weve got a jury waiting minton and i left the chambers and entered the courtroom through the clerks station roulet was seated in the defendants chair and waiting what the hell was that all about minton whispered to me he was playing dumb he had to have heard the same rumors my exwife had picked up in the halls of the das office nothing ted just some bullshit involving another case of mine you going to wrap it up today depends on you the longer you take the longer i take cleaning up the bullshit you sling bullshit huh youre bleeding to death and dont even know it he smiled confidently at me i dont think so call it death by a thousand razor blades ted one doesnt do it they all do it welcome to felony practice i separated from him and went to the defense table as soon as i sat down roulet was in my ear what was that about with the judge he whispered nothing she was just warning me about how i handle the victim on cross who the woman she actually called her a victim louis first of all keep your voice down and second she is the victim in this thing you may have that rare ability to convince yourself of almost anything but we stillno make that istill need to convince the jury he took the rebuke like i was blowing bubbles in his face and moved on well what did she say she said she isnt going to allow me a lot of freedom in crossexamination she reminded me that regina campo is a victim im counting on you to rip her to shreds to borrow a quote from you on the day we met yeah well things are a lot different than on the day we met arent they and your little scheme with my gun is about to blow up in my face and im telling you right now im not going down for it if i have to drive people to the airport the rest of my life i will do that and do it gladly if its my only way out from this you understand louis i understand mick he said glibly im sure youll figure something out youre a smart man i turned and looked at him luckily i didnt have to say anything further the bailiff called the court to order and judge fullbright took the bench mintons first witness of the day was lapd detective martin booker he was a solid witness for the prosecution a rock his answers were clear and concise and given without hesitation booker introduced the key piece of evidence the knife with my clients initials on it and under mintons questioning he took the jury through his entire investigation of the attack on regina campo he testified that on the night of march he had been working night duty out of valley bureau in van nuys he was called to regina campos apartment by the west valley division watch commander who believed after being briefed by his patrol officers that the attack on campo merited immediate attention from an investigator booker explained that the six detective bureaus in the valley were only staffed during daytime hours he said the nightduty detective was a quickresponse position and often assigned cases of a pressing nature what made this case of pressing nature detective minton asked the injuries to the victim the arrest of a suspect and the belief that a greater crime had probably been averted booker answered that greater crime being what murder it sounded like the guy was planning to kill her i could have objected but i planned to exploit the exchange on crossexamination so i let it go minton walked booker through the investigative steps he took at the crime scene and later while interviewing campo as she was being treated at a hospital before you got to the hospital you had been briefed by officers maxwell and santos on what the victim had reported had happened correct yes they gave me an overview did they tell you that the victim was engaged in selling sex to men for a living no they didnt when did you find that out well i was getting a pretty good sense of it when i was in her apartment and i saw some of the property she had there what property things i would describe as sex aids and in one of the bedrooms there was a closet that only had negligees and clothing of a sexually provocative nature in it there was also a television in that room and a collection of pornographic tapes in the drawers beneath it i had been told that she did not have a roommate but it looked to me like both bedrooms were in active use i started to think that one room was hers like it was the one she slept in when she was alone and the other was for her professional activities a trick pad you could call it that did it change your opinion of her as a victim of this attack no it didnt and why not because anybody can be a victim prostitute or pope doesnt matter a victim is a victim spoken just as rehearsed i thought minton made a check mark on his pad and moved on now when you got to the hospital did you ask the victim about your theory in regard to her bedrooms and what she did for a living yes i did what did she tell you she flat out said she was a working girl she didnt try to hide it did anything she said to you differ from the accounts of the attack you had already gathered at the crime scene no not at all she told me she opened the door to the defendant and he immediately punched her in the face and drove her backwards into the apartment he assaulted her further and produced a knife he told her he was going to rape her and then kill her minton continued to probe the investigation in more detail and to the point of boring the jury when i was not writing down questions to ask booker during cross i watched the jurors and saw their attention lag under the weight of so much information finally after ninety minutes of direct examination it was my turn with the police detective my goal was to get in and get out while minton performed the whole case autopsy i only wanted to go in and scrape cartilage out of the knees detective booker did regina campo explain why she lied to the police she didnt lie to me maybe not to you but she told the first officers on the scene maxwell and santos that she did not know why the suspect had come to her apartment didnt she i wasnt present when they spoke to her so i cant testify to that i do know that she was scared that she had just been beaten and threatened with rape and death at the time of the first interview so you are saying that under those circumstances it is acceptable to lie to the police no i did not say that i checked my notes and moved on i wasnt going for a linear continuum of questions i was potshotting trying to keep him off balance did you catalog the clothing you found in the bedroom you said ms campo used for her prostitution business no i did not it was just an observation i made it was not important to the case would any of the outfits you saw in the closet have been appropriate to sadomasochistic sexual activities i wouldnt know that i am not an expert in that field how about the pornographic videos did you write down the titles no i did not again i did not believe that it was pertinent to the investigation of who had brutally assaulted this woman do you recall if the subject matter of any of the videos involved sadomasochism or bondage or anything of that nature no i do not now did you instruct ms campo to get rid of those tapes and the clothing from the closet before members of mr roulets defense team could view the apartment i certainly did not i checked that one off my list and moved on have you ever spoken to mr roulet about what happened in ms campos apartment that night no he lawyered up before i got to him do you mean he exercised his constitutional right to remain silent yes thats exactly what he did so as far as you know he never spoke to the police about what happened that is correct in your opinion was ms campo struck with great force i would say so yes her face was very badly cut and swollen then please tell the jury about the impact injuries you found on mr roulets hands he had wrapped a cloth around his fist to protect it there were no injuries on his hands that i could see did you document this lack of injury booker looked puzzled by the question no he said so you had ms campos injuries documented by photographs but you didnt see the need to document mr roulets lack of injuries correct it didnt seem to me to be necessary to photograph something that wasnt there how do you know he wrapped his fist in a cloth to protect it ms campo told me she saw that his hand was wrapped right before he punched her at the door did you find this cloth he supposedly wrapped his hand in yes it was in the apartment it was a napkin like from a restaurant it had her blood on it did it have mr roulets blood on it no was there anything that identified it as belonging to the defendant no so we have ms campos word for it right thats right i let some time pass while i scribbled a note on my pad i then continued to question the detective detective when did you learn that louis roulet denied assaulting or threatening ms campo and that he would be vigorously defending himself against the charges that would have been when he hired you i guess there was a murmur of laughter in the courtroom did you pursue other explanations for ms campos injuries no she told me what happened i believed her he beat her and was going to thank you detective booker just try to answer the question i ask i was if you looked for no other explanation because you believed the word of ms campo is it safe to say that this whole case relies upon her word and what she said occurred in her apartment on the night of march sixth booker deliberated a moment he knew i was leading him into a trap of his own words as the saying goes there is no trap so deadly as the one you set for yourself its not just her word he said after thinking he saw a way out there is physical evidence the knife her injuries more than just her word on this he nodded affirmatively but doesnt the states explanation for her injuries and the other evidence begin with her telling of what happened you could say that yes he said reluctantly she is the tree on which all of these fruits grow is she not i probably wouldnt use those words then what words would you use detective i had him now booker was literally squirming in his seat minton stood up and objected saying i was badgering the witness it must have been something he had seen on tv or in a movie he was told to sit down by the judge you can answer the question detective the judge said what was the question booker asked trying to buy some time you disagreed with me when i characterized ms campo as the tree from which all the evidence in the case grows i said if i am wrong how would you describe her position in this case booker raised his hands in a quick gesture of surrender shes the victim of course shes important because she told us what happened we have to rely on her to set the course of the investigation you rely on her for quite a bit in this case dont you victim and chief witness against the defendant correct thats right who else saw the defendant attack ms campo nobody else i nodded to underline the answer for the jury i looked over and exchanged eye contact with those in the front row okay detective i said i want to ask you about charles talbot now how did you find out about this man uh the prosecutor mr minton told me to find him and do you know how mr minton came to know about his existence i believe you were the one who informed him you had a videotape from a bar that showed him with the victim a couple hours before the attack i knew this could be the point to introduce the video but i wanted to wait on that i wanted the victim on the stand when i showed the tape to the jury and up until that point you didnt think it was important to find this man no i just didnt know about him so when you finally did know about talbot and you located him did you have his left hand examined to determine if he had any injuries that could have been sustained while punching someone repeatedly in the face no i didnt is that because you were confident in your choice of mr roulet as the person who punched regina campo it wasnt a choice it was where the investigation led i didnt locate charles talbot until more than two weeks after the crime occurred so what you are saying is that if hed had injuries they would have been healed by then correct im no expert on it but that was my thinking yes so you never looked at his hand did you not specifically no did you question any coworkers of mr talbot about whether they saw bruising or other injuries on his hand around the time of the crime no i did not so you never really looked beyond mr roulet did you that is wrong i come into every case with an open mind but roulet was there and in custody from the start the victim identified him as her attacker he was obviously a focus was he a focus or the focus detective booker he was both at first he was a focus and laterafter we found his initials on the weapon that had been held to reggie campos throathe became the focus you could say how do you know that knife was held to ms campos throat because she told us and she had the puncture wound to show for it are you saying there was some sort of forensic analysis that matched the knife to the wound on her neck no that was impossible so again we have ms campos word that the knife was held to her throat by mr roulet i had no reason to doubt her then i have none now now without any explanation for it i guess you would consider the knife with the defendants initials on it to be a highly important piece of evidence of guilt wouldnt you yes even with explanation i would say he brought that knife in there with one purpose in mind you are a mind reader are you detective no im a detective and i am just saying what i think accent on think its what i know from the evidence in the case im glad you are so confident sir i have no further questions at this time i reserve the right to recall detective booker as a witness for the defense i had no intention of calling booker back to the stand but i thought the threat might sound good to the jury i returned to my seat while minton tried to bandage up booker on redirect the damage was in perceptions and there wasnt a lot that he could do with that booker had only been a setup man for the defense the real damage would come later after booker stepped down the judge called for the midmorning break she told the jurors to be back in fifteen minutes but i knew the break would last longer judge fullbright was a smoker and had already faced highly publicized administrative charges for sneaking smokes in her chambers that meant that for her to take care of her habit and avoid further scandal she had to take the elevator down and leave the building and stand in the entry port where the jail buses come in i figured i had at least a half hour i went out into the hallway to talk to mary alice windsor and work my cell phone it looked like i would be putting on witnesses in the afternoon session i was first approached by roulet who wanted to talk about my crossexamination of booker it looked to me like it went really well for us he said us you know what i mean you cant tell whether its gone well until you get the verdict now leave me alone louis i have to make some calls and where is your mother i am probably going to need her this afternoon is she going to be here she had an appointment this morning but shell be here just call cecil and hell bring her in after he walked away detective booker took his place walking up to me and pointing a finger in my face its not going to fly haller he said whats not going to fly i asked your whole bullshit defense youre going to crash and burn well see yeah well see you know you have some balls trying to trash talbot with this some balls you must need a wheelbarrow to carry them around in im just doing my job detective and some job it is lying for a living tricking people from looking at the truth living in a world without truth let me ask you something you know the difference between a catfish and a lawyer no whats the difference ones a bottomfeeding shiteating scum sucker the others a fish thats a good one detective he left me then and i stood there smiling not because of the joke or the understanding that lankford had probably been the one to elevate the insult from defense attorneys to all of lawyerdom when he had retold the joke to booker i smiled because the joke was confirmation that lankford and booker were in communication they were talking and it meant that things were moving and in play my plan was still holding together i still had a chance thirtyfour every trial has a main event a witness or a piece of evidence that becomes the fulcrum upon which everything swings one way or the other in this case the main event was billed as regina campo victim and accuser and the case would seem to rest upon her performance and testimony but a good defense attorney always has an understudy and i had mine a witness secretly waiting in the wings upon whom i hoped to shift the weight of the trial nevertheless when minton called regina campo to the stand after the break it was safe to say all eyes were on her as she was led in and walked to the witness box it was the first time anyone in the jury had seen her in person it was also the first time i had ever seen her i was surprised but not in a good way she was diminutive and her hesitant walk and slight posture belied the picture of the scheming mercenary i had been building in the jurys collective consciousness minton was definitely learning as he was going with campo he seemed to have arrived at the conclusion that less was more he economically led her through the testimony he first started with personal background before moving on to the events of march regina campos story was sadly unoriginal and that was what minton was counting on she told the story of a young attractive woman coming to hollywood from indiana a decade before with hopes of celluloid glory there were starts and stops to a career an appearance on a television show here and there she was a fresh face and there were always men willing to put her in small meaningless parts but when she was no longer a fresh face she found work in a series of straighttocable films which often required her to appear nude she supplemented her income with nude modeling jobs and slipped easily into a world of trading sex for favors eventually she skipped the façade altogether and started trading sex for money it finally brought her to the night she encountered louis roulet regina campos courtroom version of what happened that night did not differ from the accounts offered by all previous witnesses in the trial but where it was dramatically different was in the delivery campo with her face framed by dark curly hair seemed like a little girl lost she appeared scared and tearful during the latter half of her testimony her lower lip and finger shook with fear as she pointed to the man she identified as her attacker roulet stared right back a blank expression on his face it was him she said in a strong voice hes an animal who should be put away i let that go without objection i would get my chance with her soon enough minton continued the questioning taking campo through her escape and then asked why she had not told the responding officers the truth about knowing who the man who attacked her was and why he was there i was scared she said i wasnt sure they would believe me if i told them why he was there i wanted to make sure they arrested him because i was very afraid of him do you regret that decision now yes i do because i know it might help him get free to do this again to somebody i did object to that answer as prejudicial and the judge sustained it minton threw a few more questions at his witness but seemed to know he was past the apex of the testimony and that he should stop before he obscured the trembling finger of identification campo had testified on direct examination for slightly less than an hour it was almost but the judge did not break for lunch as i had expected she told the jurors she wanted to get as much testimony in as possible during the day and that they would go to a late abbreviated lunch this made me wonder if she knew something i didnt had the glendale detectives called her during the midmorning break to warn of my impending arrest mr haller your witness she said to prompt me and keep things going i went to the lectern with my legal pad and looked at my notes if i was engaged in a defense of a thousand razors i had to use at least half of them on this witness i was ready ms campo have you engaged the services of an attorney to sue mr roulet over the alleged events of march sixth she looked as though she had expected the question but not as the first one out of the chute no i havent have you talked to an attorney about this case i havent hired anybody to sue him right now all i am interested in is seeing that justice is ms campo i interrupted i didnt ask whether you hired an attorney or what your interests are i asked if you had talked to an attorneyany attorneyabout this case and a possible lawsuit against mr roulet she was looking closely at me trying to read me i had said it with the authority of someone who knew something who had the goods to back up the charge minton had probably schooled her on the most important aspect of testifying dont get trapped in a lie talked to an attorney yes but it was nothing more than talk i didnt hire him is that because the prosecutor told you not to hire anybody until the criminal case was over no he didnt say anything about that why did you talk to an attorney about this case she had dropped into a routine of hesitating before every answer this was fine with me the perception of most people is that it takes time to tell a lie honest responses come easily i talked to him because i wanted to know my rights and to make sure i was protected did you ask him if you could sue mr roulet for damages i thought what you say to your attorney is private if you wish you can tell the jurors what you spoke to the attorney about there was the first deep slash with the razor she was in an untenable position no matter how she answered she would not look good i think i want to keep it private she finally said okay lets go back to march sixth but i want to go a little further back than mr minton did lets go back to the bar at morgans when you first spoke to the defendant mr roulet okay what were you doing at morgans that night i was meeting someone charles talbot yes now you were meeting him there to sort of size up whether you wanted to lead him back to your place to engage in sex for hire correct she hesitated but then nodded please answer verbally the judge told her yes would you say that practice is a safety precaution yes a form of safe sex right i guess so because in your profession you deal intimately with strangers so you must protect yourself correct yes correct people in your profession call this the freak test dont they ive never called it that but it is true that you meet your prospective clients in a public place like morgans to test them out and make sure they arent freaks or dangerous before you take them to your apartment isnt that right you could say that but the truth is you can never be sure about somebody that is true so when you were at morgans you noticed mr roulet sitting at the same bar as you and mr talbot yes he was there and had you ever seen him before yes i had seen him there and a few other places before had you ever spoken to him no we never talked had you ever noticed that he wore a rolex watch no had you ever seen him drive up or away from one of these places in a porsche or a range rover no i never saw him driving but you had seen him before in morgans and other places like it yes but never spoke to him correct then what made you approach him i knew he was in the life thats all what do you mean by in the life i mean that the other times i had seen him i could tell he was a player id seen him leave with girls that do what i do you saw him leave with other prostitutes yes leave to where i dont know leave the premises go to a hotel or the girls apartment i dont know that part well how do you know they even left the premises maybe they went outside for a smoke i saw them get into his car and drive away ms campo you testified a minute ago that you never saw mr roulets cars now you are saying that you saw him get into his car with a woman who is a prostitute like yourself which is it she realized her misstep and froze for a moment until an answer came to her i saw him get into a car but i didnt know what kind it was you dont notice things like that do you not usually do you know the difference between a porsche and a range rover ones big and ones small i guess what kind of car did you see mr roulet get into i dont remember i paused a moment and decided i had milked her contradiction for all it was worth i looked down at my list of questions and moved on these women that you saw leave with mr roulet were they ever seen again i dont understand did they disappear did you ever see them again no i saw them again had they been beaten or injured not that i know of but i didnt ask but all of this added up to you believing that you were safe as far as approaching and soliciting him correct i dont know about safe i just knew he was probably there looking for a girl and the man i was with already told me he would be finished by ten because he had to go to his business well can you tell the jury why it was that you did not have to sit with mr roulet like you did with mr talbot and subject him to a freak test her eyes drifted over to minton she was hoping for a rescue but none was coming i just thought he was a known quantity thats all you thought he was safe i guess so i dont know i needed the money and i made a mistake with him did you think he was rich and could solve your need for money no nothing like that i saw him as a potential customer who wasnt new to the game somebody who knew what he was doing you testified that on prior occasions you had seen mr roulet with other women who practice the same profession as yourself yes theyre prostitutes yes do you know them were acquaintances and do you extend professional courtesy to these women in terms of alerting them to customers who might be dangerous or unwilling to pay sometimes and they extend the same professional courtesy to you right yes how many of them warned you about louis roulet well nobody did or i wouldnt have gone with him i nodded and looked at my notes for a long moment before continuing i then led her in more detail through the events at morgans and then introduced the video surveillance tape from the bars overhead camera minton objected to it being shown to the jury without proper foundation but he was overruled a television on an industrial stand was wheeled in front of the jury and the video was played i could tell by the rapt attention they paid to it that they were enamored with the idea of watching a prostitute at work as well as the aspect of seeing the two main players in the case in unguarded moments what did the note say that you passed him i asked after the television was pushed to the side of the courtroom i think it just said my name and address you didnt quote him a price for the services you would perform i may have i dont remember what is the going rate that you charge usually i get four hundred dollars usually what would make you differentiate from that depends on what the client wants i looked over at the jury box and saw that the bible mans face was getting tight with discomfort do you ever engage in bondage and domination with your clients sometimes its only role playing though nobody ever gets hurt its just playacting are you saying that before the night of march sixth you have never been hurt by a client yes thats what i am saying that man hurt me and tried to kill please just answer the question i ask ms campo thank you now lets go back to morgans yes or no at the moment you gave mr roulet the napkin with your address and price on it you were confident that he would not be a danger to you and that he was carrying sufficient cash funds to pay the four hundred dollars you demand for your services yes so why didnt mr roulet have any cash on him when the police searched him i dont know i didnt take it do you know who did no i hesitated for a long moment preferring to punctuate my shifts in questioning streams with an underscore of silence now uh you are still working as a prostitute correct i asked campo hesitated before saying yes and are you happy working as a prostitute i asked minton stood your honor what does this have to do with sustained the judge said okay i said then isnt it true ms campo that you have told several of your clients that your hope is to leave the business yes thats true she answered without hesitation for the first time in many questions isnt it also true that you see the potential financial aspects of this case as a means of getting out of the business no thats not true she said forcefully and without hesitation that man attacked me he was going to kill me thats what this is about i underlined something on my pad another punctuation of silence was charles talbot a repeat customer i asked no i met him for the first time that night at morgans and he passed your safety test yes was charles talbot the man who punched you in the face on march sixth no he was not she answered quickly did you offer to split the profits you would receive from a lawsuit against mr roulet with mr talbot no i did not thats a lie i looked up at the judge your honor can i ask my client to stand up at this time be my guest mr haller i signaled roulet to stand at the defense table and he obliged i looked back at regina campo now ms campo are you sure that this is the man who struck you on the night of march sixth yes its him how much do you weigh ms campo she leaned back from the microphone as if put out by what was an invasive question even coming after so many questions pertaining to her sex life i noticed roulet start to sit back down and i signaled him to remain standing im not sure campo said on your ad on the website you list your weight at one hundred and five pounds i said is that correct i think so so if the jury is to believe your story about march sixth then they must believe that you were able to overpower and break free of mr roulet i pointed to roulet who was easily six feet and outweighed her by at least seventyfive pounds well thats what i did and this was while he supposedly was holding a knife to your throat i wanted to live you can do some amazing things when your life is in danger she used her last defense she started crying as if my question had reawakened the horror of coming so close to death you can sit down mr roulet i have nothing else for ms campo at this time your honor i took my seat next to roulet i felt the cross had gone well my razor work had opened up a lot of wounds the states case was bleeding roulet leaned over and whispered one word to me brilliant minton went back in for a redirect but he was just a gnat flitting around an open wound there was no going back on some of the answers his star witness had given and there was no way to change some of the images i had planted in the jurors minds in ten minutes he was through and i waived off a recross feeling that minton had accomplished little during his second effort and i could leave well enough alone the judge asked the prosecutor if he had any further witnesses and minton said he would like to think about it through lunch before deciding whether to rest the states case normally i would have objected to this because i would want to know if i had to put a witness on the stand directly after lunch but i let it go i believed that minton was feeling the pressure and was wavering i wanted to push him toward a decision and thought maybe giving him the lunch hour would help the judge excused the jury to lunch giving them only an hour instead of the usual ninety minutes she was going to keep things moving she said court would recess until and then abruptly left the bench she probably needed a cigarette i guessed i asked roulet if his mother could join us for lunch so that we could talk about her testimony which i thought would come in the afternoon if not directly after lunch he said he would arrange it and suggested we meet at a french restaurant on ventura boulevard i told him we had less than an hour and that his mother should meet us at four green fields i didnt like the idea of bringing them into my sanctuary but i knew we could eat there quickly and be back to court on time the food probably wasnt up to the standards of the french bistro on ventura but i wasnt worried about that when i got up and turned from the defense table i saw the rows of the gallery were empty everybody had hustled out to lunch only minton was waiting by the rail for me can i talk to you for a minute he asked sure we waited until roulet had gone through the gate and left the courtroom before either one of us spoke i knew what was coming it was customary for the prosecutor to throw out a lowball disposition at the first sign of trouble minton knew he had trouble the mainevent witness was a draw at best whats up i said i was thinking about what you said about the thousand razors and and well i want to make you an offer youre new at this kid dont you need somebody in charge to approve a plea agreement i have some authority okay then give me what you are authorized to offer ill drop it all down to an aggravated assault with gbi and ill go down to four the offer was a substantial reduction but roulet if he took it would still be sentenced to four years in prison the main concession was that it knocked the case out of sex crime status roulet would not have to register with local authorities as a sex offender after he got out of prison i looked at him as if he had just insulted my mothers memory i think thats a little strong ted considering how your ace just held up on the stand did you see the juror who is always carrying the bible he looked like he was about to shit the good book when she was testifying minton didnt respond i could tell he hadnt even noticed a juror carrying a bible i dont know i said its my duty to bring your offer to my client and i will do that but im also going to tell him hed be a fool to take it okay then what do you want a case like this theres only one verdict ted im going to tell him he should ride it out i think its clear sailing from here have a good lunch i left him there at the gate halfway expecting him to shout a new offer to my back as i went down the center aisle of the gallery but minton held his ground that offers good only until onethirty haller he called after me an odd tone in his voice i raised a hand and waved without looking back as i went through the courtroom door i was sure that what i had heard was the sound of desperation creeping into his voice thirtyfive after we came back into court from four green fields i purposely ignored minton i wanted to keep him guessing as long as possible it was all part of the plan to push him in a direction i wanted him and the trial to go when we were all seated at the tables and ready for the judge i finally looked over at him waited for the eye contact and then just shook my head no deal he nodded trying his best to give me a show of confidence in his case and confusion over my clients decision one minute later the judge took the bench brought out the jury and minton promptly folded his tent mr minton do you have another witness the judge asked your honor at this time the state rests there was the slightest hesitation in fullbrights response she stared at minton for just a second longer than she should have i think it sent a message of surprise to the jury she then looked over at me mr haller are you ready to proceed the routine procedure would be to ask the judge for a directed verdict of acquittal at the end of the states case but i didnt fearing that this could be the rare occasion that the request was granted i couldnt let the case end yet i told the judge i was ready to proceed with a defense my first witness was mary alice windsor she was escorted into the courtroom by cecil dobbs who then took a seat in the front row of the gallery windsor was wearing a powder blue suit with a chiffon blouse she had a regal bearing as she crossed in front of the bench and took a seat in the witness box nobody would have guessed she had eaten shepherds pie for lunch i very quickly went through the routine identifiers and established her relationship by both blood and business to louis roulet i then asked the judge for permission to show the witness the knife the prosecution had entered as evidence in the case permission granted i went to the court clerk to retrieve the weapon which was still wrapped in a clear plastic evidence bag it was folded so that the initials on the blade were visible i took it to the witness box and put it down in front of the witness mrs windsor do you recognize this knife she picked up the evidence bag and attempted to smooth the plastic over the blade so she could look for and read the initials yes i do she finally said its my sons knife and how is it that you would recognize a knife owned by your son because he showed it to me on more than one occasion i knew he always carried it and sometimes it came in handy at the office when our brochures came in and we needed to cut the packing straps it was very sharp how long did he have the knife four years you seem pretty exact about that i am how can you be so sure because he got it for protection four years ago almost exactly protection from what mrs windsor in our business we often show homes to complete strangers sometimes we are the only ones in the home with these strangers there has been more than one incident of a realtor being robbed or hurt or even murdered or raped as far as you know was louis ever the victim of such a crime not personally no but he knew someone who had gone into a home and that happened to them what happened she got raped and robbed by a man with a knife louis was the one who found her after it was over the first thing he did was go out and get a knife for protection after that why a knife why not a gun he told me that at first he was going to get a gun but he wanted something he could always carry and not be noticeable with so he got a knife and he got me one too thats how i know it was almost exactly four years ago that he got this she held the bag up containing the knife mines exactly the same only the initials are different we both have been carrying them ever since so would it seem to you that if your son was carrying that knife on the night of march sixth then that would be perfectly normal behavior from him minton objected saying i had not built the proper foundation for windsor to answer the question and the judge sustained it mary windsor being unschooled in criminal law assumed that the judge was allowing her to answer he carried it every day she said march sixth would have been no dif mrs windsor the judge boomed i sustained the objection that means you do not answer the jury will disregard her answer im sorry windsor said in a weak voice next question mr haller the judge ordered thats all i have your honor thank you mrs windsor mary windsor started to get up but the judge admonished her again telling her to stay seated i returned to my seat as minton got up from his i scanned the gallery and saw no recognizable faces save that of c c dobbs he gave me an encouraging smile which i ignored mary windsors direct testimony had been perfect in terms of her adhering to the choreography we had worked up at lunch she had succinctly delivered to the jury the explanation for the knife yet she had also left in her testimony a minefield that minton would have to cross her direct testimony had covered no more than i had provided minton in a discovery summary if he strayed from it he would quickly hear the deadly click under his foot this incident that inspired your son to start carrying around a fiveinch folding knife when exactly was that it happened on june ninth in two thousand and one youre sure absolutely i turned in my seat so i could more fully see mintons face i was reading him he thought he had something windsor s exact memory of a date was obvious indication of planted testimony he was excited i could tell was there a newspaper story about this supposed attack on a fellow realtor no there wasnt was there a police investigation no there wasnt and yet you know the exact date how is that mrs windsor were you given this date before testifying here no i know the date because i will never forget the day i was attacked she waited a moment i saw at least three of the jurors open their mouths silently minton did the same i could almost hear the click my son will never forget it either windsor continued when he came looking for me and found me in that house i was tied up naked there was blood it was traumatic for him to see me that way i think that was one of the reasons he took to carrying a knife i think in some ways he wished he had gotten there earlier and been able to stop it i see minton said staring down at his notes he froze unsure how to proceed he didnt want to raise his foot for fear that the mine would detonate and blow it off mr minton anything else the judge asked a not so well disguised note of sarcasm in her voice one moment your honor minton said minton gathered himself reviewed his notes and tried to salvage something mrs windsor did you or your son call the police after he found you no we didnt louis wanted to but i did not i thought that it would only further the trauma so we have no official police documentation of this crime correct thats correct i knew that minton wanted to carry it further and ask if she had sought medical treatment after the attack but sensing another trap he didnt ask the question so what you are saying here is that we only have your word that this attack even occurred your word and your sons if he chooses to testify it did occur i live with it each and every day but we only have you who says so she looked at the prosecutor with deadpan eyes is that a question mrs windsor you are here to help your son correct if i can i know him as a good man who would not have committed this despicable crime you would be willing to do anything and everything in your power to save your son from conviction and possible prison wouldnt you but i wouldnt lie about something like this oath or no oath i wouldnt lie but you want to save your son dont you yes and saving him means lying for him doesnt it no it does not thank you mrs windsor minton quickly returned to his seat i had only one question on redirect mrs windsor how old were you when this attack occurred i was fiftyfour i sat back down minton had nothing further and windsor was excused i asked the judge to allow her to sit in the gallery for the remainder of the trial now that her testimony was concluded without an objection from minton the request was granted my next witness was an lapd detective named david lambkin who was a national expert on sex crimes and had worked on the real estate rapist investigation in brief questioning i established the facts of the case and the five reported cases of rape that were investigated i quickly got to the five key questions i needed to bolster mary windsors testimony detective lambkin what was the age range of the known victims of the rapist these were all professional women who were pretty successful they tended to be older than your average rape victim i believe the youngest was twentynine and the oldest was fiftynine so a woman who was fiftyfour years old would have fallen within the rapists target profile correct yes can you tell the jury when the first reported attack occurred and when the last reported attack occurred yes the first was october one two thousand and the last one was july thirtieth of two thousand and one so june ninth of two thousand and one was well within the span of this rapists attacks on women in the real estate business correct yes correct in the course of your investigation of this case did you come to a conclusion or belief that there were more than five rapes committed by this individual minton objected saying the question called for speculation the judge sustained the objection but it didnt matter the question was what was important and the jury seeing the prosecutor keeping the answer from them was the payoff minton surprised me on cross he recovered enough from the misstep with windsor to hit lambkin with three solid questions with answers favorable to the prosecution detective lambkin did the task force investigating these rapes issue any kind of warning to women working in the real estate business yes we did we sent out fliers on two occasions the first went to all licensed real estate businesses in the area and the next mailout went to all licensed real estate brokers individually male and female did these mailouts contain information about the rapists description and methods yes they did so if someone wished to concoct a story about being attacked by this rapist the mailouts would have provided all the information needed correct that is a possibility yes nothing further your honor minton proudly sat down and lambkin was excused when i had nothing further i asked the judge for a few minutes to confer with my client and then leaned in close to roulet okay this is it i said youre all we have left unless theres something you havent told me youre clean and there isnt much minton can come back at you with you should be safe up there unless you let him get to you are you still cool with this roulet had said all along that he would testify and deny the charges he had reiterated his desire again at lunch he demanded it i always viewed the risks of letting a client testify as evenly split anything he said could come back to haunt him if the prosecution could bend it to the states favor but i also knew that no matter what admonishments were given to a jury about a defendants right to remain silent the jury always wanted to hear the defendant say he didnt do it you take that away from the jury and they might hold a grudge i want to do it roulet whispered i can handle the prosecutor i pushed my chair back and stood up the defense calls louis ross roulet your honor thirtysix louis roulet moved toward the witness box quickly like a basketball player pulled off the bench and sent to the scorers table to check into the game he looked like a man anxious for the opportunity to defend himself he knew this posture would not be lost on the jury after dispensing with the preliminaries i got right down to the issues of the case under my questioning roulet freely admitted that he had gone to morgans on the night of march to seek female companionship he said he wasnt specifically looking to engage the services of a prostitute but was not against the possibility i had been with women i had to pay before he said so i wouldnt have been against it he testified that he had no conscious eye contact with regina campo before she approached him at the bar he said that she was the aggressor but at the time that didnt bother him he said the solicitation was openended she said she would be free after ten and he could come by if he was not otherwise engaged roulet described efforts made over the next hour at morgans and then at the lamplighter to find a woman he would not have to pay but said he was unsuccessful he then drove to the address campo had given him and knocked on the door who answered she did she opened the door a crack and looked out at me regina campo the woman who testified this morning yes thats right could you see her whole face through the opening in the door no she only opened up a crack and i couldnt see her only her left eye and a little bit of that side of her face how did the door open was this crack through which you could see her on the right or left side as i was looking at the door the opening would have been on the right so lets make sure we make this clear the opening was on the right correct correct so if she were standing behind the door and looking through the opening she would be looking at you with her left eye that is correct did you see her right eye no so if she had a bruise or a cut or any damage on the right side of her face could you have seen it no okay so what happened next she saw it was me and she said come in she opened the door wider but still sort of stood behind it you couldnt see her not completely she was using the edge of the door as sort of a block what happened next well it was kind of like an entry area a vestibule and she pointed through an archway to the living room i went the way she pointed did this mean that she was then behind you yes when i turned toward the living room she was behind me did she close the door i think so i heard it close and then what something hit me on the back of my head and i went down i blacked out do you know how long you were out no i think it was a while but none of the police or anybody ever told me what do you remember when you regained consciousness i remember having a hard time breathing and when i opened my eyes there was somebody sitting on me i was on my back and he was sitting on me i tried to move and that was when i realized somebody was sitting on my legs too what happened next they took turns telling me not to move and one of them told me they had my knife and if i tried to move or escape he would use it on me did there come a time that the police came and you were arrested yes a few minutes later the police were there they handcuffed me and made me stand up that was when i saw i had blood on my jacket what about your hand i couldnt see it because it was handcuffed behind my back but i heard one of the men who had been sitting on me tell the police officer that there was blood on my hand and then the officer put a bag over it i felt that how did the blood get on your hand and jacket all i know is that somebody put it on there because i didnt are you lefthanded no i am not you didnt strike ms campo with your left fist no i did not did you threaten to rape her no i did not did you tell her you were going to kill her if she didnt cooperate with you no i did not i was hoping for some of the fire i had seen on that first day in c c dobbss office but roulet was calm and controlled i decided that before i finished with him on direct i needed to push things a little to get some of that anger back i had told him at lunch i wanted to see it and wasnt sure what he was doing or where it had gone are you angry about being charged with attacking ms campo of course i am why he opened his mouth but didnt speak he seemed outraged that i would ask such a question finally he responded what do you mean why have you ever been accused of something you didnt do and theres nothing you can do about it but wait just wait for weeks and months until you finally get a chance to go to court and say youve been set up but then you have to wait even longer while the prosecutor puts on a bunch of liars and you have to listen to their lies and just wait your chance of course it makes you angry i am innocent i did not do this it was perfect to the point and playing to anybody who had ever been falsely accused of anything there was more i could ask but i reminded myself of the rule get in and get out less is always more i sat down if i decided there was anything i had missed i would clean it up on redirect i looked at the judge nothing further your honor minton was up and ready before i even got back to my seat he moved to the lectern without breaking his steely glare away from roulet he was showing the jury what he thought of this man his eyes were like lasers shooting across the room he gripped the sides of the lectern so hard his knuckles were white it was all a show for the jury you deny touching ms campo he said thats right roulet retorted according to you she just punched herself or had a man she had never met before that night punch her lights out for her as part of this setup is that correct i dont know who did it all i know is that i didnt but what you are saying is that this woman regina campo is lying she came into this courtroom today and flat out lied to the judge and the jury and the whole wide world minton punctuated the sentence by shaking his head with disgust all i know is that i did not do the things she said i did the only explanation is that one of us is lying its not me that will be for the jury to decide wont it yes and this knife you supposedly got for your own protection are you telling this jury that the victim in this case somehow knew you had a knife and used it as part of the setup i dont know what she knew i had never shown the knife to her or in a bar where she would have been so i dont see how she could have known about it i think that when she went into my pocket for the money she found the knife i always keep my knife and money in the same pocket oh so now you have her stealing money out of your pocket as well when does this end with you mr roulet i had four hundred dollars with me when i was arrested it was gone someone took it rather than try to pinpoint roulet on the money minton was wise enough to know that no matter how he handled it he would be facing a breakeven proposition at best if he tried to make a case that roulet never had the money and that his plan was to attack and rape campo rather than pay her then he knew i would trot out roulets tax returns which would throw serious doubt on the idea that he couldnt afford to pay a prostitute it was an avenue of testimony commonly referred to by lawyers as a cluster fuck and he was staying away he moved on to his finish in dramatic style minton held up the evidence photo of regina campos beaten and bruised face so regina campo is a liar he said yes she had this done to her or maybe even did it herself i dont know who did it but not you no it wasnt me i wouldnt do that to a woman i wouldnt hurt a woman roulet pointed to the photo minton had continued to hold up no woman deserves that he said i leaned forward and waited roulet had just said the line i had told him to somehow find a way of putting into one of his answers during testimony no woman deserves that it was now up to minton to take the bait he was smart he had to understand that roulet had just opened a door what do you mean by deserves do you think crimes of violence come down to a matter of whether a victim gets what they deserve no i didnt mean it that way i meant that no matter what she does for a living she shouldnt have been beaten like that nobody deserves to have that happen to them minton brought down the arm that held the photo he looked at it himself for a moment and then looked back up at roulet mr roulet i have nothing more to ask you thirtyseven istill felt that i was winning the razor fight i had done everything possible to maneuver minton into a position in which he had only one choice it was now time to see if doing everything possible had been enough after the young prosecutor sat down i chose not to ask my client another question he had held up well under mintons attack and i felt the wind was in our sails i stood up and looked back at the clock on the upper rear wall of the courtroom it was only threethirty i then looked back at the judge your honor the defense rests she nodded and looked over my head at the clock she told the jury to take the midafternoon break once the jurors were out of the courtroom she looked at the prosecution table where minton had his head down and was writing mr minton the prosecutor looked up were still in session pay attention does the state have rebuttal minton stood your honor i would ask that we adjourn for the day so that the state has time to consider rebuttal witnesses mr minton we still have at least ninety minutes to go today i told you i wanted to be productive today where are your witnesses frankly your honor i was not anticipating the defense resting after only three witnesses and i he gave fair warning of that in his opening statement yes but still the case has moved faster than anticipated were a half day ahead i would beg the courts indulgence i would be hardpressed to get the rebuttal witness i am considering even into court before six oclock tonight i turned and looked at roulet who had returned to the seat next to mine i nodded to him and winked with my left eye so the judge would not see the gesture it looked like minton had swallowed the bait now i just had to make sure the judge didnt make him spit it out i stood up your honor the defense has no objection to the delay maybe we can use the time to prepare closing arguments and instructions to the jury the judge first looked at me with a puzzled frown it was a rarity that the defense would not object to prosecutorial foot dragging but then the seed i had planted began to bloom you may have an idea there mr haller if we adjourn early today i will expect that we will go to closing statements directly after rebuttal no further delays except to consider jury instructions is that understood mr minton yes your honor i will be ready mr haller it was my idea judge ill be ready very well then we have a plan as soon as the jurors are back i will dismiss them for the day theyll beat the traffic and tomorrow things will run so smoothly and quickly that i have no doubt they will be deliberating by the afternoon session she looked at minton and then me as if daring one of us to disagree with her when we didnt she got up and left the bench probably in pursuit of a cigarette twenty minutes later the jury was heading home and i was gathering my things at the defense table minton stepped over and said can i talk to you i looked at roulet and told him to head out with his mother and dobbs and that i would call him if i needed him for anything but i want to talk to you too he said about what about everything how do you think i did up there you did good and everything is going good i think were in good shape i then nodded my head toward the prosecution table where minton had returned and dropped my voice to a whisper he knows it too hes about to make another offer should i stick around to hear what it is i shook my head no it doesnt matter what it is theres only one verdict right thats right he patted my shoulder when he got up and i had to steady myself not to shrink away from the touch dont touch me louis i said you want to do something for me then give me my fucking gun back he didnt reply he just smiled and moved toward the gate after he was gone i turned to look at minton he now had the gleam of desperation in his eye he needed a convictionany convictionon this case whats up i have another offer im listening ill drop it down further take it down to simple assault six months in county the way they empty that place out at the end of every month he probably wont do sixty days actual i nodded he was talking about the federal mandate to stop overcrowding in the county jail system it didnt matter what was handed down in a courtroom out of necessity sentences were often drastically cut it was a good offer but i didnt show anything i knew the offer had to have come from the second floor minton wouldnt have had the authority to go so low he takes that and shell rob him blind in civil i said i doubt hell go for it thats a damn good offer minton said there was a hint of outrage in his voice my guess was that the observers report card on minton was not good and he was under orders to close the case out with a guilty plea trash the trial and the judges and jurys time just get that plea the van nuys office didnt like losing cases and we were only two months removed from the robert blake fiasco it pleaded them out when the going got rough minton could go as low as he needed to go just as long as he got something roulet had to go downeven if it was only for sixty days actual maybe from your side of things its a damn good offer but it still means i have to convince a client to plead to something he says he didnt do then on top of that the dispo still opens the door to civil liability so while hes sitting up there in county trying to protect his asshole for sixty days reggie campo and her lawyer are down here taking him to the cleaners you see its not so good when you look at it from his angle if it was left to me id ride the trial out i think were winning i know weve got the bible guy so weve got a hanger at minimum but who knows maybe weve got all twelve minton slapped his hand down on his table what the fuck are you talking about you know he did this thing haller and six monthslet alone sixty daysfor what he did to that woman is a joke its a fucking travesty that ill lose sleep over but theyve been watching and think youve got the jury so i have to do it i closed my briefcase with an authoritative snap and stood up then i hope you got something good for rebuttal ted because youre going to get your wish for a jury verdict and i have to tell you man youre looking more and more like a guy who came naked to a razor fight better get your hands off your nuts and fight back i headed through the gate halfway to the doors at the back of the courtroom i stopped and looked back at him hey you know something if you lose sleep over this or any other case then you gotta quit the job and go do something else because youre not going to make it ted minton sat at his table staring straight ahead at the empty bench he didnt acknowledge what i had said i left him there thinking about it i thought i had played it right id find out in the morning i went back over to four green fields to work on my closing i wouldnt need the two hours the judge had given us i ordered a guinness at the bar and took it over to one of the tables to sit by myself table service didnt start again until six i sketched out some basic notes but i instinctively knew i would largely be reacting to the states presentation in pretrial motions minton had already asked and received permission from judge fullbright to use a powerpoint presentation to illustrate the case to the jury it had become all the rage with young prosecutors to put up the screen and flash computer graphics on it as if the jurors couldnt be trusted to think and make connections on their own it now had to be fed to them like tv my clients rarely had the money to pay my fees let alone for powerpoint presentations roulet was an exception through his mother he could afford to hire francis ford coppola to put together a powerpoint for him if he wanted it but i never even brought it up i was strictly old school i liked going into the ring on my own minton could throw whatever he wanted up on the big blue screen when it was my turn i wanted the jury looking only at me if i couldnt convince them nothing from a computer could either at i called maggie mcpherson at her office its quitting time i said maybe for bigshot defense pros us public servants have to work till after dark why dont you take a break and come meet me for a guinness and some shepherds pie then you can go back to work and finish up no haller i cant do that besides i know what you want i laughed there was never a time that she didnt think she knew what i wanted most of the time she was right but not this time yeah what do i want youre going to try to corrupt me again and find out what minton is up to not a chance mags minton is an open book smithsons observer is giving him bad marks so smithsons told him to fold the tent get something and get out but mintons been working on his little powerpoint closing and wants to gamble take it all the way to the house besides that hes got genuine outrage in his blood so he doesnt like the idea of folding up neither do i smithsons always afraid of losingespecially since blake he always wants to sell short you cant be that way i always said they lost the blake case the minute they passed you over you tell em maggie if i ever get the chance someday she didnt like dwelling on her own stalled career she moved on so you sound chipper she said yesterday you were a murder suspect today youve got the da by the short hairs what changed nothing its just the calm before the storm i guess hey let me ask you something have you ever put a rush on ballistics what kind of ballistics matching casing to casing and slug to slug depends on who is doing itwhich department i mean but if they put a real rush on it they could have something in twentyfour hours i felt the dull thud of dread drop into my stomach i knew i could be on borrowed time most of the time though that doesnt happen she continued two or three days is what it will usually take on a rush and if you want the whole packagecasing and slug comparisonsit could take longer because the slug could be damaged and tough to read they have to work with it i nodded i didnt think any of that could help me i knew they had recovered a bullet casing at the crime scene if lankford and sobel got a match on that to the casing of a bullet fired fifty years ago from mickey cohens gun they would come for me and worry about the slug comparison later you still there maggie asked yeah i was just thinking of something you dont sound so chipper anymore you want to talk about this michael no not right now but if i end up needing a good lawyer you know who ill call thatll be the day you might be surprised i let some more silence into the conversation just having her on the other end of the line was a calming comfort i liked it haller i should get back to my job now okay maggie put those bad guys away i will good night i closed the phone and thought about things for a few moments then opened it up again and called the sheraton universal to see if they had a room available i had decided that as a precaution i would not go home this night there might be two detectives from glendale waiting for me wednesday may thirtyeight after a sleepless night in a bad hotel bed i got to the courthouse early on wednesday morning and found no welcoming party no glendale detectives waiting with smiles and a warrant for my arrest a flash of relief went through me as i made my way through the metal detector i was wearing the same suit i had worn the day before but was hoping no one would notice i did have a fresh shirt and tie on i keep spares in the trunk of the lincoln for summer days when im working up in the desert and the cars air conditioner can get overwhelmed when i got to judge fullbrights courtroom i was surprised to find i was not the first of the trials players to arrive minton was in the gallery setting up the screen for his powerpoint presentation because the courtroom had been designed before the era of computerenhanced presentations there was no place to put a twelvefoot screen in comfortable view of the jury the judge and the lawyers a good chunk of the gallery space would be taken up by the screen and any spectator who sat behind it wouldnt get to see the show bright and early i said to minton he looked over from his work and seemed a bit surprised to see me in early as well have to work out the logistics of this thing its kind of a pain you could always do it the oldfashioned way and just look at the jury and talk directly to them no thanks i like this better did you talk to your client about the offer yeah no sale looks like we ride this one to the end i put my briefcase down on the defense table and wondered if the fact that minton was setting up for his closing argument meant he had decided against mounting any kind of rebuttal a sharp jab of panic went through me i looked over at the states table and saw nothing that gave me a clue to what minton was planning i knew i could flat out ask him but i did not want to give away my appearance of disinterested confidence instead i sauntered over to the bailiffs desk to talk to bill meehan the deputy who ran fullbrights court i saw on his desk a spread of paperwork he would have the courtroom calendar as well as the list of custodies bused to the courthouse that morning bill im going to grab a cup of coffee you want something no man but thanks im set on caffeine for a while at least i smiled and nodded hey is that the custody list can i take a look and see if any of my clients are on it sure meehan handed me several pages that were stapled together it was a listing by name of every inmate that was now housed in the courthouses jails following the name was the courtroom each prisoner was headed to acting as nonchalant as i could i scanned the list and quickly found the name dwayne jeffery corliss on it mintons snitch was in the building and was headed to fullbrights court i almost let out a sigh of relief but kept it all inside it looked like minton was going to play things the way i had hoped and planned something wrong meehan asked i looked at him and handed back the list no why i dont know you look like something happened is all nothings happened yet but it will i left the courtroom and went down to the cafeteria on the second floor when i was in line paying for my coffee i saw maggie mcpherson walk in and go directly to the coffee urns after i paid i walked up behind her as she was mixing powder from a pink packet into her coffee sweet n low i said my exwife used to tell me thats how she liked it she turned and saw me stop haller but she smiled stop haller or ill holler i said she used to have to say that too a lot what are you doing shouldnt you be up on six getting ready to pull the plug on mintons powerpoint im not worried in fact you ought to come up and check it out old school versus new school a battle for the ages hardly by the way isnt that the same suit you were wearing yesterday yeah its my lucky suit but how do you know what i was wearing yesterday oh i popped my head in fullbites court for a couple minutes yesterday you were too busy questioning your client to notice i was secretly pleased that she would even notice my suits i knew it meant something so then why dont you pop your head in again this morning today i cant im too busy whatve you got im taking over a murder one for andy seville hes quitting to go private and yesterday they divided up his cases i got the good one nice does the defendant need a lawyer no way haller im not losing another one to you just kidding ive got my hands full she snapped a top onto her cup and picked it up off the counter using a layer of napkins as insulation against its heat same here so id wish you good luck today but i cant yeah i know gotta keep the company line just cheer up minton when he comes down with his hat in his hand ill try she left the cafeteria and i walked over to an empty table i still had fifteen minutes before the trial was supposed to start up again i pulled out my cell and called my second exwife lorna its me were in play with corliss are you set im ready okay im just checking ill call you good luck today mickey thanks ill need it you be ready for the next call i closed the phone and was about to get up when i saw lapd detective howard kurlen cutting through the tables toward me the man who put jesus menendez in prison didnt look like he was stopping in for a peanut butter and sardine sandwich he was carrying a folded document he got to my table and dropped it in front of my coffee cup what is this shit he demanded i started unfolding the document even though i knew what it was looks like a subpoena detective i wouldve thought youd know what it is you know what i mean haller whats the game ive got nothing to do with that case up there and i dont want to be a part of your bullshit its no game and its no bullshit youve been subpoenaed as a rebuttal witness to rebut what i told you and you already know i didnt have a goddamn thing to do with that case its marty bookers and i just talked to him and he said its gotta be a mistake i nodded like i wanted to be accommodating ill tell you what go on up to the courtroom and take a seat if its a mistake ill get it straightened out as soon as i can i doubt youll be here another hour ill get you out of there and back chasing the bad guys how about this i leave now and you straighten it out whenever the fuck you want i cant do that detective that is a valid and lawful subpoena and you must appear in that courtroom unless otherwise discharged i told you i will do that as soon as i can the states got one witness and then its my turn and ill take care of it this is such bullshit he turned from me and stalked back through the cafeteria toward the doorway luckily he had left the subpoena with me because it was phony i had never registered it with the court clerk and the scribbled signature at the bottom was mine bullshit or not i didnt think kurlen was leaving the courthouse he was a man who understood duty and the law he lived by it it was what i was counting on he would be in the courtroom until discharged or until he understood why i had called him there thirtynine at the judge put the jury in the box and immediately proceeded with the days business i glanced back at the gallery and caught sight of kurlen in the back row he had a pensive if not angry cast to his face he was close to the door and i didnt know how long he would last i was figuring i would need that whole hour i had told him about i glanced further around the room and saw that lankford and sobel were sitting on a bench next to the bailiffs desk that was designated for law enforcement personnel their faces revealed nothing but they still put the pause in me i wondered if i would even get the hour i needed mr minton the judge intoned does the state have any rebuttal i turned back to the court minton stood up adjusted his jacket and then seemed to hesitate and brace himself before responding yes your honor the state calls dwayne jeffery corliss as a rebuttal witness i stood up and noticed to my right that meehan the bailiff had stood up as well he was going to go into the courtroom lockup to retrieve corliss your honor i said who is dwayne jeffery corliss and why wasnt i told about him before now deputy meehan hold on a minute fullbright said meehan stood frozen with the key to the lockup door poised in his hand the judge then apologized to the jury but told them they had to go back into the deliberation room until recalled after they filed through the door behind the box the judge turned her focus onto minton mr minton do you want to tell us about your witness dwayne corliss is a cooperating witness who spoke with mr roulet when he was in custody following his arrest bullshit roulet barked i didnt talk to be quiet mr roulet the judge boomed mr haller instruct your client on the danger of outbursts in my courtroom thank you your honor i was still standing i leaned down to whisper in roulets ear that was perfect i said now be cool and ill take it from here he nodded and leaned back he angrily folded his arms across his chest i straightened up im sorry your honor but i do share my clients outrage over this lastditch effort by the state this is the first we have heard of mr corliss i would like to know when he came forward with this supposed conversation minton had remained standing i thought it was the first time in the trial that we had stood side by side and argued to the judge mr corliss first contacted the office through a prosecutor who handled the first appearance of the defendant minton said however that information was not passed on to me until yesterday when in a staff meeting i was asked why i had never acted on the information this was a lie but not one i wanted to expose to do so would reveal maggie mcphersons slip on st patricks day and it might also derail my plan i had to be careful i needed to argue vigorously against corliss taking the stand but i also needed to lose the argument i put my best look of outrage on my face this is incredible your honor just because the das office has a communication problem my client has to suffer the consequences of not being informed that the state had a witness against him this man should clearly not be allowed to testify its too late to bring him in now your honor minton said jumping in quickly i have had no time to interview or depose mr corliss myself because i was preparing my closing i simply made arrangements for him to be brought here today his testimony is key to the states case because it serves as rebuttal to mr roulets selfserving statements to not allow his testimony is a serious disservice to the state i shook my head and smiled in frustration with his last line minton was threatening the judge with the loss of the das backing should she ever face an election with an opposing candidate mr haller the judge asked anything before i rule i just want my objection on the record so noted if i were to give you time to investigate and interview mr corliss how much would you need a week now minton put on the fake smile and shook his head thats ridiculous your honor do you want to go back and talk to him the judge asked me ill allow it no your honor as far as im concerned all jailhouse snitches are liars it would do me no good to interview him because anything that comes out of his mouth would be a lie anything besides its not what he has to say its what others have to say about him thats what i would need time for then i am going to rule that he can testify your honor i said if you are going to allow him into this courtroom could i ask one indulgence for the defense what is that mr haller i would like to step into the hallway and make a quick phone call to an investigator it will take me less than a minute the judge thought for a moment and then nodded go ahead i will bring the jury in while you do it thank you i hurried through the gate and down the middle aisle my eyes caught those of howard kurlen and he gave me one of his best smirks in the hallway i speeddialed lorna taylors cell phone and she answered right away okay how far away are you about fifteen minutes did you remember the printout and the tape got it all right here i looked at my watch it was a quarter to ten okay well were in play here dont delay getting here but then i want you to wait out in the hall outside the courtroom then at tenfifteen come into court and give it to me if im crossing the witness just sit in the first row and wait until i notice you got it i closed the phone and went back into the courtroom the jury was seated and meehan was leading a man in a gray jumpsuit through the lockup door dwayne corliss was a thin man with stringy hair that wasnt getting washed enough in the lockdown drug program at countyusc he wore a blue plastic hospital id band on his wrist i recognized him he was the man who had asked me for a business card when i interviewed roulet in the holding cell my first day on the case corliss was led by meehan to the witness box and the court clerk swore him in minton took over the show from there mr corliss were you arrested on march fifth of this year yes the police arrested me for burglary and possession of drugs are you incarcerated now corliss looked around um no i dont think so im just in the courtroom i heard kurlens coarse laugh behind me but nobody joined in no i mean are you currently being held in jail when you are not here in court im in a lockdown drug treatment program in the jail ward at los angeles countyusc medical center are you addicted to drugs yes im addicted to heroin but at the moment i am straight i havent had any since i got arrested more than sixty days thats right do you recognize the defendant in this case corliss looked over at roulet and nodded yes i do why is that because i met him in lockup after i got arrested you are saying that after you were arrested you came into close proximity to the defendant louis roulet yes the next day how did that happen well we were both in van nuys jail but in different wards then when we got bused over here to the courts we were together first in the bus and then in the tank and then when we were brought into the courtroom for first appearance we were together all of that time when you say together what do you mean well we sort of stuck close because we were the only white guys in the group we were in now did you talk at all while you were together for all of that time corliss nodded his head and at the same time roulet shook his i touched my clients arm to caution him to make no demonstrations yes we talked corliss said about what mostly about cigarettes we both needed them but they dont let you smoke in the jail corliss made a whatareyougoingtodo gesture with both hands and a few of the jurorsprobably smokerssmiled and nodded did you reach a point where you asked mr roulet what got him into jail minton asked yes i did what did he say i quickly stood up and objected but just as quickly was overruled what did he tell you mr corliss minton prompted well first he asked me why i was there and i told him so then i asked him why he was in and he said for giving a bitch exactly what she deserved those were his words yes did he elaborate further on what he meant by that no not really not on that i leaned forward waiting for minton to ask the next obvious question but he didnt he moved on now mr corliss have you been promised anything by me or the district attorneys office in return for your testimony nope i just thought it was the right thing to do what is the status of your case i still got the charges against me but it looks like if i complete my program ill be able to get a break on them the drugs at least i dont know about the burglary yet but i have made no promise of help in that regard correct no sir you havent has anyone else from the district attorneys office made any promises no sir i have no further questions i sat unmoving and just staring at corliss my pose was that of a man who was angry but didnt know exactly what to do about it finally the judge prompted me into action mr haller crossexamination yes your honor i stood up glancing back at the door as if hoping a miracle would walk through it i then checked the big clock on the back door and saw it was five minutes after ten i noticed as i turned back to the witness that i had not lost kurlen he was still in the back row and he still had the same smirk on his face i realized that it might have been his natural look i turned to the witness mr corliss how old are you fortythree you go by dwayne thats right any other names people called me dj when i was growing up everybody called me that and where did you grow up mesa arizona mr corliss how many times have you been arrested before minton objected but the judge overruled i knew she was going to give me a lot of room with this witness since i was the one who had supposedly been sandbagged how many times have you been arrested before mr corliss i asked again i think about seven so youve been in a number of jails in your time havent you you could say that all in los angeles county mostly but i got arrested over in phoenix before too so you know how the system works dont you i just try to survive and sometimes surviving means ratting out your fellow inmates doesnt it your honor minton said standing to object take a seat mr minton fullbright said i gave you a lot of leeway bringing this witness in mr haller gets his share of it now the witness will answer the question the stenographer read the question back to corliss i suppose so how many times have you snitched on another inmate i dont know a few times how many times have you testified in a court proceeding for the prosecution would that include my own cases no mr corliss for the prosecution how many times have you testified against a fellow inmate for the prosecution i think this is my fourth time i looked surprised and aghast although i was neither so you are a pro arent you you could almost say your occupation is drugaddicted jailhouse snitch i just tell the truth if people tell me things that are bad then i feel obligated to report it but you try to get people to tell you things dont you no not really i guess im just a friendly guy a friendly guy so what you expect this jury to believe is that a man you didnt know would just come out of the blue and tell youa perfect strangerthat he gave a bitch exactly what she deserved is that correct its what he said so he just mentioned that to you and then you both just went back to talking about cigarettes after that is that right not exactly not exactly what do you mean by not exactly he also told me he did it before he said he got away with it before and he would get away with it now he was bragging about it because with the other time he said he killed the bitch and got away with it i froze for a moment i then glanced at roulet who sat as still as a statue with surprise on his face and then back at the witness you i started and stopped acting like i was the man in the minefield who had just heard the click come from beneath my foot in my peripheral vision i noticed mintons body posture tightening mr haller the judge prompted i broke my stare from corliss and looked at the judge your honor i have no further questions at this time forty minton came up from his seat like a boxer coming out of his corner at his bleeding opponent redirect mr minton fullbright asked but he was already at the lectern absolutely your honor he looked at the jury as if to underline the importance of the upcoming exchange and then at corliss you said he was bragging mr corliss how so well he told me about this time he actually killed a girl and got away with it i stood up your honor this has nothing to do with the case at hand and it is rebuttal to no evidence previously offered by the defense the witness cant your honor minton cut in this is information brought forward by defense counsel the prosecution is entitled to pursue it i will allow it fullbright said i sat down and appeared dejected minton plowed ahead he was going just where i wanted him to go mr corliss did mr roulet offer any of the details of this previous incident in which he said he got away with killing a woman he called the girl a snake dancer she danced in some joint where she was like in a snake pit i felt roulet wrap his fingers around my biceps and squeeze his hot breath came into my ear what the fuck is this he whispered i turned to him i dont know what the hell did you tell this guy he whispered back through gritted teeth i didnt tell him anything this is a setup you set me up me what are you talking about i told you i couldnt get to this guy in lockdown if you didnt tell him this shit then somebody else did start thinking who i turned and looked up at minton standing at the lectern and continuing his questioning of corliss did mr roulet say anything else about the dancer he said he murdered he asked no thats all he really told me minton checked his notes to see if there was anything else then nodded to himself nothing further your honor the judge looked at me i could almost see sympathy on her face any recross from the defense with this witness before i could answer there was a noise from the rear of the courtroom and i turned to see lorna taylor entering she hurriedly walked down the aisle toward the gate your honor can i have a moment to confer with my staff hurry mr haller i met lorna at the gate and took from her a videotape with a single piece of paper wrapped around it with a rubber band as she had been told to do earlier she whispered in my ear this is where i act like i am whispering something very important into your ear she said how is it going i nodded as i took the rubber band off the tape and looked at the piece of paper perfect timing i whispered back im good to go can i stay and watch no i want you out of here i dont want anybody talking to you after this goes down i nodded and she nodded and then she left i went back to the lectern no recross your honor i sat down and waited roulet grabbed my arm what are you doing i pushed him away stop touching me we have new information we cant bring up on cross i focused on the judge any other witnesses mr minton she asked no your honor no further rebuttal the judge nodded the witness is excused meehan started crossing the courtroom to corliss the judge looked at me and i started to stand mr haller surrebuttal yes your honor the defense would like to call dj corliss back to the stand as surrebuttal meehan stopped in his tracks and all eyes were on me i held up the tape and the paper lorna had brought me i have new information on mr corliss your honor i could not have brought it up on cross very well proceed can i have a moment judge a short one i huddled with roulet again look i dont know what is going on but it doesnt matter i whispered what do you mean it doesnt matter are you listen to me it doesnt matter because i can still destroy him doesnt matter if he says you killed twenty women if hes a liar hes a liar if i destroy him none of it counts you understand roulet nodded and seemed to calm as he considered this then destroy him i will but i have to know is there anything else he knows that could come out is there anything i need to stay away from roulet whispered slowly as if explaining something to a child i dont know because i never talked to him im not that stupid as to have a discussion about cigarettes and murder with a total fucking stranger mr haller the judge prompted i looked up at her yes your honor carrying the tape and the paper that came with it i stood up to go back to the lectern on the way i took a quick glance across the gallery and saw that kurlen was gone i had no way of knowing how long he had stayed and what he had heard lankford was gone as well only sobel remained and she averted her eyes from mine i turned my attention to corliss mr corliss can you tell the jury exactly where you were when mr roulet supposedly made these revelations to you about murder and assault when we were together together where mr corliss well on the bus ride we didnt talk because we were in different seats but when we got to the courthouse we were in the same holding cell with about six other guys and we sat together there and we talked and those six other men all witnessed you and mr roulet talking correct they woulda had to they were there so what you are saying is that if i brought them in here one by one and asked them if they observed you and mr roulet talking they would confirm that well they should but but what mr corliss its just that they probably wouldnt talk thats all is it because nobody likes a snitch mr corliss corliss shrugged i guess so okay so lets make sure we have all of this straight you didnt talk with mr roulet on the bus but you did talk to him when you were in the holding cell together anywhere else yeah we talked when they moved us on out into the courtroom they stick you in this glassedin area and you wait for your case to be called we talked some in there too until his case got called he went first this is in the arraignment court where you had your first appearance before a judge thats right so you two were talking in the court and this is where mr roulet would have revealed his part in these crimes you described thats right do you remember specifically what he told you when you were in the courtroom no not really not specifics i think that might have been when he told me about the girl who was a dancer okay mr corliss i held the videotape up described it as video of louis roulets first appearance and asked to enter it as a defense exhibit minton tried to block it as something i had not produced during discovery but that was easily and quickly shot down by the judge without my having to argue the point he then objected again citing the lack of authentication of the tape i am just trying to save the court some time i said if needed i can have the man who took the film here in about an hour to authenticate it but i think that your honor will be able to authenticate it herself with just one look i am going to allow it the judge said once we see it the prosecution can object again if so inclined the television and video unit i had used previously was rolled into the courtroom and placed at an angle viewable by corliss the jury and the judge minton had to move to a chair to the side of the jury box to fully see it the tape was played it lasted twenty minutes and showed roulet from the moment he entered the courtroom custody area until he was led out after the bail hearing at no time did roulet talk to anyone but me when the tape was over i left the television in its place in case it was needed again i addressed corliss with a tinge of outrage in my voice mr corliss did you see a moment anywhere on that tape where you and mr roulet were talking uh no i yet you testified under oath and penalty of perjury that he confessed crimes to you while you were both in the courtroom didnt you i know i said that but i must have been mistaken he must have told me everything when we were in the holding cell you lied to the jury didnt you i didnt mean to that was the way i remembered it but i guess i was wrong i was coming off a high that morning things got confused it would seem that way let me ask you were things confused when you testified against frederic bentley back in nineteen eightynine corliss knitted his eyebrows together in concentration but didnt answer you remember frederic bentley dont you minton stood objection nineteen eightynine where is he going with this your honor i said this goes to the veracity of the witness it is certainly at issue here connect the dots mr haller the judge ordered in a hurry yes your honor i picked up the piece of paper and used it as a prop during my final questions of corliss in nineteen eightynine frederic bentley was convicted with your help of raping a sixteenyearold girl in her bed in phoenix do you remember this barely corliss said ive done a lot of drugs since then you testified at his trial that he confessed the crime to you while you were both together in a police station holding cell isnt that correct like i said its hard for me to remember back then the police put you in that holding cell because they knew you were willing to snitch even if you had to make it up didnt they my voice was rising with each question i dont remember that corliss responded but i dont make things up then eight years later the man who you testified had told you he did it was exonerated when a dna test determined that the semen from the girls attacker came from another man isnt that correct sir i dont i mean that was a long time ago do you remember being questioned by a reporter for the arizona star newspaper following the release of frederic bentley vaguely i remember somebody calling but i didnt say anything he told you that dna tests exonerated bentley and asked you whether you fabricated bentleys confession didnt he i dont know i held the paper i was clutching up toward the bench your honor i have an archival story from the arizona star newspaper here it is dated february ninth nineteen ninetyseven a member of my staff came across it when she googled the name dj corliss on her office computer i ask that it be marked as a defense exhibit and admitted into evidence as a historical document detailing an admission by silence my request set off a brutal clash with minton about authenticity and proper foundation ultimately the judge ruled in my favor she was showing some of the same outrage i was manufacturing and minton didnt stand much of a chance the bailiff took the computer printout to corliss and the judge instructed him to read it im not too good at reading judge he said try mr corliss corliss held the paper up and leaned his face into it as he read out loud please fullbright barked corliss cleared his throat and read in a halting voice a man wrongly convicted of rape was released saturday from the arizona correctional institution and vowed to seek justice for other inmates falsely accused frederic bentley thirtyfour served almost eight years in prison for attacking a sixteenyearold tempe girl the victim of the assault identified bentley a neighbor and blood tests matched his type to semen recovered from the victim after the attack the case was bolstered at trial by testimony from an informant who said bentley had confessed the crime to him while they were housed together in a holding cell bentley always maintained his innocence during the trial and even after his conviction once dna testing was accepted as valid evidence by courts in the state bentley hired attorneys to fight for such testing of semen collected from the victim of the attack a judge ordered the testing earlier this year and the resulting analysis proved bentley was not the attacker at a press conference yesterday at the arizona biltmore the newly freed bentley railed against jailhouse informants and called for a state law that would put strict guidelines on police and prosecutors who wish to use them the informant who claimed in sworn testimony that bentley admitted the rape was identified as dj corliss a mesa man who had been arrested on drug charges when told of bentleys exoneration and asked whether he fabricated his testimony against bentley corliss declined comment saturday at his press conference bentley charged that corliss was well known to the police as a snitch and was used in several cases to get close to suspects bentley claimed that corlisss practice was to make up confessions if he could not draw them out of the suspects the case against bentley okay mr corliss i said i think that is enough corliss put the printout down and looked at me like a child who has opened the door of a crowded closet and sees everything about to fall out on top of him were you ever charged with perjury in the bentley case i asked him no i wasnt he said forcefully as if that fact exonerated him of wrongdoing was that because the police were complicit with you in setting up mr bentley minton objected saying i am sure mr corliss would have no idea what went into the decision of whether or not to charge him with perjury fullbright sustained it but i didnt care i was so far ahead on this witness that there was no catching up i just moved on to the next question did any prosecutor or police officer ask you to get close to mr roulet and get him to confide in you no it was just luck of the draw i guess you were not told to get a confession from mr roulet no i was not i stared at him for a long moment with disgust in my eyes i have nothing further i carried the pose of anger with me to my seat and dropped the tape box angrily down in front of me before sitting down mr minton the judge asked i have nothing further he responded in a weak voice okay fullbright said quickly i am going to excuse the jury for an early lunch i would like you all back here at one oclock sharp she put on a strained smile and directed it at the jurors and kept it there until they had filed out of the courtroom it dropped off her face the moment the door was closed i want to see counsel in my chambers she said immediately she didnt wait for any response she left the bench so fast that her robe flowed up behind her like the black gown of the grim reaper fortyone judge fullbright had already lit a cigarette by the time minton and i got back to her chambers after one long drag she put it out against a glass paperweight and then put the butt into a ziploc bag she had taken out of her purse she closed the bag folded it and replaced it in the purse she would leave no evidence of her transgression for the night cleaners or anyone else she exhaled the smoke toward a ceiling intake vent and then brought her eyes down to mintons judging by the look in them i was glad i wasnt him mr minton what the fuck have you done to my trial your shut up and sit down both of you we did as we were told the judge composed herself and leaned forward across her desk she was still looking at minton who did the due diligence on this witness of yours she asked calmly who did the background uh that would haveactually we only did a background on him in la county there were no cautions no flags i checked his name on the computer but i didnt use the initials how many times had he been used in this county before today only one previous time in court but he had given information on three other cases i could find nothing about arizona came up nobody thought to check to see if this guy had been anywhere else or used variations of his name i guess not he was passed on to me by the original prosecutor on the case i just assumed she had checked him out bullshit i said the judge turned her eyes to me i could have sat back and watched minton go down but i wasnt going to let him try to take maggie mcpherson with him the original prosecutor was maggie mcpherson i said she had the case all of about three hours shes my exwife and she knew as soon as she saw me at first apps that she was gone and you got the case that same day minton where in there was she supposed to background your witnesses especially this guy who didnt come out from under his rock until after first appearance she passed him on and that was it minton opened his mouth to say something but the judge cut him off it doesnt matter who should have done it it wasnt done properly and either way putting that man on the stand in my opinion was gross prosecutorial misconduct your honor minton barked i did save it for your boss hes the one youll need to convince what was the last offer the state made to mr roulet minton seemed frozen and unable to respond i answered for him simple assault six months in county the judge raised her eyebrows and looked at me and you didnt take it i shook my head my client wont take a conviction it will ruin him hell gamble on a verdict you want a mistrial she asked i laughed and shook my head no i dont want a mistrial all that will do is give the prosecution time to clean up its mess get it all right and then come back at us then what do you want she asked what do i want a directed verdict would be nice something with no comebacks from the state other than that well ride it out the judge nodded and clasped her hands together on the desk a directed verdict would be ridiculous your honor minton said finally finding his voice were at the end of trial anyway we might as well take it to a verdict the jury deserves it just because one mistake was made by the state there is no reason to subvert the whole process dont be stupid mr minton the judge said dismissively its not about what the jury deserves and as far as i am concerned one mistake like you have made is enough i dont want this kicked back at me by the second and that is surely what they will do then i am holding the bag for your miscon i didnt know corlisss background minton said forcefully i swear to god i didnt know the intensity of his words brought a momentary silence to the chambers but soon i slipped into the void just like you didnt know about the knife ted fullbright looked from minton to me and then back at minton what knife she asked minton said nothing tell her i said minton shook his head i dont know what hes talking about he said then you tell me the judge said to me judge if you wait on discovery from the da you might as well hang it up at the start i said witnesses disappear stories change you can lose a case just sitting around waiting all right so what about the knife i needed to move on this case so i had my investigator go through the back door and get reports its fair game but they were waiting for him and they phonied up a report on the knife so i wouldnt know about the initials i didnt know until i got the formal discovery packet the judge formed a hard line with her lips that was the police not the das office minton said quickly thirty seconds ago you said you didnt know what he was talking about fullbright said now suddenly you do i dont care who did it are you telling me that this did in fact occur minton reluctantly nodded yes your honor but i swear i didnt you know what this tells me the judge said cutting him off it tells me that from start to finish the state has not played fair in this case it doesnt matter who did what or that mr hallers investigator may have been acting improperly the state must be above that and as evidenced today in my courtroom it has been anything but that your honor thats not no more mr minton i think ive heard enough i want you both to leave now in half an hour ill take the bench and announce what well do about this i am not sure yet what that will be but no matter what i do you arent going to like what i have to say mr minton and i am directing you to have your boss mr smithson in the courtroom with you to hear it i stood up minton didnt move he still seemed frozen to the seat i said you can go the judge barked fortytwo ifollowed minton through the court clerks station and into the courtroom it was empty except for meehan who sat at the bailiffs desk i took my briefcase off the defense table and headed toward the gate hey haller wait a second minton said as he gathered files from the prosecution table i stopped at the gate and looked back what minton came to the gate and pointed to the rear door of the courtroom lets go out here my client is going to be waiting out there for me just come here he headed to the door and i followed in the vestibule where i had confronted roulet two days earlier minton stopped to confront me but he didnt say anything he was putting words together i decided to push him even further while you go get smithson i think ill stop by the times office on two and make sure the reporter down there knows therell be some fireworks up here in a half hour look minton sputtered we have to work this out we just hold off on the times okay give me your cell number and give me ten minutes for what let me go down to my office and see what i can do i dont trust you minton well if you want whats best for your client instead of a cheap headline youre going to have to trust me for ten minutes i looked away from his face and acted like i was considering the offer finally i looked back at him our faces were only two feet apart you know minton i couldve put up with all your bullshit the knife and the arrogance and everything else im a pro and i have to live with that shit from prosecutors every day of my life but when you tried to put corliss on maggie mcpherson in there thats when i decided not to show you any mercy look i did nothing to intentionally minton look around theres nobody here but us no cameras no tape no witnesses are you going to stand there and tell me you never heard of corliss until a staff meeting yesterday he responded by pointing an angry finger in my face and youre going to stand there and tell me you never heard of him until this morning we stared at each other for a long moment i may be green but im not stupid he said the strategy of your whole case was to push me toward using corliss you knew all along what you could do with him and you probably got it from your ex if you can prove that then prove it i said oh dont worry i could if i had the time but all ive got is a half hour i slowly raised my arm and checked my watch more like twentysix minutes give me your cell number i did and then he was gone i waited in the vestibule for fifteen seconds before stepping through the door roulet was standing close to the glass wall that looked down at the plaza below his mother and c c dobbs were sitting on a bench against the opposite wall further down the hallway i saw detective sobel lingering in the hallway roulet noticed me and started walking quickly toward me soon his mother and dobbs followed whats going on roulet asked first i waited until they were all gathered close to me before answering i think its all about to blow up what do you mean dobbs asked the judge is considering a directed verdict well know pretty soon what is a directed verdict mary windsor asked its when the judge takes it out of the jurys hands and issues a verdict of acquittal shes hot because she says minton engaged in misconduct with corliss and some other things can she do that just acquit him shes the judge she can do what she wants oh my god windsor brought one hand to her mouth and looked like she might burst into tears i said she is considering it i cautioned it doesnt mean it will happen but she did offer me a mistrial already and i turned that down flat you turned it down dobbs yelped why on earth did you do that because its meaningless the state could come right back and try louis againthis time with a better case because theyll know our moves forget the mistrial were not going to educate the prosecution we want something with no comebacks or we ride with this jury to a verdict today even if it goes against us we have solid grounds for appeal isnt that a decision for louis to make dobbs asked after all hes cecil shut up windsor snapped just shut up and stop secondguessing everything this man does for louis hes right were not going through this again dobbs looked like he had been slapped by her he seemed to shrink back from the huddle i looked at mary windsor and saw a different face it was the face of the woman who had started a business from scratch and had taken it to the top i also looked at dobbs differently realizing that he had probably been whispering sweet negatives about me in her ear all along i let it go and focused on what was at hand theres only one thing the das office hates worse than losing a verdict i said thats getting embarrassed by a judge with a directed verdict especially after a finding of prosecutorial misconduct minton went down to talk to his boss and hes a guy who is very political and always has his finger in the wind we might know something in a few minutes roulet was directly in front of me i looked over his shoulder to see that sobel was still standing in the hallway she was talking on a cell phone listen i said all of you just sit tight if i dont hear from the da then we go back into court in twenty minutes to see what the judge wants to do so stay close if you will excuse me im going to go to the restroom i stepped away from them and walked down the hallway toward sobel but roulet broke away from his mother and her lawyer and caught up to me he grabbed me by the arm to stop me i still want to know how corliss got that shit he was saying he demanded what does it matter its working for us thats what matters roulet brought his face in close to mine the guy calls me a murderer on the stand how is that working for us because no one believed him and thats why the judge is so pissed because they used a professional liar to get up there on the stand and say the worst things about you to put that in front of the jury and then have the guy revealed as a liar thats the misconduct dont you see i had to heighten the stakes it was the only way to push the judge into pushing the prosecution i am doing exactly what you wanted me to do louis im getting you off i studied him as he computed this so let it go i said go back to your mother and dobbs and let me go take a piss he shook his head no im not going to let it go mick he poked a finger into my chest something else is going on here mick and i dont like it you have to remember something i have your gun and you have a daughter you have to i closed my hand over his hand and finger and pushed it away from my chest dont you ever threaten my family i said with a controlled but angry voice you want to come at me fine then come at me and lets do it but if you ever threaten my daughter again i will bury you so deep you will never be found you understand me louis he slowly nodded and a smile creased his face sure mick just so we understand each other i released his hand and left him there i started walking toward the end of the hallway where the restrooms were and where sobel seemed to be waiting while talking on a cell i was walking blind my thoughts of the threat to my daughter crowding my vision but as i got close to sobel i shook it off she ended her call when i got there detective sobel i said mr haller she said can i ask why you are here are you going to arrest me im here because you invited me remember uh no i dont she narrowed her eyes you told me i ought to check out your trial i suddenly realized she was referring to the awkward conversation in my home office during the search of my house on monday night oh right i forgot about that well im glad you took me up on it i saw your partner earlier what happened to him oh hes around i tried to read something in that she had not answered the question about whether she was going to arrest me i gestured back up the hallway toward the courtroom so what did you think interesting i wish i could have been a fly on the wall in the judges chambers well stick around it aint over yet maybe i will my cell phone started to vibrate i reached under my jacket and pulled it off my hip the caller id readout said the call was coming from the district attorneys office i have to take this i said by all means sobel said i opened the phone and started walking back up the hallway toward where roulet was pacing hello mickey haller this is jack smithson in the das office hows your day going ive had better not after you hear what im offering to do for you im listening fortythree the judge did not come out of chambers for fifteen minutes on top of the thirty she had promised we were all waiting roulet and i at the defense table his mother and dobbs behind us in the first row at the prosecution table minton was no longer flying solo next to him sat jack smithson i was thinking that it was probably the first time he had actually been inside a courtroom in a year minton looked downcast and defeated sitting next to smithson he could have been taken as a defendant with his attorney he looked guilty as charged detective booker was not in the courtroom and i wondered if he was working on something or simply if no one had bothered to call him with the bad news i turned to check the big clock on the back wall and to scan the gallery the screen for mintons powerpoint presentation was gone now a hint of what was to come i saw sobel sitting in the back row but her partner and kurlen were still nowhere to be seen there was nobody else but dobbs and windsor and they didnt count the row reserved for the media was empty the media had not been alerted i was keeping my side of the deal with smithson deputy meehan called the courtroom to order and judge fullbright took the bench with a flourish the scent of lilac wafting toward the tables i guessed that shed had a cigarette or two back there in chambers and had gone heavy with the perfume as cover in the matter of the state versus louis ross roulet i understand from my clerk that we have a motion minton stood yes your honor he said nothing further as if he could not bring himself to speak well mr minton are you sending it to me telepathically no your honor minton looked down at smithson and got the goahead nod the state moves to dismiss all charges against louis ross roulet the judge nodded as though she had expected the move i heard a sharp intake of breath behind me and knew it was from mary windsor she knew what was going to happen but had held her emotions in check until she had actually heard it in the courtroom is that with or without prejudice the judge asked dismiss with prejudice are you sure about that mr minton that means no comebacks from the state yes your honor i know minton said with a note of annoyance at the judges need to explain the law to him the judge wrote something down and then looked back at minton i believe for the record the state needs to offer some sort of explanation for this motion we have chosen a jury and heard more than two days of testimony why is the state doing this at this stage mr minton smithson stood he was a tall and thin man with a pale complexion he was a prosecutorial specimen nobody wanted a fat man as district attorney and that was exactly what he hoped one day to be he wore a charcoal gray suit with what had become his trademark a maroon bow tie with matching handkerchief peeking from the suits breast pocket the word among the defense pros was that a political advisor had told him to start building a recognizable media image so that when the time came to run the voters would think they already knew him this was one situation where he didnt want the media carrying his image to the voters if i may your honor he said the record will note the appearance of assistant district attorney john smithson head of the van nuys division welcome jack go right ahead please judge fullbright it has come to my attention that in the interest of justice the charges against mr roulet should be dropped he pronounced roulets name wrong is that all the explanation you can offer jack the judge asked smithson deliberated before answering while there were no reporters present the record of the hearing would be public and his words viewable later judge it has come to my attention that there were some irregularities in the investigation and subsequent prosecution this office is founded upon the belief in the sanctity of our justice system i personally safeguard that in the van nuys division and take it very very seriously and so it is better for us to dismiss a case than to see justice possibly compromised in any way thank you mr smithson that is refreshing to hear the judge wrote another note and then looked back down at us the states motion is granted she said all charges against louis roulet are dismissed with prejudice mr roulet you are discharged and free to go thank you your honor i said we still have a jury returning at one oclock fullbright said i will gather them and explain that the case has been resolved if any of you attorneys wish to come back then i am sure they will have questions for you however it is not required that you be back i nodded but didnt say i would be back i wouldnt be the twelve people who had been so important to me for the last week had just dropped off the radar they were now as meaningless to me as the drivers going the other way on the freeway they had gone by and i was finished with them the judge left the bench and smithson was the first one out of the courtroom he had nothing to say to minton or me his first priority was to distance himself from this prosecutorial catastrophe i looked over and saw mintons face had lost all color i assumed that i would soon see his name in the yellow pages he would not be retained by the da and he would join the ranks of the defense pros his first felony lesson a costly one roulet was at the rail leaning over to hug his mother dobbs had a hand on his shoulder in a congratulatory gesture but the family lawyer had not recovered from windsor s harsh rebuke in the hallway when the hugs were over roulet turned to me and with hesitation shook my hand i wasnt wrong about you he said i knew you were the one i want the gun i said deadpan my face showing no joy in the victory just achieved of course you do he turned back to his mother i hesitated a moment and then turned back to the defense table i opened my briefcase to return all the files to it michael i turned and it was dobbs reaching a hand across the railing i shook it and nodded you did good dobbs said as if i needed to hear it from him we all appreciate it greatly thanks for the shot i know you were shaky about me at the start i was courteous enough not to mention windsor s outburst in the hallway and what she had said about him backstabbing me only because i didnt know you dobbs said now i do now i know who to recommend to my clients thank you but i hope your kind of clients never need me he laughed me too then it was mary windsors turn she extended her hand across the bar mr haller thank you for my son youre welcome i said flatly take care of him i always do i nodded why dont you all go out to the hallway and ill be out in a minute i have to finish up some things here with the clerk and mr minton i turned back to the table i then went around it and approached the clerk how long before i can get a signed copy of the judges order well enter it this afternoon we can send you a copy if you dont want to come back that would be great could you also fax one she said she would and i gave her the number to the fax in lorna taylors condominium i wasnt sure yet how it could be used but i had to believe that an order to dismiss could somehow help me get a client or two when i turned back to get my briefcase and leave i noticed that detective sobel had left the courtroom only minton remained he was standing and gathering his things sorry i never got the chance to see your powerpoint thing i said he nodded yeah it was pretty good i think it would have won them over i nodded what are you going to do now i dont know see if i can ride this out and somehow hold on to my job he put his files under his arm he had no briefcase he only had to go down to the second floor he turned and gave me a hard stare the only thing i know is that i dont want to cross the aisle i dont want to become like you haller i think i like sleeping at night too much for that with that he headed through the gate and strode out of the courtroom i glanced over at the clerk to see if she had heard what he had said she acted like she hadnt i took my time following minton out i picked up my briefcase and turned backwards as i pushed through the gate i looked at the judges empty bench and the state seal on the front panel i nodded at nothing in particular and then walked out fortyfour roulet and his entourage were waiting for me in the hallway i looked both ways and saw sobel down by the elevators she was on her cell phone and it seemed as though she was waiting for an elevator but it didnt look like the down button was lit michael can you join us for lunch dobbs said upon seeing me we are going to celebrate i noticed that he was now calling me by my given name victory made everybody friendly uh i said still looking down at sobel i dont think i can make it why not you obviously dont have court in the afternoon i finally looked at dobbs i felt like saying that i couldnt have lunch because i never wanted to see him or mary windsor or louis roulet again i think im going to stick around and talk to the jurors when they come back at one why roulet asked because it will help me to know what they were thinking and where we stood dobbs gave me a clap on the upper arm always learning always getting better for the next one i dont blame you he looked delighted that i would not be joining them and for good reason he probably wanted me out of the way now so he could work on repairing his relationship with mary windsor he wanted that franchise account just to himself again i heard the muted bong of the elevator and looked back down the hall sobel was standing in front of the opening elevator she was leaving but then lankford kurlen and booker stepped out of the elevator and joined sobel they turned and started walking toward us then well leave you to it dobbs said his back to the approaching detectives we have a reservation at orso and im afraid were already going to be late getting back over the hill okay i said still looking down the hall dobbs windsor and roulet turned to walk away just as the four detectives got to us louis roulet kurlen announced you are under arrest turn around please and place your hands behind your back no mary windsor shrieked you cant what is this dobbs cried out kurlen didnt answer or wait for roulet to comply he stepped forward and roughly turned roulet around as he made the forced turn roulets eyes came to mine whats going on mick he said in a calm voice this shouldnt be happening mary windsor moved toward her son take your hands off of my son she grabbed kurlen from behind but booker and lankford quickly moved in and detached her handling her gently but strongly maam step back booker commanded or i will put you in jail kurlen started giving roulet the miranda warning windsor stayed back but was not silent how dare you you cannot do this her body moved in place and she looked as though unseen hands were keeping her from charging at kurlen again mother roulet said in a tone that carried more weight and control than any of the detectives windsor s body relented she gave up but dobbs didnt youre arresting him for what he demanded suspicion of murder kurlen said the murder of martha renteria thats impossible dobbs cried everything that witness corliss said in there was proven to be a lie are you crazy the judge dismissed the case because of his lies kurlen broke from his recital of roulets rights and looked at dobbs if it was all a lie howd you know he was talking about martha renteria dobbs realized his mistake and took a step back from the gathering kurlen smiled yeah i thought so he said he grabbed roulet by an elbow and turned him back around lets go he said mick roulet said detective kurlen i said can i talk to my client for a moment kurlen looked at me seemed to measure something in me and then nodded one minute tell him to behave himself and it will all go a lot easier for him he shoved roulet toward me i took him by one arm and walked him a few paces away from the others so we would have privacy if we kept our voices down i stepped close to him and began in a whisper this is it louis this is goodbye i got you off now youre on your own get yourself a new lawyer the shock showed in his eyes then his face clouded over with a tightly focused anger it was pure rage and i realized it was the same rage regina campo and martha renteria must have seen i wont need a lawyer he said to me you think they can make a case off of what you somehow fed to that lying snitch in there you better think again they wont need the snitch louis believe me theyll find more they probably already have more what about you mick arent you forgetting something i have i know but it doesnt matter anymore they dont need my gun theyve already got all they need but whatever happens to me ill know that i put you down at the end after the trial and all the appeals when they finally stick that needle in your arm that will be me louis remember that i smiled with no humor and moved in closer this is for raul levin you might not go down for him but make no mistake you are going down i let that register for a moment and then stepped back and nodded to kurlen he and booker came up on either side of roulet and took hold of his upper arms you set me up roulet said somehow maintaining his calm you arent a lawyer you work for them lets go kurlen said they started moving him but he shook them off momentarily and put his raging eyes right back into mine this isnt the end mick he said ill be out by tomorrow morning what will you do then think about it what are you going to do then you cant protect everybody they took a tighter hold of him and roughly turned him toward the elevators this time roulet went without a struggle halfway down the hall toward the elevator his mother and dobbs trailing behind he turned his head to look back over his shoulder at me he smiled and it sent something right through me you cant protect everybody a cold shiver of fear pierced my chest someone was waiting for the elevator and it opened just as the entourage got there lankford signaled the person back and took the elevator roulet was hustled in dobbs and windsor were about to follow when they were halted by lankfords hand extended in a stop signal the elevator door started to close and dobbs angrily and impotently pushed on the button next to it my hope was that it would be the last i would ever see of louis roulet but the fear stayed locked in my chest fluttering like a moth caught inside a porch light i turned away and almost walked right into sobel i hadnt noticed that she had stayed behind the others you have enough dont you i said tell me you wouldnt have moved so quickly if you didnt have enough to keep him she looked at me a long moment before answering we wont decide that the da will probably depends on what they get out of him in interrogation but up till now hes had a pretty smart lawyer he probably knows not to say a word to us then why didnt you wait wasnt my call i shook my head i wanted to tell her that they had moved too fast it wasnt part of the plan i wanted to plant the seed thats all i wanted them to move slowly and get it right the moth fluttered inside and i looked down at the floor i couldnt shake the idea that all of my machinations had failed leaving me and my family exposed in the hardeyed focus of a killer you cant protect everybody it was as if sobel read my fears but were going to try to keep him she said we have what the snitch said in court and the ticket were working on witnesses and the forensics my eyes came up to hers what ticket a look of suspicion entered her face i thought you had it figured out we put it together as soon as the snitch mentioned the snake dancer yeah martha renteria i got that but what ticket what are you talking about i had moved in too close to her and sobel took a step back from me it wasnt my breath it was my desperation i dont know if i should tell you haller youre a defense lawyer youre his lawyer not anymore i just quit doesnt matter he look you just took that guy down because of me i might get disbarred because of it i might even go to jail for a murder i didnt commit what ticket are you talking about she hesitated and i waited but then she finally spoke raul levins last words he said he found jesuss ticket out which means what you really dont know do you look just tell me please she relented we traced levins most recent movements before he was murdered he had made inquiries about roulets parking tickets he even pulled hard copies of them we inventoried what he had in the office and eventually compared it with whats on the computer he was missing one ticket one hard copy we didnt know if his killer took it that day or if he had just missed pulling it so we went and pulled a copy ourselves it was issued two years ago on the night of april eighth it was a citation for parking in front of a hydrant in the sixtysevenhundred block of blythe street in panorama city it all came together for me like the last bit of sand dropping through the middle of an hourglass raul levin really had found jesus menendezs salvation martha renteria was murdered two years ago on april eighth i said she lived on blythe in panorama city yes but we didnt know that we didnt see the connection you told us that levin was working separate cases for you jesus menendez and louis roulet were separate investigations levin had them filed that way too it was a discovery issue he kept the cases separate so i wouldnt have to turn over anything on roulet that he came up with on menendez one of your lawyer angles well it stopped us from putting it together until that snitch in there mentioned the snake dancer that connected everything i nodded so whoever killed raul levin took the hard copy we think did you check rauls phones for a tap somehow somebody knew he found the ticket we did they were clear bugs could have been removed at the time of the murder or maybe it was someone elses phone that was tapped meaning mine meaning it might explain how roulet knew so many of my moves and was even conveniently waiting for me in my home the night i had come home from seeing jesus menendez i will have them checked i said does all of this mean i am clear on rauls murder not necessarily sobel said we still want to see what comes back from ballistics were hoping for something today i nodded i didnt know how to respond sobel lingered looking like she wanted to tell me or ask me something what i said i dont know is there anything you want to tell me i dont know theres nothing to tell really in the courtroom it seemed like you were trying to tell us a lot i was silent a moment trying to read between the lines what do you want from me detective sobel you know what i want i want raul levins killer well so do i but i couldnt give you roulet on levin even if i wanted to i dont know how he did it and thats off the record so that still leaves you in the crosshairs she looked down the hall at the elevators her implication clear if the ballistics matched i could still have a problem on levin they would use it as leverage give up how roulet did it or go down for it myself i changed the subject how long do you think before jesus menendez gets out i asked she shrugged hard to say depends on the case they build against rouletif they have a case but i know one thing they cant prosecute roulet as long as another man is in prison for the same crime i turned and walked over to the glass wall i put my free hand on the railing that ran along the glass i felt a mixture of elation and dread and that moth still batting around in my chest thats all i care about i said quietly getting him out that and raul she came over and stood next to me i dont know what you are doing she said but leave the rest for us i do that and your partner will probably put me in jail for a murder i didnt commit you are playing a dangerous game she said leave it alone i looked at her and then back down at the plaza sure i said ill leave it alone now having heard what she needed to she made a move to go good luck she said i looked at her again same to you she left then and i stayed i turned back to the window and looked down into the plaza i saw dobbs and windsor crossing the concrete squares and heading toward the parking garage mary windsor was leaning against her lawyer for support i doubted they were still headed to lunch at orso fortyfive by that night the word had begun to spread not the secret details but the public story the story that i had won the case gotten a das motion to dismiss with no comebacks only to have my client arrested for a murder in the hallway outside the courtroom where i had just cleared him i got calls from every other defense pro i knew i got call after call until my cell phone finally died my colleagues were all congratulating me in their eyes there was no downside roulet was the ultimate franchise i got schedule a fees for one trial and then i would get schedule a fees for the next one it was a doubledip most defense pros could only dream about and of course when i told them i would not be handling the defense of the new case each one of them asked if i could refer him to roulet it was the one call that came in on my home line that i wanted the most it was from maggie mcpherson ive been waiting for your call all night i said i was pacing in the kitchen tethered by the phone cord i had checked my phones when i had gotten home and found no evidence of bugging devices sorry ive been in the conference room she said i heard you were pulled in on roulet yes thats why im calling theyre going to cut him loose what are you talking about theyre letting him go yes theyve had him for nine hours in a room and he hasnt broken maybe you taught him too well not to talk because hes a rock and they got nothing and that means they dont have enough youre wrong there is enough they have the parking ticket and there have to be witnesses who can put him in the cobra room even menendez can id him there you know as well as i do that menendez is a scratch hed identify anybody to get out and if there are other wits from the cobra room then its going to take some time to run them down the parking ticket puts him in the neighborhood but it doesnt put him inside her apartment what about the knife theyre working on it but thats going to take time too look we want to do this right it was smithsons call and believe me he wanted to keep him too it would make that fiasco you created in court today a little more palatable but its just not there not yet theyre going to kick him loose and work the forensics and look for the witnesses if roulets good for this then we will get him and your other client will get out you dont have to worry but we have to do it right i swung a fist impotently through the air they jumped the gun damn it they shouldnt have made the move today i guess they thought nine hours in interrogation would do the trick they were stupid nobodys perfect i was annoyed by her attitude but held my tongue on that i needed her to keep me in the loop when exactly will they let him go i asked i dont know this all just went down kurlen and booker came over here to present it and smithson just sent them back to the pd when they get back i assume theyll kick him loose listen to me maggie roulet knows about hayley there was a horribly long moment of silence before she answered what are you saying haller you let our daughter into i didnt let anything happen he broke into my house and saw her picture it doesnt mean he knows where she lives or even what her name is but he knows about her and he wants to get back at me so you have to go home right now i want you to be with hayley get her and get out of the apartment just play it safe something made me hold back on telling her everything that i felt that roulet had specifically threatened my family in the courthouse you cant protect everybody i would only use that if she refused to do what i wanted her to do with hayley im leaving now she said and were coming to you i knew she would say that no dont come to me why not because he might come to me this is crazy what are you going to do im not sure yet just go get hayley and get somewhere safe then call me on your cell but dont tell me where you are it will be better if i dont even know haller just call the police they can and tell them what i dont know tell them youve been threatened a defense lawyer telling the police he feels threatened yeah theyll jump all over that probably send out a swat team well you have to do something i thought i did i thought he was going to be in jail for the rest of his life but you people moved too fast and now you have to let him go i told you it wasnt enough even knowing now about the possible threat to hayley its still not enough then go to our daughter and take care of her leave the rest to me im going but she didnt hang up it was like she was giving me the chance to say something more i love you mags i said both of you be careful i closed the phone before she could respond almost immediately i opened it again and called fernando valenzuelas cell phone number after five rings he answered val its me mick shit if id known it was you i wouldnt have answered look i need your help my help youre asking for my help after what you asked me the other night after you accused me look val this is an emergency what i said the other night was out of line and i apologize ill pay for your tv ill do whatever you want but i need your help right now i waited after a pause he responded what do you want me to do roulet still has the bracelet on his ankle right thats right i know what happened in court but i havent heard from the guy one of my courthouse people said the cops picked him up again so i dont know whats going on they picked him up but hes about to be kicked loose hell probably be calling you so he can get the bracelet taken off im already home man he can find me in the morning thats what i want make him wait that aint no favor man this is i want you to open your laptop and watch him when he leaves the pd i want to know where hes going can you do that for me you mean right now yeah right now you got a problem with that sort of i got ready for another argument but i was surprised i told you about the battery alarm on the bracelet right valenzuela said yeah i remember well i got the twenty percent alarm about an hour ago so how much longer can you track him until the batterys dead probably about six to eight hours active tracking before it goes on low pulse then hell come up every fifteen minutes for another five hours i thought about all of this i just needed to make it through the night and to know that maggie and hayley were safe the thing is when he is on low pulse he beeps valenzuela said youll hear him coming or hell get tired of the noise and juice the battery or maybe hell pull the houdini act again i thought okay i said you told me that there were other alarms that you could build into the tracking program thats right can you set it so you get an alarm if he comes near a specific target yeah like if its on a child molester you can set an alarm if he gets close to a school stuff like that its got to be a fixed target okay i gave him the address of the apartment on dickens in sherman oaks where maggie and my daughter lived if he comes within ten blocks of that place you call me doesnt matter what time call me thats the favor what is this place its where my daughter lives there was a long silence before valenzuela responded with maggie you think this guys going to go there i dont know im hoping that as long as hes got the tracker on his ankle he wont be stupid okay mick you got it thanks val and call my home number my cell is dead i gave him the number and then was silent for a moment wondering what else i could say to make up for my betrayal two nights earlier finally i let it go i had to focus on the current threat i moved from the kitchen and down the hallway to my office i rolled through the rolodex on my desk until i found a number and then grabbed the desk phone i dialed and waited i looked out the window to the left of my desk and noticed for the first time that it was raining it looked like it was going to come down hard and i wondered if the weather would affect the satellite tracking of roulet i dropped the thought when my call was answered by teddy vogel the leader of the road saints speak to me ted mickey haller counselor how are you not so good tonight then i am glad you called what can i do for you i looked out the window at the rain before answering i knew that if i continued i would be indebted to people i never wanted to be on the hook with but there was no choice you happen to have anybody down my way tonight i asked there was a hesitation before vogel answered i knew he had to be curious about his lawyer calling him for help i was obviously asking about the kind of help that came with muscles and guns got a few guys watching things at the club whats up the club was the strip bar on sepulveda not too far from sherman oaks i was counting on that theres a threat to my family ted i need some warm bodies to put up a front maybe grab a guy if needed armed and dangerous i hesitated but not too long yeah armed and dangerous sounds like our kind of move where do you want them he was immediately ready to act he knew the value of having me under his thumb instead of on retainer i gave him the address of the apartment on dickens i also gave him a description of roulet and what he had been wearing in court that day if he shows up at that apartment i want him stopped i said and i need your people to go now done vogel said thank you ted no thank you were glad to help you out seeing as how youve helped us out so much yeah right i thought i hung the phone up knowing i had just crossed one of those lines you hope to never see let alone have to step across i looked out the window again outside the rain was now coming down hard off the roof i had no gutter in the back and it was coming down in a translucent sheet that blurred the lights out there nothing but rain this year i thought nothing but rain i left the office and went back to the front of the house on the table in the dining alcove was the gun earl briggs had given me i contemplated the weapon and all the moves i had made the bottom line was i had been flying blind and in the process had endangered more than just myself panic started to set in i grabbed the phone off the kitchen wall and called maggies cell she answered right away i could tell she was in her car where are you im just getting home now ill get some things together and well get out good what do i tell hayley that her father put her life in danger its not like that maggie its him its roulet i couldnt control him one night i came home and he was sitting in my house hes a real estate guy he knows how to find places he saw her picture on my desk what was i can we talk about this later i have to go in now and get my daughter not our daughter my daughter sure call me when youre in a new place she disconnected without further word and i slowly hung the phone back on the wall my hand was still on the phone i leaned forward until my forehead touched the wall i was out of moves i could only wait on roulet to make the next one the phones ring startled me and i jumped back the phone fell to the floor and i pulled it up by the cord it was valenzuela you get my message i just called no ive been on the phone what glad i called back then hes moving where i shouted it too loud into the phone i was losing it hes heading south on van nuys he called me and said he wanted to lose the bracelet i told him i was already home and that he could call me tomorrow i told him he had better juice the battery so he wouldnt start beeping in the middle of the night good thinking wheres he now still on van nuys i tried to build an image of roulet driving if he was going south on van nuys that meant he was heading directly toward sherman oaks and the neighborhood where maggie and hayley lived but he could also be headed right through sherman oaks on his way south over the hill and to his home i had to wait to be sure how up to the moment is the gps on that thing i asked its real time man this is where hes at he just crossed under the oneohone he might be just going home mick i know i know just wait till he crosses ventura the next street is dickens if he turns there then hes not going home i stood up and didnt know what to do i started pacing the phone pressed tightly to my ear i knew that even if teddy vogel had immediately put his men in motion they were still minutes away they were no good to me now what about the rain does it affect the gps its not supposed to thats comforting he stopped where must be a light i think thats moorpark avenue there that was a block before ventura and two before dickens i heard a beeping sound come over the phone whats that the tenblock alarm you asked me to set the beeping sound stopped i turned it off ill call you right back i didnt wait for a response i hung up and called maggies cell she answered right away where are you you told me not to tell you youre out of the apartment no not yet hayleys picking the crayons and coloring books she wants to take goddamn it get out of there now were going as fast as just get out ill call you back make sure you answer i hung up and called valenzuela back where is he hes now at ventura mustve caught another light because hes not moving youre sure hes on the road and not just parked there no im not sure he couldnever mind hes moving shit he turned on ventura which way i started pacing the phone pressed so hard against my ear that it hurt rightuh west hes going west he was now driving parallel to dickens one block away in the direction of my daughters apartment he just stopped again valenzuela announced its not an intersection it looks like hes in the middle of the block i think he parked it i ran my free hand through my hair like a desperate man fuck it ive gotta go my cells dead call maggie and tell her hes heading her way tell her to just get in the car and get out of there i shouted maggies number into the phone and dropped it as i headed out of the kitchen i knew it would take me a minimum of twenty minutes to get to dickensand that was hitting the curves on mulholland at sixty in the lincoln but i couldnt stand around shouting orders on the phone while my family was in danger i grabbed the gun off the table and went to the door i was shoving it into the side pocket of my jacket as i opened the door mary windsor was standing there her hair wet from the rain mary what she raised her hand i looked down to see the metal glint of the gun in it just as she fired fortysix the sound was loud and the flash as bright as a cameras the impact of the bullet tearing into me was like what i imagine a kick from a horse would feel like in a split second i went from standing still to moving backwards i hit the wood floor hard and was propelled into the wall next to the living room fireplace i tried to reach both hands to the hole in my gut but my right hand was hung up in the pocket of my jacket i held myself with the left and tried to sit up mary windsor stepped forward and into the house i had to look up at her through the open door behind her i could see the rain coming down she raised the weapon and pointed it at my forehead in a flash moment my daughters face came to me and i knew i wasnt going to let her go you tried to take my son from me windsor shouted did you think i could allow you to do that and just walk away and then i knew everything crystallized i knew she had said similar words to raul levin before she had killed him and i knew that there had been no rape in an empty house in belair she was a mother doing what she had to do roulets words came back to me then youre right about one thing i am a son of a bitch and i knew too that raul levins last gesture had not been to make the sign of the devil but to make the letter m or w depending on how you looked at it windsor took another step toward me you go to hell she said she steadied her hand to fire i raised my right hand still wrapped in my jacket she must have thought it was a defensive gesture because she didnt hurry she was savoring the moment i could tell until i fired mary windsors body jerked backwards with the impact and she landed on her back in the threshold of the door her gun clattered to the floor and i heard her make a highpitched whining noise then i heard the sound of running feet on the steps up to the front deck police a woman shouted put your weapons down i looked through the door and didnt see anyone put your weapons down and come out with your hands in full view this time it was a man who had yelled and i recognized the voice i pulled the gun out of my jacket pocket and put it on the floor i slid it away from me the weapons down i called out as loud as the hole in my stomach allowed me to but im shot i cant get up were both shot i first saw the barrel of a pistol come into view in the doorway then a hand and then a wet black raincoat containing detective lankford he moved into the house and was quickly followed by his partner detective sobel lankford kicked the gun away from windsor as he came in he kept his own weapon pointed at me anybody else in the house he asked loudly no i said listen to me i tried to sit up but pain shot through my body and lankford yelled dont move just stay there listen to me my fam sobel yelled a command into a handheld radio ordering paramedics and ambulance transport for two people with gunshot wounds one transport lankford corrected shes gone he pointed his gun at windsor sobel shoved the radio into her raincoat pocket and came to me she knelt down and pulled my hand away from my wound she pulled my shirt out of my pants so she could lift it and see the damage she then pressed my hand back down on the bullet hole press down as hard as you can its a bleeder you hear me hold your hand down tight listen to me i said again my familys in danger you have to hold on she reached inside her raincoat and pulled a cell phone off her belt she flipped it open and hit a speeddial button whoever she called answered right away its sobel you better bring him back in his mother just tried to hit the lawyer he got her first she listened for a moment and asked then where is he she listened some more and then said goodbye i stared at her as she closed her phone theyll pick him up your daughter is safe youre watching him she nodded we piggybacked on your plan haller we have a lot on him but we were hoping for more i told you we want to clear levin we were hoping that if we kicked him loose hed show us his trick show us how he got to levin but the mother sort of just solved that mystery for us i understood even with the blood and life running out of the hole in my gut i was able to put it together releasing roulet had been a play they were hoping that hed go after me revealing the method he had used to defeat the gps ankle bracelet when he had killed raul levin only he hadnt killed raul his mother had done it for him maggie i asked weakly sobel shook her head shes fine she had to play along because we didnt know if roulet had a tap on your line or not she couldnt tell you that she and hayley were safe i closed my eyes i didnt know whether just to be thankful that they were okay or to be angry that maggie had used her daughters father as bait for a killer i tried to sit up i want to call her she dont move just stay still i leaned my head back on the floor i was cold and on the verge of shaking yet i also felt as though i were sweating i could feel myself getting weaker as my breathing grew shallow sobel pulled the radio out of her pocket again and asked dispatch for an eta on the paramedics the dispatcher reported back that the medical help was still six minutes away hang in there sobel said to me youll be all right depending on what the bullet did inside you should be all right gray i meant to say great with full sarcasm attached but i was fading lankford came up next to sobel and looked at me in a gloved hand he held up the gun mary windsor had shot me with i recognized the pearl grips mickey cohens gun my gun the gun she shot raul with he nodded and i took it as some sort of signal maybe that in his eyes i had stepped up that he knew i had done their work by drawing the killer out maybe it was even the offering of a truce and maybe he wouldnt hate lawyers so much after this probably not but i nodded back at him and the small movement made me cough i tasted something in my mouth and knew it was blood dont flatline on us now lankford ordered if we end up giving a defense lawyer mouthtomouth well never live it down he smiled and i smiled back or tried to then the blackness started crowding my vision pretty soon i was floating in it part three postcard from cuba tuesday october fortyseven it has been five months since i was in a courtroom in that time i have had three surgeries to repair my body been sued in civil court twice and been investigated by both the los angeles police department and the california bar association my bank accounts have been bled dry by medical expenses living expenses child support and yes even my own kindthe lawyers but i have survived it all and today will be the first day since i was shot by mary alice windsor that i will walk without a cane or the numbing of painkillers to me it is the first real step toward getting back the cane is a sign of weakness nobody wants a defense attorney who looks weak i must stand upright stretch the muscles the surgeon cut through to get to the bullet and walk on my own before i feel i can walk into a courtroom again i have not been in a courtroom but that does not mean i am not the subject of legal proceedings jesus menendez and louis roulet are both suing me and the cases will likely follow me for years they are separate claims but both of my former clients charge me with malpractice and violation of legal ethics for all the specific accusations in his lawsuit roulet has not been able to learn how i supposedly got to dwayne jeffery corliss at countyusc and fed him privileged information and it is unlikely he ever will gloria dayton is long gone she finished her program took the i gave her and moved to hawaii to start life again and corliss who probably knows better than anyone the value of keeping ones mouth shut has divulged nothing other than what he testified to in courtmaintaining that while in custody roulet told him about the murder of the snake dancer he has avoided perjury charges because pursuing them would undermine the case against roulet and be an act of selfflagellation by the das office my lawyer tells me roulets lawsuit against me is a facesaving effort without merit and that it will eventually go away probably when i have no more money to pay my lawyer his fees but menendez will never go away he is the one who gets to me at night when i sit on the deck and watch the milliondollar view from my house with the millionone mortgage he was pardoned by the governor and released from san quentin two days after roulet was charged with martha renterias murder but he only traded one life sentence for another it was revealed that he contracted hiv in prison and the governor doesnt have a pardon for that nobody does whatever happens to jesus menendez is on me i know this i live with it every day my father was right there is no client as scary as an innocent man and no client as scarring menendez wants to spit on me and take my money as punishment for what i did and didnt do as far as i am concerned he is entitled but no matter what my failings of judgment and ethical lapses were i know that by the end i bent things in order to do the right thing i traded evil for innocence roulet is in because of me menendez is out because of me despite the efforts of his new attorneysit has now taken the partnership of dan daly and roger mills to replace meroulet will not see freedom again from what i have heard from maggie mcpherson prosecutors have built an impenetrable case against him for the renteria murder they have also followed raul levins steps and connected roulet to another killing the followhome rape and stabbing of a woman who tended bar in a hollywood club the forensic profile of his knife was matched to the fatal wounds inflicted on this other woman for roulet the science will be the iceberg spotted too late his ship will founder and go down the battle for him now lies in just staying alive his lawyers are engaged in plea negotiations to keep him from a lethal injection they are hinting at other murders and rapes that he would be willing to clear up in exchange for his life whatever the outcome alive or dead he is surely gone from this world and i take my salvation in that it is what has mended me better than any surgeon maggie mcpherson and i are attempting to mend our wounds too she brings my daughter to visit me every weekend and often stays for the day we sit on the deck and talk we both know our daughter will be what saves us i can no longer hold anger for being used as bait for a killer i think maggie no longer holds anger for the choices i have made the california bar looked at all of my actions and sent me on a vacation to cuba thats what defense pros call being suspended for conduct unbecoming an attorney cuba i was shelved for ninety days it was a bullshit finding they could prove no specific ethical violations in regard to corliss so they hit me for borrowing a gun from my client earl briggs i got lucky there it was not a stolen or unregistered gun it belonged to earls father so my ethical infraction was minor i didnt bother contesting the bar reprimand or appealing the suspension after taking a bullet in the gut ninety days on the shelf didnt look so bad to me i served the suspension during my recovery mostly in a bathrobe while watching court tv neither the bar nor the police found ethical or criminal violation on my part in the killing of mary alice windsor she entered my home with a stolen weapon she shot first and i shot last from a block away lankford and sobel watched her take that first shot at my front door selfdefense cut and dried but what has not been so clearcut are the feelings i have for what i did i wanted to avenge my friend raul levin but i didnt want to see it done in blood i am a killer now being state sanctioned only tempers slightly the feelings that come with that all investigations and official findings aside i think now that in the whole matter of menendez and roulet i was guilty of conduct unbecoming myself and the penalty for that is harsher than anything the state or the bar could ever throw at me no matter i will carry all of it with me as i go back to work my work i know my place in this world and on the first day of court next year i will pull the lincoln out of the garage get back on the road and go looking for the underdog i dont know where i will go or what cases will be mine i just know i will be healed and ready to stand once again in the world without truth acknowledgments this novel was inspired by a chance meeting and conversation with attorney david ogden many years ago at a los angeles dodgers baseball game for that the author will always be grateful though the character and exploits of mickey haller are fictitious and wholly of the authors imagination this story could not have been written without the tremendous help and guidance of attorneys daniel f daly and roger o mills both of whom allowed me to watch them work and strategize cases and were tireless in their efforts to make sure the world of criminal defense law was depicted accurately in these pages any errors or exaggerations in the law or the practice of it are purely the fault of the author superior court judge judith champagne and her staff in department in the criminal courts building in downtown los angeles allowed the author complete access to her courtroom
