william dietrich the emerald storm part i chapter my intention was to retire after learning in that i had fathered a family then rescuing mother and son from a tyrant in tripoli and finally escaping in a submarine invented by crackpot american inventor robert fulton i was more than ready to trade heroism for domesticity my preference is lover not fighter no one tries harder to escape adventure than me ethan gage so why in april of was i clinging to the side of a frozen fortress in frances jura mountains sleet in my eyes a bomb on my back and hemp rope heavy as a hangmans noose slung round my neck despite my best efforts to settle down my new family was in peril again and scaling napoleon bonapartes impregnable prison had become a necessary step toward domestic bliss i was grumpy at this predicament as one matures a slow process in my case the unpredictability of life becomes less exciting and more annoying french police and british spies claimed the fault was mine for trying to pawn a stolen emerald but i felt the jewel was small compensation for my battles with the barbary pirates now there was a far bigger treasure at stake strange aerial conspiracies brewing war between france and england and the need to retrieve my own nearly threeyearold son whom i kept losing like a button so here i was on the french frontier boots scrabbling on an icy wall the promise that motivated me if i could break a negro hero to freedom i my bride astiza and little horus or harry might finally be able to live somewhere in peace and youll further the cause of liberty and equality as well ethan gage my old compatriot sir sidney smith had written me im skeptical of such causes the idealists who dream them up send employees to carry them out and said employees have the habit of dying early if everything in this latest mission went well the best i could hope for was flinging myself into space aboard the untested flying contraption of an eccentric englishman of which that nation has a surfeit and that experiment was after my new bride pretended to be the creole mistress of the worlds most notorious negro locked in napoleons gloomiest prison in short my quest for retirement had gotten me in a mess of political causes well above my station and once more i was supposed to straighten the worlds difficulties out i seem forever a pawn of both british and french and both countries wanted my expertise applied to flying machines and lost aztec treasure in hopes it could decide the war between them damnation slave revolts naval mastery of the caribbean and staving off invasion of england were exactly the kind of weighty issues id pledged to get away from its even more exhausting to be necessary given my flaws my human habits of greed lust impatience vanity sloth and foolishness tend to hobble my idealism to explain my fate as reluctant hero while my mentor benjamin franklin did his best to instill character in me before he died my instinctive aversion to honest work thrift and loyalty had provided a pleasant if aimless life in paris as the eighteenth century drew to a close then circumstances threw me in with a young rascal named napoleon and no end of adventures involving books of ancient wisdom norse gods greek superweapons and a tormenting seductress or two ive found that heroism doesnt pay very well and is frequently a cold filthy and painful occupation as well i originally went adventuring because i was poor and a fugitive from an unjust murder charge now if i could profit from the emerald i stole from the barbary pirates i would emulate the rich and never do anything interesting again the entire point of being wealthy as i understand it is to escape life in all its miseries and to avoid work discomfort unfamiliarity and challenge of any kind the rich ive met dont have to live but merely exist like pampered plants and after battles tortures broken hearts and nightmare terrors it had become my goal to become as dull and selfsatisfied as the highborn i would think about horse breeds and ledger books offer predictable opinions to acceptable acquaintances and spend four hours eating dinner it would be a pleasant change accordingly astiza harry and i had traveled from tripoli to france to sell the gem id snatched the very best jewelers paying the very best prices are in paris my plan was to make myself wealthy cross the atlantic buy a quiet home in america pass my wisdom to young harry and sire more little ethans in the offhours with my voluptuous temptation of a bride perhaps id toy with something mildly ambitious like taking up astronomy and looking for new planets like herschel the telescope builder whod first spied uranus his sister caroline was good at finding comets so maybe astiza would take peeks at the sky as well and wed reinforce our renown as a couple of clever savants but things had gone awry first i had to scale fort de joux and break free from prison one toussaint louverture liberator of saintdomingue the tormented western half of the island of hispaniola that the natives call haiti the black general louverture an adopted name meaning the opening had reconquered his country for france been tricked into arrest because he succeeded and been rewarded for loyalty by imprisonment the slaves in the caribbean had risen against their french overseers you see and the spaniards and the british had seen an opportunity to invade a french possession the french had rather cleverly recruited rebel armies back to their side by promising freedom and then arrested toussaint just when he was on the brink of achieving it now napoleon was trying to reverse time by reinstating slavery and saintdomingue was a hellhole of fire massacre torture and oppression the question i was blackmailed into seeking an answer for was did louverture locked in icy fort de joux know a fantastic secret of an ancient treasure that held the secret of flight and thus mastery of the world the french border fortress of the medieval joux family had started as a wooden stockade on a rocky outcrop in my british advisers had informed me over the nearly eight centuries since i was climbing in the predawn hours of april it had become a barnaclelike accretion of tower wall parapet and gate by now it had three moats five concentric walls and a view of la cluse pass that was literally breathtaking given that the altitude and climate of the place were enough to bring on apoplexy even in april the sheer wall i was ascending was coated with a particularly nasty veneer of frost what a ruthless place to imprison a black spartacus from the tropics leader of the first successful negro slave revolt in history theres dampness to fortress de joux more penetrating than the actual temperature and the mountains around are brown bleak and spotted with snow napoleon hoped the cold would squeeze out the black generals revelations and the british wanted him before it did the englishpaid frenchborn agent who recruited me for this insanity charles frotte tried to make my assignment sound reasonable the fortress is quite picturesque and delightfully quiet when armies arent marching its way said frotte a spy with more allegiances than a courtesan in the kingdom of naples he was a vatican hireling whod tried unsuccessfully to rescue poor king louis before the guillotine dropped and was still a royalist whod been signed up by sidney smith my old ally now appointed to parliament with english gold there were rumors the austrians dutch and spanish were paying frotte as well i owed the man a favor for saving me in paris but assaulting a medieval monstrosity singlehandedly seemed extreme payback unfortunately i had little choice i needed help in getting back my son whod been kidnapped and getting free my wife who had talked her way into louvertures cell quiet i responded then wont they notice whatever noise i make the guards hate the gloomy weather as much as you do and stay indoors wretched place to play sentry thats to your advantage when you go up their blind side a quick ramble across the rooftops to louvertures chamber a clever application of english science a historymaking escape and off youll be to cozy london toasted for pluck and genius its splendid how things work out thats exactly what sidney smith said they dont work out at all just try not to jostle the cylinder on your back ethan id hate to see you explode the cylinder contained some witches brew invented by an english chemist named priestly i was also carrying two hundred feet of finestranded climbing rope a grappling hook a fivepound sledge a cold chisel two naval pistols a frontier hunting knife coat and boots for the man i was rescuing and winter dress for myself id had to sign a receipt for all of it and buy my own leather gloves besides yes it was a ridiculous assignment but i kept my mind on my goal get my jewel and family back learn of aztec treasure and leave these lunatics behind what if they dont let my wife out thats exactly why your scheme must succeed when a medieval knight returned from the crusades to this fort and suspected his seventeenyearold bride berthe of infidelity he locked her in a threebyfourfoot cavity for ten years she couldnt stand or stretch and her only view was of the skeletal corpse of her alleged lover hanging from a cliff opposite all the evidence attested to her innocence but the old warlord wouldnt listen this is supposed to reassure me inspire you astiza is only pretending to be a mistress and we dont lock adulterers in cages anymore modern times still its reason not to tarry on your way up the cliff when you jump back off remember to take her with you i recalled this conversation as i picked a route away from the village of la cluseetmijoux following a concealing line of pine up a steep slope on which the madman george cayley my other english confederate lugged his contraption that put me at the foot of a limestone cliff which i ascended to the base of a limestone wall the top of that wall was the highest tower of the castle in other words to stay out of sight id chosen the very hardest place to climb youre sure your glider will work i again asked cayley who had nagged the entire way reminding me not to tear fabric or fray a wire the english like nothing better than a disagreeable journey with scant chance of success their occasional luck accomplishing the impossible only encourages them perfectly he replied in theory i am neither monkey nor fly but i did have factors in my favor the fortress wall was not absolutely sheer instead having a slight inward tilt to add stability it was also so inaccessible that it was in modest disrepair frost heave or tremors had opened cracks and twisted stones giving me handholds that would have been absent in a newer wall if only i could stop the shake of my limbs i clawed my way up while not daring to look down until i could jam my left elbow in a yawning crack plant each boot on a canted stone and swing my climbing rope up with my free right arm id used a bowline to tie on the grapple and now i swung line and hook until it began to rotate in great circles whistling as it cut through the night finally i leaned out as far as i dared to give myself the best angle and let the line fly the hook sailed upward snagged the stone gutter of a conical tower roof and yanked taut the other end of the rope dropped to where cayley was waiting he began tying on his machine i began hauling myself up eyes blinking against sleet the extra coat for louverture flapping like a loose sail i came near the top a parapet to my right and crabwalked across the face of the tower my boot toes teetering as the angle of the rope steepened almost there unfortunately i had angled my way in front of a grilled tower window a candle was burning low inside almost guttering a figure rose from bed had i made a shadow or sound tousling her long hair a woman peered out my face was like a full moon outside the slit of her window she was young pretty and her nightdress hung temptingly on her form lovely breasts and belly as near as i could discern and the face of an angel i paused for a moment instinctively enchanted then she opened her mouth to scream chapter a stiza and i had been married less than a year joined in wedlock the summer of by lieutenant andrew sterett on board the american navy schooner enterprise that dashing officer had plucked us out of the sea near tripoli after we escaped the barbary pirates i suppose our shipboard union wasnt exactly a womans ceremony given that there could be no flowers bunting or bridesmaid but we did have three redoubtable savants as witnesses my companions robert fulton zoologist georges cuvier and geologist william smith plus my little friend pierre radisson to warn my lover that she was crazy to marry a man as senseless as me fortunately id met astiza during napoleons campaign in egypt and shed had ample opportunity to judge my merits and shortcomings cupid had seen fit to reunite us the crew did make the ceremony festive by stringing signal flags from the rigging crafting a temporary bridal train from a scrap of old sail and organizing an orchestra consisting of fife drum bell and horn that managed barely recognizable versions of yankee doodle and heart of oak a wedding march was beyond their repertoire after sterett pronounced us man and wife i kissed the girl with gusto danced a jig with little harry fondled the emerald id stolen from the pasha of tripoli and looked forward to a life of ease pierre also gave us a locket hed lifted in our headlong flight from tripoli set with diamonds and worth a gentlemans yearly income for your honeymoon donkey he told me but you need a reward too theres nothing to buy where a canadian voyageur goes spend this gift on your wife and son certainly our marriage began as an idyll sterett put my family ashore in naples and we visited the newly excavated pits at pompeii dug by antiquarian william hamilton who seemed to have permanently lent his wife emma to my old acquaintance admiral horatio nelson ruins fascinate astiza and even i was intrigued given that id seen pompeii artifacts in the mansion of malmaison outside paris bought by napoleons wife josephine we congratulated hamilton on his industry and saw gratitude that we were interested in something other than his straying wife i judged him happier without the tart who was too young for him anyway and a parvenu as shameless as me from naples astiza harry and i made our way to rome and its overgrown forum and so northward enjoying the european peace between britain and france we had a sunny christmas on the island of elba and then after new year made the quick crossing to france which was visibly prospering since napoleon had seized power we drifted toward paris busy learning to be husband and wife astiza was the kind of bright independent woman whom some men would run from but who fascinated me she was seductive as a siren poised as a goddess and as commonsensical as a midwife what she saw in me i cant say unless i represented a challenging remodeling project i simply knew i was lucky to have her and hauled in my winnings i first met her after she helped her alexandrian master take potshots at napoleon and shes proved a scrapper ever since shed been a brilliant slavehighly educated with a scholars curiosity about ancient mystery and a wizards determination to make sense out of existence wed fallen in love on the nile just like antony and cleopatra except with a lot less money despite my infatuation i daresay theres more work to a marriage than poets let on negotiations are worthy of a talleyrand what time to bed and which side do you sleep on left for me who tracks the money her and suggests ways to spend it me what rules govern our child hers and who works off the boys energy with romping play me do we sup in candlelit cellars with hearty portions of ale my preference or sunlit terraces with vegetables fruit and wine hers who decides on a route deals with innkeepers sees to the laundry drags along souvenirs initiates lovemaking rises first reads late sets the pace of travel decides appropriate attire sketches out an ideal home lingers in a library contemplates ancient temples pays extra for a bath burns incense rolls dice or takes coach seats facing backward or forward more seriously i was set on finding us a home in america while my wife longed for the sunlit mysteries of egypt trees enclosed her soul while sheltering mine and i was drawn to mountains while astiza preferred the shore she loved me but i was a sacrifice i loved her but she pulled me in directions to which i was reluctant to return when unmarried the future was vague and full of endless possibility with marriage we began to make choices wedded bliss is certainly more complicated than the rapture of falling in love but once you share out the victories and defeats and come to compromise theres more contentment than id ever enjoyed the growth of little harry is a marvel and the warmth of a nightly lover is a relief we became comfortable with our intimacy leading me to wonder why i hadnt seriously considered marriage before youre actually a quite suitable father ethan astiza remarked with mild surprise one day watching me build a dam on a little rivulet near nimes with harry who would turn three in june it helps to retain the mind of a twelveyearold i said most men do do you ever miss your independence women forget nothing and worry forever you mean the bullets the hardship the scheming temptresses not in the least i pointed out some more dambuilding rocks to harry who was working like a beaver ive had more than enough adventure for any fellow this is the life for me my love dull but comfortable so im dull now women pick at words like a barrister youre radiant i just meant my new life is pleasantly placid without the bullets and hardship and the temptresses see what i mean about women forgetting nothing how can a man be tempted when he has isis and venus helen and roxanne yes i was becoming quite the husband heres some more stackable stones harrylets build a castle on the shoreline and blow it up he cried i was teaching him to be a boy even though my wife sometimes frowned at our games so my family came to paris my plan was this a precious gem is more portable and easily hidden than a sack of money accordingly wed wait to sell the emerald where i judged id get the best price only then would we set off for some safe and sleepy place in america my homeland im afraid there was vanity in this schedule i had after all recently found and destroyed the mirror of archimedes rescuing harry and astiza from pirates in the process i couldnt resist the possibility of hobnobbing with the first consul again in hopes of being told how brilliantly id performed there was also the lingering question of the vast louisiana territory that france had acquired and which i now considered myself expert on having been dragged there by a norwegian lunatic id already advised jefferson to buy and napoleon to sell but the negotiations had stalled while the president sent a new diplomat named james monroe to paris i was just the man i thought to hurry things along before i retired as a gentleman thats the trouble with success it makes you feel indispensable which is a delusion pride exacts more trouble than love accordingly when my family arrived in paris in midjanuary of i was asked by american envoy robert livingston to lobby napoleon about the fate of the wasteland west of the mississippi river since livingston offered to put us up in a hotel and was working with my friend fulton on a new contraption called a steamboat i persuaded astiza we should enjoy paris while i sought another audience with bonaparte the city was buzzing with talk of renewed conflict with england which is always entertaining war is perennially exciting to society people with little chance of having to actually fight it astiza was curious to explore the citys famed libraries for texts on mystery religions so we lingered like gentry i was proud that while wed once been imprisoned in paris now we were invited to its salons what we both wouldnt dare admit is that we were still treasure hunters at heart which set the stage for disaster chapter i couldnt resist auditioning for history when i finally obtained an audience with napoleon frances first consul who had replaced the incompetent directory with his own dictatorship had spent a million francs rehabilitating the dilapidated palace of saintcloud outside paris to serve as his latest home it was a headquarters six miles from the stinking heart of the city prudently distant from democratic mobs and far bigger than josephines malmaison this new pile had the room to house the first consuls growing retinue of aides servants supplicants and schemers it could also properly impress visiting ministers of state with wasteful opulence the standard by which the powerful rank one another having first met bonaparte on the uncomfortably crowded warship lorient in i reflected how much grander and more beautiful his homes were each time i saw him in the brief period since hed ascended to power hed collected more palaces than i had shoes i still had no house at all and the contrast in our careers couldnt have been plainer when i crossed the pont de saintcloud across the seine and turned up the walled gravel avenue that led to the court of honor the ushaped palace is an imposing five floors tall and enclosed a graveled yard where messengers dismounted diplomatic coaches reined up ministers loitered footmen smoked dogs barked tradesmen delivered and servants scurried the entire arena dotted with horse droppings and overlooked by josephines grand apartments the gossip was that napoleons long hours had prompted the couple to keep separate bedrooms and that the new quarters were so confusing that when the first consul wanted to sleep with his wife hed change into his nightshirt and cap ring for his secretary and be led down the dark corridors by a single candle to her bed i of course arrived in daylight and was ushered by his new valet constant wairy an unctuous functionary with wellfed face and muttonchop whiskers who sniffed at my clothes as if i were a private standing for inspection i congratulated him with a goad what a grand place to be a lackey if anyone has experience with that he gave right back i understand it to be you monsieur gage our mutual snobbery established we ascended a grand staircase and strode down a paneled hallway entering a library the size of a barn napoleon was wolfing down the dejeuner being served in this study since there was no designated room in his palace or any other palace for that matter for regular meals he occupied a settee covered with green taffeta eating his lunch from a portable campaign table hed already batheddespite the skepticism of his doctors napoleon had embraced the modern french fashion of scrubbing every day now that he had servants to heat the waterand was dressed in a simple blue military coat with red collar white breeches and silk stockings i thought he might offer coffee and a roll not to mention some soup or chicken but he ignored my hunger and gestured me to an upholstered chair i looked about there was a large writing table napoleon had designed in the shape of a kidney or viol so he could squeeze into its middle and have incoming and outgoing correspondence flank him it was heaped with papers and had legs carved like griffins a smaller table was assigned to his new secretary claudefrancois de meneval who had abruptly replaced bourienne when the latter became embroiled in speculation over military supplies young and handsome meneval glanced at me now reminding me that wed met at mortefontaine when celebrating the american treaty i nodded though i had no memory of him behind this scribe clifflike bookcases covered the walls from floor to ceiling helping insulate the cavernous office from winters chill bronze busts of the ancient antagonists hannibal and scipio eyed each other on the mantel as if wishing for more war elephants the last time id discussed hannibal with napoleon i found myself guiding his army over the alps so this time i vowed to stay entirely away from military history gage bonaparte greeted me matteroffactly as if wed just conferred yesterday instead of nearly a year ago i thought the pirates might have finally extinguished you but here you are again like a misfire you cant pry loose from a muzzle the naturalist cuvier tells me you actually succeeded in accomplishing something not just destroying a dangerous ancient weapon first consul but finding a wife and son remarkable that someone would have you he took a drink of his favorite chambertin a pinot wine with a rich fruity flavor it reminded me i was thirsty too there was alas only one goblet but then i spied merit in you as well he said with his usual bluntness the secret to rule is to find the natural talent of each man and woman yours it seems is to perform odd errands in peculiar places but now im retiring i said lest he get the wrong idea i had some luck in tripoli and plan to settle down with my bride astiza whom youll remember from the egyptian campaign yes the one helping shoot at me he had a memory as long as a womans shes more agreeable now i said be wary of wives gage and i say that as a man mad about the one i have theres no greater misfortune for a man than to be governed by his wife in such a case he is a perfect nonentity napoleons disdain for women beyond their sexual charms was well known were partners i said a concept i wasnt sure he could comprehend bah be careful how much you love her he took another bite the guilt of many men can be traced to overaffection for their wives are you guilty because of your affection for josephine shes as guilty as me as you know from pariss tiresome gossip but all that trouble is in the past as rulers were models of rectitude now i knew better than to express my doubt of that claim our difference is that i regulate my emotions gage you cannot im a man of reason you of impulse i like you but lets not pretend were equal that was obvious enough each time i see you first consul you seem to have done better for yourself yes it surprises even me he glanced about my ambition doesnt hurry it simply keeps pace with circumstances i feel as if im being driven to an unknown goal all life is a stage set playing out as the seers promised hed told me of his visions in the great pyramid and prophecy from a legendary gnome called the little red man you still believe in destiny how else to explain where i am i was laughed at for my corsican accent in military school now were putting the finishing touches on the code napoleon which will remake the laws of france i started too penniless to buy my own uniform and now i accumulate palaces and how but destiny to explain an american like you with more lives than a cat the policeman fouche was right not to trust you because your survival is so inexplicable and i was right not to trust fouche police invent more lies than they ever discover truth id heard that the minister of police whod arrested me the year before had since been dismissed and become a mere senator just as sir sidney smith had gone from near east warlord to the relative obscurity of the british parliament i was relieved at both events lawmakers do great mischief but seldom do they personally throw you in jail do you wish to get my impressions of the mediterranean i offered bonaparte poured himself a coffee and picked up a pastry still offering me nothing forget the mediterranean your young nation is keeping the tripoli pirates occupied with its little war and im drifting toward a big war with the perfidious british theyve refused to depart malta as they promised in the treaty of amiens france hasnt upheld its obligations either he ignored this the british gage are evil no man is more peace loving than me a general who has seen the horror of war yet the lobsters have sent threescore assassins to stalk me stirred europe with spies paid by english gold and scheme to take back all of north america our two nations america and france must unite against them i received you in order to talk about louisiana my impression of that huge territory had been of black flies and bad weather but i knew thomas jefferson was eager to get hold of a property several times bigger than france american negotiators had hoped to buy new orleans to assure trading access to the gulf of mexico id suggested a bigger bargain i hope our two countries can come to agreement on that wilderness i agreed but i thought you were sending an army to create an empire there i had an army until yellow fever took it in saintdomingue as well as my brotherinlaw general charles leclerc leaving my poor sister pauline a widow he eyed me as he chewed his pastry im pretty sure he knew id tupped his sister when helping with another treaty at mortefontaine the tryst had really been the girls idea and it was a romp i paid dearly for since it forced me into temporary exile on the american frontier but brothers view such flings through a particular prism my history with bonaparte was complicated and pauline was one of the complications i tried not to show my relief that her husband was safely dead what a tragedy i said my imbecile sister cut her beautiful hair to show her grief she hardly liked the man and certainly wasnt faithful to him but appearances are all he sighed and picked up a letter she also took the first boat back to france she has the hardheaded practicality of a bonaparte beauty too this is a communication from leclerc last october just weeks before he died he read here is my opinion on this country we must destroy all the negroes in the mountains men and women and keep only children under twelve years old destroy half of those on the plain and not leave in the colony a single man of color who has worn an epaulette otherwise the colony will never be quiet if you wish to be the master of saintdomingue you must send me twelve thousand men without wasting a single day he put the letter down what does that sound like to you gage futility he grimly nodded i keep you in my service for your honesty dont i saintdomingue is tormented by longing for freedom in a place where freedom can never work in trying to make all men equal the blacks have succeeded only in making them equally miserable and im left to put things back as they were ive captured the leading rebel louverture and locked him up in the mountains but the negroes dont know when to quit the war is eating whole regiments i have no twelve thousand troops for haiti let alone men to send to louisiana sorry to hear of your difficulty i said even though i wasnt sorry at all it wasnt like the first consul deserved another million square miles hed bullied spain into giving louisiana back to france a couple years before but the spanish flag still flew in new orleans because napoleon hadnt bothered to put anyone there to take possession he was busy trying to hang on to frances richest colony the sugar isle of saintdomingue by reinstating slavery to make its sugar competitive on the world market as a result that onetime paradise had become a charnel house his policy was a complete betrayal of the ideals of the french revolution and stupid as well it baffles me why people believe they can force on others what theyd never tolerate themselves meanwhile tom jefferson was the only one in the world crazy enough to actually want louisiana having not seen the hell that is the american west he believed it heaven and mused about sending his secretary meriwether lewis to explore it promising to persuade bonaparte to sell the place had won me a good bottle of wine with the president jefferson like franklin was genius enough that hed spent his diplomatic days in france learning to properly eat and drink he later bought so much wine on credit that hed assembled the best cellar and worst debt in america the virginian is also a far better conversationalist than the brusque bonaparte and by the time we got to the bottom of our bottle id decided to vote him another term if i lived to get the chance napoleon had less patience for lifes pleasantries he waved and servants materialized to take his silver serving dishes away whether it was palace cuisine or infantry biscuits he ate at lightning speed so your nation gage can benefit from european folly i need you to go to the american negotiators and convince them that buying all of louisiana is their idea it will set the united states as a counterweight to britain in canada and give me money to fight the english in the coming war if i cant control saintdomingue britain shall not control the mississippi valley the united states will block english ambitions for france like a prodigal son thats not how my nation thought of itself but i did see a deal could be to everyones benefit including mine id played a small role in ending an undeclared naval war between america and france back in and now i was gobetween again napoleon wanted to unload an expanse hed acquired with a stroke of a pen before englands navy took it from him it appeared i could make everyone happy except britain ill make my countrymen think in grand terms i promised why purchase a mere city new orleans when you could buy an empire my stomach growled from hunger what do you want for the dustbin anyway fifty million francs suggest double that and they can take pleasure in bargaining me down when i conquer london and put an end to the british navy your country and mine will become the greatest trading partners in the world louisiana is a first step this is an opportunity as significant as our revolutionary victory at yorktown ill fire every american dollar i receive at the english from the mouth of my cannons and all of us can enjoy the spectacle agreed but after this service im determined to retire on what pension i acquired something of value in tripoli i intend to sell he eyed me with shrewd curiosity what is it no concern of the french government a trifle but enough to set my family for life thats a remarkable trifle ive finally had remarkable luck youve been quite valuable at times gage if annoying at others napoleon had almost had me shot two or three times realize that one doesnt resign from destiny at will yes youre american but when your interests coincide with frances then you become french do you understand i understand thats exactly what i wish to retire from im working very hard at being useless except for louisiana of course its important we complete this sale gage you must stay in paris until its concluded i understand but given that i havent actually sold my trifle yet i wonder if an appointment could come from all my hard work especially if youre about to gain fifty million francs its always smart to look for crumbs from the diplomatic table a salary will convince american negotiators i truly represent your thinking ha if you wish to pretend partnership with me you should adopt the habit of my most trusted agents which is a discreet tattoo signifying their loyalty a tattoo of what the initial n surrounded by a laurel wreath you must be joking life is filled with enemies there has to be some way to tell friends not by wearing another mans brand its a secret legion he was annoyed that i wasnt flattered or you can have a more temporary badge but you must give it back should you ever displease me whats that he opened a drawer in his desk and drew out a small medal on a chain it was the same design as the tattoo but in gold an ornament to wear around the neck only a handful of agents are so favored it would give me credibility i supposed i took it in my palm small light unobtrusive and removable not very much metal there are a million men who would pledge their lives for such favor i appreciate the honor i didnt but wanted to avoid insult and your discoveries when on missions for me belong to france a last mission on louisiana in paris and then home something to buy bread would help in the meantime i persisted when it came to money he could be evasive as a loan officer get louisiana for your president gage and theyll make you a congressman chapter so i worked to double the size of my homeland arranging a meeting with livingston to plant the idea of buying every savageinfested acre we actually had something in common robert livingston had been the grand master of freemasonrys grand lodge in new york before traveling to france i was a mason as well although i didnt tell him it was of the most casual and disreputable kind it was benjamin franklin himself who introduced me to the precepts of your fraternity i said to ingratiate myself ive striven to live up to them ever since striven but not succeeded if my government could afford a modest salary i might be able to linger in paris to see the bargaining through im a confidant of napoleon you know i showed him the pendant it helped that livingston had struck up a friendship with my american colleague robert fulton after meeting the inventor at one of his panoramas or huge circular paintings on such lurid themes as city conflagrations fulton charged admission to earn a living while designing unnecessary machines wed lost the tinkerers submarine nautilus when rescuing astiza and harry from tripoli but now fulton had a grander scheme for a contraption called a steamboat it was to be two and a half times as long as his submersible and painted bright as a carnival it would be captained by a man called a mechanician and would go three miles an hour against the current cutting the time for freight to go from nantes to paris from four months to two weeks such speed seemed unlikely but livingston a steam engine enthusiast whod written to the inventor of that device james watt in london had joined fultons project the eccentrics were as happy as boys with a play fort so to keep their favor i quit pointing out that machines are expensive heavy and deafening like all men the pair liked things that made noise be it a lusty wench at full gallop the crack of a cannon or the headacheinducing thump of boiler and crank i guess we could spare you a small stipend livingston said bonaparte also gave me a letter of introduction to his minister francois barbemarbois the french negotiator i got on famously with him as well because we were both victims of the unpredictability of fortune francois had actually served as intendant of saintdomingue in before the slave revolt began and was well aware the colony was swallowing napoleons army after the revolution his moderation made him suspect by royalist and revolutionary alike since reasonable men like us are always threatening to the ambitious and fanatic for a while he was imprisoned in hellish french guiana now that bonaparte was firmly in power his common sense was deemed useful again i confided that id had my own ups and downs ive had a pharaohs hoard and a book of magic slip through my fingers and until i got married i had the devils own time with women but i remain ambitious ill try to get the americans to raise their sights if you could advance me a french salary for my expenses i can afford to wait to bend the ear of james monroe you really think your countrymen will pay to take this wasteland off our hands barbemarbois could scarcely believe we americans were so gullible i had companions who thought louisiana was the garden of eden one killed the other wounded but they were optimists so my chance to draw pay from both america and france and to encourage the greatest real estate deal in history caused us to linger in paris into the spring of it was a pleasant interlude we strolled the tivoli gardens where fireworks and acrobats delighted my son there was a tethered elephant two rather bored and rattylooking lions in iron cages and an ostrich that napoleons troops had brought back from egypt it displayed considerably more ferocity than the cats at the competing frascati amusement park only a franc a day per person there was a miniature village of mills and bridges that absorbed my boy like a gulliver look a real castle hed cry at fortifications three feet high the balloon ascents we watched at the tuileries brought powerful emotions to astiza and me given our history in egypt the exotic costumes of street performers brought to mind perilous times in the holy land i found married life altogether different from our frequently interrupted courtship we were no longer allied by danger and didnt have the flush that comes from novelty and infatuation instead there was deepening affection and security like many great men my mentor benjamin franklin had been a poor husband who hadnt hesitated to expound on what makes a good one marriage was an investment in time commitment and compromise he told me a work for which the profit was contentment and even at times bright happiness the most natural state of man hed counseled if natural then why are our heads always swiveling toward the next woman like a dog spying a rabbit because we dont catch the rabbit ethan or if we do we scarcely know what to do with it on the contrary marriage saves us from confusion and heartbreak yet your wife is five thousand miles away in philadelphia and i take comfort knowing she is there waiting i counted myself astoundingly lucky then id snatched an emerald yes but what was the real jewel from tripoli my wife beside me we walked arm in arm under rose arbors ate sugared ices swayed to accordion bands playing on brilliantly lit stages and watched up to three hundred people at a time wheeling to the new german waltz the crowd thinned when the more complicated quadrille and mazurka were danced but gaiety had returned to paris there was also quiet anxiety because the newspapers were full of tension with england rumor contended that napoleon had ordered work on an invasion fleet of barges to cross the channel once the boats were ready war would return predictions went ethan if we tarry much longer we may be trapped in paris astiza warned as we crossed the new pedestrian bridge of the arts at the louvre an iron novelty that was one of several bridges napoleon had ordered to unite both banks of the city britain will blockade and france may arrest any aliens she was not just beautiful the antiquityinspired fashion of high waist puffed sleeves and a vale of decolletage enhanced her greek egyptian sultriness to a bewitching degree but practical as well she thought ahead a novel quality and despite napoleons prejudices was probably closer to his habits than i was she also gave me a wifely elbow when my eye lingered too long on other consular beauties some of them with breasts in mere gauze unfortunately that happy fashion was being discouraged by a more conservative militarist ethic that began with bonaparte himself the corsican was proving stern announcing that the primary purpose of women was not to display their charms but make future soldiers given male instincts i thought the two went hand in hand but i think he wanted sex like everything else bent to efficient purpose for myself i saw fashion as one of lifes pleasures and necessities its display as articulate as bright conversation astiza and i made quite the dashing couple given that id copied the incroyable dandies with the long boot tight coat carefully wrinkled shirt and stylish top hat a precisely calculated mix of elegance and disorder to mirror the turmoil of our times we were a couple at the height of fashion and i enjoyed being glanced at it was mostly bought on credit but once i sold the emerald my debts would be erased the british are already leaving the city astiza went on as we strolled harry would run ahead and then come back to announce he was exhausted and then run ahead again there are rumors napoleon wants to invade england since hes ordered the building of boats its more than a rumor i paused to watch the traffic on the seine paris was a pleasing spectacle on a sunny march day the polluted river glittered its banks skirted with bright arcades and singsonging merchants palaces and church towers punctuated bright blue sky like exclamation points napoleons rule had brought stability and reinvestment but im supposed to wait for monroe and finish the purchase of louisiana even if war breaks out were neutral as americans i knew she didnt think of herself as american yet but i intended she become one two dueling navies and ethan gage the hero of acre and mortefontaine she responded youve managed to make enemies on all sides weve a son to think about lets take ship for new york or philadelphia settle before nelson or napoleon strikes and you can seek an appointment from jefferson youve got a family now ethan indeed i did a revelation no matter how many times i remembered it but we still have to sell the emerald well get a far better price here than in the united states but i dont want to have to worry about coin until negotiations are concluded lets wait until the proper moment the proper moment is now the first consul is not content without a war this was true people repeat what theyre successful at and napoleon had made himself with generalship for all his trumpeting of peace he was forever listening for the roll of the drums i suspected this next war would dwarf all that had come before so i looked at her fondly and decided to indulge worry made her look vulnerable uncommon for astiza with a beauty that stirred my heart very well ive lent the negotiators what wisdom i can lets sell the stone and retire to the everlasting peace we both deserve chapter josephine bonapartes favorite jeweler was marieetienne nitot a man who had apprenticed to the great auber jeweler to marie antoinette his success demonstrates anew that revolution disrupts everything but the desire for luxury nitot coupled his mentors artistry with a salesmans flair and after the queen lost her head hed quickly built a clientele among the new elite of france gossip said the jeweler met bonaparte when grasping the bridle of napoleons skittish horse on an avenue of paris preventing a fall and that hed cultivated the relationship ever since the handsome craftsman opened a smart shop called chaumet at place vendome near the clockmaker breguet and both did a bustling business the plunder of napoleons early victories had fueled a mania for bright baubles displaying frances new pride and power the necklaces and rings on display were clustered near chaumets bright windows for an appraisal of my emerald nitot took us to the rear of his establishment locking the workshop door for privacy and carefully washing his hands in a basin a delicacy few surgeons would bother with gray light filtered from a skylight gridded with iron bars to discourage thieves lamps lent a honeyed glow there were banks of drawers that no doubt held treasures and a workbench with vises clamps and jeweler tools bright bits of silver and gold glittering like fairy dust thick ledger books held records of trades and treasures from all over the world i could almost smell my coming coin monsieur gage im so honored to have your business nitot began a man of dash and daring and rumored to have recently returned from a secret mission against the pirates for bonaparte i couldnt help puffing and your beautiful wife so exotic so regal i beg you madame to allow us to grace your lovely neck were here to sell a jewel not buy one monsieur nitot she replied i have a young son we had to leave in the care of a nursemaid in our apartment and im eager to have our business concluded and get back to my boy she had a mothers instinct to stay close to her young yes but how wonderful to sell and buy no nitot went on its merely a suggestion inspired by your radiance just as a great picture deserves an inspiring frame so does jewelry demand exquisite complexion and yours of amber and olive alabaster and silk your neck your ears your wrists your ankles you are your husbands ornament and the world begs to decorate you id had quite enough of this since the compliments seemed a little forward and potentially expensive to boot no wonder this rascal was doing so well he had the persuasive instincts of the devil but i was no mere brigadier looking for a way to hang martial plunder on a consort i was a savant of sorts an electrician and a franklin man determined to finance a contemplative life with a rock stolen from a pasha so i kept my emotions in check we need an appraisal not a commentary on my wife of course of course im just so vulnerable to beauty i lay at its mercy a poor artisan helpless at my desire to bring splendor to the world my apologies monsieur at being at all presumptive i am here only to assist i was partially annoyed because astiza had actually suggested she stay home to watch little harry and now i wished id let her why do you need me to sell a jewel shed asked in our hotel because this was the first time in my life i could anticipate real wealth and i wanted to show off by letting my bride watch me impress a jaded jeweler now i was foolishly jealous that nitots attention was on her and not on my cleverness for getting the stone in the first place im just a man whos prompt about business i told him i was nervous because the simple job of hawking my trophy was tinged with foreboding i hadnt after all really earned the stone though i attribute my gambling success to my wits this time i was selling plunder oui oui he said his eyes assessed me guessing my discomfort and fearing he might miss a bargain your stone please i kept it in a felt purse on a metal chain hung round my neck to discourage any thief or pickpocket now i fished out an emerald the size of a robins egg nitot gasped which was gratifying even in this light the jewel glowed with green fire heavy slick and imposing it was decoration fit for a king and my hope was that the jeweler would know a royal in russia or rome eager to pay dearly where did you get this he seemed almost in shock from an ottoman who got too close to my wife it is truly incredible and worth quite a bit of money im betting he set the stone on his workbench and went to a shelf with old leatherbound volumes he pulled one down called lost treasures of the pagans and for some minutes studied it occasionally glancing at the emerald and where did the ottoman get it he finally asked stole it i imagine the man was a pirate who wounded his mother and killed his brother and wasnt very polite to me he kept that jewel in a cage with a leopard grumpier than a tax auditor astiza was in the thick of a catfight it was quite a tussle but i said no more because i doubted the jeweler would believe me i see nitot said even though he didnt see at all well there are stories about this stone this may have been the legendary green apple of the sun monsieur gage if so it was stolen while en route to the pope as a present from his catholic majesty philip ii of spain emperor of the holy roman empire in the sixteenth century that has always been conjecture however because both the jewels existence and the greater treasure it came from have been a matter of historical mystery i love a good mystery so the stone is worth what exactly when dealing with an expert you have to work to keep them on track like putting blinders on a horse as a precious gem it has one price tag but as a piece of tragic history its value is almost incalculable you may have stumbled on one of the most astonishing artifacts in history i swelled again id like to think it was more than just a stumble monsieur have you ever heard of la noche triste is that another jewel it means the sad night ethan astiza said in spanish did i mention one reason i loved the girl was because she was bright as a penny ive had a few of those im afraid la noche triste monsieur gage was when the aztecs managed to briefly drive the spanish out of their capital in tenochtitlan they rose in a fury overcoming the volleys of conquistador muskets with fearless numbers jade club against spanish steel hernan cortes lost hundreds of men and most of his artillery but also something even more significant as he retreated on the causeways that led across a lake from the spectacular city his men lost the captured treasure of montezuma they died with it in the waters of lake texcoco you think this stone is part of a larger treasure he had my attention look in the book here legend describes that one of the aztec emperors treasures was a spectacular emerald from the jungles of south america the size and cut of this gem it was a small but distinct part of riches that would dwarf those of our own kings a bounty of gold jewels and silver such as europe had never seen there were great golden and silver wheels said to predict the future of the universe gold collars that could bend a proud warrior with their weight a metal alligator with gems for eyes and crystals for teeth silver birds golden idols if this is really part of the aztec emperors hoard it means at least part of the treasure was not just lost but at some point found and then lost again what do you mean when the spaniards reconquered mexico city no mention was made of the wealth the retreating soldiers had desperately hurled into the lake and ever since there has been speculation one story is that the indians recovered the precious goods and took them on a perilous journey to forgotten mountains to the far north of mexico if so no one knows where the burial place is one story another is that the spaniards forced the indians to dive and salvage the treasure for shipment to spain putting to death the native slaves so that no word would leak to other european powers a galleon with the recovered hoard set out in secret for the spanish homeland but disappeared in a hurricane this single gem was kept by the only survivor a cabin boy so the rest of the lot is at the bottom of the ocean there were rumors that escaped slaves called maroons eventually salvaged what was lost by diving in the shallows of the reef where the galleon was dashed some of the loot was melted lost or stolen but much was reportedly hidden just why is not clear and thats the last anyone heard of the hoard until an announcement was made that this emerald was on its way to the pope but it never arrived making some wonder if montezumas treasure existed at all some say the entire story is a myth until now exactly does this mean the wreck was salvaged and if it was what became of its contents have blacks passed down its secret whereabouts each generation to another waiting until they rise as a nation and can reclaim it now here is famous ethan gage hero of the pyramids explorer of the american wilderness appearing with a token in his hands is this but a precursor of more astonishment to come do you have a ships hold of aztec treasure in your apartment if i did id have more than an apartment wouldnt i he smiled even this single gem will buy you more than an apartment ethan gage i certainly hope so he still hadnt given an appraisal and if its from the lost treasure of montezuma nitot went on it may buy us both a palace you as source and me as dealer it becomes not just adornment but historic majesty imbued in stone so i must ask your permission to leave the emerald here while i consult more texts concerning its provenance if we can establish its identity its value goes up astronomically the question becomes whether you are merely wealthy or fabulously wealthy this was just the kind of talk i wanted to hear no wonder this nitot sold to dukes and duchesses he certainly knew the trigger to pull for a mercenary like me aztec treasure my id never even been to mexico but leave the stone we were skeptical how can we trust you with its safekeeping astiza asked madame this is not a stone one pawns without notice to steal it id have to flee the lucrative life ive built for myself and try to sell a jewel that would instantly mark me as a thief dont worry theres more profit in being honest let me make some inquiry so we know its true value we are as i said in a hurry i reminded then come back in one week soon all of us may be famous i knew i was onto something when i spied that green egg on karamanlis turban after all my years of fruitless treasure hunting at last i was to be compensated and more generously than id guessed yes we were brilliant and about to be richer than i dreamed i turned to my new bride this is better luck than i ever hoped chapter luck is fickle ive come near to drowning more times than i care to remember and ive decided its the near part that makes the experience so unpleasant if one truly drowned consciousness would be mercifully lost and the victim would pass to other worlds but i have the habit of never quite succumbing and thus revisit the experience in all its horror which was precisely the intention of a renegade secret policeman named leon martel one week after my first visit to nitots shop he had my ankles roped i was suspended upside down from a butchers hook and an iron collar was locked to my neck he was methodically lowering me into a trough of cold water i regret the necessity monsieur gage he told me as i sputtered my ambition is to become a gentleman but you are notoriously uncooperative no im not im just confused and down id go again id hold my breath as long as i could suspended so my hair just grazed the bottom of the tin finally id writhe in growing terror explode a gush of bubbles that sucked water into my lungs with searing pain and then be lifted coughing and gasping the idiot leaned close with garlic breath and asked where is the lost treasure of the aztecs id never heard of it until last week down id submerge once more there were at least two reasons i should have suspected something like this was about to take place first my luck always falls short of true fortune so why did i expect to neatly sell my fabulous emerald the way an ordinary man might treasures have been elusive every time ive touched them second nitots jewelry shop was uncharacteristically quiet when we returned as scheduled to learn the history of our stone and receive payment its front was closed to customers and it was only by tapping on the window that a clerk let us in astiza was once more impatient nervous about leaving harry to play with his toys shed argued that people kept looking at us in odd ways and that shed seen the same scrutinizer three different times i suggested that they were looking at her youre too modest i reassured youve no idea how lovely you truly are lets beg off sick and go some other time the portents arent aligned she was superstitious as a sailor and leave a kings fortune with nitot now there is something to worry about youre the one whos in a hurry if youre so concerned about impending war the best thing is to conclude our bargain and be off to america merchants are usually affectionate when money changes hands but the clerk avoided my eye when he allowed us into the shop scurrying to his bench wheres nitot in the back monsieur his eye was pressed to a loupe to watch a diamond as if it might get away of course id already spent my new fortune in my imagination several times over and was oblivious to the odd atmosphere my naive assumption was that our sale was so monumental that the jeweler wanted privacy to let me scoop up my gold i had purchased a small magnifying glass hung on a cord around my neck as id hung the jewel id prudently studied my stone before surrendering it for appraisal and would examine it again i didnt want nitot switching emeralds and then backing out of a sale so i was being clever and cautious in my own modest way just not clever and cautious enough to astiza id given napoleons n pendant to advertise our importance and discourage any sales nonsense about decorating my ornament it actually looked good on her and except for the fact it came from a megalomaniac i rather liked the piece now she put her hand on my arm i should have stayed with horus she whispered paris always smells wicked to me thats just the fish market and the plumbing lets finish our business our boy had also been playing quite happily with thimbles and spools rolling the latter into the former while his nursemaid watched i doubted he missed us a whit so we returned to the back room marieetienne i called i thought he could have set out little cakes or a decanter of brandy to celebrate but the room was gloomy the clerk oddly moved behind us are you here i repeated the door slammed shut and shadows became animated half a dozen ruffians in tricorn hats and heavy black cloaks dark as morticians materialized from the gloom the workshop was suddenly as crowded as a privy at the opera when the singing has gone on too long damnation robbery i was so surprised that i was momentarily stupid then i realized we didnt have the jewel to rob and felt momentarily cheered im afraid we have nothing of value gentlemen not robbery monsieur gage said their leader arrest arrest i groaned with annoyance even though i try to do the right thing people are constantly trying to incarcerate me i make a poor prisoner having a knack for escape for what this time withholding information from the french state information my confusion was growing about what a significant archaeological discovery the green apple of the sun were they greedy gendarmes or impatient historians its exactly such information that im seeking not that i have and arrest on whose authority minister fouche but he is no longer minister of police dont you read the papers he should be when joseph fouche had arrested me the year before he was one of the most powerful men in france his ministry the stronghold of napoleons military dictatorship but by his very success fouche had become dangerously powerful and bonaparte had temporarily dismissed him napoleon liked to keep his acolytes offbalance however the ambitious policeman had left behind a police organization more efficient and insidious than the world had ever seen and the reassignment of their superior to the legislature had apparently not dampened his investigators conspiratorial instincts this bunch had decided to act as if their boss had never changed and you are inspector leon martel the ringleader said his heavy cavalry pistol pointed at my midsection his colleagues also had guns out their piggish gaze lingered a little too long on astizas figure for my taste and for policemen these seemed a loutish bunch i tensed for the worst you must share with us what you know while fouche had the sly thinlipped look of a lizard martel had the bright concentration of a cat hazel eyes giving him a look of feline cunning you came into possession of a valuable jewel and we require answers on its history i know nothing and where is my valuable wheres nitot its been confiscated and the jeweler has been sent home confiscated you mean stolen it is you who stole it first monsieur from the pasha of tripoli help thieves i cried no one can hear you the real employees have been ordered to leave the shop for the day youve no allies or hope of rescue on the contrary the first consul is my friend and patron i warned look at my wifes neck she wears his pendant he shook his head hes no patron when you hide secrets critical to the future of france present your wrists for manacles please ive learned that hesitation with unpleasant people only encourages them its best to establish immediately where the relationship stands i was also heartily tired of people pointing firearms at the lover who was now my wife and mother of my child so i did present my wrists but only to lock my fists together like a hammer and launch them fiercely up under martels annoying pistol knocking its muzzle toward the ceiling the gun went off flew like a jugglers pin and i kept swinging ramming my fists into the bastards nose martel howled quite satisfyingly with pain astiza as quickwitted as me fanned her cloak like a batwing in front of the scoundrels henchmen packed too tight in our closet of a room i leaped after the cape plowing into the lot while more pistols went off gun smoke roiling the renegade gendarmes and i crashed together into the bank of jewel drawers toppling them and spilling baubles everywhere by some miracle no one was hit though a quiteexpensive cloak was ruined with half a dozen bullet holes but the nice thing about muzzleloaders is that everybodys weapon was now empty run for harry i shouted as we thrashed and cursed on the floor the jewelers workbench turning over and then as i clawed for one of their pistols in hopes of using it as a club hands grabbing my throat and ankles something struck my head and everything went black chapter i awoke in a vaulted cellar of smoky stone suspended upside down like an unhappy possum and annoyed that the police if thats who they were wanted me since i knew not a whit as i woozily came to i got an upsidedown look at my assailants including martel recognizable because he had a bandaged nose and foul expression corruption had hardened him his jaw was shovelshaped as if in the habit of digging into others affairs and his skin was cribbaged from some kind of pox i theorized this cruelty of fate made flirtation difficult and kept him in bad humor people who dont have frequent congress are sour and mean martels gallic skin was dark from sun and weather and his thick unruly hair was barely controlled by a cord on his queue dark brows met over his nowbroken nose heavy lips tended toward a sneer and his face had the overall grimness that comes from a desperate childhood too much drink and disappointment or both he was the sort of man who either guards a prison or inhabits it not a cat i decided but a feral rodent while useful to superiors he can never be one of them because his edges are too rough i could tell martel knew that and it gnawed at him he could rise only so high where did the emerald originate gage his breath was like that of a diseased neapolitan whore who subsists on cheap wine and suspect foods like tomato and eggplant italians id learned would eat anything not that i necessarily know anything about diseased italian whores wheres astiza i countered it seemed a reasonable question but one of his henchmen hit me with a carriage whip for asking it i yelped martel stuck his bandaged nose in my face again the man needed a good toothbrush and a pick too what do you know of the flying machines the what it occurred to me that id been captured by lunatics which is always more dangerous than the merely covetous say did my wife get away the switch struck again which i took to be an answer in the affirmative they were angry at how things had gone which was encouraging but they also plunged me into cold filthy water which was not i didnt even have time to take a breath that first time and began choking immediately they hauled me back up as i wheezed and coughed shaking my head like a dog so i could spray their breeches it was all the defiance i could muster who the devil are you i gasped youre not just thieves youre worse were the police i told you inspector leon martel remember that name because in time ill make you pay for my nose with your own unless you tell me what i want to hear the fact weve lost our patron in the ministry doesnt erase our loyalty to france we act on our own for the good of the state a criminal with a badge is the very worst kind your superiors have no idea what youre up to here theyll thank us for it its never good when evil thinks its doing the right thing i do know one secret i tried i have friends trying to build a steamboat which is a vessel powered by one of watts clamorous engines its going to be demonstrated for napoleon on the seine this summer i wouldnt care to fetch the boiler wood myself but it may prove a brilliant investment opportunity though personally i cant see the logic yet men like you wagering on the idea at this opportune stage i was plunged down into the water again their questions hammered at me how had i learned about the jewel where was the treasure of the aztecs what did i know about flying machines oh they were balmy all right and not a little happy to keep me so rattled that it gave them an excuse to dunk me again and again they were having a jolly good time of it whereas i experienced the shock of cold water the dark and helplessness the agonizing holding of breath the terrible sensation of drowning excruciating resurrection back to the light how precious is the air we so take for granted searing pain of lung raw throat leaking nostrils the dread of extinction ive had better conversations i took it from a heathen pasha i sputtered its only proper recompense for serving the first consul hes a friend i warn you and down they sank me again each time was longer but instead of loosening my lips the torture was turning me insensible they began to realize this as martel started pacing maybe hes really as stupid as he says one of his henchmen suggested the great ethan gage hero explorer and negotiator he makes fools of men by playing the fool the one man in the world to find this emerald just happens to be the one who has roamed from the holy land to canada who befriends savants and politicians who served the foul englishman sir sydney smith no gage knows far more than hes telling us look at him hang there playing the idiot but i am an idiot i tried and down i plummeted again living a significant life is terribly overrated i believe the treasure is in the great pyramid of egypt i tried the next time making up nonsense just to get them to stop the aztecs and egyptians were one happy bunch you see with nearly the same kind of architecture of course ive no idea how to get back inside but with enough gunpowder they lashed me again grunting each time they swung the switch flogging never works but we live in an age when its the first solution to everything lord it hurt but at least they didnt dunk me since i truly was on the brink of drowning what do we do now martel the accomplice said fouche cant protect us anymore and bonaparte will be impatient i warned you that no man brings his wife on a treasure hunt or dawdles in paris while riches await silence he glared at me he must know more than hes telling why do people assume this men never want my advice when i have any and whip me for it when i dont to hell with him martel went on lets drown gage and throw the body into the seine his wife had bonapartes ornament and gage his iron collar by the time anyone finds him hell be rotted to cheese an unpleasant picture why dont you just keep the emerald i countered i promise not to tell and if i hear of any more riches ill be sure to let you know then there was a shot loud and shocking in the close cellar and a bullet hit the rope i was suspended by twanging it like a harpsichord string it frayed i twirled it broke and then i dropped like an anchor toward the tub of water hitting the bottom with a great splash even submerged i heard a blaze of other shots ring out and then i truly began to drown i should have sold the thing in naples chapter a t first being shot down into water deep enough to drown seemed worse than being deliberately dunked since there was no block and tackle to haul me out and the iron collar kept my head hard against the bottom i wiggled in my ropes like a worm but id awkwardly jammed thinking further i remembered the gunfire and considered whether staying under for a spell might not be the safest strategy after all instead of thrashing i tried to be inconspicuous while hard things pounded the tubs sides soon i neared the limit of how long i could hold my breath there was an unholy clamor through tin and water and i wondered what the devil was going on should i surface the decision was made for me when my nose emerged of its own accord bullets had pierced the tub missing me and the receptacle was rapidly draining strong hands grasped and hauled me upright i know nothing i sputtered again which was close enough to the truth good god gage someone said in english youre just as much trouble as sidney smith said youd be sidney smith my old savior or was it nemesis from the holy land id fought for him against napoleon until fate cast me again on the french side and he seemed to have retained a fondness despite my confusion of alliances i am profoundly likable youre english i asked the men more baffled than ever a french anglophile charles frotte sir at your service with compliments of sir sidney he began sawing at my bonds with a knife large enough to make me hope his energy was matched by precision two bodies of renegade gendarmes were sprawled on the floor and the others had fled frottes companions were reloading their guns im afraid martel has gotten away and is no doubt mustering help we must hurry my veins stung as circulation began to return im afraid im not up for running we have a coach frotte had that intensity common to small wiry men that can be wearying except in an emergency which was now my bonds fell away and one of his confederates worked the latch on the iron collar at the back of my neck it toppled with a clang narrowly missing a toe my boots had disappeared the magnifying glass had dropped from my neck to the bottom of the tub and i instinctively snatched it up again in case i somehow got my gem back when your income is as uncertain as mine you dont forget anything that might help preserve your fortune frottes men half carried me from the cellar dark and caped they looked exactly like the ruffians id just escaped from theres uniformity to the spy trade its practitioners have far more in common with one another than whichever nation they serve a black coach waited in an alley its hubs almost touching each wall two heavily muscled black horses were in harness snorting and steelshod with a restlessness conjured out of a nightmare vapor huffed from the animals nostrils and a coachman hooded like death hunched on the drivers seat i looked about unfortunately there was no frilly cabriolet we have to save my wife too i finally managed as my wits returned your wife monsieur gage has saved you were off to confer with her frotte shoved me into the coach with him a shotgun and musket leaning against its seats two companions hung off the back and with a crack of the coachmans whip we were off who the devil i began theyre running to block us sir the coachman shouted from above excuse me said frotte politely he picked up the shotgun leaned out the carriage door and fired ahead there were howls answering shots a pop as a bullet hole dilated our coach cabin a foot from my head and then we bumped over something prone and yelling on the muddy street i heard a crack of bone the horses galloped mud spraying one of our saviors grunted in pain and fell off the rear of our vehicle with a thud our wheels skidded then held there are proposals to pave pariss streets but its a faddish and wayward idea a dirt lane can be repaired by anyone with a shovel and swallows its own manure and refuse stone cobbles in contrast keep horse droppings on display like one of nitots jewels dirt isnt clattery like cobbles and horses can get up a good grip paving sounds very smart but its as questionable a strategy as steamboats and submarines dandies complain of the mud but thats what boots and planks are for im nothing if not opinionated and right more often than im listened to another ball punched a hole in our coach the hole as round as a trollops lips its appearance jerking me out of my civic reverie the other confederate hanging on our stern fired a pistol in reply we were being chased gage im told youre something of a shot with an american long rifle mine alas was lost to a dragon in tripoli frotte raised his eyebrows but decided not to pursue this history he thrust the musket into my hands can you slow them while i reload the shotgun i dont think im so much an expert marksman as a sensible one so i picked up the piece leaned out my window looked back and considered the situation at least three men were atop a coach chasing us the driver and two renegade policemen struggling to reload their own guns i figured my first shot was critical since i might not get another yet muskets are notoriously inaccurate and even more so from a bouncing platform i could aim for the coachman or his propulsion take a corner i shouted i felt our speed dangerously slacken to make a turn into another twisting lane our pursuers whooping as they closed the distance then we scraped the side of a house hub squealing sparks flashing and with a cry and crack of whip we accelerated again i leaned farther out our foes were making the same turn their driver swearing at the moment their horses and harness had made the corner but the coach had yet to follow i fired at my biggest target a lead animal the horse fell in its harness dragging its companion sideways and by doing so the coach crashed where wed scraped the frame exploded and occupants flew a mess of horse harness wheels and men tumbled into the street frotte pounded my shoulder perfect shot gage it was perfect because it was easiest i said modestly i peered back the coachs disintegration was particularly satisfying after my torture and no one else seemed to be following so i flopped against the seat back and watched frotte finish loading his own gun the ramrod chattering as our vehicle rattled and he tamped down buckshot who are those rogues renegades jacobins freebooters and pirates that seemed to cover most mischief i could think of and now what of my wife son and emerald were going to meet her in a house outside the city and set you on a course to retrieve not just the stone but more treasure than youve ever imagined more treasure was this bunch lunatic too but ive retired not anymore youre working for england now what were your newest friends gage your proper alliance is with britain surely bonaparte has taught that by now and the cost of this alliance breaking the king of saintdomingue out of napoleons grimmest prison and solving a mystery that has baffled men for almost three hundred years chapter any man is flattered by a job offer not stopping to think hes probably being asked to do something the employer prefers not to do himself so id felt for a moment that maybe i was lucky after all until frotte made clear hed saved me for what sounded like certain suicide we pulled our coach into a barn at a farm outside paris hiding it from pursuing police and came into a stone house with plank floors handhewn beams and a blaze in a fireplace big enough to roast a goat astiza was impatiently waiting anxious and angry and our son was nowhere to be seen wheres harry the trouble with love is that it exaggerates other emotions as well from lust to disgust now she looked at me with an expression of agonized loss and frustrated regret that cut to the quick happiness had turned to horror in an instant i was taken aback and felt guilt without thinking myself entirely guilty imagine a painting of paradise that you could magically step into so that a viewer identifies you with all things sweet and serene this magic happens to lovers in lovely places all the time now imagine a painting of hell it was as if astiza were studying damnation and id wandered into her view it was unfair and yet why did i the father have to ask her where my own son was i felt the shame that comes from miscalculation and the emptiness that drops the bottom out of your chest when you lose a child yet i wouldnt express my fear lest i make it true is he still at our hotel her eyes had the same blaze as the fire the renegade gendarmes kidnapped him she said when i ran to our inn the maid was tied and gagged and harry was gone the girl said men seized him shortly after we set out for nitots shop my god id lost my son once before to the barbary pirates and now this i mislaid my boy as easily as a bookmark being dipped upside down in a tub is nothing compared to the monstrosity of making a child a pawn in a game of nations i silently cursed leon martel hed regret not killing me nor could astiza keep a mothers accusatory tone out of her voice shed urged me to be prompt and id procrastinated shed had a hunch to stay with horus and id insisted she come along so i could show how clever i was shed wanted to retire to her studies and id wanted to play a hand in the disposition of louisiana the greeks i believe called it hubris and you my voice was a little strangled i ran from one band of spies into the hands of another these men she was impatient instead of pursuing the french bandits theyve held me here while finding you ethan what if harry is dead not dead madame frotte tried to reassure a hostage surely how can you know that because while alive he can be used to manipulate you for us to rush a rescue without planning is the one error that would assure he dies you dont want your boy in a gun battle this new spy confirmed to me that astiza had been rescued by english scoundrels trading one band of hooligans for another the worst people pursue me as persistent as gulls after a fishing smack i felt sick id lost my son for a piece of green glass a stone that would have fed my family forever this is the worst luck i managed the french took our only child to control you not to do harm frotte reassured and you saved my wife to manipulate you again at least he was candid spies understand spies and frotte was confident his foes motive mirrored his own agents depend on one another to be nefarious masters of calculation and the doublecross lest they all become unemployed how we british need your desperate daring to rescue toussaint louverture the black spartacus of saintdomingue from an icy french prison we believe louverture may know the truth about the fabled treasure of montezuma and that we can use his secrets to find it ourselves at that point we can negotiate with martel for your son and the emerald ransoming both while keeping a truly important secret out of french hands youve unwittingly become necessary again ethan gagethe key to france and england what bitter honor but i was practicing being unnecessary i should tie strings to my arms ethan gage the puppet and now you want me to rescue a condemned negro how the plan is to make an escape with a flying machine a birdlike contraption called a glider ridiculous ive flown once before in a french balloon it was more terrifying than a ministerial meeting on tax reform and more disastrous than a mistress wanting to discuss a relationships future astiza fell into the nile and i crashed into the sea i can assure you men dont have wings for good reason gods intention is that we stay on the ground we dont have gills either but youve journeyed under the sea frotte argued yes yes we know all about your adventures in tripoli with robert fultons plunging boat come gage weve entered the modern nineteenth century youre a man of scienceno one should be more excited about the future than you my future is a dignified retirement financed by a gem i went to no small trouble to steal but that has now sundered my family to pieces martel has restolen your gem as well which means your retirement is on hold until you can get it back hes kidnapped your only son and tried to seize your wife your only hope is to have something to bargain with meaning that your chance is alliance with england sir sidney smith says youre the most expert treasure hunter in the world get louverture and you can put your life back together again he was earnest as an undertaker but his compliment was nonsense since despite my best efforts of grubbing in tunnels and tombs i continued to come up penniless but i am susceptible to flattery im also accustomed to fate being frustrating nonetheless i stubbornly shook my head you realize that as usual i havent the slightest idea what is really going on at stake is the thwarting of a bonaparte invasion of england and mastery of the world which means were fighting for nothing less than civilization itself you im afraid are key i had a headache im a neutral american trying to help negotiate a land purchase with the first consul youre harrys only chance my love astiza you know im as heartbroken as you im the mother ethan it was a trump i couldnt match horus is why fate brought us together again and horus is all i care about now we have to do whatever it takes to save him i just wanted to give you peace and security for your studies i said wearily my plan was precisely to avoid dilemmas like this she took a breath summoning back her familiar courage destiny has other plans for us this martel has pointed the way toward a challenge greater than we wanted and then the gods sent these english spies to give us a slender opportunity were being punished for trying to relax i think but also given a chance for redemption the only way well get harry back is to ransom him with what everybody seeks astiza believed in fate you see which gave her an equanimity most people lack its relaxing not having to blame everything on yourself though that didnt stop her from silently blaming a good part of this fiasco on me if i were an ordinary fellow none of this would have happened but then again shed married me because i wasnt ordinary for which she probably blamed herself emotions are entirely too complicated i turned back to frotte the lost treasure of the aztecs i said resignedly which contains information that must never fall into french hands he added a countryman between two lawyers is like a fish between two cats benjamin franklin once said the same is true i think of an american between two great european powers for me it was like choosing between two difficult lovers the british invented liberty bequeathed it to the american imagination and stood for order and predictability the french hailed the rights of man had helped win our revolution and had better cooking but had made the devils bargain called napoleon for that same order the two nations hated each other because their idealism was too alike and yankee doodlemewas caught in the middle ben also said the first mistake in public business is the going into it but he was no better at following his advice than i am he played the statesman in paris and flirted shamelessly while lecturing me on marriage so where is this treasure exactly that is what you must find out it seemed lost to history until the slave revolt in saintdomingue and the reappearance of your emerald rumor for years is that black generals have heard legends of its whereabouts and hope to finance their new nation with its rediscovery accordingly leclerc tricked the negro spartacus louverture into capture hes been locked in the jura mountains in hopes hell disclose the treasures location in return for his freedom but hes tight as an oyster and dying from cold no one took the legend entirely seriously until you showed up with an actual stone now both sides fear the secret will die with him so this martel thinks that because i had an emerald rumored to come from this treasure i know the hiding place of the rest as well yes sidney smith in contrast merely believes you could learn it louverture may trust you if you tell him about the emerald and your boy but why did martel ask me about flying machines one of the stories is that the aztecs or their ancestors knew how to fly this treasure reportedly contains representations of their fabulous machines thats nonsense why didnt they beat the conquistadors then maybe the secret had been lost and they only retained fragments in any event it doesnt matter if the story is true it only matters that martel believes it true if he could come to napoleon with flying machines from a fantastic treasure he would be not only rich but powerful and if leon martel had the sense of ordinary men hed settle down and enjoy life for what it was not what it could be alas thats not the way of the ambitious is it but im perfectly useless ive known nothing of this until now as a neutral american and slightly famous hero youre the one man who might convince toussaint louverture that his best hope is england tell him that he can help haiti secure its freedom from the french by letting us secure the treasures secrets britains victory is louvertures victory and britains defeat is the reenslavement of the oppressed blacks of saintdomingue you have the motivation to break him free from his cage get him to safety and learn what he knows what motivation well ten percent of any treasure to start ten percent why not all of it youll need british expertise and pluck to pull this off gage the lions share goes to the crown and the black rebels plus expenses youll still be a very rich man i frowned im to risk my life for ten percent a week ago i had an entire emerald and not a care in the world that was a week ago ethan dont you see astiza said we need to rescue louverture to get the treasure to trade the secret of flight to return our son certainly there can be no thought of we i grumbled ive already dragged you into a dangerous trap there was no false gallantry here i was merely afraid id misplace her too this spys plan is that i slip ahead to louvertures cell by pretending to the french guards to be his whore who can solicit secrets from him she said matteroffactly hes notorious for concubines of every color the french will think i am working for them and the british for them while were really working for horus you have the mind of a spy madame frotte said admiringly if we dont succeed i protested youll already be locked in their prison so you must win ethan in order that martel is forced to bargain with us and we can get our son back frotte nodded and then kill martel on ground of your choosing chapter so after the robbery of my emerald and the kidnapping of my son i found myself scaling a prison wall in wretched spring weather at the edge of the alps when the woman at the window of the fortress de joux opened her mouth to scream i put my finger to my lips and raised my brows suggestively its difficult to appear suave when dangling from a grappling hook above a precipitous drop laden with equipment and spattered with snow but i do have practiced charm accordingly i wasnt surprised when she hesitated in her alarm an encouraging smile from me and she bent forward to peer into the blackness at my peculiar situation motioning for the damsel to wait i finished crabwalking to a crenellation and hauled myself over the lip of the wall muscles shaking i looked back down i couldnt see aeronaut george cayley or his contraption but i tied off the rope to the stonework and jerked the line as a signal it jerked back like a fish on the end of the line well first things first glancing about for sentries they were huddled inside as promised the idlers i danced lightly to the parapet door of the tower id just scaled and rapped the beauty opened it a crack and looked out cautiously monsieur why were you hanging like a spider outside my window she was ripe rumpled and rubenesque lord its hard to be married not a spider but a butterfly my wings opened by the fires of love i cheerfully lied a necessity with strange women i gave her a quick kiss on the cheek which gave her a start but also a blush of excitement and yes i was mindful that my wife was in theory somewhere in the castle below pretending to be louvertures longlost mistress what can i say ours is a unique marriage and the fate of nations was at stake not to mention the rescue of brave little harry prepare yourself my love while i haul up a surprise monsieur she said confused but intrigued do i know you if you know longing if you ache for beauty as i do if you dream desire then you know my heart please patience for just minutes more i will confess all soon and i gently pushed her backward and shut the door with any luck she was a romantic nitwit who would sleepily confuse me with some other swain whod given her the eye then i hurried back to the fortress edge and hauled on the rope cayleys flying machine a twentyfootlong cylinder of sticks and twine wrapped in canvas as delicate as a veined leaf came lurching up toward me i heaved it over to lie on the parapet and cast the rope back down for the inventor to pull himself up the plan was hed assemble his flying machine while i rescued the negro assuming either of us was still alive by then wed trust our lives to something that was little more than lattice and oiled cotton well it would be quicker than waiting for the guillotine for days cayley had tried to assure me he knew what he was doing the wings of daedalus and icarus need not be mere myth mr gage he told me as we prepared for our mission not only is man destined to fly he already has i had peered upward skeptically not that ive seen the berber ibn firnas launched himself from a mountain near cordoba with artificial wings in about the monk eilmer flew from a tower at malmesbury abbey just before the norman conquest leonardo da vinci sketched flying machines and the spaniard diego aquilera flew from the highest part of the castle of coruna del conde just ten years ago what happened to them all oh they crashed none died however a few broken bones for the early ones and just bruises for aguilera i suppose thats progress ive studied bird wings and learned from my predecessors failures which included the lack of a tail i believe we can launch from fort de joux and glide for miles far outdistancing any pursuit all it takes is courage theres a fine line between heroism and idiocy im an expert my test models suggest curved wings provide more lift just like a bird and the knack is adjusting the weight the real problem is stopping ive yet to duplicate the legs and talons of a raptor so youre proposing a controlled fall down the side of a mountain and a crash at high speed just to be clear what were planning no im proposing that we aim for a lake for our landing landing where there is no land end of winter freezing water frozen water perhaps it will take the french entirely by surprise wont it ingenuity against elan ethan thats the english secret this is just a first step someday ordinary men will fly everywhere in luxurious comfort in enormous padded chairs in floating cabins attended by beautiful servant girls feeding them courses worthy of a sunday dinner obviously the man should be packed off to an asylum but what stopped me from laughing is that while we had a plan to get into louvertures prison we didnt have one to get back out or if we did we could expect the entire angry garrison to hunt us down the french would spare no effort to recapture the black spartacus and cayley was the only person with a scheme to give us a head start when every other option means imprisonment or execution lunacy becomes attractive so id signed us on cayley called his artificial bird a glider unfortunately it can only descend not ascend he said i can do that already by myself but not with the gentleness of a feather right frankly i dont like falling at all it will be like sliding down a banister our strategy was threefold the glider for escape i to crack open our prisoners cell and astiza laying the groundwork with womanly charm louverture had a reputation as a prodigious womanizer that left me frankly a little envious hed had black white and brown wives and concubines and astiza had approached the french commandant by posing as one of these she suggested to the french that she might solicit treasure secrets with warmth where cold wouldnt do seducing louverture for his secrets in return for a share of any treasure shed fled the wartorn tropic colony and was trying to make her way in cruel france she explained i wasnt entirely happy at her calm confidence in being able to pull this charade off the less innocent a man is the more innocent he hopes his wife will be but i knew better than anyone just how irresistible astiza could be when she put her mind to it i was sending her into the lions den and hoping she could persuade louverture to join our lunatic escape without too many objections worse i knew shed likely achieve the coup shed be seductive and ruthless persuasive but distant winsome but steely with hardly an extra breath women are by natural law inferior napoleon insists except that every time i meet one im forced to doubt the truth of his maxim we had two reasons for this seduction one was that astiza as pretend mistress could demand that the viewing port into toussaints cell be closed for conjugal privacy giving me time to break out louverture from the roof the other was to alert the imprisoned general that he was about to be rescued and to prepare him for being hoisted through a hole and catapulted into space thered be no time for debate wed flee across the castle battlements and use cayley and his flying machine to meet frotte and his mix of spies where they waited in a snowy meadow then wed flee to the swiss border and onward down the rhine to the north sea and britain or such was the plan how many can this flying machine carry id asked cayley by my calculations three the inventor had replied i count four gambling gives one familiarity with arithmetic one of you will surely be dead by the time you launch frotte pointed out and we dont have time to invent a bigger flying machine he had a point the only thing worse than our scheme was doing nothing at all the first problem i must overcome was that the only way out of our prisoners cell was an overhead skylight bare of glass but grilled with stout iron bars it will take me until easter to saw through them id objected that holiday was four days after our planned assault english science has the answer ethan frotte assured why a frenchborn spy was so enamored of english ingenuity was unclear though i suspected it had something to do with the payments he received from sir sidney smith or perhaps it was my own reputation i am after all a savant of sorts an electrician antiquarian marksman and expert in plunging boats but first i had to keep the girl in the window quiet we hadnt predicted that id encounter a sentry of such beauty a woman as fair and encapsulated as rapunzel anxiously awaiting rendezvous with me a married man i was entirely too civilized to simply bludgeon the girl insensible and even if id wanted to be unfaithful i didnt have the time what to do while cayley climbed i tapped on the maidens door again astiza i was fairly certain was meanwhile waiting impatiently in louvertures cell below the lovely answered wrapped in a cloak artfully opened just enough to suggest there was nothing underneath since i had turned my back shed built up a little fire in her chamber hearth and pinched her cheeks to give them color she grasped and pulled on me come inside before you wither no chance of that im glad you keep a careful watch its papa who watches me youre so clever to come up the wall was she the commandants daughter and did her lack of astonishment mean suitors were reliably persistent well to look at her i could see why she enjoyed the attention too the minx its papa i worry about i whispered i saw a shadow on a distant parapet and worry it might be a soldier gone to alert your father her eyes grew wide with alarm the safest thing to do is pretend youre fast asleep while i wait and watch its imperative that you dont stir an inch no matter what noises you hear now when all is quietif no alarm is soundedi will come to you later lets give it an hour to be safe will you wait for me my pretty she nodded excited at the promise of sexual skullduggery thank god this wasnt my daughter and thank god i so far had no daughters to police since girls sound like a positive plague to raise and govern i wouldnt let a man like me within five hundred yards of a daughter wait for me in bed not a sound now how gallant you are the cloak slipped from one shoulder as she closed her tower door i peeked as far as i could glimpsing a swell of a breast and then congratulated myself on my own rectitude for not following instinct and wrecking our mission as a husband i am a model of restraint yes onward to astiza and louverture waiting in his cell chapter we live in an age of science modernity change and odd invention its hard even to keep up i was assaulting a castle because french and british lunatics thought it might be possible to flap around like birds upending military strategy and everyday experience dangerous missions are often inspired by impossible ideas instead of sensible ones and the revolutionary fervor that gave rise to notions such as equality have also uncorked the dreams of every tinkerer in europe and america britain leads the world in discovery and experimentation and i was told the english had come up with scientific sorcery that would make quick work of the iron grill above louvertures cell its carbon dioxide squeezed at pounds per square inch frotte explained as we prepared for the mission to break the prisoner out carbon what its a component of air said cayley the thirtyyearold lunatic who dreamed of flying he looked the part of inventor with high forehead long nose lip pursed in contemplation and inquisitive eyes he seemed as puzzled by my presence as i was by his the chemist priestley published a paper before we were born on how dripping oil of vitriol on chalk can produce the gas in pure form i think i missed that one if you condense the resulting carbon dioxide tight enough it liquefies expose it to air again and the liquid flashes into gas evaporation turns the carbon dioxide into a snow with a temperature more than a hundred degrees below zero i can scarcely conceive of more useless information who cares what air is made of were going to give you a canister of it to release on the bars frotte explained the iron will go brittle from the cold and a sharp blow with a chisel should snap it like an icicle youll punch through to louverture in seconds see what science is for cayley added im something of an expert on electricity myself ive used it to fry my enemies find ancient hiding places and make the nipples of ladies hard during private demonstrations they ignored this the only drawback is that youll be carrying a carbon dioxide bomb of such extreme pressure that it could explode ripping apart your torso and instantly freezing your guts cautioned frotte the result would be startling and painful not to mention fatal which means its best to be careful added cayley unnecessarily why doesnt one of you carry it because youve the incentive to rescue your wife while george here will be busy with his flying machine said frotte theres no room for me so ill organize the horses thanks to your emerald fate has provided us with the hero of acre and tripoli for a most truly dangerous part he hoped flattery would give me spine it was my emerald now that damned french policeman has it once you know all of louvertures secrets imagine what you can bargain for with those words in my ear i scuttled across the castle roof there was a flat parapet following the walls towers poking up here and there the center of the castle was a series of barrelarched stone vaults over the cells id been briefed on the location of louverture and faint light emanated from a hole in the center of his vault across the hole were iron bars and down it i hoped were the people i was to break from prison astiza i hissed here ethan thank goodness he hasnt molested you has he hes so old and sick he can barely stand please hurry was it hard to have them let you in the french are bored she said impatiently they found the idea of seducing him for secrets quite amusing theyre probably listening for sounds of love i pulled out the canister is louverture ready not really he thinks us quite mad well he hasnt lost his judgment then the guards are suspicious stop talking and act moan to buy us time women are good at noises the bars formed a cross meaning i had to break the rods in four places to get my wife and the black general out of their hole i held the cylinder used my gloved hands to loosen a screw cap the english had devised and readied the spout over one of the bars stand back while i release this i warned a lever freed a cork the final way and somethingi suppose it was liquefied carbon dioxidegushed out flashing into white snow as promised i dunked what frotte had called dried ice on the point where an iron rod jutted from the masonry snow and steam swirled upward then i took my chisel and hammer and struck a blow where id frozen the iron the bar snapped with a ring surprising me with its glasslike fragility maybe this would truly work its clever being a savant but noisy too i glanced about no sentry yet i repeated the operation on the next bar and the next a prison guard alerted by the noise pounded on the cell door below mademoiselle please we are busy astiza protested feigning breathlessness on the fourth blow the grill will fall inward try to catch it i reminded i froze the final bar and got ready to swing but what i hadnt counted on was that the fourth rod snapped all on its own from the weight of the grill and dropped before i could even tap it it bonged like a bell on the floor below and i winced what is going on the guard demanded games astiza called as if impatient at his interruption do you know nothing of love i poked my head down into louvertures prison it was a rather generous thirty by twelve feet with a fireplace on one wall a door at one end and a narrow bed with rude blankets a coaldark face looked up from the bed in amazement the bright white of his eyes the most arresting feature in the gloom louverture looked thin ill and rather homely with graying hair thick lips sunken cheeks and thin limbs this was a notorious womanizer the fatalism of his gaze was disconcerting he looked up at my head framed in the skylight as if i were some kind of angel but not of mercy rather the angel of longwishedfor death more guards pounded on the cell door mademoiselle is he abusing you how can i finish my interview with all this knocking you idiots my wife snapped go away and give us privacy were playing a game i dropped a rope into the cell astiza use the bed to block the door toussaint tie this under your arms ethan hes too sick to move then you move him no man goes before a lady the black general said his voice deep but raw he coughed horribly damnation he was feeble he stood as if arthritic grabbed his bed and manfully dragged it to the wooden cell door to barricade it your wifewhom i have not touched monsieurgoes first louverture was the first gentleman id encountered in some time and no time to argue she expertly tied a noose wed practiced slipped it under her arms and i leaned back against the bricks of the barrel roof and heaved her up being much lighter than a man in seconds she was up and beside me giving me a quick kiss and glancing about as warily as a sparrow her eyes were bright her smile crooked she was enjoying this i realized no wonder wed married im glad i didnt have to hear you talk your way in you simply let men imagine more than they will ever get women practice that keeping us constantly befuddled now some of those frustrated men were again banging on the door shouting questions louverture limped over to stand beneath the hole i am already dying he called up you are rescuing a corpse not before you help freedom with your secrets for liberty i dropped the rope again with agonizing slowness he stepped into the noose and lifted it to his chest i yanked to make it tight the peephole in the cell door opened angry cries now recriminations from an officer and the squeal of keys the french guards were unlocking the barricaded door astiza seized the rope too pull we hoisted louverture spun like a top ascending to heaven limp with a curious resignation did he somehow foresee his end then there was a crash the door butted in the bed smashed into splinters and then a volley of gunshots flashed in the gloom the haitian heros body jerked as it was riddled astiza and i looked at each other horrified we dropped the rope in surprise there was a thud as louvertures body hit the floor had my hopes of rescuing my son died with him the smoky room filled with soldiers some of them glancing up at the hole in the roof the two of us leaned back so as not to be seen their muskets were for the moment empty wheres his mistress one asked on the roof somehow she has an accomplice raise the alarm a bell began to clang upstairs you morons time to flee i grabbed my wife and we sprinted back for the wall where wed climbed cayley had made it up to the parapet there as planned and had unfolded and assembled his invention behind its crenellation the glider looked to me a kind of wooden bed frame from which canvas wings jutted like flaps on the skeleton of a goose no sturdier than a stack of jackstraws he greeted our arrival with relief thank goodness we can go he glanced past wheres the general shot trying to escape i couldnt keep the despair from my voice then all this was for nothing not entirely astiza murmured i didnt have time to ask her what she meant because the door opened to the tower room id climbed past my wouldbe female companion her hourglass charms on display in a linen shift stood backlit by revealing candlelight monsieur what is that bell is it time for our rendezvous no i told you to wait ethan my wifes tone was understandably suspicious i had to tell her something to keep her from crying out tell her what that you were going to cheat on your wife wife the girl asked realizing another woman was beside me its not what it seems i said to both of them and now the damsel did scream screeching for papa like a fury damnation women are difficult another door from another tower banged open and more soldiers appeared their primed muskets tipped with glinting bayonets time to fly cayley cried he picked up astiza heaved her onto the flimsy frame without apology and tugged at me lift on the other wing we hoisted and climbed up the low crenellated wall at the brink of the castle the guards were raising their guns theyre after the colonels daughter one cried i held the glider with one arm pulled a pistol and fired my fist bucking to throw off their aim one of them actually went down i threw the empty gun making them instinctively duck and then pulled and fired my other pistol now now cayley cried there was a volley of muskets bullets tearing toward us or rather tearing toward where wed been wed launched into the abyss chapter we hurtled into a black void there was the sickening sensation of falling stomach left behind and then a gust of wind swooped us sideways cayley shouted something unintelligible i clung to the frame and astiza was squashed and half smothered between us our goose felt pregnant with our weight more shots the hiss of musket balls and then we began to glide just above the tips of a downwardsloping comb of mountain pine jutting like stakes to impale us i could smell the forest in the wind it works cayley cried i waited for his invention to make my son an orphan i hate modern times our machine was nothing like the angel wings of an icarus its spine was a pole twenty feet long with a cruciform tail of little wings like two kites melded at right angles to each other this appendage the inventor explained was to give us balance and direction the two main canvas wings were more reminiscent of a bat than a bird thin canvas fabric stretched over a wooden framework like dried skin thin cables led from tail and wings to a rectangular framework suspended below the pole the englishman had lit a small lamp that hung from the central strut it would allow our allies and the french i thought gloomily to follow our progress or find our bodies the swooping glide was like a sled run id never traveled so fast cayley had one cable in his teeth and another in a hand pull your line to the left he commanded i did so and the machine leaned almost spilling us out astiza shrieked sensibly or was that me not that much i slacked off groaning but then he shouted enough and we flattened and steadied we were still descending but on a long gentler trajectory patches of snow went by beneath us like blurred clouds the experiment actually worked we heard the rip of a cannonball cutting through the air sounding like tearing fabric and then the boom of its cannon echoing from the fort i was impressed theyd gotten even one shot off we were flying what seemed like fifty times faster than any horse fort de jouxs mountain far behind and a rent in the clouds lit up a palette of grays that showed fields woodlots and the lines of road ahead was a lighter gray the blob of a pond no a lake it was rapidly growing as we neared it by creation that was more than enough to die in i tensed all over again george the ice will be like pavement if its thick and well drown if its thin im going to aim for the water near shore the ice will bend like a cushion frotte will follow with dry clothing his voice was tight his concentration enormous the wings of the glider rocked as we flew gusts bucking us up and then dropping us down wind sang in our rigging i heard gasps and hugged astiza or was that me doing the snuffling it will be like a bird crashing into a window thin glass in april english scientists are unrelentingly optimistic however the landing weve made history my friends i gritted my teeth im sure theyll put a stone up now we were skimming over ice the lake growing ever larger and more menacing a tracery of snow had been blown into patterns some of it puffed up as we raced just above instinctively we all cried out and braced then before i could take breath we slammed onto the surface of the lake breaking through crust as fragile as frosting and plowing into freezing water the glider disintegrated into kindling canvas wings caught ice floes and floated off meanwhile we heavy humans plunged into black depths i clutched astiza determined to die with her in my arms the cold was paralyzing all was dark we kicked looking for the surface our heavy winter clothes were like weights and she pushed away from me to sensibly shed hers then my feet touched something a rocky bottom i staggered upright surging through shards of ice and snow to freezing air throwing off water like a frenzied dog i could stand and haul up my wife and so i did so astiza are you all right alive her eyes mirrored my own shock its so cold it hurts i held her close its shallow i gasped you can walk we half waded half swam up the pebbled shore wheres george i think i can salvage it he cried from behind us he was still chestdeep hauling in pieces of his shattered flying machine leave it cayley maybe theyll think we drowned even an eccentric can discern logic at times he nodded reluctantly and let the pieces of his prize float away struggling toward shore himself the three of us staggered out of the bitter water and up onto a frosty snowglazed meadow the clouds had closed up again and there were no lights to be seen we were soaked the wind was numbing and wed survived glider flight only to die of exposure of all the bollocksbackward schemes ive been involved in this was the worst i wheezed using the anger to warm myself actually im amazed it worked at all cayley confessed too bad it will have to remain a secret given the necessities of espionage i think my aerial machine could also benefit from improvement the object of our rescue shot dead your invention ruined the three of us on the brink of freezing and no closer to dealing with leon martel for my son than before i recited just to make clearer the actual situation astiza why didnt louverture climb faster he was already dying she said chilled to his marrow and thin as a stalk you could see death in his eyes betrayal and imprisonment had broken his spirit he didnt look at me as if i were a rescuer ethan he looked at me as a messenger of doom and now our modern spartacus has been crucified for nothing not for nothing for science cayley said yes how fast can we freeze in place the inventor ignored my skepticism and staggered up a snowy slope we heard hoofbeats on frozen ground cayley waved its frotte hes coming with horses and clothes so we might live after all if the spy brought brandy to light our core my heart was racing like a hummingbirds wings trying to keep warm and i was furious at risking the life of my wife to rescue a man already almost a corpse all for nothing i growled but it wasnt for nothing ethan she whispered while she shuddered what do you mean id time to explain the emerald and the treasure to louverture and i could see he understood what i was talking about his eyes gleamed with hope just before you lifted me he gave a clue i saw the spray of snow from the rescuers who would spirit us toward switzerland the french i guessed were mustering their own cavalry to pursue what clue i chattered shaking with cold astiza looked as miserable as id ever seen her but her eyes were bright to look for the emeralds in the diamond chapter the heat of the caribbean in june the beginning of the sultry hurricane season was like a heavy shroud of sweaty muslin as the british frigate hecate ghosted into english harbor on the island of antigua sails limp pitch on deck seams bubbling tarred rigging hot as a throbbing vein my wife and i studied what officers called the graveyard of the englishman the sugar isles were colorful hell they said a muggy mystery of thick green scrub iridescent turquoise water truculent black slaves and poisonous vapors a soldier or sailor assigned there was far more likely to die of disease than from a french or spanish bullet europeans went to the sugar isles for one reason and one reason only to get rich then they rushed home before fevers took them vermin bit their own negro maids poisoned them or a rebel maroonan escaped slaveslit their throats the rain comes down like an overturned bucket captain nathaniel butler warned us turning the serene harbor into an enclosing net of menace the air is alive with insects and the ground with ants the groundwater is bad so you must doctor it with spirits but in order to drink enough the planters are intoxicated from breakfast to bedtime and drunkards all every english item costs three times what it does in london and a tropical tempest can knock down a decades hard labor yet just one of these islands produces more wealth than all of canada an ambitious man can carve a plantation out of jungle and double his money every year sugar gage is white gold and men die for gold i daresay this is a good hurricane hole i ventured english harbor was surrounded by steep verdant hills and the serpentine bay wound back into the island like a rabbits burrow a hundred black cannon poked out from various batteries to deter attack this was the most closely defended graveyard id ever seen perhaps a dip in the sea would make it bearable most unwise said the ships surgeon thomas janey whose bloodletting had hurried two seamen to the burial shroud in our brief passage a record that kept three more sailors sick at their posts lest janey get his hands on them i know eccentrics like nelson bathe in buckets of seawater but all physicians know that too much washing is a sure invitation to consumption or worse bonaparte bathes every day then he is a dead man i will tell the secret of health in the tropics mr gage keep bathing to a minimum wear stout shoes against insect bites do not open your windows to poisonous night airs fortify your constitution with strong spirits and if feeling ill have a physician bleed you profusely its little more than common sense our race is healthier in england than here so it stands to reason that to the degree possible we must dress eat and treat our sicknesses like englishmen but darkskinned people seem to go around halfnaked and feel better for it my clothes itched i was sweating so much that astiza kept her distance all the englishmen aboard were equally rank sin and savagery sir sin and savagery its hard to argue with an expert but i was reminded of what napoleon once told me doctors will have more lives to answer for in the next world than even we generals physicians are clever only in that they take credit for any cure and blame any death on the almighty such odds making impresses a gambler like me at least its beautiful murmured astiza surveying the bay beautiful madam it is bright ill grant you that but remember it was the garden that hid the serpent what you see is the beauty of corruption no sane white man comes here by choice except to make his fortune it is an isle of necessity as hideous as jamaica or martinique orange flowers she pointed to trees that spotted the hillside with blossoms a sign that im getting closer to my son o ur transition from a frozen lakeside in the french alps to the sultry airs of antigua had been dizzying our calamitous but pioneering flight suggested that leon martels babbling about flying machines was not complete nonsense and aeronaut cayley was anxious to get back to his english workshop to perfect his designs we galloped as planned with the spy frotte to the swiss cantons of the helvetic republic the spy having purchased our border crossing in advance with english gold it was odd how slow our escape seemed after flying how convenient it would be if these dreams really worked and you could cross the ocean above the pitching sea then north to the german states and the rhine our escape was helped by political preoccupation with the reichsdeputationshauptschluss or napoleons ambitious reorganization of hundreds of germanic duchies and kingdoms that bordered france some three hundred german states were reduced to thirty disenfranchised petty princes compensated by having their private fortunes enhanced by lands seized from the church the compression was instigated by bonapartes foreign minister talleyrand and forced on the reluctant austrian emperor francis ii as tribute for recent french military victories it cemented french dominance of the continent and began to draw to a close the thousandyear history of the holy roman empire the pope grumbled but napoleon had more cannon the winners in this reshuffling in theory passed into the french sphere of influence securing his frontier with new allies yet i wondered if the political unification of the industrious germans was the wisest course for france or europe as princelings they were robber barons charging tariffs for passage on the rhine as french satellites they were mercenary generals muttering about german nationhood princes who are elevated become ambitious inevitably resenting the master who did the elevating because he didnt promote enough i wondered if these states would someday turn on napoleon that was in the future for the present we fugitives fled down the river from basel without undue interference because customs and tolling stations were in chaos from political change we slid along the broad current under sail sweeps and rudder admiring old castles that clung to gorge walls in picturesque ruin at the batavian republic we took ship with the dutch across the channel and arrived in london in early may just two weeks before the peace of amiens ended and war resumed between britain and france london was a city of a million people larger than paris and even muddier and more chaotic here englands naval power was apparent the masts on the thames formed a forest thick as sherwood lighters crawled between larger vessels like water bugs casks rolled on quays with constant thunder and press gangs swept up sailors for his majestys navy with the brutal efficiency of slavers the crush of street traffic made it impossible to get anywhere banks were grander than churches and the extremes of wealth and poverty were more grotesque than in revolutionary france winding alleys were jammed with beggars thieves whores and drunkards my instinct was to hunt for a card game and brothel but then remembered i was married and long since reformed london was also glorious its steeples and domes catching the spring sun now that wind had blown away the worst of the winters coal and wood smoke if the rims of carriage wheels were brown with shit and splatter the hubs shone under the constant polishing of legions of footmen if gutters were full of trash windows gleamed like diamonds after polishing by indentured irish girls if the piers stank of tide fish and sewage theaters and hotels were scented with perfume flowers and tobacco the counting houses were a babble of languages and there was money from the markets of empire colonies counted like chips in a game britain could wage war forever napoleon i thought should have kept the peace we met sir sidney smith at somerset house the new government ministry built on the shore of the thames its grandeur was a symbolic choice a union between water and land and the building was so intimate with the tide that arches gave entry to boats beneath its stone promenade you could walk to its chambers or row to them we walked from the rooming house wed taken after being rowed ashore from our dutch ship the edifice reflected the growth of the british bureaucracy under the pressure of war and empire both in ambition and its half finish recent combat had robbed the taxes needed to complete this architectural elephant smith however had secured for our meeting a recently finished room overlooking the thames still smelling of paint and lacquer warmed by a low coal fire and lit by spring sunlight that played peekaboo through clouds to the south cradled in one corner was a globe a meter in diameter to keep track of world domination there were crossed claymore swords tea sets from china otter pelts from the northwest coast and wooden war clubs from pacific isles we entered exhausted from escape and travel and at the same time impatient to set out after our son ethan gage at last we are allies again the newly appointed lord had the smile of a cairo rug salesman and the lovely astiza is your bride who said endings cant be happy you look radiant my dear well that was friendlier than napoleon smith and i had been doughty comrades in arms at the siege of acre and he remembered my wifes courage im flushed with worry over the fate of my son she coolly replied my husband attracts the worst kind of people it was clear from her tone that she wasnt exempting smith from this assessment frankly our lives had been at a boil since meeting him in palestine and while we needed british help she feared sir sidney would only add to the heat and if we were truly at a happy end id be a retired country gentleman in america i added grumpily ive had quite enough adventuring and planned to settle down sir sidney but it never seems to happen but thats because of napoleon and leon martel no smith was never one to be rattled by discontent im trying to save you from them he was still fit and handsome the kind of swashbuckling adventurer whod built the british empire books about his exploits have made women swoon and men jealous and now he could call himself a lord i cant say i envied his having to sit through debates in parliament but i did think my emerald gone that too many of the men i meet seem to do better than me in a better mood i might have asked for friendly advice but instead i wanted to puncture his good cheer fort de joux was a fiasco i said id say your escape was a credit to british pluck and engineering thanks to the genius of george cayley and joseph priestly and you never give yourself enough credit for your own success ethan its not every father who would leap off a castle for his son the man chugged ahead like a machine that scoundrel martel is a skunk of a schemer but youre with the right side now and you were saved by my own charles frotte it should be in the papers but for the moment we need secrecy saved to play a role in english intrigue and skullduggery skullduggery he laughed ethan i am in parliament we statesmen are not even supposed to have knowledge of that word no no not skullduggery alliance against the worst bonapartist tyranny and intimidation the man has not kept a single precept of the treaty of amiens nor has england thanks to my role as gobetween i got to hear the same complaints from both sides being a statesman can be as tiresome as refereeing quarreling children napoleon has betrayed every revolutionary ideal set himself up as military dictator aspires to dominate germany and italy and plots invasion against your own nations mother country hes attempting to reinstitute slavery in saintdomingue against every precept of his own nations declaration of rights and steal an ancient treasure he has no rights to that could leave us defenseless no one should see through his hypocrisy better than you ours is a noble league you and i a league against brutal caesar just as at acre were a bulwark against tyranny i first met smith when he helped defend the ottoman city of acre against napoleon in the english captain was handsome dashing energetic brave ambitious vain and more intelligent than almost any officer he encountered which meant he was thoroughly detested by most of his naval peers his knighthood had come from service to the king of sweden and his escape from a parisian prison with the aid of women hed wooed had all the elements to make him celebrated bonaparte had railed at his success the english meanwhile were never quite certain if he was a genius or merely odd and so stuck him in parliament where hed be at home in either event ive taken up with napoleon in a way i confessed as an american im not really sure which side im supposed to be on expediency ethan expediency yes ive heard of your work on negotiations over louisiana youre clever as a fox but then so is frotte here who somehow draws payments from half a dozen governments at once youre both rascals but useful rascals and now your interests are aligned with mine is that not so astiza only because the french have kidnapped my young son she said women have a formidable singlemindedness when it comes to children and the english are going to help you get him back smith beamed she was skeptical but i was of the mind we needed whatever help we could get see here sir sidney i agree that ours is an alliance of convenience i said i was simply trying to sell a jewel when a renegade secret policeman stole it kidnapped my son horus and demanded secrets i dont have weve no idea where martel is or what to tell him if we find him nor am i entirely clear what he really wants he wants to conquer england have some tea please and ill tell you more of what i know we sat around a side table as the service was set oil paintings of sternlooking dead englishmen looking down on us as if in judgment from a secular sistine chapel life for the upper class is constantly trying to live up to the standards of ancestors who never seemed to have had a good time out the windows the thames through the wavy glass was a parade of watery commerce sails slipping by like bird wings first of all leon martel is a scoundrel smith began he was an underworld boss of some sortthe rumor is he turned country girls to prostitution and orphan boys to pickpocketswhen he decided to join bonapartes new secret police rather than risk being caught by them his allegiance is to himself and he reportedly had hopes he could succeed fouche someday as police minister either through promotion or betrayal instead hes now found himself out of the police and suspect to his fellow criminals as turncoat and informer so hes extorting people like you and shopkeepers like the jeweler nitot hes made a close study of torture and uses it on people who cross him hes also a coward he was drafted into the early french revolutionary armies and deserted a man who makes anyone else look good i summarized glancing at my wife those of us with flaws are encouraged by such comparisons as the two of you know as well as anyone smith went on england is a nation with a powerful navy by the end of this year well have seventyfive ships of the line and hundreds of frigates while france has but fortyseven battleships we hear nineteen are being built and we must always fear alliance between bonaparte and spain still our confidence in our navy is high indeed the english seemed to win almost every sea fight they picked however we have a relatively weak army we believe our soldiers are the finest in the world but they are relatively few and spread over a large empire if bonaparte can get a hundred and fifty thousand men across the channel which our spies tell us he intends london will fall there will be an eternal reign of terror i was of a mind that london cuisine could benefit from a french invasion and that a glass of wine in late afternoon was preferable to a pot of tea but i kept such subversion to myself the english would die like lions to defend boiled mutton and dark beer that means the english channel is key smith went on if napoleon can control it even for a fortnight he could land an army and conquer our kingdom he might achieve passage with a decisive naval victory but we believe that unlikely he might lure our ships away but i hope nelson is too clever for that then theres the chance of strange new machines of waryes ive heard of fulton and his plunging boat or submarinebut it takes time to perfect new inventions or bonaparte could take to the air ethan and i have been in a balloon astiza said you never quite got all the way in the balloon i amended i still had nightmares of her fall i remember smith said his ship had rescued me when i crashed in the mediterranean but balloons can be shot down and are slow and victim to the vagaries of the wind cayleys glider only descends what if such a craft could go up as well as down and travel exactly where you pointed it what if men could fly like hawks wheeling and plunging and sending down bombs from heaven a ghastly idea i said unfair to boot thank god no ones close to doing it i tried cayleys contraption and i can assure you sir sidney if you can get napoleon into something like that your war is all but won hell plunge like a shotgunned sparrow and yet mexicos aztecs had apparently made a golden replica of just such a device putting me in this predicament theres something to be said for conservatism where nothing ever changes george cayley is just at the beginning of his experiments smith said mildly there is however an earlier civilization rumored to have mastered the art of flight or at least to have produced models that look like flying machines the speculation is that they not only enjoyed a controlled descent but an ascent as well you mean the aztecs but how what could make that web of sticks go upward weve no idea a steam engine perhaps you yourself gage are reputed to be somewhat of an electrician a master of lightning perhaps that mysterious force can somehow drive an aerial craft mechanicians like fulton and watt are coming up with all kinds of peculiar ideas in any event the ancients were clever and might have had far better understanding of flight than we do if the french could learn from an earlier civilization they might swoop ahead of us and descend on our fleet like vultures earlier civilization so the stories go the recent notion that those in the future might know more than those in the past or that the present age is the equal or better than our origins is very new for most of history people believed the ancients knew more than us the aztec empire mr gage believed it learned the arts of civilization from its gods and is rumored to have immortalized the designs of their gods flying machines in the gold and jewels of lost treasures if the treasure of montezuma could be found and provides a model for flight such a discovery might turn the tide of the war the channel could be leaped that is what leon martel has heard and that is what hes after in the hoard but from indians you understand better than anyone that the world has lost secrets in deep places the pyramids mythic norse artifacts on the american frontier greek superweapons i had to give him the point our planet is a lot stranger than most people are willing to admit id found a number of clever oddities in my time and had nearly died trying to harness them clever races or supermen seemed to be mucking about long before our own culture got started and it wouldnt surprise me if they flew as well we know the caribbean is littered with the wrecks of spanish treasure ships smith continued breaking into my thoughts in the century after as many as six hundred such vessels sank each bearing an average of four to eight million pesos it says something of the wealth of mexico and peru that even with such losses enough survived that spain became the richest kingdom in christendom does montezumas treasure exist was it lost recovered and finally rehidden who knows but even if martels theory is improbable the barest possibility makes it imperative he is stopped empires are at stake a true flying machine could tip the balance of power in an instant imagine a regiment of french cavalry mounted on the equivalent of flying carpets swooping down the thames like valkyries as ive said smith was barking mad not to mention having the habit of mixing metaphors you enlisted me because you seriously fear valkyries we enlisted you ethan in hopes you could get louverture to tell us where the treasure is so we can lay claim to them the french alas filled him full of holes the death of the black spartacus had been reported in the newspapers but the french blamed louvertures end on disease not a failed escape attempt he was dying anyway but they shot him as we hoisted him barbarians so did he give you any clue i hesitated did we want to share what little bargaining we had with the greedy british astiza a mother didnt hesitate he said the emeralds are in the diamond but we dont know what that means she spoke up please share that with leon martel and get our son back sir sidney we dont care about this treasure of montezuma you can follow martel when he goes looking for it and take it away from him then we just want to get our boy and go home and where did she imagine home was i wondered would she follow me to a new one in america after id helped lose our son smith shook his head sympathetic but stern absolutely not we dont share secrets with the enemy mrs gage and have no doubt leon martel is your enemy moreover hes not easily contacted in anticipation of war hes already crossed the ocean with horus before he could be stopped by the british navy crossed the ocean and not with napoleons consent i suspect martels a renegade operating on his own so far as we know he rowed out to a ship bound for saintdomingue during a brewing storm on the pretense of visiting a friend when the gale came the captain was forced to weigh anchor and sail to gain sea room taking martel and your son with him presumably the villain has arrived in the embattled colony were also informed that he has relations on the french sugar colony of martinique thats the childhood home im sure you know of bonapartes wife josephine martel thinks the treasure is somewhere in the caribbean and hes no doubt sending evil minions out to find it in order to ingratiate himself with the first consul and his family i wondered if the french would call me an evil minion if i signed on again with the british astiza had given me back napoleons little pendant and id secreted it in case we needed to sneak about french possessions if hung around my neck it would make a splendid target for a firing squad from either nation but what choice did we have but to join smith we really knew nothing and if we were to get my son and emerald back we either needed a clue to bargain with or the british navy to back up our demands what do you want us to do i asked resignedly i want you to go to the west indies find the treasure before martel does and lure him into a trap at the end youll get your son the emerald ten percent of anything you find and everlasting fame he nodded already victorious in his head the west indies for many men they were a death sentence i already knew napoleons army was being destroyed by yellow fever and revengeful slaves but how i asked louverture is dead but his successor general jeanjacques dessalines fights on in saintdomingue i need you to go to the slave war ethan and find out if the negroes are hiding the most important golden models in human history you have an enormous advantage the french government has no idea it was you and your wife racing across the rooftops of fortress de joux for all napoleon knows youre still his gobetween with the american negotiators correct i told his ministers in paris that i was taking leave to draw a map of my explorations for monroe i conceded then we sneaked off to rescue louverture that means you can go yourself to the french garrison in saintdomingue as an american agent and pretend to be their friend smith was even more devious than me which is saying something but what good will that do you need to learn their military secrets and then trade them to dessalines for the secret of the treasure he said this as if it were simple but wont the french hang us both as spies long before that happens astiza asked she has impeccable logic not if you pose as negotiators for louisiana smith said and explain you need to inspect the state of the war in saintdomingue to report to both the american and french agents whether a sale makes sense can france hold the colony and if not is it best that napoleon get money for new orleans all this is true enough you can pretend youre important even though youre not astiza thought out loud while ethan poses as a diplomat in saintdomingue i can look for harry and martel exactly youre double agents pretending to work for france and america while you really work for england and the slave army you will pretend to dessalines that you have been sent by louverture to find the treasure to finance their new nation after lying to everyone you escape and deliver the secret to us the british he smiled with the satisfaction of a burrowed fox watching baying hounds thunder past tongues out and saliva flying for smith of course the question was simple my loyalties were more complicated i liked france and the french if not their henchmen it had been france that had helped my own country win independence bankrupting itself in the process and the french revolution that bankruptcy precipitated was closer to american ideals than england was if i could just persuade bonaparte to return to its precepts i might be more at home in paris than london yet it was england i needed now thanks to treacherous martel so i must go back to the french in their tropic headquarters in the midst of pestilence i tried to weigh the odds if i find harry and the emerald in saintdomingue why would i share anything with you i am honest to a fault because our navy will help you retrieve what must be a remote treasure since no ones found it with your ten percent youll be the richest man in the united states play the spy just once more gage and youll have the retirement you desire chapter our safe arrival at the english island colony of antigua in the caribbean was something of a miracle given the tumult that ensued once britain and france renewed their struggle ive often pondered the popularity of war the peculiar eagerness of nations for fleeting glory and insane butchery ten thousand deaths and borders barely change but the truth is that many people make money off conflict and nowhere can fortune be made or lost so quickly as at sea ships become pawns and we were captured and then recaptured in the first two weeks of combat we started our journey on a merchant tub transferred to a french privateer and ended on a british frigate from london astiza and i took the express coach to portsmouth to sail for the west indies on the merchant brig queen charlotte in hopes of getting ahead of trouble the ship was a regular transatlantic trader that was carrying a cargo of china furniture and fabric it would exchange for sugar molasses and rum the portsmouth express however proved to be a waste given that we hurried to the city only to wait a week in harbor for favorable winds and it turned out the onset of war astiza remained in a fever of anxiety about the fate of our son and easily irritated since we both felt my procrastination in paris had led to this mess like too many married couples we didnt talk out our resentments and they festered i was solicitous but she remained cool she was polite but i was stubborn about admitting blame i had to get our boy back i paced the port trying to will the wind maybe steam engines arent such a ridiculous idea after all i still wore my magnifying glass around my neck to confirm the identity of my emerald no one can say im not in my own way an optimist i also still carried that medallion of confidence from napoleon yet i was on no ones side but my own switching sides and trusting no one is a wearying place to be not only does every man seem a potential enemy you also get confused about what you stand for another thing i plan upon retirement is becoming an unblinking american patriot and giving allegiance to my countrys policies no matter how daft so i can mix with neighbors who think that i think the thoughts they think i should have even while i dont have to think very much at all we finally set sail on may and began working south to catch the trades off africa not knowing that our departure was the first day of renewed conflict accordingly we were captured one week out by the french privateer gracieuse a brigantine of a dozen guns a privateer is a pirate made legal with a license to bring profit to the government that allows its piracy this particular privateer fired shots off our bow our captain discharged a single cannon from our stern for honors sake taking careful aim at a swell so as not to annoy the frenchmen and our vessel struck its colors without bloodshed with a french supervisory crew and the english captain comfortably locked in his cabin our little convoy of two vessels set sail for brest i had nightmares of astiza and me returning to fortress de joux not as liberators but prisoners accordingly id tried to talk our english master out of his hasty surrender cant we make a run for it i asked before our capitulation our captain was a rheumyeyed drinker named greenly with failing eyesight and a limp he said came from being gnawed by a shark the mate told me it had actually been caused by dropping a block and tackle on his toes while trying to load cargo in the rain after a nights carousing i judge her faster mr gage greenly opined when i tried to arouse his martial spirit he squinted at the trim of the french sails better captained too im really not eager to be captured by the french in what may be a frightfully long war i said my wife and i are in a hurry to get our boy back and positively must get to the caribbean how about we mount a wellaimed volley as they try to board and then a sudden turn to knock off their bowsprit and bring down their foremast i dont usually feel particularly brave but the threat of imprisonment stiffens me i suggested naval tactics id learned from a lurid adventure novel a predator will back off if stung will it now and if youre wrong and my head is taken off by a cannonball in defense of a cargo i dont own surely your employers would compliment your steadfastness perhaps with a pension for your widow if there should be one i admire your ferocity gage but we aint all of us heroes of musselmen wars and battles with red indians surrender is more prudent since the likelihood is that ill be swapped for a french captain within a month fortunes of war im afraid but who will we be swapped for ive no idea i cant imagine youll be seen as useful by either side ethan theyve got a dozen cannon astiza prudently pointed out maybe we can get the french to send us to martel and saintdomingue as ive said shes practical and clever after all they may think youre still working for them you have the pendant working for them from an english ship and if the daughter of fort de joux or her father gets another look at me might i not be hanging outside her window permanently my pessimism about capture and women is justified no man is friendlier than me or accumulates more enemies you can tell the french sailors humorous stories about napoleon and pretend youre an american diplomat eager to go to saintdomingue she coaxed i am an american diplomat eager to go to saintdomingue bonaparte however is not particularly amusing ill flirt with the captain and persuade him we were saved by his privateer he will be our liberator not our captor and will be flattered to send us on our way i was dubious fearing that if we persuaded the french we were significant theyd be even likelier to hold us in case we could be sold to one side or the other fortunately we didnt have to test astizas plan because our captivity was brief the beginning of war had unleashed a flurry of prizehungry captains on both sides and two days later the british frigate hecate intercepted and recaptured the queen charlotte and took gracieuse as well fortunes of war indeed and now our captains pusillanimity seemed prudent maybe greenly wasnt an idiot after all the french privateer was sailed with a prize crew for england while our merchant brig and navy frigate set off again for the west indies i talked our way onto the faster warship by promising to tell tales of my own adventures that offer didnt seem to excite anyone but the british officers gazed at my wife as a miracle of femininity adventurers never plan it but its actually quite useful having a woman along a damsel can distract an enemy disarm a tyrant and disable the angry the british were entranced by astizas stories about the gods of the pyramids though the truth is she could have talked about insurance premiums and still held these femalestarved officers in thrall she was useful for another reason i retained napoleons gold n and circlet of laurel wreath but didnt think the british navy would be amused by this favor a ship is close quarters and my trinket might be discovered so i gave it back to astiza to hold on her own body reasoning correctly shed be given privacy as a woman that i wouldnt have is it risky to keep it at all she whispered we keep volleying from side to side you never know so she slipped it in her undergarments and we sailed southwest by boarding a warship we traded comfort for speed the frigate was jammed with men needed primarily for the rare battle discipline was harsh and cruelty routine we were mustered to see three floggings in six weeksfor thieving food talking back to a midshipman of thirteen and sleeping on watchand that was considered a relatively mild exercise of discipline the beatings broke the men instead of reforming them but the ships company couldnt imagine a society not based on physical fear there was also the camaraderie of shared misery and daily salvation in the form of rum it was pointless to be critical grimness ruled the world there was also gloomy foreboding astiza was in the habit of meditating and while a frigate has little room space for what she called a prayer chamber was found on the deep orlop deck private because it was adjacent to the spirit room and guarded by marines to keep sailors away there was no natural light in her cubby but her lamp was deemed sufficiently far from the powder magazine so as not to pose a danger that room was covered in felt to prevent any stray sparks and no lamp or candle was ever allowed inside the dim lamp that sailors saw by shone through a thick glass window built into the magazine wall lest some idiot blow the entire warship to hell astiza got her chamber by insisting she must study away from prying male eyes a desire the officers were sympathetic to sailors tracked her movements like dogs entranced by a squirrel so once out of sight she quietly set up a secret temple to a democratic pantheon of gods that might have gotten us burned in a different century i didnt want my wife accused of being a heathen so i stood watch while she lit incense pulled out little bone and stone idols from egypt that she carried in a velvet bag and prayed for the future good thing too because we were admittedly peculiar astiza consulted the christian pantheon but was considerably more ecumenical about religion than the narrowminded norm sailors are a superstitious lot and i didnt want us pitched overboard her allotted chamber was hardly bigger than a confessional and it was thick with that ship smell the brain remembers for weeks after disembarking a musty reek of rope bilgewater wet wood hundreds of inadequately washed men kitchen coal fire rancid cheese moldy bread and until it ran out in the first month beer an egyptian tomb would have been a cheerier spot but astiza needed solitary contemplation the way i need flirtatious conversation i explained to any officer who asked that her meditation tended to bring good luck and that our own rescue by the british was proof just to be safe i threw out some additional nonsense about female modesty piety contemplation and egyptian eccentricity and the crew generally swallowed it i hoped shed emerge encouraged but the idyll made her moody and uncommunicative she looked at me sadly when coming up for air and i feared shed fantasized some supernatural message about the loss of our son i left her alone as long as i could stand it but when she stood by the windward rail that nightby now the climate had warmed and the sky was thick with starsi finally approached to talk things through which i should have done long before is harry all right i asked she was a kind of witch but a good one and id come to trust in her witchcraft i believed she could see distant places and the future too she didnt answer for a long time so i touched her elbow as tentative as a stranger she twitched finally she turned what if it was a mistake to marry her tone was hollow no oath or insult could be more devastating i recoiled as if from a blow surely you cant mean that astiza was all i wanted or needed and to suggest fate didnt want us together was like a stab to the heart not for you ethan she said sadly not even for us but for our son what did you see is he sick no no she sighed is the future fixed certainly not certainly fixable i said so even though i secretly shared her dread about fate my god what is it she shook her head nothing specific just a feeling of a severe test ahead a test that might separate us instead of unite us danger when were together as if we draw trouble but thats not true we escape it you know we have a dozen times we must run down this french thief martel once we do then we have the rest of our lives for quiet happiness thats what i took the emerald for us i know that ethan fate is strange she looked over the waves im so far from home i took her in my arms were going home youll see chapter and so we came to the isle of white gold and black labor air thick with flower scent and rot the caribbean was hell the british promised but hell with a seductresss allure silken air dazzling color and a sweaty leisure supported by slaves in decadence that would do romans proud overlain by ominous pestilence coming ashore at english harbor was our first introduction to what seemed after a century and a half of slavery an african isle there were whites aplenty looking half suffocated in heavy red military uniforms they shouted orders amid the clamor of squealing blocks and rasping saws as the base hurried toward war but fully threequarters of the men we saw plaiting rope mending sail forging iron coopering barrels and standing sentry were black some were slaves and others skilled freemen who gleamed in the heat and worked with a cheerful energy the enervated europeans lacked they were at home in this climate and we were not the officer who had been sent to conduct astiza and me to a meeting with the islands governor was pink of skin and red of coat a cheerfully talkative army captain named henry dinsdale the potentate we were to meet was lord lovington a planter born ralph payne who would instruct us further in west indies strategy and politics dinsdale meanwhile served as the governors secretary liaison with the islands military and escort to visitors he was tall thin sardonic and eager to inform clearly jolted out of boredom by the chance to be a guide to my lovely wife he bowed to the gracious architecture of her figure with the reverence of a muslim to mecca lovington resides mostly at the new government house in saintjohns on the other side of the island dinsdale said but at the moment hes checking on his plantation at carlisle youll dine with him tomorrow there and learn something of the islands smiths introductory letter got his attention sir sidney smith had given us a letter we could show to any british authority who asked for passage to saintdomingue where our son might be and to help with forged documents to fool the french there are more dark faces here than tripoli i remarked more than in my nations new capital between maryland and virginia even your garrison seems to be made up largely of negroes you are perceptive dinsdale said there are only three thousand whites on antigua and the slaves outnumber us more than ten to one most of the trades are occupied by black and mulatto freemen and even the bulk of our infantry is black our fortunes here rest on sugar but no white man can survive the fieldwork required to cultivate it so the island is a congo you dont fear revolt weve had half a dozen of them in our history he glanced at my wife hoping i suppose to thrill her with shock we impale burn castrate pour hot wax on lash wounds and chop off feet he wiped some perspiration with a handkerchief scented with perfume we hang shoot manacle and chase escapees with dogs its mercy because it prevents worse trouble if youll pardon my candor mrs gage she looked more composed than us having been raised in hot egypt with its own castes the world could use more candor captain if it is ever to reform the first step to correcting the worst is to acknowledge it exists he cocked his head regarding her intelligence as an unexpected and rather alarming curiosity no reform is needed its no different than mastering a herd of farm animals slave and master have come to a rough understanding of each other conveniently the black regiments keep the peace and defend the island theyre the only units that withstand yellow fever obedient too id rather lead a black regiment than a white one here i mean he fanned himself not in england so you appreciate their sacrifice astiza asked he frowned theres a natural order in the west indies mrs gage without the whites there is no market without the blacks there is no product the french toyed with upsetting this power structure on saintdomingue with wild talk of revolutionary freedoms and the result has been a massacre of planters and a decade of devastating war here all know their place which is precisely why britain is fighting the frogs the goal is to preserve order we antiguans represent i think the front line of civilization with whip and chain astiza said my wife is blunt and i love her for it with class and station black freedom mrs gage go see how it works in africa its a hard life the slaves lead but a safe one if they allow it no cannibalism no tribal war and dont think they dont enslave one another they came to our slave ships already in chains led by their own people or the arabs their plantation life is hard maam but a blessing for them as well they have a chance to save their own souls from eternal damnation the pregnant ones are even exempt from flogging youll see we spent the night in the officers quarters at english harbor shutters flung wide to catch some breeze despite the doctors warning and our bed tented by mosquito netting the plank floors and brick walls were no different than a good hotel in england except the ceilings were higher and the prints of ships and royalty had more mildew tree frogs set up a roar like surf after the sun went down the long shady porches were a concession to the climate however and before retiring we sat to contemplate a landscape as vivid as an opium dream life bent to the sun as it did in egypt if this were hell it was a rather languid and nurturing one and we sipped punch and watched boats on the water with release mixed with impatience somewhere little harry was waiting we hoped and we hoped he was near there was relief at having successfully crossed the ocean disquiet that we must journey farther to find our son restlessness that it took so much time to track him and apprehension that such a journey would take us to saintdomingue a hellhole of war and torture yellow fever had killed the french general would it kill astiza harry and me given the climate we set out for carlisle before dawn at the coolest time of day a black domestic in waistcoat and bloused shirt drove our carriage dinsdale sat beside with two pistols and cutlass in his belt and a musket lashed upright beside him like a lamppole astiza and i were behind clutching the broad straw hats wed been issued as protection against the sky the first quarter mile into the forest was like entering ink until the day began to lighten and even then the jungle made a dark tunnel as we worked our way up a hill to overlook the harbor once away from the water the sea breeze completely vanished so that even the dawn air seemed oppressive but then we cleared the ridge crest the trees disappeared and the wind resumed the morning suddenly felt fresh behind us the crowded bay looked idyllic with its anchored ships ahead was a rolling landscape of seemingly endless sugarcane each hill crowned with a stone windmill their great sails majestically wheeling for a while we were quite comfortable and maybe antigua wasnt entirely the hell the english claimed the spanish quite naturally skipped over these small islands and headed for larger cuba hispaniola mexico and peru dinsdale narrated as we clopped along the carib indians who lived in the windwards and leewards were fierce and their little knobs of green seemingly useless but then english french and dutch colonists began to pick up these spanish leftovers and tried everything they could think to survive first the caribs and wild pigs were hunted down and exterminated creating space for farming when ordinary crops didnt take hold we attempted tobacco coffee cocoa indigo ginger and cotton and when all of those products failed to compete with virginia and brazil we tried sugar a ton from every acre which made these islands wealthy i asked politely so it promised but wage earners quit the work and indentured servants fled the cane fields are hot dusty and endless we finally copied the portuguese and brought in slaves from africa they endured the heat that killed the white man subsisting on the corn plantain beans and yams that white workers threw away the blacks consume loblolly a cornmeal mush and even maize right from the cob eating the kernels like animals the planters are not ungenerous they give their slaves a tot of rum on sundays and even meat if a cow or sheep takes sick breadfruit too the plant that bligh was after in tahiti and the blacks are rather clever in their own way they make alcohol called mobby from sweet potatoes and perino from cassava theyre even allowed to have their own thunderous dances that put our revelry to shame yes were tolerant here in antigua and the negro is everything the european laborer is not sociable adaptable enduring kind domesticated and disciplined a white man wants treasure a black wants a hut you seem quite the student we learn our slaves the way an englishman learns horses the whydahs and the pawpaws are the most tractable the senegalese the brightest and the mandingos the gentlest but they are prone to worry the coromantees are courageous and faithful but they are also stubborn the eboes are despondent they dont last the congos and angolans are good in groups but stupid individually all these characteristics are reflected in their pricing the negroes are marvelous in their own way they hardly need clothes or tools the planters give them a hoe an ax and a curved cane knife called a bill and get ten hours good labor even with a twohour break at the hottest time of day and what are the planters doing seeing to accounts and organizing amusements like all rich men we were quiet a moment every fortune is built on a crime astiza finally said dinsdale wouldnt take offense which is perhaps why he had the job of squiring visitors around and what is yours sitting high with me in this carriage he asked rhetorically bargaining with bonaparte from what i hear seeing me startled he continued yes ive heard of the reports to the governor little is secret on antigua he shrugged im the son of a landlord in the midlands and our vicar there takes heavy rents from the poor to live like a comfortable squire not exactly what jesus preached our ships are ruled by the lash and noose as youve just seen our infantry is mostly forbidden to marry and beaten bloody at the least excuse france tried to abolish such distinctions and had chaos now napoleon is setting things to right for the life of me i dont see why were fighting him hes trying to reestablish slavery in saintdomingue which is exactly what needs to be done dinsdale clearly thought himself a realist but a realist who did not have the imagination for an alternate reality its a pessimistic view but i understand the fear of conservatives the more i see of the world the more i believe civilization is a thin varnish on a hulking cabinet of human passions fears and cruelties a dark armoire that hides the truth of our natures ominously thumping to get out our natural barbarism is barely held in check by priests hangman and potential humiliation you are not a liberal captain i said mildly i am practical i study the gospels but i live in antigua can blacks ever be free if they are the economy of sugar is at an end no freeman can afford to grow it the former slaves will live in emancipated poverty on islands dreaded as incubators of disease no man will ever come to antigua for pleasure only for profit theres no voice for abolition here the subject was becoming a heated one in england i knew taking ideas from france men were agitating for the end of the slave trade or even the end of slavery entirely all the revolutionary tumult in the world has brought remarkable notions there are quakers who are politely ignored parliament however is full of dangerously utopian ideas that attack free market values fostered by comfortable liberals with no sense of reality west indies society is one of necessity mr gage send a white regiment here and as many as ninetenths are dead in a year of yellow fever but the blacks are bred to it necessity mr gage necessity and dont forget that a tenth of them have managed to win their freedom thanks to the mercy of their masters they are the carters the carpenters the shepherds and the fishermen youre an american believing in freedom its freedom is it not for we antiguans to have the right to develop our own society in our own way freedom to make an honest living even if it does involve the purchase and nurturing of slaves dinsdale clearly was impervious to irony so we bounced along without comment for a while astiza and i both sipped some punch of water lemon and madeira we often had to drink in the humidity giving our journey a drugged drowsiness even in early morning the windmills make it look like holland my wife finally observed their great sails were all pointed exactly into the wind a trick i didnt understand yet turning with tireless efficiency in the trades even at great distance you could hear the squeal of their gears and rollers theres no waterpower here and in fact drought is our biggest enemy the only way to crush the cane is with the power of the sea breeze the sugarcane was like an eightfoot wall on either side of our red dirt road the sun rose above the stalks and we put on our hats then we heard a horn and another and another conch shells said dinsdale the slaves are being called to work insects began to rise with the sun we waved and slapped the gnats and mosquitoes are the most constant dinsdale said at the beaches and in the mangroves you see the land crabswhite sickly and hideous always wear shoes and stockings against chiggers which can be agonizing we also boast woodlice bedbugs lizards and cockroaches that look hatched from lobsters in the plantation houses the servants keep them at bay but youll see field slaves with faces furrowed by cockroach scars the creatures come at them at night when they sleep on the dirt of their huts ants too of course billions of them termites wasps snakes are you trying to frighten my wife sir certainly not and i mean no offense its simply that england paints a lyrical picture of the planters existence as a life of leisure when in fact it is one of constant struggle the spoonful of sugar in a cup of london tea has an epic story behind it no european understands the real cost of cake you have fire as well it seems astiza was gazing beneath the brow of her wide planters hat as columns of smoke began to rise from distant fields we burn the fields after harvest its the only way to keep down the snakes and rats we lose a third of our crop to vermin at carlisle they put a bounty on ratsa cob or a crust for each oneand slaves caught thirtynine thousand of them can you imagine we joked they were breeding the pests sugarcane takes fourteen to eighteen months to ripen and everything is done by hand not the plow so we have to keep animal invaders in check losing a slave to snakebite is more expensive than losing a horse we burn the fields to make them safe we passed some blacks planting new cane in a harvested field their skin glistened in the hot sun hoes swinging up and down in ceaseless rhythm black overseers watched from horseback in the shade of a giant tree left standing for lunchtime shade clay jars lined the furrows but whether the water was for the plants or the planters i didnt know the men were in loincloths dust turning them red the women were naked to the waist some stooping with babies tied to their backs a white man is lucky to live five years in this climate dinsdale said but if he does he can increase his fortune fivefold we entered jungle again a steamy corridor of plants snarled and voluptuous flowers erupted like dots of light the mosquitoes became even more incessant and we sweated in quiet misery apply vinegar for the bites the captain offered then we began passing into lawns a grand clearing in the forest at its center was a stately house like a mansion in heaven the plantation home was wrapped in a cool twolevel porch each window bordered with shutters the clapboards painted a gay yellow and wicker chairs and hammocks beckoning us to rest huge tropical trees surrounded it with shade a flower garden was a quilt of color and a stream flowed into an artificial pool it was an oasis carlisle mansion dinsdale said now you can discuss your real business with the governor chapter a chief occupation of the planters of antigua is dinner a ceremony occupying three to five hours at the height of the days heat lord and lady lovington corpulent yet dapper in their fine london clothes greeted us enthusiastically on their shady veranda like all colonists they were eager to hear the latest gossip from london and paris fashion comes to the west indies six months late meaning winter costumes arrive just as the tropical summer deepens but no planter can resist wearing them everyone sweating without embarrassment our hosts were as amiably tipsy as we from the water purified by wine and rum imbibed from dawn to dusk to hydrate perspiring bodies the governor and his wife were in their sixties successful but not entirely secure they were political survivors who had reluctantly sided with prime minister william pitt in order to win appointment to a governorship that provided salary and brought them back to island landholdings burdened by debt the truth was for every planter who got rich another went bankrupt and lovington returned to antigua to prevent his plantation from declining into ruin the jungle storms war and the gyrations of markets were always threatening to destroy what had been built and dreams of retiring to london were thwarted by the difficulty of managing holdings from thousands of miles away the constant financial risk of the planters life gives island gaiety a sharp edge i knew the demeanor from the swells id encountered at gambling tables they are cocky but desperate to go from the dazzle of the sunlit yard to the dining room was like entering a cave until our eyes adjusted but once inside we saw a reasonable replica of england there was a massive mahogany table and sideboards fine china heavy cutlery prints of hunts and battleships and silk wallpaper spotted with mold the table legs rested in pans of water keeps the ants off the meat lord livingston explained settling into his chair at the head of the table with as much weighty deliberation as starting a day of work i daresay if the garden of eden had so many bugs eve would have spent her time scratching instead of eating apples governor what a silly thing to say his wife scolded ive no doubt mr and mrs gage have made that observation on their own eh this island grows all things crawling hopping creeping biting and stinging and grows them bigger and faster than any place civilized man is born he waved his arm and flies orbited our table you boys there fan faster will you two young black domestics put a minute of brief energy into waving large palm fronds before going back to their usual desultory pace the island certainly has lush beauty astiza offered the forest is completely opposite my native egypt egypt lord lovington exclaimed now thats a place id like to see dry as toast i hear even hotter than antigua i said hardly possible what he laughed but we have our own advantages too no frosts no coal fires rains in buckets but stops like turning off a tap some good horse racing maybe youll have time to see it i think our mission will force us to hurry on i said our threeyearold son is in the hands of a renegade french policeman on saintdomingue astiza explained what frogs have your boy they want to exchange him for a secret i said trouble is we dont know what the secret is and we need to find out thats the most damnable thing ive ever heard the french do you know we held martinique for a time and were pounding english sense into it when we gave it back in the last peace foolish thing to do go back and bombard it i should think what we really need is information and passage i said yes yes well lets have a bite and then ill show you the sugar factories gage plotting strategy i think works better after digestion like the room our feast was a partial replica of england a ridiculous cornucopia of rich food in limpid heat there was lamb stew hot and cold cuts of beef hot and cold fish turtle soup pickles white bread ginger sweetmeats roasted plover and doves a ham and slices of pineapple there were sweet jellies a bread pudding cream coffee tea and half a dozen wines and liquors one servant was dressed like an english butler his face beaded with perspiration but other male and female blacks shuttled in and out dressed in secondhand calico and with bare feet the huge palm fronds continued to fan the flies while the open windows and doors allowed in not just island breezes but cats dogs skittering lizards and a chicken that pecked at crumbs on the floor and was ignored by all involved this new war is our chance to chase the french out of these islands once and for all livingston went on the fevers are destroying their troops in saintdomingue their defeat is gods will i believe punishment for the reign of terror they hope to sell louisiana to the united states i said do they now to america and whatever will you do with it president jefferson estimates it will take a thousand years to settle let england take it is my advice you americans are having trouble enough governing what you have vicious elections im told lies pamphleteering and demonstrations by the rabble youll want the crown back someday mark my word we have some loyalists here on the island waiting for that happy day lady lovington added our independence was confirmed twenty years ago by treaty im still correcting mistakes i made forty years ago our host guffawed it was five the shadows lengthening by the time the governor took us on a tour of his plantation his wife had offered to entertain astiza at the house but shed demurred preferring to come with me i knew why she found domestic chitchat boring and after the botched sale of the emerald in paris she didnt trust me on my own id merely picked at my food but still felt bloated in the heat i was not alone threequarters of the food was sent back untouched presumably consumed by slaves happy to benefit from european attempts to maintain home customs we mounted horses to tour the fields the epic blue of the sky hazed by field smoke and dust sugar mr gage is the one thing that turns a profit here the governor said as we rode sedately toward a mill up to eighteen months to grow excruciatingly difficult to extract and expensive to ship what makes it possible is slavery and the british abolitionists seeking to end the trade are seeking sir to end the prosperity of the empires richest colonies captain dinsdale said the same thing its why the revolt in saintdomingue is so worrisome how many slaves do you own we were three pale sweating inspectors white as frosting touring a dark chocolate of earth and skin two hundred and they represent most of my capital more than my herds more than my horses more than my sugar mills and more than my houses even louverture insisted the freed blacks of saintdomingue continue to labor on the plantations he knew there was no alternative he needed money to buy arms and powder from america and the only source of money was sugar to strip the blacks away would be like dismantling the masts sails rigging cannon and ballast of a ship it cannot be done sir it cannot be done for their sake and ours we came to the bare crown of a hill the windmill rose there its sloping stone walls fifty feet high opposite the blades of the mill was a huge timber as long as a mainmast it led from the axle of the great windmill sails at the top of the tower down to a track in the ground now i saw how every towers blades had been aligned so neatly to the prevailing wind the timber worked like a great tiller pushed along the ground so that it turned the mills top to face the breezes direction from within the structure came the great grinding as cane was fed into the mills presses to be squeezed of brown juice we dismounted and went into the dimness it was even hotter there the trade winds not penetrating donkeys were led laden into the gloom with the last of the seasons harvest their backs carrying a small mountain of harvested cane weighing more than two hundred pounds a release of the hemp ropes that secured it and their burden cascaded onto the mills floor then the cane was fed by the slaves into the gears of the windmill the juice squirting to be caught in a tin trench below its my habit to be friendly and i thought i might say something to these sweating laborers but they ignored us as completely as working ants their eyes only for their ominous enormous black overseer in one corner who held a curled whip the laborers movements were choreographed by gears and rollers i couldnt understand what they were saying to each other their jargon was a broken mix of english and african with bits of french and spanish littering as well all thickly accented it nagged at me to try to communicate to somehow bridge our gulf of humanity but what could i say i was observing a brutal workshop from which no hope of deliverance was possible the quips of we mastersand by the color of my skin i was one of thosewere as irrelevant to these slaves as marie antoinettes blabbering about baked goods the french had succeeded in crushing a revolt in guadalupe inspired by the language of the french and american revolutions but only by roasting the ringleaders over openpit fires like spitted pigs liberty was restricted to one color only my own countrys constitution says much the same thing no black man or woman can vote so i felt inadequate to the heat stench and cruelty a participant in a system id no say in inventing morality suggested i talk like an abolitionist but practicality suggested i keep my mouth shut i needed lovingtons cooperationmeaning passage on a ship to the slave revolt in saintdomingueto rescue my son i cast about for something to say i was surprised to see a bright wellsharpened cutlass hanging near the mill rollers you risk giving your workers a weapon i finally asked the governor pointing to the sword its for the overseer to chop off their arms he said matteroffactly if they reach too far forward the rollers catch their fingers and the pressure inexorably draws them all the way in their heads crushed like melons i lose valuable property and a trough of juice is ruined by blood a onearmed slave on the other hand can still be trained to do light chores i keep the sword burnished to remind them of the danger stupid some of them or careless i let them know therell be whippings if there is any blood sugar surely you could invent a safer mechanism astiza said he was annoyed i am not a mechanic madam hot work i said more diplomatically attempting to change the topic i felt i was on a tour of dantes inferno bearable for africans theyre lazy actually caring nothing about my profit no matter how much i exhort them they dont really want to work at all he seemed perplexed by this flicking his riding crop against his own thigh come ill show you where it really gets warm we walked next door to the boiling house a rectangular stone building shaped like a barracks the air above it quivered from the heat within inside was a long shadowy luridly lit gallery heres the truly hot work mr gage israel there is my most valuable possession because the boiler man makes or breaks the quality of the sugar five huge copper kettles hung over a trench of glowing charcoal this israel stripped to a loincloth moved between the steaming pots ladling the cane juice into the first and biggest skimming out the impurities that boiled to its top and then ladling the purified remainder to each smaller pot in turn until the sugar juice began to turn thick and ropy from a gallon of juice we can get a pound of muscovado sugar lovington said the syrup is tempered with lime to become granular just before it crystallizes the boiler must judge the moment and ladle it into a cooling cistern this work is more dangerous than the mill because the hot syrup can stick like tar and burn its way down to your bones israel there moves like a minuet does he not in fact i orchestrate at carlisle a great dance the cane must be crushed within hours of cutting lest the sugar deteriorate and then the juice has only hours to be fed to the boilers before it ferments weve been operating here day and night for three months now what happens when youre not harvesting we plant burn weed manure and repair do the slaves have religion astiza asked it seemed a digression but she had great interest in that subject african witchcraft mostly with scraps of gospel theyve absorbed we try to discourage it but they do their own ceremonies in the woods it was after one of those woodland sabbaths that the revolt broke out in saintdomingue you know do you believe slaves have souls he squinted at my wife clearly not accustomed to a woman asking such questions or having a woman along at all i am a planter not a preacher mrs gage we do try to introduce them to their savior so there are slaves in heaven the governor decided to ignore her and turned back to me now we mostly ship muscovado or brown sugar which is further refined in england but if we seal the cooling pot with a moistened clay cap with holes in the bottom for the molasses to run out we can make clayed sugar of the purest white its a fourmonth process however and only barbados has abundant clay on antigua we mostly just drain off the molasses from the brown sugar and use it to make rum i run both farm and factory herds to feed us all and supervise coopers carpenters coppersmiths blacksmiths and domestics free blacks are going to sustain this on their own i think not the white man guides and the black labors the african ethan is happiest in servitude each race to its place yet when given the choice they seem to prefer not to do the work of animals i observed they become tradesmen or soldiers and by all accounts in saintdomingue they are beating the finest troops that france can send against them disease and climate are beating the french we english beat superstition and savagery out of the negro its gods work what we do ive noticed that whenever men want to justify what they desire they attribute their choice to god the meaner the ambition the more they swear it is the almightys desire and it is the very greediest who insist most vigorously that their covetous hoarding is the creators will judging by whats claimed god blesses the armies of both sides kings indiscriminately and the poor not at all ben franklin and tom jefferson were both skeptical of this truck but even they seemed to hope there was some divinity or destiny to make sense of life some slaves i knew had converted to christianity but their new god didnt seem to have improved their lot and i wondered what they thought about fate what was life like laboring like an animal with no hope of change it certainly must be complicated to organize i said needing lovington as an ally only condemn us when youre willing to stop eating sugar the lord replied your southern americans understand what i mean ask your virginians ask your president jefferson the french are oscillating between anarchy and tyranny gage and must not win you and i will not let them which brings us to saintdomingue i had not just the fate of races but a missing son to worry about and every minute of factory tour slowed my search for harry he nodded lets ride where we cant be overheard by the blacks i cant understand them they can understand us more than you know we took a lane through the cane fields to a rocky outcrop with a view over a forested valley beyond was the deep blue of the caribbean its shallows the color of angel eyes its beaches seemingly poured from the produced sugar what might such an island be like with a less ruthless economy even in the wind i continued to sweat in my coat and vest a necessary uniform when visiting with a governor i kept sipping from my flask im told by sidney smith that youre the last man to see louverture alive lovington said is this true yes except for the guards who killed him i suppose in his introductory letter smith said you found part of an ancient treasure the french believe could hold strategic secrets a cad named leon martel apparently has a strong imagination but yes do you know where the rest of the hoard is no i thought it best not to mention louvertures enigmatic clue let that be a card that astiza and i kept until we learned more but if the black spartacus knew probably other blacks in saintdomingue know too thats why you must send us there i hear they want to call it haiti imagine that choosing their own name he was pensive a man who suspected that his way of life was slipping away as we marched into the modern nineteenth century everyone gets old and all of us are eventually defeated by change i need passage to the island so i can contact their generals i said i understand a man named dessalines has taken charge a black butcher worse than toussaint louverture but a winner too the french are falling back yes lovington bit his lip ill learn what i can from the french trade it to dessalines for their own secrets and discover whether this treasure exists and how to get it and then what get your garrisons help to fetch it it was a lie but a necessary one id no idea who would prevail if the blacks french and english battled over treasure but i didnt see any of them deserving it more than me i hoped to use the secret of its whereabouts to get back harry and the emerald long before the rest of them had at it and then take all i could carry id also give payback to martel killing the villain once i had my boy how will you persuade dessalines the governor asked first im american and the blacks have relied on trade with my country the entire decade of their revolt they will listen second i tried to save louverture and theyll be curious about his fate third im going to spy on the french and offer my military expertise to their negro strategists youre going to help the blacks win the thought made him uneasy to help britain conquer the french its a game of enemy and ally you know that he nodded reluctantly youre white dessalines may just impale you on a stake as he has many others but affable actually i was fearful of going to saintdomingue but what choice did i have once we betray the french positions everyone may want to hang us a pox on all of them they shouldnt have taken my son astiza smiled at this a reassertion our host noticed your wife should stay here lady lovington would enjoy the company youre very kind i said as a way of sparing astiza from having to answer youll find carlisle very comfortable the governor told her and safe i care more about my sons safety than my own yes i was surprised he wasnt more insistent at her keeping to a womans place but he was shrewd in his own way and maybe not all that eager to have my spouse give his wife odd ideas and there is one advantage to going with your husband whats that the french commander rochambeau has a weakness for ladies your meaning i asked even though i knew perfectly well his meaning hes the son of the general who helped your nation win independence at yorktown but he doesnt have his fathers intelligence or character his strategy is terror which has united the whole island against him his distraction from disaster is women you want me to prostitute my wife i think hes suggesting i play a role again astiza said exactly rochambeau is the french weakness not their strength instead of leading an attack on dessalines he holds balls and carnivals if you want to learn the french strategic positions i believe mrs gage may discover more with flirtation than you will with a sketchbook and telescope well shed already posed as louvertures concubine and we needed something to take to dessalines flirt nothing more of course i know where to draw the line ethan rochambeau is ruled by his emotions lovington said such a man is vulnerable this was a terrible idea except it wasnt astiza would cutlass her own arm off before being stuck for weeks or months with an aristocratic twit like lady lovington she was hot to hunt for harry and would castrate leon martel herself if she got the chance her sorceress reverie in the ships hold had warned her of things and she wanted to manipulate fate by doing the unexpected and i would be along to defend her honor surely this french general is too cautious to woo the wife of an american diplomat i said on the contrary i think making men cuckolds gives him as much pleasure as the sex itself he beds with impunity protected by his soldiers thats not reassuring ethan it will never go that far im pretending only i sighed yes what could ever go wrong astiza turned to the governor you must deliver us to saintdomingue lovington nodded your wife has a decisive frame of mind thats one way of putting it weve captured a french privateer well take you to capfrancois in that still posing as a frog vessel youll both row ashore as yankee diplomats then its settled she said i dont get a husbands vote what is your vote ethan she was erect as a knight well it was clear enough what my answer was supposed to be i reluctantly saluted her that you use your charms to find our son so i can shoot martel once and for all maybe this rochambeau too ill aim low and once more you get to play the hero mr gage lovington said a spy in the french camp and an adventurer in the jungle conspiring with savage black rebels on an island set afire he beamed the ultimate object of which is lets be clear to keep carlisle here safe part ii chapter yellow fever starts with sharp pain not just in stomach and loins but oddly in the feet and eye sockets eyeballs feel as if they might explode the afflicted told me in saintdomingue then they become glazed and gush with tears each case follows the same progression faces flush fever rages the sick find it hard to breathe and fear suffocation puffing in terror a thick whiteyellow fluid coats the tongue and teeth vomit yellow feces red the mouth blackens with a crust patients cannot drink wounds open spontaneously inflamed and eerily deep its as if the body is dissolving from within and the inflicteds weight drops by half a ghastlier disease can scarcely be imagined cruelly the patient recovers or seems to usually this rally only signals the end a few hours respite and then there are agonizing cramps nosebleeds and a flagging pulse liquids gush from all orifices the body is already a corpse in the words of one doctor physicians can think of little to do but drain pints of blood in a vain attempt to balance the bodys humors in the french hospitals every bed was accompanied by a bowl of blood the bleeding never works the only thing that can be said for this cure is that it hastens the end soldiers viewed confinement in a hospital as a death sentence of ten who contracted the disease nine died doctors were defeated then they died too such was the horror that had annihilated napoleons caribbean legions bonaparte recruited two regiments of polish mercenaries and half were dead within ten days of landing a swedish ship arrived with military munitions every crew member expired but a cabin boy newly arrived french officers succumbed so quickly that those already on the island avoided befriending them lest the new companion be in a shroud a week later what the french called mal de siam named after similar fevers seen in the kingdoms of asia retreated in the cooler winter months but it doomed every campaign and made a mockery of every march the white race seemed cursed the remnants of french power had retreated to capfrancois on the north haitian coast a ring of fortifications keeping their former slaves at bay here they held and withered the grand avenue of trees that led into the city from the plantations was denuded its palms chopped down to make breastworks between the stumps were crosses and the freshly heaped red dirt of graves both filled and waiting the few slaves whod not escaped the city were made to dig dozens of new holes each day in anticipation that they would soon be filled by their masters the disease was worse in humid summer and medical belief held that miasmas of air that rose from the swamps caused the malady but as food grew scarcer and the siege continued what the british called yellow jack persisted into the cooler months of october and november anxious celebrations were held by the french aristocracy to stave off despair as wine cellars emptied courage became more and more dependent on rum here in this sunny death house wed seek our son harry and his kidnapper leon martel it was early november wed celebrated his third birthday of june in his absence and prayed he was well enough to see a fourth nothing was more commonplace in than the death of young children for astiza separation had been agony for me it meant guilt and anger i condemned myself for not better safeguarding our boy and chafed under my unaccustomed saddle responsibility i was a father but so far mostly in name only from the sea capfrancois still had the pleasing prospect of many a tropic town a broad bay on saintdomingues north coast was fronted by a palmlined boulevard at the waters edge called the quay louis a name left from royalist days the city behind was like a stage set its narrow flat platter of buildable land a porch in front of steep green mountains it shimmered in the sun as if lit for effect next to the quay was a row of sturdy brick and stone warehouses with redtile roofs such as one might find in a european port in happier times this harbor area was thronged with wagons of rum and sugar swank carriages auctions of slaves and quick commerce island planters averaged higher annual incomes than french royalists had once boasted at home and the nouveauriche colonists spent their money as fast as it came in luxury furnishings would be hoisted from ferrying longboats trunks of dresses arrived from paris shops and tea and dinnerware came packed from china after transit in europe trains of chained african captives would shuffle to be inspected just as i had shuffled in chains in tripoli they were stripped naked and prodded like pieces of fruit but now the warehouses and factories were shuttered after a decade of war the promenade looked tired and dirty dotted with broken carts no one bothered to repair there were drifts of refuse homeless blacks camped there in thatch shelters their owners dead from massacre or fever these negroes didnt flee because they feared being drafted by dessalines and his rebels outside the fortifications they werent claimed by anyone else because there was nothing for them to do and no food left to feed them they foraged stole and waited for the city to fall beyond the quay were catholic steeples and a grid of streets as neat as a roman camp leading to government houses barracks parks and a parade ground backing all were tropical mountains so precipitous that they formed a natural wall the height exaggerated by towers of cloud poised like opera curtains and colored by rainbows the tangle of jungle and slippery mud was so steep that it made trying to attack from that direction a strategic impossibility for a large army in a rain muddy torrents ran down from the hills and through the city to the east however a river debouched from the haitian plain that had once been a rich network of plantations between this river and the protective mountains capfrancois was nearly flat and open toward the dawn there the old sugar fields seemed to run forever and there the rebel army prowled french ramparts and redoubts built of piled dirt logs and stones snaked across from river to mountains to protect this last french capital tricolor flags marking the position of cannon batteries beyond were columns of smoke and astiza and i assumed the notoriously cruel general we had to seek if we were to learn more about the treasure of montezuma if toussaint louverture had been the black spartacus jeanjacques dessalines was portrayed by his followers as the black caesar and by his enemies as the black attila we were ferried ashore from the captured privateer that lord lovington had provided an english crew flying the french flag from the ship until they could creep back out of the harbor we told authorities at the quay steps that the brig the toulon was en route from charleston to martinique and had dropped my wife and me on a diplomatic mission with bonapartes permission i was to judge if the french attempt to hold saintdomingue could ever succeed and if not make recommendations to the american and french governments on the disposition of louisiana it was plausible enough yet sentries stared at us as if we were lost why had we been put ashore in hades what a wonder the paris of the antilles must once have been clear warm water lapped at mossy stone steps that led from the boat landing to a stone plaza between town and sea the bay was blue sapphire the shallow sands golden a stone balustrade worthy of versailles marked the perimeter of the breakwater but after years of war it was marred chips knocked away by cannon and musket shot decorative pillars held up what once must have been a welcoming monument but that statuary too had been blasted away like the nose of the sphinx other royal statues in the parks were headless a reminder of revolution a dozen years before to our right or west was a stone fort leclercs army had stormed it to recapture capfrancois from the rebels nearly two years before and it showed fresh repairs from bombardment black cannon jutted from embrasures but soldiers were invisible artillerymen staying out of the sun i was struck by the somnolent quiet of the place a city waiting for the end a french lieutenant named levine was summoned from the fort to study the forged documents i brought lord lovingtons antiguan office had helped make french and american papers testifying to my diplomatic status your mission is out of date monsieur he said he spoke to me but looked at my wife his eyes a mix of appreciation and speculation maybe he expected me to expire of yellow fever within days removing the annoyance of a husband i wished the same plague upon him were told louisiana was sold to america late this spring news travels slowly so my surprise was genuine if a sale of louisiana has already been concluded i couldnt be happier i said grandly i had a hand in the early negotiations and now can take some credit for success its not just that monsieur with renewal of war between england and france our position here is even more precarious a british blockade could force our defeat i must counsel that you put your wife in grave jeopardy by bringing her here i turned to scan the sea my wife has a mind of her own and i see no british ships this was my little joke since i was looking directly at the masquerading toulon but i would like to bring the freshest assessment possible back to my american government is it possible to obtain an interview with the commanding general donatienmariejoseph de vimeur vicomte de rochambeau levine glanced at astiza again as if thinking that was not the best of ideas i am sure something can be arranged he nonetheless said do you require lodging if you could suggest a stillfunctioning guesthouse it functions just the lieutenant called a carriage our wardrobe was modest but wed borrowed a large empty trunk from lovington so wed look the part of baggageheavy diplomats our black hire gave us a quizzical look when he lifted the container into the vehicle we should have stuffed it with extra blankets but too late now then a crack of the whip and astiza and i rode into town while the main boulevards were cobbled most of the side streets were dirt or when it rained which was almost daily mud some buildings were masonry as firmly rooted as a german burghers but the majority were wooden island colonials elevated on posts a few feet off the ground palm fronds litter and lumber hid underneath the stilts let the breeze and water through our black teamster told us in thickly accented french hurricane too the buildings were mostly two stories high with a continuous arcade along the bottom floor that ran above the ground like a floating sidewalk from the bedrooms above jutted narrow french balconies with iron railings just large enough for an occupant to step from a bedroom to survey the world hang laundry or empty a chamber pot flowers spilled from planting boxesragged looking in the stress of the siegeand paint flaked in the humidity despite the humid decay and stress of war the whites some of them french born and some locally born creoles like napoleons own wife josephine dressed smartly if illogically even in the heat there were plenty of splendid blue uniforms tailed coats and dresses that closed all the way to the throat reflecting new fashion at least the civilian hats were broadbrimmed and often white or straw more eyecatching were the coloreds even besieged the city was at least a third black and mulatto from house servants field slaves and freemen who hadnt joined the rebellion the worst were in rags but the mixedrace population formed a secondary aristocracy at capfrancois that was more finely attired there was a complicated gradation of color with the lightest skin conveying the highest status quadroons were the offspring of a mulatto and white mustees of a quadroon and white and mustefinos the finest of all coloreds were from white and musteeseveneighths european but still colored by custom and law relations between this palette of skin had once been as precisely regulated as court ritual and now habits were breaking down even the loveliest tan had been caught up in an enormously complicated war when the revolt began in lovington had explained there were approximately thirty thousand whites forty thousand mulattos and more than half a million black slaves in saintdomingue in the last dozen years all three racial groups had at times both allied or been at odds with each other while forming temporary partnerships with invading spanish english and french slaughter had been met with counterslaughter and victories with betrayal many of the rich had already fled and id seen some of the refugees disembarking two years before in new york city yet what glories of the human skin still mingled in this city people moved slowly here but with a floating flowing gait enchanting in its gracefulness the sway of the women accentuating hips and bust their smoothness made the white troops seem clumsy by comparison and their beauty was striking with colors from cream through nut cocoa coffee chocolate and ebony teeth were bright necks high muscles smooth carriages erect and some colored men and women wore fabulous hats topped with plumage as bright as parrots in gayer times this would have been paradise capfrancois however showed the wear and tear of war paint was unobtainable gunfire pocked bricks from when the city was taken by blacks in and then back by the french in with numerous battles between several blocks were blackened shells even in sections still inhabited broken windows were boarded rather than repaired because there was little glazing and fewer glaziers garbage lay in heaps because it was too dangerous to cart it to the countryside and the slaves whod performed this job had fled the entire town had a pungent odor of rot sewage and smoke with the redeeming whiff of the sea this place has the smell of disease astiza murmured i fear for horus if that monster brought him here martel is no nurse and harry is a handful im hoping hes vexed his captor maybe by now the devil wants to give him back it was a poor attempt at humor but we needed to lift our spirits my secret worry however was that my threeyearold had adapted to captivity and kidnapper quite well and scarcely remembered his father at all capfrancois also had the scent of a farmyard some of the burnedout lots now held penned animals presumably brought into town for food there were cows donkeys sheep and chickens goats and pigs wandered freely flies buzzed off deposits of manure the citys squares were still geometrically planted with palms that shaded shaggy lawns and sculpted shrubbery but instead of statuary there were gibbets from which rebels hung we passed three decomposing black bodies while journeying from the port to guesthouse the corpses turning in the breeze like weathercocks no one but us gave them even a passing glance we took quarters on the rue espagnole not far distant from government house where wed find rochambeau the british had provided a little money for expenses since we were otherwise destitute how i missed my emerald it was just as well there was little to buy in this besieged city since our allowance was so modest ive always felt pinched doing government work better to stick with trade and gaming everyone seems to be waiting astiza said as she sat on the bed the guesthouse was shabby from neglect shutters broken and small green lizards clinging to its walls the maids were sullen the floors grimy my dreams of joining the wealthy were once more in abeyance while aztec riches beyond imagination beckoned somewhere in the caribbean it was time to spy i looked toward rochambeaus headquarters a hundred yards from its door was a guillotine blade bright in the sun chapter while we waited for an audience with the french general astiza and i mapped a plan to explore capfrancois hoping to sight our son given her interest in religion shed start at a church and ask about orphans runaways or odd parishioners i didnt think leon martel was likely to turn up in pew or confessional but it was possible a wayward child or a newly arrived adult of poor character might come to the attention of nuns given martels past i thought a hunt of brothels would be likelier to find him than a hunt of cathedrals but id been married long enough now to know not to propose that as a beginning i decided instead to master the military geography of the city in hopes id find something useful to take to dessalines how wed cross french lines to this negro hannibal id no idea but my experience is that if you poke into a bear den you might find a bear which had happened during my sojourn with the dakota sioux i dont believe things always work out as sidney smith claims but i do believe trouble will find you easily enough should you go looking so i began to stroll trying to make a crude estimate of the garrison while keeping an eye out for harry id try to flush martel out with my mere presence it didnt occur that far from hiding martel had made himself part of the french government and likely knew of our arrival as soon as we climbed the steps of the quay so did others survival had become precarious in saintdomingue and the key for all sides was using eyes and ears to prevent surprise at first my foot patrol seemed fruitless the town was desultory traffic listless weather sultry and clouds mounded on the peaks and then clawed overhead like a drawn tarp there was a growl of thunder to echo the occasional boom of siege guns then afternoon downpour turned the streets of capfrancois into temporary rivers raindrops as heavy as musket balls rattled while i stood on a boardwalk under a porch roof watching a slurry of silt and garbage flow toward the sea how was i to cross this deluge to continue my scouting someone dark and gigantic came striding out of the murk from the middle of the street as impervious to the pounding water as a bull in a paddock can i offer you a ferry monsieur a strapping black looked up at me on my boardwalk with a smile that glowed each tooth dice bright and his gums pink like an orchid i peered into the curtain of rain where is your carriage my shoulders adventurer i glanced down the street another white was boarding the shoulders of another negro like a toddler climbing aboard his father the human foot ferry keeping his cargos feet clear of the mud and another and another it was clearly the odd custom of this place the first passenger was carried to the boardwalk on the opposite side of the avenue and deposited like a delivery of mail a coin changed hands theres an entire company of carriers my entrepreneur explained even in a revolution the black man has to make a living yes i saw another duo go by the human mule singing african songs with the gusto of a venetian gondolier while the white hunched with hat streaming it seemed a parody of oppression but when in rome whats your name broad shoulders jubal monsieur ive always found it convenient to have big friends or quick little ones this fellow was an extraordinary specimen six and a half feet tall with polished skin the color of coal muscles like a dray horse and broad smile as brilliant as a snowdrift he wore a tattered and patched infantry coat that was wet as a washcloth his pantaloons cut off at the knee so that he could wade barefoot in our tideland of a street a red kerchief gave his neck a jaunty air and his belt was wide as a pirates there was poise to his posture completely different from the hunch of the wary slave and his eyes sized me up with the calibration of an engineer i was impressed but not surprised while my race has no shortage of philosophers arguing our godgiven superiority such arrogance has been contradicted by the sheer capability of brown arab red indian and black african ive met in my travels the races arent very different at all but europeans seldom believe me its easier to sort people out by pigment come monsieur we will make the voyage to the left bank together i am the mercury of mire a columbus of navigation climb on my shoulder and jubal will take you where you need to go you seem a very erudite porter i can read and even think imagine that from a negro and why would an educated freeman work as a mule why do you assume im a freeman by your bearing and industry maybe im just cocky climb aboard and find out and how much for this favor a franc but jubal is the best carrier so you may wish to give me two it was like mounting a sturdy horse and off we went into the rain id kept my planters straw hat from antigua and looked out at the world through a veil of water dripping from its brim my shoulders were instantly soaked but the downpour was warm and the ride enjoyable i felt ridiculous but at least i wasnt calfdeep in mud jubal set his own course rather than wade straight across to the other side he splashed to the middle of the avenue and trudged parallel making us drift toward the harbor no no i want to go there i pointed he might not even get his franc you will get there but perhaps you wish to talk to jubal first out here in the street in the rain where no frenchman can hear us i was immediately alert about what yes talk to mighty jubal who knows both mountains and sea jubal who has heard of an american diplomat arrived at the harbor with his striking wife seeking information on the liberation of haiti jubal has heard about this electrician who walks into the lions mouth to ask about the lion my heart beat faster how did you learn that the black man knows all in capfrancois who rows first to a ship hoists a trunk or drives a carriage the black man who mops out a meeting room serves at a banquet or digs new entrenchments the black man but should an american ambassador talk only to the french side or should he seek information from the african legions as well the ones who will soon rule this country i looked down on his woolly head glistening in the wet you mean dessalines who trades with the united states for weapons the washington of our revolution yes jubal knows youre a soldier for the other side the last men i would consider for that role were human camels its the rare black man in capfrancois who doesnt serve two three or more masters its necessary for survival yes the mambo cecile fatiman foresaw that a white man is coming who knows our hero toussaint louverture is this true yes but who is cecile fatiman the wise witch who preached our revolt a dozen years ago in the bois caiman the alligator wood thats where it all started you mean the war she danced with the rebel boukman and slit the black pig for blood i saw the slave frenzy with my own eyes because id already slain my master and become a maroon who hid in the jungle cecile is led by the voodoo spirit ezili danto the seductress who knows all our mambo prophesized that an american would come and here you are i was still trying to get straight the complex history what happened to boukman his head was put on a pike his revolt though goes on here was opportunity with broad shoulders i was in an odd position for negotiation but also felt a glimmer of hope i was the last to see toussaint louverture alive and he told you something no this is what cecile sees he told my wife shes a bit of a priestess herself the dead toussaint now waits for us in africa with all our loved ones and ancestors if we fall in battle we go to louverture dessalines promises that i envy such conviction we rely on it which is why we will win did you know that our soldiers are so inspired that they put their arms into the muzzles of the french cannon what do you think of that that its as risky as it is bold when it comes to faith im wary to a fault when the cannon fire their souls fly to our homeland then the comrades who are left hack the cannoneers to pieces i admire such courage although im cautious about selfsacrifice unless theres a real need not cowardly exactly but prudent it just seems practical to preserve oneself for another day my selfassessment fell short of being ennobling i suppose no one knows if the next day will come you are an instrument of fa monsieur our spirit of fate but you are also in grave danger men have heard these prophecies and might be jealous or fearful so you need jubal bad men will send death against you the dark loa we call baron samedi or seek to make you a zombi whats a zombi wed now circuited a block as if i couldnt decide where to go i was wet as a sponge but i must say the conversation was more interesting than dinner at a planters house jubal ignored my question dessalines will meet you monsieur gage if you can bring him something worth knowing i hope to inspect the french lines we blacks have built the french lines you must do better than that you are to speak to the french then keep your ears open and perhaps we will keep our eyes open for you for an escaped slave this fellow was quicker than a clerk i wondered at his background its true i saw louverture and its also true i may help the rebel cause but my wife and i are looking for our kidnapped son a threeyearold named horus i could keep an eye out for him his mother would be grateful for her i would look even harder how about a swarthy man named leon martel heavyjawed with the look of a weasel i havent seen him the french do not invite me to their parties martel is a renegade policeman cruel like rochambeau but i may have heard of him because the black man hear everything you have i bounced on his shoulders i will ask he said enigmatically now he changed direction to finish crossing the street by a gunners ramrod what else did this creature know and i want to learn island legends that might help you and me that stopped him what legends about treasure recovered by escaped maroons that was hidden lost and awaits rediscovery by the right cause if i knew about treasure would i carry you he laughed no jubal knows no legends maybe cecile does listen we need the key to capfrancois not old stories bring that and i will take you to dessalines and cecile fatiman then we will help find your son he finally set me on the opposite boardwalk dripping as if id fallen into a river my boots still clean these are cruel commanders youve come to ethan gage after a dozen years of war there is no mercy take care to recognize who is your friend and who is your enemy how do i do that by how they treat your wife theyll treat her correctly or pay with their lives you must treat her correctly too because you never know when she might be taken from you what does that mean to take care goodbye now wait how will i find you again i talk with dessalines then i will find you i turned to go both enlightened and mystified monsieur he said yes a franc if you please i gave him three chapter rochambeau was a famous name in the united states as lovington had recalled the elder count led the french forces that helped washington defeat cornwallis at yorktown finally winning the american revolution his son had the good luck to inherit his fathers renown and the bad luck to inherit leclercs sickened army after that general succumbed to yellow fever so far the second rochambeau had shown more cruelty than initiative hed retreated to capfrancois and fortified his morale with women and drink i wasnt surprised then that the invitation to call upon his headquarters was issued to both mr and mrs gage word of astizas exotic beauty had spread quickly around the city and the notorious rochambeau was likely contemplating a different kind of conquest to make up for his lack of victories on the battlefield we had to let him think such corruption was possible while not allowing it certainly i recognized the danger plain women are more devoted older ones more appreciative but i too have an eye for beautyits a fault of mineand knew i had to defend the woman id married the french government house was a twostory white stone building flanked north and south by orderly landscaping meant to emphasize power now the complex betrayed physical and moral decay window sashes were peeling flower beds had gone to weed litter curled in corners and four small cannon were aimed on the lawns as if this governor was as threatened by his own population as the rebel army the buildings court and foyer were thick with french officers and military bustle but their assembly was untidy in the way of men who are losing hope and discipline maps and papers were in heaps swords and muskets leaned in disorderly tangles and unwashed bottles and plates drew flies hats were off coats thrown across furniture and muddy tracks crisscrossed the floors astiza and i had our papers inspected and then were escorted to the generals office upstairs the mahogany door opening to the scent of tobacco and cologne rochambeau didnt make a good first impression he was a squat man with a round soft rather sullen face reminding me of a stocky schoolhouse bully his head was sunk between his shoulders and a brown birthmark surrounded one eye so he looked punched he received us in a hussars hot uniform blue breeches and cavalry shirt with red collar and silk sash the finery making him sweat his plump torso was buttoned tight with rows of horizontal silver frogging that to an american rifleman would function mostly as tempting target his shoulder epaulettes were sturdy enough to balance beer mugs on the dress was gaudy but i knew some women have a weakness for peacock display he stood from his desk to inspect us we wearing clothes similar to what wed paraded on the louvre iron bridge i glanced about i have the habit of orienting myself because its useful to have an escape route when life becomes too exciting rochambeaus office windows looked down across the gardens toward the port and its forest of ships as if to remind where escape lay a balcony extended next door to his private quarters heavy french curtains hung damp too heavy to move in the breeze the general greeted me by name but came out around his desk to astiza bowing kissing her hand and simpering a compliment like a clumsy casanova his eyes were small and i decided in predetermined distaste piglike many women apparently considered him oddly handsome given the allure that high birth and money brings but i didnt see it leclercs death i suspected had been disastrous for france in more ways that one it had left their army to a man void of imagination for anything but reprisal and infidelity of course i was traveling under false pretenses myself and rochambeau could justifiably have me shot as a spy should he learn my real mission here again astiza was useful shed donned the little pendant bonaparte had given me at saintcloud a fine chain letting it fall to the swell of her breasts i admire your jewelry madame a gift from the first consul she blushed modestly rochambeaus brows rose and this is for persons he favors it actually is in honor of my husband ethan is such an able diplomat well the general sat back down regarding us with new respect and i sensed suspicion i hope you appreciate the significance of that bauble anyone close to bonaparte had as many enemies as friends i knew i view it as protection she said calmly the general nodded uncertainly beckoning us to sit then he tapped the forged papers id brought with the pretend signatures of american delegates livingston and monroe i appreciate your wish to understand our strategic position in the americas gage but unless i get reinforcements anything you report will be obsolete louisiana has been sold and the english are attacking everywhere theyve already taken castries in saintlucia and then tobago and are scooping up dutch islands like walnuts in a barrel where is my navy hiding in french ports as near as i can tell if the british blockade our position will be precarious indeed the colony may become entirely black which means of course entirely savage yet the remedy seems beyond our grasp remedy i glanced about his office had the usual masculine decoration of flags standards swords firearms and old halberds and pikes as if theyd cleaned out the bastilles attic before tearing the prison down there was also a purple velvet settee strewn with yellow silk pillows and a sideboard with wines brandies and liqueurs with a set of fine crystal the ultimate solution is to exterminate saintdomingue of its present negro population which has been infected with radical ideas and bring in an entirely new and docile population from africa the novice slaves must be kept from reading or hearing anything prohibited from meeting and taught that disobedience results in indescribable pain its no different than training a dog or breaking a horse he examined his rounded fingernails but to do that i need a huge army and our army has melted away with fever like frost before a sun its as if god is against us which i do not understand does he want the rule of pagan voodoo churches made of trees and swamps peasants growing yams instead of plantations growing sugar weve had a code noir the black code which spelled out the rights of master and slave alike the result was paradise now the negro has chosen anarchy maybe it wasnt paradise for them it prohibited beating or execution at whim and weve done them a favor by rescuing them from africa under the code noir all men had their place the king himself helped draft it when we had a king but that was long ago wasnt it now bonaparte is trying to restore calm by reinstating slavery which is the only economy that ever made sense but the blacks have become fanatics so ive been left to fall back on my imagination to keep barbarism at bay im a creative man in my own way but i am misunderstood and little appreciated even by my own officers he sighed the very picture of selfsacrifice great men are not always recognized in their own time i figured flattery might prove more useful than truth my primary concern is the protection of innocents such as your wife he continued aiming a smile at astiza i also work to fortify our morale with entertainments theres a ball tomorrow night you both must come our worst defeat would be to give up civilization so i work tirelessly to sustain normalcy just as i work tirelessly to keep us safe from dessalines who has hanged and tortured more good frenchmen that one can count he gave her a nod and a wink the bastard we must not let him at our women i appreciate your gallantry my wife said with such astonishing pretend sincerity that i appreciated again the ability of females to negotiate relationships with the skill of actresses i do hope you can keep us protected during our sojourn in saintdomingue my dear vicomte you can be sure of it he picked up a pistol to fondle absently and i could only hope it was unloaded the secret to dealing with the negro is ruthlessness leclerc did his best to be stern tying some of his captive to heavy flour sacks and throwing them into the harbor to drown but thats a waste of good bread there was a point beyond which he would not go i have no such scruples i have hanged i have shot i have burned and i have boiled have you ever watched men being boiled alive mrs gage never she gave a little shudder if anyone could wring secrets out of rochambeau i supposed it would be astiza but i was damned if shed do it near his bedroom how soldierly to carry it through she continued as i shifted uncomfortably it takes a certain hardness he boasted many officers quail when the victims begin screaming and yet the result on the rest of the blacks is salutary if i could only torture and execute ten thousand i could bring order to a million so its a kind of mercy astiza said exactly his eyes kept falling to the swell of her breasts as if some physical problem prevented his gaze from staying level with hers not that i blame him ive had the same problem i locked a hundred of them in the hold of a ship and suffocated them with sulfur and then made a hundred more hurl the bodies into the sea word of that got around the island i daresay i should imagine my latest innovation has been maneating dogs ive used my own money to import them from the spanish in cuba now no black army can stand against a french regiment in the open field you can be sure but every time we pursue the rebels into the jungle an ambush ensues its maddening and my men are becoming timid the dogs however smell and ravage the rebels and give my forces fair warning i havent been in the engagements myself but im told the beasts are truly terrifying in how they rip their victims to pieces my god he was madman and sadist i was about to blurt honest revulsion when my wife responded first horrifying astiza said and clever its only for the protection of beauties such as yourself every monstrosity i invent is but a necessity to save frances children your valor is known in paris i can assure you vicomte and if its not we will celebrate it when we return he nodded expecting as much why do butchers feel compelled to boast the truth was that rochambeau and dessalines would each slit a million throats if it furthered their personal ambitions and both would destroy the whole island before letting their own demise occur nor would they ever muster the courage to duel in an arena by themselves preferring to sacrifice thousands of others to settle their hash the man kept eyeing my wife and i sourly decided he had the soft look of too many pastries and not enough marching so you believe theres a chance of victory i interjected after clearing my throat theres always a chance monsieur gage and an obligation to make a valiant stand if there is not remember the spartans at thermopylae im hoping god will still see the justice of our cause and bless us against the forces of darkness i understand the blacks believe they have supernatural protection too from african witchcraft their courage is quite baffling he glanced out his window again at the harbor and the ships that could carry him away well i must plan my ball and im eager that you grace it with your presence youll promise me at least one dance madame gage i would be flattered general i swear she batted her eyes was she enjoying this charade but no i knew astiza her mind hadnt strayed off her quest for little harry for one second i do want to meet all your brave officers and my husband is eager to study your strategic dispositions he was involved in the siege of acre in and has been a student of fortification ever since this was complete nonsense since that bit of epic bloodletting had taught me to stay away from sieges as much as possible yet she was playing her part to the hilt is he really the general looked at me speculatively perhaps he can lend your officers advice im an amateur savant i said modestly an electrician and explorer but i flatter myself to have slight military expertise yes i can lie too i was actually wondering if i could learn from your engineering its to your credit that youve held off the rebels this long he nodded cautiously i appreciate your curiosity but monsieur you are a foreigner talking of military strategy secrets if you will as lafayette was a foreigner to washington my husband is ever so good at keeping secrets astiza leaned forward giving him an eyeful and he might share some of his i dont know if i have an escort to spare i however am not fond of riding around in the sun she added i saw where she was going and im uncomfortable leaving you alone in a new city rife with tension i told her rochambeau who was not the brightest general ever to take the field finally realized his opportunity but she is not alone she is with me general were my husband to go on tour id be ever so grateful to wait for him here i would feel safe if it would not be too distracting his pig eyes gleamed as if wed poured slops in a trough how could you help but distract yet a gentleman can always spare time for a woman in need i am an important man yes i may have to issue orders but perhaps we can issue orders from the veranda while monsieur gage sees how expertly we have fortified this city you and i can have rum punch and compare memories of paris in the paris of the antilles she said sweetly alas if only you could have seen it at the height of its glory your courageous stand gives grandeur to what is left i have pledged my life in its defense i cannot imagine more capable company for my wife i put in tired of this prattle and i dont need an escort i can poke about on my own and be shot by a startled sentry no im sure theres a colonel or major downstairs who is unoccupied rochambeau rifled through some papers as if reminding himself who served on his staff enjoy my hospitality make your diplomatic report and critique our heroic defense he looked at me im aware you have quite the reputation as a warrior monsieur gage both on frances side and against her id fought with the british at acre as ive said but as an american my expediency had let me also do errands for napoleon sometimes its convenient to bounce about though you do accumulate a great deal of misunderstanding youre a neutral capable of honest and blunt opinion rochambeau went on i hope youll lend your critique to the barricades of capfrancois as lafayette and my father did at yorktown i would be humbled to learn and teach i marvel at your skill i have an interest in writing perhaps i can tell the world how you did it he cocked his head as if id gone too far but then looked at my wifes chest again so let me arrange a tour while astiza and i enjoy a view of the sea that is the way home madame the sea chapter i wasnt eager to leave my wife alone with rochambeau the lecher but i also knew astiza was the type to put even bonaparte in retreat if she had to i meanwhile might spy out something useful for dessalines finding a french weakness and trading it for legends of treasure that in turn could help get my boy back i might seem a traitor to my race but leon martel had ensured my enmity by stealing my son and jewel besides it appeared to me that the best choice for rochambeaus forces was to leave before they all succumbed to fever why not hurry them along with my skin color my reputation my diplomatic papers and my wonder of a wife the french officers assumed my loyalty theyd also been instructed i suspect to keep me busy for the afternoon while rochambeau tried to maneuver astiza to that purple couch so i was given a rambunctious cavalry mountit took a few minutes for us to come to a proper understanding which is that i would indicate the general direction i wanted to go and the horse would get there in a manner of its own choosingand a colonel for escort named gabriel aucoin this officer looked as soldiers are supposed to look with erect torso calm confidence easy command of his mount and an exploding souffle of blond curls that put me in mind of alexander the great they gave you pepper american but you sit him well he congratulated it might be more accurate to say he lets me sit im not really a horseman still i can ride when i need to im not an engineer or a guide but i can show you our gun batteries and then share some bordeaux well be friends i think i like honest men not braggarts and indeed i liked him and felt guilty for preparing to betray him but if i could help put an end to this damnable war maybe aucoin would live a prolonged siege would likely mean hed die at least thats what i told myself to justify my confusion of loyalties i was pretending to be a diplomat while playing the spy and pretending to be a loyal white while hoping to betray the members of my race here in capfrancois none of this would have been necessary if martel had not kidnapped harry but i regretted having to drag men like aucoin into my quarrels we rode to the flat eastern end of capfrancois where the primary fortifications are the island that columbus called hispaniola is divided into two colonies the spanish santo domingo to the east and the french saintdomingue or haiti to the west the land is very mountainous and so the french colony was strategically divided into three parts in the north west and south were separate pans of plantations each hemmed in by hills the blacks had already conquered west and south and now were pressing on this last white stronghold in the north having seized all but the city of capfrancois itself the struggle would be decided on the citys eastern boundary between river and mountains it was hot as we rode the scenery somnolent but luscious the island is a gorgeous mosaic of greens with cane orchards and jungles almost glowing like my emerald under a brilliant blue sky birds flit like darting flames and flowers are a scattering of paint oranges lemons mangoes and plantains erupt for the picking like something out of eden butterflies flutter and insects drone disturbing the green tableau today were fires on the distant horizon but from war or agriculture i couldnt say haiti is a dream that hate turned into a nightmare lush paradise as a portal to hell we rode along the stumps and graves of the rue espagnole at midday the lack of shade made the sun feel like it was pounding my straw hat past the citys outskirts were the french lines and behind them mildewed military tents hot as ovens and trampled grassy fields artillery waited hub to hub next to neat pyramids of black cannonballs soldiers lounged beneath awnings muskets too were stacked in pyramids we confine drill to the cooler morning colonel aucoin volunteered when he saw me eyeing the inactivity half my men are unwell and all are thin from shortened rations useful but dessalines no doubt knew this when do you sally to meet the enemy not much anymore because disease depletes our ranks dessaliness army swells and ours shrinks he grows bold and we grow timid he has the entire island on which to maneuver and we have half a mile of breastworks how many men do you have about five thousand the blacks have three times as many the french art of war is all that holds the rebels at bay we have better discipline and with reinforcement could still reverse events but now war with the british makes it even unlikelier that help from france will arrive what are you hoping for then officially that dessalines breaks his army on our fortifications letting our cannon do their bloody work then we pursue the remnants with our dogs so i should not recommend a frontal attack and unofficially that we are given a chance to reach an honorable settlement before they murder us all we passed a kennel of the maneating mastiffs that rochambeau had purchased from the cubans these were monsters almost the size of small ponies great slobbering things that raced barked and lunged as we clopped past our horses shied and whinnied instinctively increasing their pace the dogs weighed about a hundred and fifty pounds i guessed and hurled themselves against the bars of their cages with anxious woofing and snarling their excitement bent the wood which sprung them back like bows they reminded me of a brute of a canine owned by my old antagonist aurora somerset and i shuddered at the memory that one had torn throats to gristle how do you control them sometimes we dont theyve turned on our men several times and weve had to shoot some but the blacks fear them more than a cavalry charge besides our horses are wearing out can the dogs turn the tide the rebels know how to shoot dogs too and if dessalines doesnt conveniently destroy his army by throwing it against your cannon then it will all have been for nothing his voice was resigned defeat starts weeks or months before an actual surrender it seems a desperate strategy for desperate times he reined up looking at me squarely i am happy to show you about monsieur but telling the truth is depressing and i think we wont tarry into the evening because you should return to your wife our general has a taste for other mens women i trust astiza which could be exactly the problem her loyalty could make you an inconvenience in rochambeaus eyes my orders are to keep you safe but dont count on that forever you do not want to make her a convenient widow what do you mean rochambeau and admiral la touche recently gave a dance aboard the admirals flagship the deck turned into a garden there were plants and flowers on the bulwarks and vines suspended from the rigging it was lovely escape letting one pretend war didnt exist but a young beauty not entirely in love with her husband came in a parisian dress so scandalous she was almost naked this clara danced the night away with our commander and the next day her husband was assigned to a column sent to smoke out the blacks it was ambushed and he never returned and clara seduced and then packed off to paris astiza is entirely in love with me even as i said it i wasnt sure her words echoed what if it was a mistake to marry then youre a lucky man his tone said he wasnt sure either but anyone can be tempted what does she most desire rochambeau will find that out and then offer it to her my son i thought im not to volunteer for a sally then and not to take for granted the fidelity of your wife or the word of our esteemed general no disrespect for her its just friendly advice monsieur for a treacherous island fear makes people do strange things no offense taken colonel aucoin general rochambeau gives fair warning by his manner doesnt he is he simply greedy afraid i think a man who doesnt know what to do thats why he slaughters and tortures the negroes out of fear theyll do the same to him it will only make it worse in the end which he knows and yet he cant help himself i think he ruts so much simply to postpone his nightmares servants have heard him screaming in the night i liked this mans realism but rarely are the most sensible in charge you must keep this conversation secret of course aucoin went on i am a soldier and will do what i am told but i try to tell the truth to protect the innocent i hadnt been called that in some time by the same token you must not tell the truth about me to him the colonel added but of course i appreciate your trust he shrugged im afraid too it puts me in the mood to confess while the citys eastern boundaries were flat and seemed to invite invasion the french had used the terrain as best they could at a low rise just to the right of the major trunk road rochambeau had ordered the construction of a sturdy fort of stone earth and logs that had just enough altitude to command the approaches it was anchored to a much steeper mountain so precipitous that no sizable body of men could flank it from that direction this fort i judged would be the key aucoin led me up a causeway to the top of the bastion no enemy could be seen the flat plantation country beyond seemed deserted and with the loan of his spyglass i could make out the blackened shells of destroyed houses and sugar mills abandoned cane waved in the wind a sea of tenfoothigh stalks hiding whatever was out there onceharvested fields had grown back wild and smoke hazed the horizon wheres dessalines watching us as we watch him and hoping disease finishes his campaign for him hes tried some assaults on our redoubts and weve taught his men that voodoo doesnt protect them from bullets they charge fanatically even the women and it only adds to the carnage you can smell the dead yes there was a hint of the sickly sweet rot of abandoned corpses out there in the grass apparently too close to french guns to be retrieved so now he waits licking his wounds id like to go after him but the general doesnt believe we have the strength to retain any ground we capture so its stalemate yes he cannot conquer us and we cannot capture him without siege artillery and the expertise to dig the proper approach trenches i dont see how he can take our fort here at vertiers he must wait for us to sicken or starve i nodded the french had splendid fields of fire several batteries of cannon and magazines crammed with powder it might still be a long war i admire your engineers you were at acre so we respect your opinion my expertise was exaggerated but id developed an artillerymans eye in the holy land i saw a crease in the terrain that could be seen from up high but was probably invisible to dessalines the ravine was a negligible ditch snaking into the cane but it pointed at the french walls like a siege trench and it was hard to see its bottom it might provide cover in darkness well that was something do you have enough artillery to cover every approach not if surprised the key is that we learn what the blacks are going to do before they decide themselves we can see them coming when they move the sugarcane shakes to betray their march kleber and napoleon used the movement of wheat to their advantage in the holy land at the battle of mount tabor i said what about flanking you the mountains are too treacherous for more than a small patrol a regiment would bog in mud and snakebite things will be decided here in the open on flat firm ground if a french naval squadron arrives we might still hold out i looked at the mountains most so steep that attackers would fall at the french as much as charge them organization goes to pieces in terrain like that but i also saw a stream that sprang from a jungle canyon in those same mountains emptying into a little pond right behind the french batteries you have a water supply too yes wells are brackish here and while we can haul barrels from capfrancois its laborious our engineers diverted that creek closer to our lines on a hot day that rivulet is a real asset theres no water on the rebel side except the brackish river which keeps them from camping too close i saw a track in the ruddy soil led along the stream into the jungle is there a vantage point up there it provides a view like a map come well have a swig of wine we left our horses and climbed up along the stream sweating in the heat a brow of hill several hundred feet above the french lines finally gave me a clear vista here up high the stream leveled briefly in a hollow hills cupping either side of the rivulet before it disappeared into jungle the waterway ran over the lip where we stood and down to the french camp below i could see the snake of the defensive lines the ominously quiet sugarcane fields the sprawl of capfrancois and tangled mountain ranges what will you tell your government gage aucoin wanted reassurance even though my opinion was no better than his it depends on the size and expertise of the opposing army i suppose i said neutrally perhaps ill tell them that either side can still win i called you honest now im not so sure he offered me a flask i sipped and glanced about and an idea occurred perhaps i did have a scheme to offer jubal who in turn could take me to dessalines his mambo priestess and legends of montezumas treasure your engineers have expertise i went on that was true enough its possible you could hold out forever with enough food and powder so an idea had tickled my brain an idea inspired by my son harry i looked uphill youve used geography to great advantage in america we call terrain this steep land that stands on end he smiled an apt description i think ill congratulate your general on your position im just as happy being on this side of your guns not charging them the colonel smiled wryly i hope dessalines shares your caution i strode to the stream scooped up water and washed my hot face taking in the geography and trying to memorize it but your real enemy has always been the fevers hasnt it disease demoralizes everyone more armies have been conquered by plague than artillery the mal de siam lingers because our men are weak and your doctors are baffled our doctors are dead i thought of slavery do you see gods hand in all this carnage when fortune is against you you see the devil i nodded im a card player you know i ponder luck all of life is a throw of the dice monsieur gage yes god satan fate fortune my wife ponders the imponderable your wife sir is in as much danger from fever as from general rochambeau come ill show you a hospital for what the british call the yellow jack it will hurry you on your way back to your marriage and your home chapter as expected astiza returned to me with virtue intact i told him i was shy and feared the return of my husband she related but that perhaps we could explore his quarters when you were distracted during the ball that was enough to reassure him of his own charm and get him to postpone advances of his army he told me nothing of treasure im fairly certain he knows nothing or hed be seeking it i also asked about lone children in this city and he said there are too many orphans to count it clearly wasnt what hes interested in this city is a death trap astiza i saw men dissolving from yellow fever if harry is here i fear for him if he isnt its almost a blessing he is its a mothers instinct but wouldnt a man like martel draw comment with a lad at his side hes hardly the fatherly type surely wed hear of it if horus is at his side what if hes hidden away somewhere locked in a cellar or sold to some monster not sold martel took harry to keep control of us hes waiting for me to find the treasure discover the secret of flight give him the key to conquering england and then swap for my boy she grimaced we hope or hes so tired of waiting that he kills hes too calculating just be sure you dont care about treasure more than your son it was a mean statement said in haste as partners sometimes do but it was also revealing and it stung id gotten us free from the barbary pirates but she gave me no credit and losing harry while hocking the emerald would always rankle if children can bond couples together their loss can strain them irreversibly apart i care about the treasure because of my son she nodded glumly knowing i loved our boy but also knowing how i wanted ordinary success shed be content in a nuns cell while i dreamed of mansions but i wanted both boy and jewel each linked to the other and tied up in aztec ransom i also wanted to best male rivals like leon martel and the vicomte rochambeau and to impress strategists like napoleon and smith yes i wasnt as singleminded as her but wasnt that a good thing the way to harry might be through dessalines she remained reluctant but if we leave capfrancois we cant get back in we can if the city falls and i think i know how to take it youll provoke a massacre with our son in the middle of it its riskier to linger here hoping rochambeau will let something slip as you flirt they know the agreement on louisiana is completed why then do we stay if they learn our diplomatic papers are a forgery or that we really came from antigua well be hanged shot or guillotined astiza went to a window to regard the mountains beyond do you really think the blacks know about this mythical treasure ive no idea but ive met one chap i like a great big one named jubal he thinks a priestess might help this mention of a priestess was calculated to get her intrigued by the other side and i dont like the idea of that lecher having another go at you i can handle rochambeau if he promises you your son in return for favors what would you do now i was the one being mean in the heat and tension of this besieged place and my jealousy was silly yet people will do extraordinary things to get what they want astiza seemed desperate rochambeau seemed reckless capfrancois felt doomed and my instinct was to get us out and seek alliance with the rebels id hold the point of a knife to whatever part of his body he holds most dear to get harry back she retorted im not leaving capfrancois until im certain that either our child isnt here or i have him to take with me i sighed hardly surprised all right how about this we attend this ball you flirt with rochambeau and learn what you can if you discover where harry is held we free him somehow if theres no word we go to dessalines after the blacks take the city we turn it upside down for evidence of our son if you give me enough time i lingered in paris and now you want to linger in capfrancois but for better reason the blacks have spies you know they might be more use than trying to pry information out of rochambeau she considered this point and offered a concession to patch over our differences on strategy the blacks have their holy spirits their women have been instructing me when we go to dessalines ill call on the gods of haiti to help us i hear them whispering from the jungle beyond the walls astiza believed in the supernatural as firmly as i believe in money and luck and as ive said she was rather inclusive of which gods shed call on my wife thought all religions were a manifestation of the same central idea and this world a mere dream of a more tangible realm somewhere beyond i knew better than to call her wrong wed seen strange things together in the great pyramid and the city of ghosts my escort today said their gods give the blacks extraordinary courage i said agreeing to patch our testiness they put their arms in cannon muzzles all political change requires belief unfortunately their arms are then blown off now she smiled knowing the habitual skepticism that was a gift from benjamin franklin and yet the french are losing she said ive been learning more about the history here this war started im told in a gathering of african religion called voodoo held in a sacred wood their gods told them to rise they have a supreme god mawu but then personal spirits there is damballah the serpent god legba who brings change ogu of fire and war baron samedi from the land of death and ezeli the goddess of beauty jubal suggested i consult the latter you most certainly will not your gods should be sogbo god of lightning and agau the god of storms and earthquakes youve called down the lightning before my american electrician indeed i had and id no desire to repeat the experience it was terrifying if gods really worked i reasoned the slaves would have triumphed a decade ago and if they didnt the french would have triumphed a decade ago when you marry a smart woman shell answer all your best arguments with her own i was filled with desire for my clever wife and not just for her mind rochambeaus slobbering reinforced my own husbandly lust we all want most whatever someone else covets but i also never tired of her face the lilt of her fingers as they moved the nape of her neck the swell of her bosom and glory of her rump the narrowness of her waist the ethan every race believes the spirit helps the flesh and the flesh is fortified by spirits i poured us a measure of punch its getting dark and i think religion is best discussed in bed or is bed your religion i daresay such a religion would be more practical or at least more comfortable than the more conventional ones ill also suggest that if people napped more the world would be a calmer place one problem with napoleon is that he never gets enough sleep ill bet rochambeau and dessalines have the same problem a colonel told me the general has nightmares im not surprised so are the haitian loa like the catholic saints to a degree but i think ezeli is the black isis the equivalent of mary venus aphrodite or freya astiza moved to where we slept and lay down as if posing for a painting bare shoulder in candlelight and the rest undulating like a serpent making me think of anything but religion i not only wanted to find my boy i wanted to make another one or girl get back the emerald retire in peace and protect them all and i think ezeli is you t he government house was transformed for rochambeaus ball gone were the slovenly belongings of tired officers replaced with pungent cascades of tropical flowers and garlands of oleander a plant imported from africa that id smelled in the ravines of the holy land the marble was mopped bright and the hardwood floors gleamed from fresh oiling the reception hall where the dancing would take place dazzled from what seemed a thousand candles crystal and armor caught the light battle standards reminded us of martial glory rochambeau clearly put more energy into festivity than war the guests were equally radiant the officers were in full dress uniform swords clinking as they turned so the sheaths bumped and rattled like discordant chimes their uniforms were blue their sashes red their frogging silver or gold their breeches white and their boots polished to almost shave by civilian gentlemen wore fashionable tailed jackets and servants sweated in embroidered french waistcoats their woolly hair powdered white under tricorn hats the women outshone all there are lovely ladies everywhere but that night in capfrancois embedded pulchritude in memory if only because the beauty seemed ephemeral and the gaiety forced given the desperate military situation impending fever the bayonet and rape were the unspoken uninvited guests to our party and gave the ball poignancy the womens gowns were as sumptuous as they were daring decolletage picked out by brilliant necklaces necks were highlighted by hair piled high skin tones ranged from the carefully protected alabaster of ladies recently arrived from europe to the tan of the creoles to the dusk of the mulattos no truly black women were in attendance except servants such were the color castes of saintdomingue the mixedrace damsels had special beauty i thought as if the gods rewarded the sin of master and slave with heavenly grace their complexions were flawless lips full and their eyes offered the dark depths and promises of a houri astiza was still special but here she had true competition the swirl of fabric skin perfume and dazzling smiles put all of us men in something of a fever we were hot and constricted in our uniforms and suit coats while the women seemed as bright and light as woodland nymphs astiza and i began to circulate and i saw rochambeau in the center greeting each couple and assessing each woman as boldly as if he were in a whorehouse i was amazed some husband hadnt already shot him but of course murder would mean a firing squad i also remembered something franklin had written in his books of aphorisms he that displays too often his wife and his wallet is in danger of having them both borrowed once again i feared he was speaking of me astiza saw me scowling and squeezed my forearm radiating her own smile like a beam of light remember were here to learn about harry she whispered youre a diplomat in control of every expression just dont be alone with the general soldiers shield him from answering for his appetites then stay with me but i couldnt entirely there was a regimental orchestra and as the music started there was a roulette of changing partners as we danced three officers in turn twirled astiza on the floor and then rochambeau swooped to grasp her arm quickstepping with surprising grace for such a squat posture he got firm hold of her in the waltz that dance the older generation views as scandalous his right hand drifted down to the swell of her hip and buttocks and gripped for purchase and his nose aimed at her bosom grinning like a conquistador with inca loot he danced past with skill i couldnt match the bastard was probably a good fencer too so i disliked him even more deciding his stature was distinctly toadlike and you are the american monsieur it was a planters wife with beauty and figure that would normally enchant me i bowed and extended my arms but as we made a great wheel on the parquet floor i kept looking past my partner to astiza determined not to lose her as id lost harry rochambeau had lowered his paw halfway to her thigh and she was whispering some confidence into his ear that had him leering i longed to pour rum down his breeches and set it on fire excuse me i broke off to have some punch i wasnt used to this business of having a wife other men desired and it put me in a foul mood i felt half guilty for planning to go over to dessalines betraying every couple around me but half vengeful too rochambeau had grasped my wife as france and the other european powers had grasped the islands of the caribbean and the labor of africa i understood the wrath of the rebels were we close to harry and the stone at all i was brooding about my dilemmas and unjust fate when astiza suddenly appeared from the dance floor face flush neck shiny tendrils of hair escaping to stick to her temples she pushed me hard back into the shadows hes here who id almost spilled my drink she had fire in her eye leon martel he slipped up to me after the music stopped and said the general was inviting me to a private audience upstairs the devil he did the policeman is rochambeaus pimp good god smith said he played that role as criminal so wheres harry i couldnt ask him ethan i dont think he recognized me from nitots jewelry store everything happened there too quickly he just does the generals propositioning for him he did have the arrogance to introduce himself i almost swooned before giving a false name hell learn soon enough who i am from rochambeau and he would recognize you since you were caught and tortured you have to stay out of sight out of sight i have to skewer the bastard not yet weve got to learn where horus is its a trap the only reason to get you upstairs is to rape or capture you they dont know who i am i tell you rochambeau simply hopes for sex martel panders ive got to learn what i can no its too dangerous hes coming she glanced over her shoulder and indeed i saw martel threading through the crowd toward my wife swarthy as a storm cloud feral as a fox he had the smug bearing of a favored courtier of a man who delighted in hobnobbing with his betters i have the same vanity promise me youll not risk ascending the staircase wait inside the library and let me learn what i can she replied then well decide what to do about rochambeaus invitation another shove and i backed reluctantly through the doorway i fumbled at my waist frustrated id deliberately come to saintdomingue without a weapon to dissuade suspicion now i longed for one to kill leon martel when he spoke to my wife the kidnapper had an unpleasant rasp to his voice that i recognized over the music even though id no idea what was being said was he really a procurer for the french commander how had the renegade ingratiated himself into the garrison here what if i called him out at this moment sword to sword maybe colonel aucoin and the other officers would join me against this upstart and demand that he produce harry as i stewed a black servant annoyingly tugged my sleeve monsieur a messenger for you in the kitchen im busy pardon but he says hes ready to carry again the negro looked at me intently at first i didnt understand but then i did jubal of all the worst times can it wait please its safe but urgent things were happening too fast heart hammering hating the idea of leaving my wife to lechers i reluctantly followed the slave surely shed not go upstairs to rochambeau except she was entirely too selfsufficient which is why i loved her here monsieur to my surprise a shelf of books rotated and i stepped into a passageway it wasnt secret but rather a hidden corridor to bring refreshments to private meetings in the library in twenty paces another door led us into the pantry with the clatter of the kitchen beyond black cooks were singing as they worked while butlers shouted orders and curses hams and fowl hung from the pantry ceiling jars of pickled preserves lined the shelves and barrels of flour and meat crowded the floor it was a hoard of food in the midst of a siege a few miles away a vast dark army loomed waiting to liberate all the servants working here what must the blacks think of nights like this emerging from the dark of a pantry corner was the large form i knew well jubal you risk coming here i risk what my commander orders he said dessalines has sent a patrol for you its the best time to escape with army officers preoccupied while they drink and eat well climb the mountains wading up a stream to throw off any dogs i cant go tonight were honored guests ambassadors and my wife has urgent business with rochambeau theres no choice if you wish to meet dessalines it must be on his schedule not yours lest he fear that you set a trap we go in one hour an hour what about our belongings leave them take them back when we take the city my wife will not agree leave her if you wish then if you want her back youll join us in storming the walls by that time shed be rochambeaus forced concubine or worse what wretched timing things cant happen that fast im looking for my boy if you dont come in an hour youll never meet dessalines unless it is to hang from the gibbet with the other whites when he conquers capfrancois damnation yet i also knew jubal was right the ball was a perfect time to creep away from capfrancois could i persuade astiza i have to ask my wife command her then meet me in the park just beyond here in one hour dont let yourself be followed he melted into the shadows for a moment i hesitated frustrated and then i realized that jubals deadline was a partial solution to my problems it meant astiza and i must flee before her flirtation with the general went too far i had an excuse to get her away she had a mothers instinct to stay close to her son but the strategic thing to dothe fatherly calculationwas to throw in with louvertures successor wasnt it i hurried back toward the celebration the level of noise had risen as guests plumbed the punch dancers twirled faster but more tipsily laughter was a shriek in the corners behind the pillars couples were kissing officers without women stumbled drunkenly together telling crude jokes i didnt see astiza nor rochambeau nor martel by the beard of odin was i too late i spied aucoin my earlier escort and risked pushing through the crowd to him betting martel had left the ballroom colonel i greeted ah monsieur gage so we fiddle while rome burns have you met my wife i wish to i saw the two of you together earlier shes beautiful ethan yes but now im looking for her its rather urgent we leave you may have to wait i believe she ascended the stairs with an aide to our general named leon martel rather formidable in personality and forbidding in appearance he arrived a few months ago and has cast a spell on our commander have you seen martel with a young boy there are rumors of several boys but they are just rumors my jaw ached from its clenching i need to get a message to her he put his hand on my shoulder best not to disturb rochambeau it hurts but politics comes first no fidelity first colonel and honor of course but he has many soldiers she is there and you are here have a drink and wait as other husbands have waited the hell i will or risk being ordered to a doomed patrol chapter no one takes my advice including my wife this may be because of my tendency to fall into political tangles military brawls debt and illconsidered romantic affairs but stilldid astiza have any inclination to honor and obey my admonition not to go upstairs in her desperation to gain information about our son apparently not posted on the balcony that fronted rochambeaus office and bedchamber were sentries with muskets and bayonets somewhere beyond those closed doors were astiza two men i despised and a grandfather clock imported from breguet that was ticking remorselessly toward my rendezvous with jubal id make no progress on finding montezumas hoard without fleeing to dessalines and the rebels and no progress toward regaining my son and the confidence of my wife without keeping close to martel and rochambeau but what if i could retrieve my bride from general rochambeau castrating the bastard in the process what if i could capture leon martel and take him with us into the mountains no doubt hed be a worthy prize to bring to the negro general maybe id have the pleasure of trying to mockdrown the renegade policeman just as hed drowned me in paris a warmup before black rebels invented even more hideous tortures i was weaponless in a house with a hundred french officers but doesnt fortune reward the bold yes id capture martel retrieve astiza castrate rochambeau flee to dessalines find the treasure get the emerald and somewhere along the way rescue my son i hurried back to the library swung the bookcase open once more and made my way down the private passageway to the pantry the same servant as before intercepted me monsieur its not yet time for jubal i need to get upstairs first but the main way is guarded strictly forbidden during celebrations general rochambeau entertains in private my wife is up there he looked sympathetic the general can be very seductive no shes captive against her will i doubted this was entirely true but i needed his help a husband has rights and rochambeau has sentries does he not it is impossible i need you to get me up a secret way behind the guards there must be a servants stair also guarded he hesitated however he knew an alternative then we flee with jubal to help liberate haiti i promised no one will know your role until victory when youll be a hero he frowned if they suspect theyll feed me to their dogs if we succeed there soon will be no more dogs and no more french no more whips and no more manacles he swallowed taking courage weve a hoist to bring food above the idea came from your own president jefferson a sea captain brought drawings from virginia perhaps you can fit inside i clapped his shoulder good man rochambeau is probably drunk and his men halfasleep ill find her without a peep and well slip away as silently as deer or bury some steel in the generals head but why alarm my new confederate as the slave turned to lead me i slipped a kitchen cleaver into my breeches beneath the back of my coat i realized how naked i felt unarmed which had been my state since escaping the pirates of tripoli i must commission another rifle but no time for that now the contraption the slave proposed to hoist me in was like a cupboard and it took some grunting and flexing to fold myself in lord its a nuisance getting older and my midthirties is a stiff march from my teens it didnt help that i had the cleaver blade to be wary of i took care not to cut a slice out of myself when the hoist stops climb out the slave instructed if they find you in the dumbwaiter theyll stick you like a pig with bayonets so as not to disturb the party with gunshots saves powder too i saluted from where i lay curled dont worry i dont intend to disturb the festivities a whit ill slink about like a ghost just dont become one monsieur a door closed and i was in darkness then with a lurch i felt myself ascending helpless as a goose folded into an oven i just prayed that astiza wasnt gaily descending the stairs looking for me as i rose to look for her the dumbwaiter stopped and i pushed to get out the cabinet door i realized too late was latched from the other side i was locked in no doubt my fellow conspirator hadnt remembered that or had he and id squeezed myself into a trap i considered signaling to go down again but i had no way to do so with no better course i wedged my feet against the hoist and pushed against the door wood groaned but didnt give it was hot and short of air so i shrank into myself as much as i could planted my boots and launched against the door the latch snapped with a crack splinters flew and my momentum carried me out onto a woodplank hallway i landed with a whoof and a clump so much for creeping cest quoi one of the sentries not as sleepy as id hoped was trotting my way i rolled to one side and when he rounded the corner tripped him and sprang he fell musket clattering and i jumped on top of him and brought the handle of the cleaver down on his temple he stilled id no desire to murder just to get my wife away from the lecher in chief unfortunately the other guard likely heard the noise time to hurry i sprang up got my bearings from our earlier visit to rochambeaus office and trotted to what i guessed was the bedroom door gripping the cleaver while realizing i should have grabbed the musket the speed of events was confusing me and it didnt help i was lubricated with rum punch ah well the kitchen utensil was a bit like my familiar tomahawk why hadnt i ordered a new one of those too well because i was married and a father quietly retired a squire of sleepy scholarship and prudent investment rochambeaus chamber was unlocked i slipped inside and looked for my wife id only seconds before the next sentry followed me the bedroom was dim a single candle tropical moonlight falling through open french doors and there on a bed behind gauze mosquito curtains a woman rode our casanova commander her back was arched breasts high hair tumbling to her splayed buttocks the man beneath her grunting as she made soft cries astiza it was as if a lance went in i knew she was desperate to get news of harry but to be betrayed so soon in our marriage and humiliated so completely a gaping cuckold cut me to the quick i mentally cursed the awful dilemma martels scheme had put me in and the desperation my wife had been driven to rochambeau must suffer so i lifted the cleaver and charged with a savage tug i ripped the bed curtain down and reached for astizas dark hair to heave her off the commander she screamed rochambeau looked at me in amazement the cleaver gleamed and then i realized i was not yanking on astiza at all it was one of the bastards other seductions her chest flushed mouth open in confusion and fear twisting her neck to relieve my grasp on her hair where was my wife behind me the door of the chamber crashed open and a sentry burst in stop right there who are you his musket came up the bayonet aimed at our frozen menage a trois dont shoot me you idiot general rochambeau cried i released the tart and shoved her down at the general who was reaching for a pistol on a nightstand damnation where was my wife i sprang for the french doors and the balcony before there was a bang and a musket ball hummed by my neck i was in it now its the american rochambeau cried hes an assassin well i had failed in that role since id entirely forgotten to cleave the bastards head i whirled around and hurled the weapon at him the blade spinning as the couple ducked and the woman shrieked the cleaver embedded itself in a bedpost then i vaulted the stone railing of the balcony outside above the garden as i did rochambeaus pistol fired and this time something hot grazed my ear stinging like fire i fell into darkness my body crashing into shrubbery and damp soil deliberately rolling so i didnt break a leg then i bounced up gasping my ear had been cut by the ball but other than bleeding it seemed intact i was scratched dirty and bewildered if his paramour wasnt astiza where the devil had she gone and where was leon martel what a stew i listened to the chorus of cries as the ball erupted into panic at the gunshots there were shouts oaths and the rasp of drawn swords id turned a cotillion into a hornets nest chapter i glanced up two men appeared on the balcony presumably the sentry and a naked rochambeau their guns were empty having missed i regretted not having my own i was curious about the size of the bastards nutmegs but it was too dim to judge with no way to strike back i limped away nursing a turned ankle sensing a presence they shouted but i carried on melting into the gardens what now no wife no son and no distracting festivity to give me cover as i crept to join dessalines instead id roused the garrison i suppose i should have thought things through more clearly and charged less impetuously but the fear that my wife was in the arms of another had obsessed me love lust and jealousy can addle the mind like english gin id also been seized by the idea of using the cleaver and not necessarily on the top of the generals anatomy if i was caught he might use it on me i could demand a trial but i suspect my husbandly outrage would hardly mollify a french military tribunal particularly when id thrown a chopping blade at their commander while he was entirely preoccupied with someone elses wife i could hear soldiers spilling from government house and the rattle of drums from the barracks against the mountains i also heard the barking of dogs and wondered if they sensed a new dinner i was probably whiter meat than they were used to but i was fairly certain their palates wouldnt mind monsieur gage it was a hiss jubal reached out a paw of a hand and jerked me deeper into garden foliage what is happening i heard shots i tried to rescue my wife where is she i didnt find her at all it sounded foolish even to me it turned out rochambeau was rogering some other spouse now the garrison is aroused and the general wants to kill me as much as i wanted to kill him i thought we were going to quietly steal away that was the plan but im afraid i became a little reckless when my wife vanished im not used to being married women make you stupid apparently so now it is very dangerous we must flee to the mountains but they will be watching monsieur i am a little disappointed we were told by the british that you were a man of cunning retirement is simply more work than i imagined im afraid ive grown rusty merde all right hurry i hear their hounds he turned to run but i stopped him jubal im sorry but we cant go without my wife we spied a dangerous man who tortured me back in france and im worried he has astiza did you see a woman emerge from government house quite beautiful mustee in coloring hurrying on some kind of mission no woman alone but i did see a woman more pushed than escorted a mans hand on one arm and a child in his other a child a boy perhaps it wasnt evident if he was forcing her somewhere or she was demanding they leave she glanced back several times they were heading for the harbor bollocks martel had promised her reunion with harry if they fled before i confronted him and shed chosen my son over me trusting her resourcefulness over mine now id lost them both if its astiza a bastard of a frenchman is taking her there my sympathies monsieur gage but we must go now to dessalines or risk being hanged or eaten it may already be too late no its i who am sorry jubal because we must go to the harbor instead to rescue my wife and you can call me ethan from now on well be equals he groaned not at all impressed by my offer of friendship we heard cries of command in french a bugle in the middle of the night a rising chorus of baying hounds this is a very poor idea our rebels are the opposite way we must my new friend i misplace my family like an old man his spectacles and i want to prove i can hold on cant you lead us to the harbor on a winding twisting way in which we wont be seen there is no such path the street grid was laid with the compass a musket ball can carry down a street from one end of capfrancois to the other theyll cut us down like rabbits and if we do get to the sea were trapped between dogs and water well steal a boat i dont even think we can reach the sea youve roused entire regiments he obviously thought me mad as well as stupid but no i was just faithful i glanced about a cluster of officers was in a cone of light spilling from government house main doors their sabers pointing as they tried to sort what the alarm was about rochambeau had disappeared probably to put some clothes on the barking was closer and near the barracks i thought i could see lupine leaping forms their wolfish teeth white in the night down the rue dauphin toward the caribbean a squad of infantry was assembling in short order the dogs would sniff us out in the shadows and wed join the men swinging on the gibbets our odor adding to the citys scent of corruption unless we can escape in that i pointed to a wagon stacked with barrels in a dark court adjacent to the park the yard just off the main street to the sea each hogshead i guessed contained sugar a remnant of wartime plantation production that had been too late for a ship with room for sweets all departing vessels were crammed with fleeing aristocrats and refugee heirlooms we have no horses or oxen monsieur its a long gentle slope to the caribbean we aim push and ride now we could hear the clatter of hooves in the dark as men mounted the barking of the dogs was getting closer youve left us no choice he admitted looking dubiously at the heavy vehicle it will fly like a chaise i wished it would fly like cayleys glider but it was several tons in the wrong direction i released the lever brake alone i couldnt have maneuvered the ponderous wagon but jubal took up its tongue and dragged it out into the street with the brute strength of a bear i kept his spirits up by pushing a little from behind we aimed down the street like a boulder tumbling down a mountain lest the vehicle drag i unlimbered the tongue by freeing an iron pin and then used that pin to jam the front axle so it couldnt turn then i threw the heavy tongue up onto the cargo of casks now push push push point her like an arrow our chariot weighing several tons began to move slowly as we ponderously accelerated we came into faint light thrown by a house window there were shouts as we were finally spotted and the excited chorus of slavering dogs the animals came on in a streak eyes glowing in the nights torch and lantern light men were running after them holding glinting sabers the wagon rolled faster did you bring a gun too dangerous jubal said id be flayed if caught of course also dangerous not to now hindsight is always sharpest i eyed the dogs well use the wagon tongue pole like a boat jubal swung the heavy timber down against the street and we shoved our cargo gained more speed guns flashed in the night and bullets made a familiar hot wasp sound my ear had stopped bleeding but still throbbed i thought i saw rochambeau by his officers gesturing while he clasped a womans silk dressing robe around his body a majorthe wronged husband was shaking his fist at the general we were now trundling rapidly downhill aimed at the sea like a ball at pins but the mastiffs grew out of the gloom with astonishing speed sprinting for our wheels and snapping a huge dog sprang to gain purchase on our cargo but jubal swung the wagon tongue in a huge arc as easily as a baton it cudgeled the beast knocking him sideways into a building where he bounced and fell among his fellows they paused to snap at him and the distraction gave us precious seconds now we were rumbling with the terrifying momentum of cayleys flying machine buildings blurring past the caribbean ahead aglitter under the moon wind warm in our faces how do we slow jubal asked the brake lever it will work at this speed possibly ill give it a pull there was a screech and the wood snapped stinging my hands we jerked and went faster or possibly not drag the tongue he tried the wooden beam bounced threw up a fountain of dirt and mud caught on something and yanked away almost pulling jubal off the wagon with it now we were racing faster than any horse could run the dogs and pursuing soldiers faded in dark behind i heard a shouted command and turned to where we were rolling ahead a file of french soldiers had formed to block the road one had a glowing match he held above a fivepound fieldpiece halt he called we couldnt jubal yanked me down theyre going to shoot the cannon barked there was a terrific impact almost bouncing us clear and our speed momentarily slackened a barrel of sugar exploded into a cloud of sparkling whiteit had been refined to the costly color and so no wonder they hoarded it i thought absentlyand then we gained speed again we struck the cannon and smashed it aside wheels flying and its spinning barrel scattering the yelling infantry i think we thumped over one or two men all of us covered in crystals like snowmen a few had the wits to shoot the bullets plunking into the casks spouts of sugar laid lines on the street like trails of white gunpowder where were astiza and harry more french my companion warned i looked at the fastapproaching sea there was a cluster of soldiers on the quay and a longboat was pulling out from the stone steps and into the harbor sailors were pulling on oars and i saw a woman facing backward at us and a man in the stern pointing somethinga pistol at her she lifted her arm to point and the manmartel it must beturned to look at us and then i saw she was holding a child were going over jubal warned we hit the stone balustrade that marked the edge of the quay and everything shattered stone and sugar hogsheads flying like britains new fragmentation bombs id read in the newspapers about their invention by a lieutenant henry shrapnel a name id never heard before we flew too launched in a corona of sugar there was a radiating cloud of white and then i plunged into the dark caribbean the pieces of our vehicle splashing into the water all around us fearing gunfire i swam away as long as i could hold my breath before surfacing when my head broke water i looked wildly about catching a glimpse of the two people i most wanted to see in the world astiza harry ethan she shouted from a great distance swim away little spouts erupted as martels scattered henchmen fired at my voice then they paused to reload i considered which way to swim blessing the tedious nature of ramming down cartridges something seized me and i almost panicked before realizing it was my black companion he was dragging me away from the longboat as he swam with his other arm this way he hissed your foolishness has ruined everything but maybe theres still a chance i need to catch my wife youre going to outswim a launch and then give them a chance to slit your throat as you try to climb aboard i let him drag me this isnt going well our only chance is to escape to dessalines which i told you in the beginning youre not married are you he stopped a moment pulling me near angry and impatient you think i never was that because im black or an exslave i dont know what youre feeling right now i killed the master who raped and murdered the woman i gave my heart to but i havent survived the last fifteen years by blundering and boasting ive used my wits perhaps its time you recovered yours that sobered me i wasnt used to being dressed down by an exslave but i deserved it instead of cleverly trailing martel which astiza had no doubt assumed id do id charged about with a meat cleaver and aroused an entire city what begins in anger ends in shame ben franklin had warned me maybe id let jubal lead for a while we stroked east while staying a hundred yards out to sea paralleling the quay of capfrancois toward the mouth of the river id seen earlier unfortunately my wife and son were headed in the opposite direction shes going to board a ship and ill lose her again i complained shes away from the siege and the plague maybe its a blessing now you must seek black help to find her again you mean dessalines yes and maybe me it was said grudgingly but the offer was sincere i was frustrated by my own confusion perhaps astiza had tried to signal me before going off with martel but i had rushed upstairs why hadnt she called for help to the french officers theyd have sympathized with a mother and abhorred a kidnapper i could see men running along the quay shouting and pointing but their shots went wild apparently we werent easy to pinpoint in the dark with only our heads above water dogs were racing up and down the stone bulkhead too barking wildly but all they could smell was the caribbean im tiring i confessed kick off your coat and boots and rest on your back here ill hold you for a moment and he did gently as we both realized we had more in common than expected tragedy a planter really took your wife my love to punish me he saw promise when i was young and taught me to read and write despite the fact my size made me a good field hand but i used the knowledge to communicate with blacks conspiring toward revolution and when he discovered id betrayed him with education he decided to hurt me in a way deeper than any whipping wed become close like father and son and hed promised eventual freedom in punishment he raped her and threatened to sell her to remind me of my station so i killed him to remind him i was human but he killed her i surprised him with her as you tried to surprise rochambeau she died in the struggle all of us screaming emotions are complex on a plantation i began paddling again slowly emotions are complex everywhere never more so than with men who have power over you it was like killing my own father this entire uprising has been like the killing of fathers the destruction of a monstrous incestuous family slavery is not just cruel ethan its intimate in the worst possible way apparently i wasnt the only one with problems and now i had dragged this poor soul into the sea im sorry jubal you dont have to be sorry for my history you barely know me im sorry for the entire bollocks of a world ah that makes sense we stroked more steadily youre a strong swimmer i said i grew up near the shore and pray to agwe the loa of the sea i sensed your education thats why dessalines uses you as a spy isnt it i can do many things and i have sorrow revolutionaries feed on hatreds sometimes there are happy endings the ending ethan is always death this statement wasnt bitter just matteroffact we finally reached a spit at the mouth of the river that was across from capfrancois and out of easy musket or rifle shot the two of us panted a moment while lying in the sandy shallows looking at the city wed fled should we run inland theres a swamp beyond jubal said snakes we need a boat maybe thats one i pointed at what appeared to be a log disconcertingly it moved caiman his tone was more exasperated than terrified what alligator the beast of scaly mail and reptilian guile shook off its lethargy with a rippled of muscle slid into the water and came toward us tail curling like calligraphy it smells us when the dogs cannot and wants a meal chapter what do we do the speed with which the monster swam was unnerving it made straight at us as if we were reeling it on a string stand and shout jubal instructed but the french exactly we sprang up in the shallows water only to our calves does this scare caimans off it draws fire here over here he waved the beasts body was flexing like the arms of a blacksmith and reminding me of extremely unhappy experiences with a nile crocodile but when we stood the moonlight silhouetted us a great shout went up and muskets fired bullets peppering the water a small cannon banged with a scream a fivepound ball struck the water and skipped like a stone before bounding up the beach this is your strategy look jubal pointed the startled alligator had turned and was retreating for the swamp now run on the sand i glanced a last time at the harbor the longboat was still clearly visible pulling for a ship and i thoughtor did i imagine astiza half standing trying to discern what the soldiers were shooting at in the night then we were dashing away upriver my feet bare the sand hardpacked men following on the opposite bank and shooting from two hundred yards away we were dim shadows against the jungle swamp i squeezed in on myself as lead sizzled by us there a fishermans boat jubal pointed a dugout canoe again looking like a log was pulled into marsh grass how do you tell boat from beast in this cursed country if it bites he dragged the canoe and we jumped aboard craft rocking and seized the paddles like those suddenly other logs slid into the water the river was thick with alligators roused from sleep by our sound and sweat i heard them plop and then a snap of exercising jaws paddle fast jubal said i needed no encouragement making a fair imitation of fultons suggested steamboats the caimans followed each sending out an ominous delta of intersecting waves it was like being escorted to a dinner with us the main course we stroked upriver still hard to pick out against the jungle one musket ball thunked into the wood of our canoe but otherwise the balls buzzed by like pesky hornets a tide had turned the sluggish current in our direction dark reptilian shapes followed like escorting frigates their prehistoric eyes gauging our pace and their primitive brains calculating what we might taste like when we spilled on the opposite shore horses galloped and dogs loped the city gave way to the avenue of shorn palms and then the french camps and outposts orders were shouted torches lit soldiers roused rochambeau was not going to let me slip by if he would help it this was a foolish way to escape but after a mile the river bends away from their lines jubal said thank goodness i did some canoeing in canada but havent stayed in shape i didnt think it necessary for retirement you should exercise because trouble seems to follow you friend my plan was to walk quietly out of town but with your plan we have to fight through their entire army this is your pattern is it not i wouldnt call it a plan exactly more like an unfortunate tendency im just in love then keep a better hold on your wife than you do i began to believe we were past the worst of it guns flashed but the aim was almost random cavalry jingled but had no way to get to us dogs howled but it was the howl of frustration the alligators almost began to seem like a benign train and a few slipped away as if bored then we neared a bright cluster of flames on the armys riverbank and my confidence faltered again artillerymen were building bonfires to cast light on the river and an entire battery of field guns had been drawn up pointing across the water we had to paddle right past them should we flee into the swamp wed be gator meat and snake chew the french will blow us to kindling yes so when i say flip the canoe into the reptiles we have no choice lover ethan come up under our vessel to breathe the tide will help kick with your feet and if you feel caiman teeth try to hit them on the nose but speed first fast as we can we bent to it in our canoe setting up a little bow wave and a respectable bubbling wake me gasping from exertion yet we were simply hurrying into firelight we could hear shouted commands and count the ominous row of cannon muzzles seven each one aimed at my right ear the cavalry had pulled up to watch our extinction so had the anxious dogs they growled and whined with that kind of audience we seemed to crawl across their field of fire look to your guns the words floated across the water firelight danced on the water alligators formed a little school aim i felt as picked out as a fly on a wedding cake now said jubal keep your paddle he jerked sideways i followed suit and with a splash we flipped over as we went in i heard the final word fire the water was pitch and only by keeping my hand on the rim of the canoe did i remain oriented i shoved my head up into its overturned wooden hull as jubal had promised there was a pocket of air there i couldnt see him in the dark but i could hear him blowing and breathing as he kicked something scaly bumped my leg and i jerked then the world erupted a projectile clipped our dugout and it boomed like a drum other cannonballs plowed into the river all around us smacking like beaver tails i couldnt see the splashes but i could feel their concussion there was the muffled screech of balls sailing by where wed been sitting seconds before and thudding into the muddy riverbank beyond that will keep monsieur caiman away i hope jubal said and indeed the alligators had the good sense to flee i heard cheering through the wooden hull did the french think their barrage had overturned us it must look so and that wed drowned or been eaten since we didnt reappear the canoe would be very low in the dark jubal was swimming awkwardly holding his paddle and the boat i did my best to assist as we slowly drifted east past the bonfires i think were running out of air i said wait like patient mice what if the caimans come back then we feed them you so we dont feed them me merci jubal youre the one who wanted to go to the harbor what followed was a little eternity of darkness gasps in the stuffy air of the overturned canoe occasional shots that i hoped were blind and the queasy feeling of waiting for teeth to test my leg id no idea if we were even going in the right direction and the certainty that id once more lost wife and son made me almost not care what a bloody fiasco i was wheezing jubal i need to go out for a breath a minute more then there was the drumlike thud of something striking our overturned canoe we stopped abruptly had the french launched boats to pursue us i could swim for the swamps to be shot or eaten or surrender to be hung or burned too tired to flee anymore i decided surface jubal said to give up to be saved i came up next to our craft there was a great bright gouge in its top where a ball had hit but otherwise it was remarkably intact the hollowed log must be ironhard i blinked away water seeing the white cross bands of uniforms in the dark and opened my mouth coughing readying an apology for throwing a cleaver at the french commander but then i realized the faces looking down were all dark and arms were reaching for us from a plank fishing boat youre rebels strong hands seized me liberators its about time jubal said maybe its you who are late the soldier replied or maybe general jeanjacques dessalines is angry that you went the opposite way of what he ordered i sighed im afraid our route was my idea my companion is an idiot antoine jubal said from the water beside me but perhaps a useful idiot they hauled me aboard he dont look useful a man with sergeant stripes said he looks drowned they laughed jubal flopped in next to me the french bonfires had receded the night protective i have an urgent message for general dessalines i said antoine leaned close then you can deliver it while he decides whether to kill you or cook you white man they laughed again and i silently prayed the hilarity wouldnt draw gunfire chapter jubal and i staggered exhausted from the rebel boat and collapsed to sleep on the bank of the river we were hidden from view by mangrove trees and wakened at midmorning by heat and insects then we shared a breakfast of pork and plantain as we watched land crabs scuttle and caimans yawn our escort of a dozen blacks was as armed as a platoon of pirates with pistol musket and bayonet cane knives and machetes took the place of swords a boy of ten perched in a tree still as a cat watching for french patrols you like to cause trouble white man said antoine a former field hand risen to full colonel never have i heard so much shooting at one soggy head two if you count jubal i think it was you they were aiming at no i conceded the point i am plagued by misunderstandings he acts with his heart instead of his head jubal interpreted you mean a woman antoine guessed cock instead of caution they laughed even worse said jubal a wife care instead of carefree im actually quite a careful planner and my wife even more so i told them its just that the french in capfrancois are excitable so now you try the other side you do seem more relaxed thats because we are winning i was marched under rebel escort into the abandoned sugarcane fields still limping from my sprain my ear aching my feet bare the ground thankfully was the red soil of soft farmland it was a relief to have lost my coat i wondered why id worn it in the caribbean as long as i had the negroes gave me another straw hat and a smear of ashes for my nose and ears to protect against the sun dirt lanes connecting the plantations led this way and that but instead of grand colonial homes there were only hollow monuments to twelve years of slaughter the land was humid and initially seemed deserted but then wed pass a clearing hacked in the cane and thered be a platoon of black soldiers camped dressed in a hodgepodge of captured french military dress stolen planter fineries and rags leftover from slavery the men were lean tough and confident one might puff a pipe another sharpen a blade theyd stop chatting and stare at me with suspicion as i trudged past the lone white amid a squad of blacks was i prisoner or mercenary but studying them i was now certain that napoleon would never reinstate slavery on this island the inhabitants had become independent not just in deed but in mind its like trying to force a boy or girl coming of age back into childhood it cannot be done i can see why the french hesitate to fight you i said to jubal some of these men have been at war all their adult lives he told me most have lost brothers mothers wives when we liberate a plantation we share what is seized but any money goes to buy arms from yankee gunrunners we have men with american rifles who can pick off french officers before they know they are being aimed at i once had a long rifle im rather a good shot actually we have all the shooters we need dessalines seeks thinkers you think dont you jubal books became bread it was a mistake by my master i realized there were alternatives youre the kind of man who reads and ponders and thinks before he speaks most men in paris and london cant do that you know right now im thinking how to make a case for you several miles from capfrancois we began to pass villages with huts of liberated black women and children theyd already converted small sections of cane field to vegetable patches and animal pens chickens clucked pigs grunted and naked toddlers wandered the latter reminding me of my missing son how much would a threeyearold remember me after all these months i could only pray hed found succor with the return of his mother and that shed tell him good things about papa how interesting if females ruled instead of men with their dreams of martial glory less sorrow and more dullness i guessed more contentment and less inspiration not better or worse necessarily but different an easier environment to sustain retirement a tropical wood topped the cane fields on a low hill too rocky and poor for agriculture within its shade was the main rebel camp instead of the closed tents of the french army the blacks had stretched canvas awnings between the trees to create a network of pavilions that let through the breeze the elevation put the headquarters at a deliberate distance from stagnant water keeping mosquitoes at bay looted plantation tables and chairs provided outdoor furniture and hammocks were strung for sleep a haze of campfire smoke hung in the branches i could smell roast pig and baking bread and after our march i was as hungry as when i met napoleon i didnt get any food before this meeting either the rebel army was not entirely the color of coal some were mulattos and others white deserters poles whod hoped service with france would spread revolution to their homeland instead found themselves hirelings in the sultry caribbean most died immediately of yellow fever but some survived to flee to the rebel army several had become drillmasters because the illiterate field hands responded almost automatically to white command a habit ingrained since birth i saw a company marching back and forth to a profane shouted pidgin of french african and polish i also saw children and grandmothers fancy girls and cripples craftsmen and cooks there were dogs cats pet parrots and braying donkeys in one corner men were clustered around fighting cocks cheering the birds on dessaliness headquarters was in the middle of this conglomeration of several thousand men and women his pavilion roofed by what looked to be a liberated mainsail oriental carpets were spread on the ground huge black bodyguards ringed what seemed to be an openair throne room and the general presided on a red velvet settee that reminded me of the purple one in the office of rochambeau he glanced up from papers as i approached frowning i was pale limping unarmed soiled and barefoot i didnt look like much of a hero or of much use for that matter jeanjacques dessalines in contrast exuded power and menace he was handsomer than louverture a negro of fortyfive years with high cheekbones a firm chin powerful torso and the erect carriage of the french army officer hed been his sideburns extended into muttonchops kinked hair cut close to his skull in the heat skin glistening he looked as chiseled from black marble as a roman statue of a nubian lord his gaze was predatory as an eagle the general had set aside on the sofa a bicorn hat with ostrich plume and wore an unbuttoned full military dress jacket with epaulettes and braiding he was african chieftain crossed with military marshal but his look of fierce intelligence exceeded either dessalines was reputed to be cruel quick and brilliantly determined jubal had told me the general was made overseer as a young man because of his obvious cleverness had been purchased by a free black named dessalines and had taken his negro masters name when the slave uprising began in the opportunistic slave joined the revolt through courage ruthlessness and strength of personality he became a key lieutenant to louverture he followed toussaint through a complex web of alliances and rifts with spanish british french and rival black armies each side betraying the other again and again as the islands tangle of ethnicities jockeyed for power dessalines was louvertures fist taking no prisoners and burning enemy homes to the ground just the year before hed heroically defended a fort against eighteen thousand french attackers retreating only after an epic twentyday siege he then succeeded toussaint when that general was betrayed in june of now in november of this general had squeezed the last whites into capfrancois he met every atrocity the french could invent with cruelty of his own and hanged shot burned drowned and tortured it was to this man that id fled for mercy and aid we fished the american antoine announced he decided to swim instead of walk jubal was good enough not to leave him for the caimans the reptiles spat him out my black friend said dessalines studied me skeptically is he useful he is famous said jubal thats not the same thing and handsome called a black woman back in the crowd leaning lazily against a tree more people laughed which i hoped was a good sign i straightened trying to look the part of resolute savant instead of desperate refugee maybe i could interest them in electricity share some of franklins aphorisms or teach them a game of cards silence dessalines held up his hand and the laughter snuffed like an extinguished candle he turned to me so youve come to the winning side his voice was low and sonorous i believe we have common interests i replied with more confidence than i felt the united states wishes to see you victorious so that napoleon will complete the transfer of louisiana to my country the british hope you will deprive their archenemy of saintdomingue frances richest colony and the french are in pursuit of a legend they think will help them conquer the english youve become not just the most important man in the land you call haiti general dessalines but one of the most important men in the world id rehearsed this bit of flattery because i wasnt certain how id be welcomed around me was africa in all its dark power and somehow i had to enlist help his officers looked as skeptical and opportunistic as medieval earls one whom id learn was named cristophe was an imposing seven feet tall while another named capois tensed like a coiled spring even when resting he seemed poised for attack they were shrewdlooking hardmuscled swaggering men with pistols in their sashes and tattoos on arms and faces some were as gaudily clothed as dessalines but one slim giant wore epaulettes on a cord slung around his neck so that his torso was bare in the heat he displayed scars of an old whipping on his back they were still men like me i reminded myself savages we call them because their manners differ from ours old ben franklin had once observed indeed dessalines replied to my speech the whole world knows the importance of jeanjacques dessalines and men come to me now that i have power for only one reason the hope that i can help them he looked at me narrowly is this not true it would do no good to deny the obvious its true of me hmph he let his eyes roam the assembly keeping attention on his performance with the skill of an actor im told you were the last to speak to toussaint louverture i tried to rescue him but he was shot in prison yet he told you something a secret to my wife he was the first of the blacks but now he presides over his fallen brothers in guinea it is i dessalines who is first of the blacks now which is why ive come to you general but i only help those who can help me you and i can help each other the french have stolen his wife and son jubal spoke up he has reason to join us commandant indeed the general took up a french snuffbox a pretty thing of silver and pearl took a pinch of tobacco and sneezed revenge jubal said hmph the black leader pointed to a red and blue banner hanging from a tree in the middle was a coat of arms do you know what that is monsieur gage a battle standard its the new flag of haiti do you see what it is missing i glanced but shook my head im poor with riddles its sewn from the french tricolor but i had the white removed ah i hate whites white man i hate mulattos the arrogant gens de couleur who fought us and pretended they are our betters because of the lightness of their skin his eyes darted at some of the followers he had just insulted i hate the french i hate the spanish i hate the british and i hate the americans i and my slave brothers have been whipped and hanged by whiteskins for two hundred years i have flayed and burned and stabbed and strangled a thousand in return with my very own hands what do you think of that this wasnt going well despite my battles everyone seems more belligerent than me i cleared my throat i do not want to be number one thousand and one there was dead silence and i feared id said the wrong thing immediately hoping for a quick shooting over a slow roasting then dessalines abruptly barked a laugh jubal guffawed in relief and the other rebel officers joined too laughter rippled around the encampment as my joke was repeated women shrieking with the men i smiled hesitantly its always flattering to be the center of attention dessalines put his hand up and everyone instantly went silent again then you will earn your keep as every other soldier does in my army are you my soldier now ethan gage when drafted its wisest to make the best of things i certainly hope so i want to liberate capfrancois i tried to make my nervous smile broader straighten my shoulders raise my chin and otherwise mimic martial traits i support blacks and admire what youve accomplished and maybe ill let a white man help us finish should he prove useful here was my chance i can help you defeat the french fortifications he raised his brow how but if i do that theres something you must do for me as well my experience with tyrants is that they admire a bit of cheek so i mustered what courage i had bonaparte responded to my cockiness and sidney smith too you dare bargain with me dessalines glowered like a thunderhead the whites of his eyes had a faint yellowish cast and the pale underside of his fingers tapped the hilt of his sword with the rattle of drumsticks but my bet was that he was acting too im in pursuit of an ancient secret i proclaimed forcing my voice louder its possible that your people and only your people can help me if i find it we can share it and its so fabulous you can build your new nation with it im the key youll be greater than spartacus greater than washington greater than bonaparte i want to be an emperor and i can help make you one i could do no such thing of course but what happened after we found the treasure of montezuma was immaterial to me i needed to find the loot to bargain for astiza and harry and this brilliant megalomaniac was the path to it however this isnt a secret to share with an entire army and not something your military officers need know i glanced about me at his entourage of killers ill help with the attack on capfrancois i have a plan to breach their defense but before i do so i need to meet those hungars and mambos priests and priestesses who know the most about your gods and legends i need to learn what they know astiza had taught me the titles and i missed her desperately she gets a better reception than i do among strangers and notices details i miss be careful of our voodoo white man it has power that even we cant control i dont need power just legends then i can help you he bargains with nothing muttered the tall black cristophe dessalines glanced at him with respect in any card game theres a time to throw all in i need to meet with cecile fatiman i declared cecile asked dessalines how do you know that name shes a famous priestess jubal tells me a mambo yes a mambo from the very beginning of the revolt in boukman wood shes our wisest said to be more than one hundred years old thats who i need she foresaw my coming and my wife learned that cecile is led by the voodoo spirit ezili danto there was a murmur in the crowd at mention of these names i need to meet with mambo cecile tap her witchcraft and solve your problems and mine at the same time but what of the french defenses after i meet cecile ill be ready to help you surprise them chapter dessalines said hed consult with his officers about my request and encouragingly ordered jubal and me to have something to eat my big companion was even hungrier than me we were led to an elegantly carved table chipped and stained since it had been dragged from some mansion into the encampment in the wood there we were fed pig goat yams and fried plantain our water purified with liberated rum ive seldom eaten a meal more delicious but then franklin said hunger makes the best dish we were served by a striking young black woman whom jubal called cherie and slapped on the bottom with cheerful familiarity when i looked questioning he introduced her this is juliet my newest wife wife she shoved him i no wife to you you get a priest or a hangar if you want a wife you get me some money or a home commonlaw wife he winked when we win we make a home and the love you told me about i asked long time ago he threw down a rib bone and picked up another this american is famous girl he knows about lightning pah she looked me up and down he wouldnt last half a day cutting cane no white man can what is he good for then hes going to find us all treasure and then i can buy you that house pah you just proud to have a white man he be dead of the fevers by christmas she gave me a spoonful of mashed yam be careful jubal he keep you in trouble i relaxed on the theory that they wouldnt waste food on a man they were about to hang then i realized they might fatten a man they were about to eat and glanced about anxiously for a big boiling pot or roasting spit i didnt really believe rumors that the rebels were cannibals but who knew what their relatives had done in africa fanciful books were popular about that continent because the less authors know about a place the more they can invent everything id read about blacks had been written by whites and it was the most lurid and sensational pamphlets that sold smartest in paris id expected the slave army to be a ragged group of bandits and cutthroats but that wasnt at all what i found many of the men were in captured european uniforms and at various points in the war had benefited from european military drill many had the gazellelike grace i envied an easy athleticism but they also exhibited discipline they were organized into quite competent regiments with stern officers and regular practice they had dozens of pieces of artillery captured or bought and most had possession of a good musket bayonet and cane knife there was a cavalry bivouac nearby with a thousand good horses and the total size of the rebel force jubal confided exceeded fifteen thousand the blacks had been fighting the french longer than washington fought the british during our revolutionary war and perseverance is the secret of success they had the confidence that comes from many victories and the cunning that comes from springing clever traps more than just disease was defeating the french as i sipped fermented juices and calculated my own plans i realized that if i were to get any credit for their victory id have to scramble to get ahead of these natural warriors theyd win anyway but i had to convince them that some of it was due to me so theyd help me fetch the treasure that is if it even existed at all finally full i leaned back against a tree as the shadows lengthened and brooded my thoughts turning to astiza i knew it had been a mistake to allow my wife to be a spy but then she hadnt given me a whole lot of choice in the matter she was independent as the devil yet why had she gone off with leon martel had he recognized her after all could she not resist asking about harry had she struck a devils bargain choosing expedient alliance with martel and sure reunion with horus over dubious partnership with me and what was the frenchmans game was he tired of taking care of a little boy or was he upping the ante how could i make his greed a partner in my own cause my head ached my muscles were sore my skin bitten and soon i was asleep i was jostled awake near midnight the camp slept but some officers and sergeants wound through on various missions sentries stood and lanterns shone where dessaliness throne was perhaps the generals were still awake napoleons habit of sleeplessness might be universal among the bloodthirsty it was antoine whod shaken me when jubal came awake too he laid a hand on my comrade not you the american alone i got up clumsily in the dark disoriented what is it i still feared execution as a white man what you asked for be quiet and follow he led me through the rebel camp and sleeping soldiers without a misstep even though i could hardly see a thing he murmured words to the men standing guard and we came out of the woods and hiked into the cane fields there was starlight enough to follow the dirt lanes but i noticed the moon was waning november would soon have dark nights an optimum time for a surprise attack occasionally id hear a distant gunshot that habitual popping from armies close to each other we walked south and east farther from capfrancois the ground sloping downward and getting muddier against my bare feet more trees and then the humid rotting overhanging architecture of a swamp it was utterly dark but i could smell stagnant water and guessed we were somewhere near the river again mist curled moss hung like ragged curtains from the limbs and my guide whod not spoken another word took a lantern down from a tree and lit it the ground had become treacherous and this time our circuitous route threaded from island to island with occasional wades through short stretches of black swamp water i kept an eye out for caimans and water snakes and started at the sight of several logs and limbs antoine smiled when i did so his teeth a flash in the night there was the familiar chorus of frogs and night insects but it began to falter before another sound through the darkness came faint drumming in time with my own heart thump thump thump it kept pace with the tempo of our walk an echo to the mystery of life itself was this the way to cecile fatiman we walked in the drums direction the sound getting deeper felt as much as heard the rhythm was ominous where are we going animal eyes gleamed from the jungle watching us slip past on and on deeper and deeper the sound of the drums grew i shivered despite the warm humid air clamped like a blanket abruptly my guide stopped here he handed me the horn lantern go on yourself now what wait i glanced to where he gestured darkness was this a trap i turned to ask antoine to stay hed disappeared frogs played their noisy chorus insects whined in my ears overlain on this music was the rumbling of drums the solitude was daunting except i wasnt alone there was a figure ahead in the mist i now realized waiting for me i raised the lantern this new companion looked slight poised more than planted meaning more likely a woman than a man cecile her figure seemed too young so maybe just a guide i stepped off toward this new apparition she waited until i came near and then without a word led me deeper into the swamp elusive before i could make out her features the water we threaded past was opaque still as a well roots climbed out of mud like frozen snakes the dank smell was as heavy as the blood of birth yes it was a woman her grace over uneven ground uncanny and her speed outstripping mine her hood topped a loose shift of pale cotton and while it initially made her shapeless i now saw the swing of shoulder and hip there was something about the flow of her natural like mist water clouds the curl of a wave that convinced me she must not just be beautiful but beautiful in some ethereal unworldly impossibly perfect way i hurried to catch up to confirm this magic and yet she seemed to float effortlessly ahead of me receding like a rainbow i knew that if she left me id be utterly lost she pulled me like filings to a magnet now i was sure i was hearing the pounding of drums from deep within the swamp i was going i guessed to some kind of religious or political ceremony similar perhaps to the one in boukman wood that had initiated this revolution lightly this woodland sprite led me toward the noise slowing if i needed to catch up floating out of reach if i came too near i was sweating with excitement and apprehension who was she what you seek suddenly echoed in my brain we came to a clearing a small barren island of damp ground in a swampy wilderness in the middle was a small hut of thatch and sticks from which a single candle glowed my guide stopped at the far edge of this isle she pointed at the dim hut clearly i was to enter would she follow but no she dissolved into shadow and i felt intense disappointment i was left to enter on my own hesitantly i stepped forward set aside my lantern and stooped poking my head into the hut as nervously as if putting it under the guillotine blade the structure was as primitive as my mental picture of africa its dome a weave of fronds and rushes the floor was dirt the candle burned on a small altar just one foot high covered with a redcheckered cloth so i couldnt see whether it was made of wood or rock a goblet in the middle of this tabernacle held what appeared to be clear water and four smooth river stones held down the cloth at the corners on one side of the goblet was a human skull and on the other a scattering of flowers there was also a little heap of seashells well it was exotic but there was actually nothing more ominous about this collection than the display in a masonic lodge certainly i didnt feel the kind of religious menace id experienced with the egyptian rite the symbol for ezili danto is the redcheckered heart i looked into the huts shadows against the opposite wall floated the illuminated face of an aged crone her skin leathercolored in the candlelight her age was not evident in the creasing of her facein fact her countenance seemed remarkably smooth if mottledbut her long years were betrayed in the wispiness of her gray hair and eyes sunk like stones in dough their depths holding wisdom that comes only from time and hard experience her parted lips showed the tip of her tongue as if testing the air for scent like a serpent this i guessed was cecile fatiman the famed mambo of revolution im something of a student of religious symbolism my wife more so and the flowers ezilis she is flower herself the water purity of life the stones anchor the four directions ceciles voice signified approval she liked my curiosity and the shells cast to divine the future to see your coming ethan gage i crouched in the entrance not certain what i was supposed to do you didnt bring your sorceress wife with you she continued in her husky french it was half reprimand and half question the shells talked of her as well she was taken from me by an evil frenchman and now you come to us the white who needs the blacks yes im seeking information to win back my son as well the same information can help you you mean my people the revolutionaries of haiti you are cecile yes but of course sit she gestured to a spot near the entry the hut was no bigger than a small tent i crowded in and crossed my legs sitting my head almost brushed the rush dome the candle was red as blood the wax melting down the edges of the altar like rivulets of lava can you help me i asked perhaps the loa can help you you know what loa are gods or spirits they speak to believers then i will try to believe im not as good at it as my wife the loa speak through the power that animates all true religions do you know what that power is seeker faith love the hardest thing to earn and give i was silent only love has the power to ward off evil without it we are damned now drink this she handed me a wooden bowl filled with cool liquid that smelled rancid it will help you listen and see what is it wisdom white man drink i sipped confirming its bitterness i hesitated do you think wisdom should be sweet she asked what you seek i shrugged and downed it all almost gagging what choice did i have there was no point in poisoning me they could kill me in a thousand simpler ways they might drug me but for what so i swallowed gasping its taste of bitter vines cobwebs and grave liners i grimaced and handed the bowl back she laughed softly half her teeth were gone are you really more than a hundred years old i asked fighting back bile a slave has no name of her own a slave has no birth of her own a slave just is so i count my age from what i remember the french say went on in the world as i grew yes i see more and remember more than anyone i go back a century maybe more she laughed softly again my stomach lurched and settled i began to feel drunk but in a very odd way my body tingled not unpleasantly but unnaturally and the candlelight oscillated yes drugs i would see loa all right was that the intention im looking for stories about a treasure you may know about but only to share after using it to win my family back i had to work to sustain my concentration if you help me your people can keep the loot before the british or french get it you can build your country and i will help you take capfrancois from rochambeau what treasure montezumas she smiled if i knew of treasure wouldnt i have it by now she cackled at her own joke her face seemed to melt and reform in the candlelight i saw now that she was a round woman well fed swathed neck to ankle in a patterned dress colors muted in the dark her nose was flat and wide and her nails long on fingers as gnarled as driftwood i dont know i felt confused louverture told my wife a secret the british believe your people may know more i only hope you saw toussaint alive i saw him killed i was trying to rescue him he was very sick napoleon killed him she turned and spat into the dirt a dark glob that suddenly seemed as menacing as serpent venom a man like napoleon he accumulates many curses great men attract great enemies she drank from the bowl herself slurping gave a sigh and put it down dragging her hand across her mouth and what did louverture tell you ethan gage the loa said you would come to us from across the sea with word of our hero toussaint my tongue was thickening from the drink that the emeralds were in the diamond she frowned disappointed i do not know what that means my own spirits dropped i was sure you would youre the wisest mambo there are stories the escaped slaves who hid in the jungle are called maroons and there were always tales that some of them had found a great treasure and hid it for reasons unknown but no one remembers where it was stowed and no one has ever mentioned a diamond no treasure has appeared louverture was sick could he have been raving she considered then shrugged but the loa the spirits they know you want to understand what louverture told your wife american of course then come you must dance with ezili danto the dark seductress of wood and water chapter i backed out of the hut and cecile ponderously followed she picked up my lantern and waddled toward the sound of the drums once more i followed she was as sure as my other guides in twisting through the maze of land and water but much slower and she stopped sometimes to wheeze insects droning in time to her breaths i waited uneasily feeling id been brought on a test not an invitation the wood throbbed with sound i feel things watching us i said just baka she dismissed small monster small what they watch in the night diab too devils dont let them take you and how am i to do that stay on the right path you are in haiti now what you seek i followed so close her skirt brushed my ankles the forest seemed malevolent as if id stepped through a portal into an underworld id sense something watching or creeping and whirl around but there was never anything i could see cecile cackled softly i finally spied firelight through the leaves and i knew we were coming to the source of the drumming our damp trail broadened to a beaten lane bordered by two rows of poles like lampposts i glanced up at what i first thought were flowers or ribbons decorating the posts tops but no black roosters dangled upside down the throats of each one neatly cut and drained the poor will eat tomorrow cecile said we entered an openair church the swamp trees a cathedral wall the ceiling a coneshaped thatch roof at this peristyles center jutting toward the roofs peak was a stout phallic pole fifteen feet high at least a hundred people lined the periphery of this temple focused on the pole the way a philadelphia congregation would be focused on an altar a fire pit illuminated dark faces the celebrants swayed to a mesmerizing drumbeat the music came from four male drummers opposite our entry their instruments flared at the top narrow at the bottom and made of hide stretched over jungle wood other musicians had flattened bells bamboo flutes and wooden triangles the rhythm pumped like a heart now you see voodoo said cecile this is the oldest religion it comes from when man was born she took a gourd shaped like a rattle and shook it and i could hear seeds inside this is an ason i must consecrate this place for ezili she moved around the perimeter of the peristyle acknowledging the greetings of robed worshippers by shaking her instrument while they bowed they set a beat with their feet the ceremony as electric as if charged by the generator id once built at acre the air itself seemed to prickle my own senses were heightened as if i could hear distant whispers and see in the dark cecile accepted a pitcher of what i assumed was holy water this was offered to the four compass points and then poured three times once at the post once at the peristyles entrance and once oddly at my feet was i some sort of sacrifice cecile spoke in slave creole the crowd answering and i followed only a few words sometimes i thought i heard a name of one of the voodoo gods that astiza had mentioned to me memories of old africa scrambled with stories of the catholic saints mawu bosu damballah simbi sogbo ogu the old woman stooped stiffly and began sketching patterns on the dirt floor if communion is designed to bring christ into the souls of its participants i guessed these drawings were designed to bring voodoo gods into the assembly just what i was doing here i still didnt know but the drums were slowly accelerating the swaying of the celebrants becoming more pronounced finally they began to dance and chant moving in a circle in serpentlike undulation they sipped from bowls as i had and responded in chorus to creole calls from cecile the dances were stately and intricate not savage or erotic and choreographed as carefully as the cotillion id just seen in the government house of rochambeau black hands tugged at me and i hesitantly joined the circulation not dancing exactly but swaying as best i could feeling clumsy and conspicuous my companions however smiled at my attempt another bowl was offered and i drank the bitter broth just to be polite i found the taste not quite as acrid this time but my mouth was growing numb i was thirsty and drank more time ceased or rather my perception of it id no sense how long we danced except that it seemed both a moment and an eternity and the melody permeated so deeply that i felt myself becoming music the noise was a bridge between our realm and the supernatural and did indeed invite spirits from another world the crowd suddenly parted as if pushed by an invisible force and a new figure stepped onto the stamped floor of the temple i stumbled and gaped it was my earlier hooded guide the elusive woman of the swamps except that now the hood was down and her luxuriant dark hair cascaded to her waist she stepped toward the central post with the grace of a doe eyes large and dark lips sensuous neck high gaze transfixing there was something animal about her human but wild uninhibited skittish ezili the crowd murmured she could not really be a goddess it was a young woman playing the part except that in my inebriated condition she did seem to float instead of walk and glow with translucence instead of blocking the light when she reached out to touch the central pillar a spark seemed to flash between flesh and wood and i jumped i was transfixed hypnotized reason gone and emotion roaring women as jubal had observed make me stupid this creature put her back to the post and rotated her head to smile at all of us but especially me at least i thought her attention was focused on me i gaped trying to remember dignity astiza was beautiful but this woman was beyond beauty she was luminous as a madonna polished as a marble saint delicate as venetian glass her complexion was mulatto but with a golden tint reminding me of amber or celestial honey its flow somehow explaining the languid precision of her movements all her features were perfect in an almost unnatural way which attracted and repelled at the same time ezili seemed like an idol forbidden to human touch her smile was dazzling and when she lifted her arms above her head and planted one foot on the post to lean back the pose lifted her breasts arched her back and emphasized her unworldly sublimity where had they found this damsel but perhaps she really wasnt a girl at all but truly ezili in the flesh or at least ezili as i might imagine her after three bowls of ceciles broth i couldnt look away now her shift seemed artfully draped by an erotic sculptor toga folds as light and fine as spider silk the drums grew louder damballah the crowd gave a shout that was almost a sigh and i startled to see a snake slither into our gathering no one jumped away the serpent was thick as my arm and longer than my body but undulated across the dirt toward ezili as if trained like a pet her eyes gleamed welcome and its tongue flicked in and out i glanced at cecile the tip of the mambo s tongue was between her lips damballah blesses us with his visit she shouted the snake seemed to have no more fear of people than they had fear of it and came on toward the woman at the post as if to squeeze or devour her i was transfixed horrified fascinated would no one rescue the beauty but no ezili stooped held out an arm and the snake slithered up as if climbing a tree limb the congregants moaning in appreciation woman and animal entwined the snake curling around her shoulders its diamondshaped head dipped as if to explore her torso a tableau both revolting and erotic damballah says it is time ezili told her audience in a clear commanding voice men stepped forward took the serpent from her and carried the snake back to the surrounding jungle with reverence befitting the ark of the covenant they dropped the reptile into foliage and it swiftly slithered away now there was a squeal and a scrabble of small hooves a black pig was dragged into this jungle church straining against a red leather rope the animal was scrubbed clean as a cat its tail and ears tied with ribbons the eyes were wide as if guessing its fate its body heaving ezilis eyesand thats how i thought of her now ezili danto the loa the compelling beauty goddess of the voodoo worldshut in welcome the pig skidded into the designs cecile had drawn to call down the gods and the old woman waddled forward with a bright steel knife she called to the congregants their chorus chanted in reply call and chant call and chant it was a sacrificial song now the goddessgirl was holding a silver bowlwhen had it been brought to her and when cecile bent to expertly slit the animals throat the assembly roared and sang ezili caught the arc of blood in her metal receptacle and when the spurt subsided and the pig lay in the dust with the tired dignity of sacrifice i thought she lifted the bowl high and danced a twirl as spritely as an irish jig the haitians raised their own arms and whirled to mimic her then she brought down the crimson liquid and cecile threw in herbs salt and a hearty splash of rum ezili danced around the edge of their church with this pagan communion some dipped fingers in the bloody broth and sucked them dry while others scooped up enough to paint a cross on their own foreheads it was blasphemy and yet blasphemy synchronized with the lifeanddeath truths of our earth like the symbol of wine at communion blood was sprinkled on the post on the trampled designs and on the instruments of the musicians bright droplets flung from ezilis fingers she laughed as she danced i was the last to be served the goddess twirled and stopped before me hair and dress settling as she posed she gave me a seductive smile eyes probing what was i supposed to do but i knew what and as she and everyone else in the assembly watched i dipped my fingers and sucked the blood as the others had done it was salty fiery with rum and the herbs made my vision waver even more the congregation roared the drumming grew even louder and then i was dancing round and round the periphery with ezili not touching her but somehow turning with her as if the drums of africa themselves had instructed me in the dance i was hopelessly drunk by her beauty and wondering if id just become damned cecile suddenly gripped my shoulders her old claws strong as talons the answers come from her monsieur she whispered fiercely i want her im terrified of her you must follow her to learn what you want to know what you seek without conscious decision i trailed ezili out of the peristyle and into the jungle moving as if in a dream once more she floated ahead but never so far that i couldnt keep up my pursuit she led me from swamp into low jungle hills farther and farther from the drums up along ridge crests and down into small ravines her gown aglow like fairy light as i followed i sensed another presence as well predatory and looming this wasnt the devils id sensed with cecile before but something huge dark ill intended it was stalking me its breath hot except when i furtively looked around i couldnt see its eyes or anything else only feel it in my imagination it was not an animal that tracked me but a man a sorcerer a loa unshakable as a shadow or the guilt of a horrible secret i whirled about again and again but nothing was there at least nothing that i could see the forest shut out the sky i had no sense of stars moon or direction i hurried after ezili panting now her dress had become almost transparent accentuating every curve of her body i dimly remembered i was married and that i was here for my wife but could no more stop following this apparition than i could stop breathing what was i thinking nothing at all the drumming of the ceremony had grown so faint that it was overtaken by a new sound pouring water ferns six feet high were a door that ezili pushed through i followed into a grotto of cliffs a phosphorescent waterfall dropping thirty feet down a fernfuzzed cliff into a pool of dark water now i could see stars thousands of them reflected in the waters mirror it was cooler here the air moist and she stopped at the edge of the pool and turned to me this is our sacred spring what do you want to know ethan gage her voice was like music mine was a croak it was difficult even to remember my question what is the diamond i finally managed did it even matter i could feel the manbeast behind me crouched in the shadows come and i will tell you her clothes slid off her body without a touch she was of course perfect but so flawless as to seem eerie forbidden her form was regal her skin what we lost in eden and her breasts belly thighs and dark triangle all hopelessly seductive she was sex incarnate i groaned with lust and longing ezili waded into the water the ripples seeming to reflect her flowing form her posture as graceful as a swans neck i stumbled forward like the fool i am all sense gone my mind as engorged as my erect member the dark thing loomed high and dark behind and over me but if i could only reach and fuse with ezili it would leave us alone wouldnt it she was a goddess a loa every dream every fantasy the enchanted water was midway up her thighs accentuating the nudity of what was still visible wait i gasped i reached to strip off my clothes she smiled the smile of a seductress and then i lurched to a stop blinking astiza the name exploded into my muddled consciousness like a shattering of glass i staggered my god i was married and not just married but melded to the mother of my son the most wonderful woman in the world an epic beauty in her own right i had taken vows i had grown up suddenly i felt sick it was as if a blow hit my stomach and i groaned leaned and heaved vomiting up the noxious stuff id tasted so that it splattered all over the water it smelled vile ezili watched me despoil her pool with disdain i stepped back emptied ashamed confused my body shaking with illness and humiliation her seductive smile vanished and with it her luminescence the pool had gone dark the reflected stars winking out shed become a silhouette the waterfall was merely a line of gray in the dark had i offended the supernatural whats the matter she asked across the water watching me with a cool objectivity she was still achingly beautiful but something had fundamentally changed i could not betray my captive wife and with my resolve a spell had been broken im married and im trying to save my wife i cant do this it is your choice to seek and resist me im sorry for what i just wanted an answer to louvertures riddle her head rose slightly and she looked at me squarely the diamond is in martinique what the diamond she repeated slowly is in martinique how will i find one diamond in an entire french island it will be right in front of you ethan my mind was whirling the dark shadow arched like a cloud ready to pounce but furious at being suspended ezili receding had i made an irrevocable mistake or saved us all but how could emeralds be inside they carry the curse of montezuma her voice was distant now theyve carried death for nearly three hundred years are you ready to risk for astiza for my son she was becoming insubstantial but will you save her something evil potent with malevolence reaching for me wait please she was fading like dreams at dawn strength ethan but if you choose wrong what you most love will be gone forever wait a frozen coldness brushed my cheek a touch clammy as death but it didnt seize hold it was like the scale of a caiman the slither of damballah the cold steel of the french guillotine and then gone retreated i staggered to the bank a drunken man looking into the most profound darkness id ever seen what wrong choice could she mean then i fainted chapter i came to with what i thought was wind in my ears the blades of the great mills of antigua churning fragments of nightmare then i realized i was hearing water and feeling sunlight i winced squinting up there was a dome of sky above the pool where id followed the goddess ezili trees all around a bright green well bright birds sang and flew in paintbox colors flowers curled like little gold trumpets ripples radiated out from the falls in bands of silver an enchanted place with no enchantress groaning i sat up the beautiful woman was gone leaving behind a sense of gaping relief and irretrievable lossof temptation id never be offered again i felt hollowed id also i believed passed a test and in passing it somehow saved myself that dark presence waiting to devour me had gone my head ached instead of swam but wait someone was present stiffly i turned on the muddy bank sitting on a stone was cecile fatiman old rotund and serene you drugged me my mouth was cotton my cheeks still numb i showed you the opening she smiled the gaps in her teeth making her seem more matronly in daytime and less devious i hallucinated i thought i was following a woman here you followed ezili she does not lead just anyone she liked you white man a loa she is not could not be real cecile said nothing she was too perfect to be real cecile still said nothing groggily i took stock my clothes were damp and dirty my face covered with stubble my stomach was too queasy to feel hunger i did feel fiercely thirsty so drank some from the clear pool cecile kept watching me what are you doing here i finally asked deciding if you are a zombi she said matteroffactly the word had a feeling of wickedness about it and for just a moment the jungle seemed to darken i remembered that hideous spirit whats a zombi people risen from the dead or rather never dead at all i was puzzled like lazarus no you dont want to meet the zombi they are cursed slaves of their masters the magic priests known as boko the boko give a potion to their enemies that make the enemy lie as if dead the enemy is buried then the boko dig out the grave and revive the enemy but only as the zombi the living dead who must serve their master instead of returning to guinea for reunification with their ancestors the zombi is an eternal slave trapped in haiti no revolt will ever free them it is a curse far worse than death your drink was a zombi potion i was appalled and more than a little offended no and apparently you did not take what was offered a boko followed you and ezili did you lie with her no of course not im married faithful the newly reformed ethan gage she disappeared cecile regarded me with dubious surprise ezili is not accustomed to being rejected im not accustomed to turning a woman like that down maybe theres more strength to you than i suspected white man i think your loyalty warded off the boko ezili wouldnt let him touch you because you didnt touch her the loa she protect you saving you for something else but shes a jealous spirit and there is always a price then im not a zombi still foolish perhaps but not stupid like the zombi they have slack mouths vacant stares and clumsy walks they are ugly and smell of the grave you not that bad i take compliments where i can it means the loa have greater uses for you which will surprise dessalines you did not impress him but now perhaps he will take you into his army did ezili solve the riddle for you im begging you to clarify that woman was not really ezili was she cecile said nothing regarding me with mild impatience she was i mean how could that be you did not answer my question she told me to go to martinique that i would find the diamond that holds the emeralds there i dont even know what that means and even if i figure it out it means going to a frenchcontrolled island and trying to wrest a treasure from under their noses while rescuing astiza and harry i dont know if i can do that without help then you must ask for help from dessalines will he care about my mission if you care about his i still didnt have a comprehensible answer to the riddle of the jewels that the dying louverture had given my wife but i at least had a new destination and i hoped new allies my thought was to persuade jubal to come with me to martinique but to get his loan from the rebel army i needed to make partnership with dessalines so i returned to the black generals camp explained in private the treasure all sides were after and asked for men to help find it this black king had given me opportunity by sending me to cecile fatiman now i had to make best use of it this is a very colorful tale you tell dessalines said eyeing me shrewdly aztec emperors lost jewels and flying machines some of it must be true im not that imaginative i do not believe it true but i dont believe it untrue either i dont have much confidence in your courage ethan gage but i sense an instinct for survival that sets some men apart i can only spare you soldiers after i take capfrancois and force out the french ive received word a british squadron is approaching to blockade rochambeau and an attack on land could decide the issue to which side are you actually allied that was the question wasnt it to whichever side helps me get wife son and emerald which is your side now and i must succeed before british and french catch up to me he nodded ambitious men understand expediency you promised an idea of how to surprise the french lines and you must first help me win my battle before i help get back your wife or son otherwise its easier to impale you on a pole and plant you alive and screaming for your mother in front of the french fortifications this will demonstrate what will happen to white men when we finally win your shrieks would dampen their morale i think he suggested this alternative rather matteroffactly in thinking back to forbidding acquaintances such as the egyptian rites alessandro silano djezzar the butcher the warrior chief red jacket or pasha yussef karamanli the one thing that unites them is an appalling indifference to my health there seems to be a discouraging correlation between power and ruthlessness my instinct for sympathy probably disqualifies me for high command i couldnt bring myself to execute as many innocents as seems to be required i am however a clever adviser with no desire to be left on a stake i will win your battle or help win it at least with a scheme that will crack the french lines and bring an end to this war but i am a white man so you must promise youll let the defeated french flee once they give up they dont deserve to escape what they deserve is irrelevant if cornered they will fight even harder he considered then nodded i might let them go if it saves the blood of my people but how do you propose to win the siege when my entire army cannot with an idea from my threeyearold son and i explained in detail what i intended to do chapter two storms gathered before the morning of november one was the tower of rain cloud building on the horizon a roiling interplay of sun and impending shower the other was the final approach of the black rebel army toward french lines it was a human tide that couldnt be disguised cane fields were trampled as regiment after regiment moved into position cannon were hauled temporary breastworks built shot stockpiled and bivouacs pitched the french were equally busy and through a glass lent to me by a negro officer i could see the bustle of a defense readying against attack bugles called earthen redoubts were heaped a little higher in hopes that a last spade full of dirt might stop a fatal bullet more tricolors were raised to snap in the tropical wind to convince those charging that they faced impossible odds cavalry rode importantly about on both sides to advertise menace with the thunder of their hooves french artillery fired ranging shots to reinforce their point dessaliness cannons barked in reply this pawing and snorting reminded me of stags in the dust and heat which know that the key to any fight is not just to rip the throat but to open the gut of churning fear on the other side war is bluff shock surprise desperation and scarcely contained panic precipitating more panic was my job while the armies postured i prepared to lead a night march in the hours before the final attack jubal antoine and a dozen handpicked comrades would follow me to the left of the rebel lines toward the mountains that anchored the french flank we deliberately kept this party small a large black force could be spotted and ambushed as it slowly climbed the tangle of jungle that matted the hills around capfrancois but my doughty group would trot in bare feet without a firearm among us so that no gun would accidentally discharge and give us away instead we were equipped with captured cutlasses and plantation cane knives dessalines had decreed me a captain and offered a pair of bloodspattered epaulettes that i declined but as their leader i was armed with a spear it was an african weapon the rebels had forged with a tearshaped spearhead as long as my forearm that was attached to an ironwood shaft our forefathers used this against the lion dessalines told me had to get rather close didnt they they smelled its hot breath i prefer to use my brain in fact i was inclined to leave this prehistoric baggage behind but jubal persuaded me that it was foolish to go into battle unarmed and that the spear made a rather convenient standard walking stick tent pole and mark of authority the spear seemed entirely savage but once my hand closed on the polished wood i did feel rather fierce this was the first real weapon id possessed since losing my rifle in tripoli and it fortified my confidence the way a primitive might have felt when going up against one of jeffersons woolly mammoths the former slaves seemed to regard it as a badge of rank signifying the trust dessalines had placed in me and followed my lead without complaint i was so unaccustomed to this most of the time no one listens to me at all that i was rather excited theres definitely a thrill in being warlord so we waited until the dusk before the battle then set off even with sunset my squad was soon panting and sweating we each had a thirtypound black powder keg strapped to our backs another reason not to risk firearms lest one set off a barrel of gunpowder and turn us into a chain of eruptions and when game trails turned the wrong direction we had to hack at foliage to get through the jungle for refreshment we had calabash gourds carrying water cut with mobby that bitter brew fermented from sweet potatoes the drink eventually made some of the men want to hum and jubal had to hush them since its a danger to be too jolly when sneaking about id also brought a flask of rum a swallow of which i shared with each man to keep up morale jubal was our guide once we reached the mountains he knew the trails like a puma leading us up a twisting ravine where a tropical creek cut through the ferns with a steady murmur that masked our footfalls it was so dark under the trees that i could barely make out my guides broad back so i stopped us had a volunteer tear his ragged white shirt to shreds and tied one on each gunpowder barrel so wed keep the man ahead in sight jubal retained the lead antoine the rear and i marched in the middle we slipped scrambled and stumbled admirably any curses in english french creole and african were kept under our breaths higher and higher we went the trees dripped and steamed from earlier showers and i could hear wild pigs grunting and moving out of our way i thought again of lurking devils but the superstition seemed silly when i was sober of voodoo drugs and banded with a group of soldiers we stopped periodically to listen for french patrols or to spy the light of a sentrys pipe but we seemed to have this world to ourselves none of my men was allowed to light a cob lest we blow ourselves up or give ourselves away so i just watched the whites of their eyes as they tilted their heads back to enjoy their mobby while they said i glowed like a ghost the hike seemed to be taking forever i want to climb above the french lines not crest the alps i complained to jubal wiping at my sweat mountains are steep in haiti yes and muddy infested with vermin feral livestock and sharp thorns well crest a ridge soon and come down where we need to be dont worry monsieur ethan jubal knows the mountains dessalines preaches that a drop of sweat can save a drop of blood im sure thats true but were doing the sweating and saving him the blood my companion laughed id rather have our sweat than his worries finally our route leveled at a crest and a welcome breeze blew off the caribbean we were above the french stronghold the dark sea beyond as id planned there was no moon and only a few lights shone in distant capfrancois i could also see the low campfires of the french line to its east if my calculations were correct we were above the dell where id climbed with colonel aucoin to see his redoubts and water supply now i was going to use this geography to help end the war the night was already half gone and we didnt have much time to implement my scheme wed best hurry your army will attack at dawn yes but were already atop the french like an ax poised atop a block jubal said with satisfaction and these boys are hard workers arent you my uglies they grinned a dozen crescent moons in the dark good i replied otherwise were all dead descending was easier on the lungs though harder on the legs and we quickly heard the murmur of another stream and broke out of jungle wed come to the small mountain pool in that cup of hills on the heights before the stream dropped to water the french we crept along the creek like panthers then the smallest and quietest of us a former slave named cyprus volunteered to scout ahead we waited silently for ten minutes trying to ignore the mosquitoes until he slithered back to report six soldiers four asleep and two on guard at the lip of the stream half a dozen cane knives came out from sheaths no sound jubal reminded from them or you i swallowed this was war at its closest and most horrible the assassins crawled ahead with us bringing up the rear for a reinforcing rush if needed i feared gunfire shouts and struggle instead the silence was profound we slunk along the pool until we were at the lip overlooking the french fortifications id heard nothing seen nothing but six severed french heads were lined up next to the stream outlet like a row of melons their eyes were shut as if relieved it was over where the bodies went i never learned very fine jubal complimented i tried not to identify with the pale skin taking a shaky breath now like beavers we must dam the creek as vigorously as my son did in france whats a beaver i was at a loss for its african equivalent like an elephant i finally said those beasts built things too and harry had watched one work in tripoli whats an elephant these former slaves had apparently never seen one of those creatures either in haiti or in africa what zoology did we have in common a beaver is a hairy very hardworking mule i described come lets drag this wood and we set to work as industriously as my boy chapter sunrise came from behind dessaliness army shining in the face of the french given our height above the impending battlefield it was in our view before anyone elses i watched the battle of vertiers unfold as if studying the diagram of a military textbook columns of soldiers moving like arrows on a map some black some white the purpose of my dam was twofold one was to cut off the flow of water to the garrison below indeed at first light there were shouts of surprise when the soldiers watering pond began to drop a company of infantry was roused and began climbing laboriously up toward us to investigate why the stream had suddenly gone dry we had to finish before they got in musket range or wed all be killed our second objective was to create a timely diversion wed turned the lazy stream pool into a substantial reservoir at our altitude by dragging logs and rocks cutting saplings and hurling mud now we took the kegs of powder and strung them along the dams base each with a jutting fuse we had to surprise the french lines below at the precise moment when dessaliness best regiments were prepared to storm the defending redoubt my plan was to send a flash flood into the enemy rear just the way harry and i had broken our own dam at nimes enjoying the havoc it created by swirling away leaves sticks and insects astiza had shaken her head at our excitement i watched the reservoir fill enjoying my own cleverness with the satisfaction of a child the blacks lay on the crest of the dam watching the french climb toward us between each was a severed head my men had arranged them like trophies recalling the worst days of the terror back in paris i suppose we should prepare to light the fuses i told my band i was so slathered in mud by this time that we looked identical a dozen grubby grinning beavers or mules the reservoir would soon top our dam and threaten to wet the powder kegs i felt in my vest pocket for a tin id brought with some coals and brought it out with some tinder id carried from camp i frowned the tinder was soggy the tin was cold in my enthusiasm for dam construction id failed to remember i was getting quite wet water and mud had penetrated the ventilation holes of a coal tin id neglected to nurse thanks to enough swigs of mobby and rum i opened the container my little bit of fire had gone out i looked at it stupidly well hell i was a threeyearold indeed i cleared my throat now who brought flint and steel jubal and his companions looked at me blankly lots of steel ethan he said no flint a pistol then we could use the flash of its pan you ordered us to leave all the guns back at camp i suppose i did i was thinking furiously the weapons of the french sentries you told us to throw them in the water to avoid any discharge that is entirely correct i have been very careful to keep us quiet as mice i realized i hadnt thought the contingencies of my plan entirely through which is a habit of mine perhaps i should start writing things down then i thought of a trick fulton had told me phosphorus anyone who they one of my doughty dam builders inquired id experimented in paris with a phosphorus bottle one uncorks the airtight container inserts a splinter and the chemical ignites when lifted into the air quite magical ethan theres no phosphorus in the black army jubal said you are correct a pity some of the men can make fire with sticks splendid it takes about an hour antoine amended hells bells at one time id helped find a gigantic ancient metal mirror capable of setting whole ships on fire and now id dragged a magazines worth of powder up a mountainside with no means of setting it off we did have steel but we were on a slope of wet clay i sent men scurrying to find a stone capable of striking sparks but the clinking and scraping was futile i had as much chance of striking fire in this mudhole as finding dry kindling in a downpour i wished my genius had more consistency down below the company of infantry climbing toward us had stopped to take a breath wary at the odd noises coming from above they shouted for their sentries but of course there was no reply we watched them take their muskets off their shoulders then their officer snapped a command and they came on again wary but determined meanwhile dessaliness column was almost at the end of the ravine ready to attack if the sun climbed high enough to light their position a single cannon loaded with grapeshot could sweep the defile like a hurricane halting the rebels before they got started unless we provided a distraction think ethan think what would ben franklin do by failing to prepare you are preparing to fail he used to lecture me with his annoying homilies he claimed id inspired at least half of them this couldnt be true but it got his point across about my dubious character what else what else hide not your talents they were made for use whats a sundial in the shade sundials sun the sun of course i had more than one venerable philosopher to draw from archimedes had built a gigantic mirror to harness the sun in a terrifying way and perhaps i could use the same idea to set off my kegs of black powder the tropic dawn had cleared the mountains to the east rays striking brilliantly where we stood fortunately i still had the magnifying glass id bought to confirm the emerald that i would inevitably retrieve from martel once i had my hands around his throat sometimes it helps to be prudently greedy in our scramble for sparkinducing rocks jubal had hunted up some dry firewood from the underside of forest logs now i directed him to put it where i could use my glass to focus the dawns new rays the convexity of the aperture may focus the radiative effect i told them importantly not certain what i was saying myself when playing the part of a savant its best to be as incomprehensible as possible they looked impressed while i fumbled meanwhile i could hear the advancing infantry shouting to one another below as they climbed toward us we had nothing to slow them down they were just a hundred yards away in the trees i took the glass oriented it to the tropical sun and concentrated its light tense with impatience its not true that time is constant depending on ones circumstances it crawls like misery or spurts like passion it races through a spring day and drags through a sick rainy one now it seemed almost to stand still as i waited for the duff to smolder me groaning that the sun wasnt already higher and hotter and wondering if this would work at all clouds were climbing too building on the eastern horizon what if they blotted my light source the wind was rising hurry hurry wrap my spearhead with dry fronds like a torch i ordered with a mutter as we waited douse it with the rest of the rum if this works well use it to ignite the fuses the blacks nodded they actually thought i knew what i was doing an eternity passed as we heard the clank and slap of equipment as fifty frenchmen labored up the hillside toward us they draw closer ethan my companions lay while the water of the creek crept steadily toward spilling lapping their bodies when when when how could i have forgotten something so elementary as nursing fire after sweating for hours with a barrel on my back first id lost a son then a wife and now apparently common sense it had been a hectic week but id not entirely lost my ingenuity the tinder began to smoke damballah do not forsake us jubal prayed and finally a snakes tongue of flame get off the dam i warned the french saw movement and a shot rang out from below i could imagine heads turning on the redoubts from where regiments waited for dessalines puzzled by this disturbance in their rear perhaps it would alert the french to surprise from their front the whole assault was about to be put in jeopardy by my stupidity your torch white man they handed me the spear its head wrapped with fronds and wet with fiery rum i dipped it into my tiny fire and it flared theyre lining up to shoot one of the rebels called i turned to our dam the water was at the brim kegs poised below fuses poking like wheat stalks and down the slope more than two score men gave a great shout at the sight of me standing up with my torch they knelt pointing their muskets up the mountain it was suicide to leap down in from of them to light the gunpowder but this was all my idea wasnt it i looked at my companions no slaves anymore to do the dirty work only me and the need for rash courage so i jumped and swung my makeshift torch its smoke leaving a trail in the air as it swooped to touch the first barrel with a flash and hiss the fuse ignited gunshots cracked i sprang to the next keg and it lit more shots and now i could hear bullets whapping against the mud of our dam a sound that had become disturbingly familiar in recent days thank goodness they had inaccurate muskets instead of precision long rifles water began to dribble down the dam face running toward the explosives hurry ethan jubal called what the devil did he think i was doing three kegs then four five a rattle of musketry a bloom of smoke from the french volley rising prettily into the dawn light fuses burning merrily and sending up their own plumes me bright as a coin in the sun shouts now up and down the main french line far below i was scrambling like a target in a shooting gallery across the face of our dam lighting each gunpowder keg madness ethan the first be burning down jubal warned men were charging toward me now bayonets fixed as they struggled up the steep slope an anxious lieutenant waving his sword in my direction they were shouting warnings about the powder kegs and clearly meant to put them out wed no weapons to fire back so i turned and hurled the spear a fiery meteor giving a grunt like an african warrior the young officer was only yards from me face red with exertion his eyes went wide at my missile what did he think in his last moment thousands of miles from france half his companions dead from yellow fever his commander a cruel lecher and a black army pounding on his garrison doors and now a flaming spear thrown by a mudsmeared lunatic a line of smoldering powder kegs and the heads of six sentries on the crest of the dam gaping sightless in his direction the spear struck and the man gave a cry his sword arcing harmlessly across the air spinning like a windmill blade then he somersaulted back toward his comrades my primitive weapon in his breast i scrambled to one side of our construction and noticed that the day had abruptly dimmed the clouds id seen earlier were continuing to mount the sun was already winking out it was sheer luck id had light for my glass the first keg erupted the others went off in a chain like fireworks a rippling explosion from one end of the dam base to the other mud and sticks blowing out toward the advancing infantry in a great gaping gout of woody splinters then the rest of the structure and its severed heads collapsed and thundered down on the attacking infantry like an avalanche skulls bouncing and after it came a wall of water the blacks were whooping while the water roared and became a chaotic slurry of mud trees and foam the tide caught the slowest victims and snatched them with it as livelier soldiers sprang out of the way on the redoubt between the cane field ravine and the camp reservoir gunners turned and gaped the unleashed waters poured down the mountain and crashed into the encampment sweeping up tents scattering screaming horses and roaring across to dash against the backside of the earthandlog redoubt like a breaker artillery was abandoned as soldiers ran in both directions to escape the punch of the cascade the flash flood didnt break the redoubt but briefly topped it and then left a tongue of wreckage from the base of the mountain to the french front line everything was in chaos then came the charge the coiled serpent of blacks that had been creeping forward in the ravine gave a tremendous shout that echoed across the battlefield and punched toward the confused gap in the defenses it was a column of steel bayonets gleaming and then a ripple of brighter light as they shot a volley there was a bloom of smoke the answering fire was fierce and both black men and women fell like scythed sugarcane the attackers simply charged faster surging up against the french their leader francois capois that keg of energy id seen at dessaliness headquarters led them through a hail of bullets while waving a sword his horse went down and capois sprang up another bullet took his hat off when a haitian banner fell he scooped it up waving it high to rally his men and women hundreds of rebels swept the french lines and i could hear the great shout of their valor from my high perch on the mountain they came on so recklessly that some of the astounded french actually applauded there was still chivalry in then the former slaves surged over the battlements in a great dark wave lifting high those redandblue battle flags with the white cut ominously from the middle they butchered with bayonets and cane knives seizing cannon and turning them on their foes their column spread out along the french line to flank it musket and artillery fire rose to a crescendo gaps were blasted in the attacking ranks in return whole lines of bluecoated napoleonic infantry were cut down id made a temporary diversion and the rebels had taken full advantage the overwhelmed french were ebbing toward capfrancois and the interior emergency lines theyd dug there but i knew wed checkmated their last great garrison the fort at vertiers had the height to command the eastern approach to the city and the rebel guns would soon breach the final french line the fighting was desperatemy view was soon obscured by huge rising thunderheads of gun smokebut the ultimate outcome was no longer in doubt rochambeau was finished i saw dessalines surveying his assault with the calm of a bonaparte seated on a rock and taking snuff as columns of cheering troops trotted past him real clouds were joining the plume of powder and as if an answer to the clamor lightning flashed and thunder growled i felt like a god on olympus ethan get back jubal jerked my arm and a bullet whizzed past the french company climbing toward us had been decimated and disrupted but the bravest were still shooting determined on revenge i took one last look at the chaos wed caused everywhere the rebels were sweeping forward tricolors falling and haitian banners lifting up then the skies opened and rain sluiced down flashes of electricity announcing a change in the world as white fled from black in a moment we were drenched our view of the chaos lost as if a curtain had been drawn we retreated into the jungle chapter our flight was brief the french infantry surged over the lip of land where the dam had been halted to shoot a volley into the jungle and waited for return fire that might show where we were when we declined to oblige they prudently retreated their army was pulling back and they didnt want to be cut off we watched them from the ferns your loa ezili protects you jubal congratulated even though youre a madman word of my strange sojourn with cecile fatiman had spread like a contagion what did you do to her for such favor nothing i said i followed her but then i remembered my wife and the loa vanished although cecile suggested she saved me from becoming a zombi as usual i dont understand a thing that has gone on man is not fated to understand anything important especially about women my companion philosophized theyre as mysterious as the wanderings of the stars but you are lucky perhaps i said were going to win my friend which means i can follow the clue that ezili gave me will you come to martinique with me to rescue my wife and son and hunt for treasure if you have the loa s favor yes youre foolish enough to be interesting i was heartened jubal was the best ally i could imagine as sensible as i was sly i feared what martel was doing to my wife and son and needed all the help i could get our companions believe in you too he added id need them all to win through on a frenchgoverned island by the time we cautiously crept back to the overlook we were behind the lines of dessaliness triumphant army thousands of rebels were digging new precautionary trenches in front of the inner line of french defenses while hundreds were turning captured cannons around and bringing up field guns of their own the blacks had the high ground and rochambeaus strategic position had become hopeless i looked out to sea and realized it was filled with new ships since id fled the city with jubal a fleet had arrived if the vessels were french my enemies my ability to stumble from side to side surprises even me might hold for a time if english it was over lets get down to dessalines i said i need a spyglass we descended to the usual butchery of a battlefield blood staining the mud puddles left by the downpour wounded crawled and groaned spouses and partners who followed the army and came to look for loved ones discovered and wept soldiers deafened by muzzle blasts bled from their ears its corruption ive grown familiar with made tolerable only by victory we skirted the french dead one i saw with sadness was colonel gabriel aucoin shot through the breast and trampled in the charge his last expression was sardonic my betrayals had not saved him corpses from both sides were being dragged for quick mass burial before becoming bloated in the heat operations for the badly wounded were performed by bloody machete in the same brutal way as lovingtons sugar mill a swift chop that was perhaps in its speed more merciful than the surgeons saw however some crawled off to die rather than face the steel despite our diversion the charging blacks had suffered several hundred dead and wounded the heap of choppedoff arms and legs was a more powerful testament to their courage than the later medals would be the dark flesh stacked like a cord of wood i watched rochambeaus manhunting dogs being executed in their cages the rebels firing muskets into the yelping animals with glee then the doors were opened so wild pigs could gnaw at the remains dessalines himself was at the highest point of captured vertieres dressed in martial splendor he was soaked from the tropical shower but with his bicorn hat with black plume goldbraided uniform and french cavalry boots he looked as magnificent and ruthless as the mameluke warriors i recalled from egypt he gave crisp orders to a legion honed by a dozen years of war i was about to witness a historical first the complete triumph of a slave revolt louverture was being avenged spartacus would be envious i waited for a moment between messengers and then pushed my way congratulations commandant monsieur gage he said you waited until the very last moment to spring your surprise and i confess i feared youd deserted us but finally the flood came as the christian god promised noah we had to wait for god to get the sun high enough to light our tinder he took his own sweet time im afraid we almost had no sun at all providence gave us just enough i decided to omit my lack of more reliable ignition methods but he guessed my character anyway you gamble monsieur i improvise its a fault im working on well victory is ours british ships are offshore rochambeau is as trapped as cornwallis was at yorktown my new nation will be born much as yours was well pay back the french they have centuries of crime to answer for id expected this response the problem with being mean as the french overseers had been is that sooner or later your victims learn that same meanness and give turnabout what terrified the french was that they were about to experience all the tortures theyd invented first our savior hoped forgiveness would prove contagious but so far ive seen little sign of it people return the worst not the best and the habit makes me gloomy the likelihood that id helped enable a massacre didnt appeal to me either maybe you can let bygones be bygones i tried the general looked scornful when did they ever offer that to us yellow fever has taken all the collar out of them you know that its not like the french army hasnt suffered cornwallis was allowed to surrender with honor if all white men are as meek as you its no wonder they are losing perhaps i will not stop with haiti maybe ill take my army and conquer the world you wouldnt like most of it europe is cold and drafty america too louverture could tell you if he was still around he scowled and i decided the sooner i left haiti the better given the color of my skin if those are british ships let the english do your work for you i argued you can no doubt take capfrancois but if thousands of whites are faced with extinction theyll fight to the death and take many of your soldiers with them if theyre allowed to flee to english ships youve won your cause without more bloodshed saintdomingue becomes free without stain on its honor foreign nations will recognize your nation more quickly he considered vengeance is so tempting you become not just a liberator but merciful i continued a hero in the salons of paris an example to the english parliament a partner to the united states dessalines the just men will salute you women admire you i suppose temperance is the mark of great men he said it with considerable doubt benjamin franklin thought so he was my mentor you know something of a nag but sharp as a razor but this negotiation must be my idea not yours of course it must resound to me not you i am utterly obscure it must be negotiated by someone the whites would trust and yet is entirely expendable since i dont trust rochambeau not to seize any messenger and disembowel him in full view of my army he is rash venomous and wicked villains recognize each other the way dogs do a scent i dont care for the fellow either yes hed come to a decision the man to negotiate the french evacuation monsieur gage is you t he trouble with offering advice is that theres a danger people will actually accept it so i found myself in the broiling noontime sun planters hat off marching with white flag between two embittered armies i estimated that at least ten thousand muskets were aimed in my direction from all points of the compass i thought the disemboweling idea was a real possibility since the last time id seen general rochambeau id interrupted him in midcoitus throwing a meat cleaver at his head while he fired a ball at me best to keep to myself that the diversionary flood was my idea and that id been tangled up in voodoo haitian goddesses and the severing of french heads for display on a makeshift dam diplomacy like romance is simpler when the other side doesnt know everything that is going on i hoped that the last few days of excitement might have caused the french general even to forget who i was but he recognized me with that baleful expression typically reserved for tax collectors naval press gangs or mothersinlaw i gave back as good as i got still smarting from being a potential cuckold even if rochambeau hadnt apparently actually lain with my wife hed certainly wanted to and had misplaced her in the process we met at the base of his last redoubts our conversation was blunt the traitor and assassin ethan gage dares return he began to save your lecherous hide how could you desert to the blacks and participate in their butchery how could you stalk my wife and pack her off to a ship with your pimp leon martel i gave back having failed to rape her are you prostituting her instead how dare you insult my honor monsieur and how dare you general i realized this kind of acrimony could go on for some time so i tried to move things along its plain enough to all your soldiers how god has rewarded your crimes and if you dont listen to me they as well as you will pay horrifyingly a cluster of colonels drew nearer at these words rochambeau looked volcanic but he was also trapped and knew it if ethan gage was his only chance of escape it wouldnt do to spit me on his sword he swallowed rage with difficulty and stood taller is dessalines asking for terms his guns command the city his troops are poised to initiate a massacre not only against your men but against the citys women and children with all the cruelties youve taught him black africa is at the gates general waiting to take revenge i let this work a moment on his officers imaginations why are you here then rochambeau asked grudgingly to prevent further bloodshed dessalines is offering you the opportunity to evacuate by british ship if you promise that france will leave saintdomingue forever we are at war with britain as well but i am not as an american im the only negotiator fit to shuttle between the three sides you may despise me as much as i despise you but if you confirm the location of my wife and son ill talk the british into taking you all off and saving your miserable life better captivity with the english than revenge from dessalines am i not correct there was an audible rustle and sigh from the officers around us they heard reprieve and looked at their general with expectation rochambeau squinted at the sea if he acquiesced to sailing with the british hed almost certainly become a prisoner of war but he could save ten thousand lives by doing so the first decent thing hed done in some time he still hesitated as if weighing which was the better path to honor finally he scowled very well very well what where are astiza and horus a tiny child that your monster of a criminal has kidnapped now there were some gasps from the assembled officers who knew nothing of this rochambeaus face darkened with fresh embarrassment but he also decided to try to turn it to advantage fortdefrance in martinique he said shortly an admission that he did know about my wifes abduction sent there for their own safety you imbecile to protect your wife from her sorry excuse of a husband he turned to his men this idiot wanted to drag her into the jungle with the blacks and we all know what the result would have been i however saw she wore a medal of trust from bonaparte and was determined to save her french chivalry protected her from american recklessness now they all looked with rebuke at me the truth was i had rather fumbled the governing of my family i decided wed both said enough and returned a contemptuous silence which was enough to make the assembly wonder which version of events was correct when i didnt reply rochambeau plunged on yes you can thank me for safeguarding your family meanwhile well row you out to the british to end this bloodshed bonaparte will hear of your treacheries and i will go down in history as the savior of the good people of capfrancois he turned to his officers i will be recorded as a hero youll see i nodded agreed and i want a letter of introduction to the governor of martinique chapter i ll admit that once i was a few yards offshore i had an overwhelming desire to cut and run finding passage to martinique with the british and leaving dessalines and rochambeau to their own devices i desperately missed astiza and harry saintdomingue would have a troubled future after the apocalyptic war and i knew the final evacuation would be chaotic and heartbreaking the french creoles whod been born on the island and invested their lives in saintdomingue would finally have to give up on what would become haiti exiles from all theyd known id be delayed waiting for the surrender and transition to play out but i also knew that as a gobetween i might save a few lives besides if i earned dessaliness satisfaction i dont think i could ever count on his approval or friendship he hated my race too much id have the help of jubal and his men in fetching my family and give a little payback to martel so i boarded the british flagship and informed its commander that without firing a shot he could offer refugees the transit that would finally rob france of what had once been its richest colony the french have lost to the slaves he seemed dumbfounded not just lost but are in peril of their lives accordingly a combination of british warships and french merchantmen closed with the harbor to take on the defeated the evacuation began in good order demonstrating only the absurdity of what people try to save they came to the quay lugging oil portraits of ugly ancestors tarnished tureens a pet goat a trunk of theatrical costumes cases of spirits antique dueling pistols hat boxes silverware freshbaked loaves more than two feet long voodoo carvings silver crucifixes and an ornamental saddle little ones clutched dolls and toy soldiers mothers peered into their own cleavage to doublecheck the safety of jewelry temporarily deposited there and men patted jackets to confirm the presence of coin or currency rochambeaus officers and english ensigns organized them into lines weeding out the most ridiculous heirlooms one family trundled a harpsichord down to waters edge and for a while the mood was of shared hardship and goodwill but as dusk fell and wine cellars were liberated both french troops and civilians got drunk and looting began in abandoned corners of the city as the waiting rebel army saw disorder black soldiers began filtering into capfrancois to join the pillage fires started and ignited panic a queue quickly became a mob some longboats swamped and had to be righted and the last crammed french ship set sail so anxiously that it hit a reef and began to sink its occupants had to be offloaded to another english vessel i was amazed there was not more rape and murder given the conflicts history at my advice dessalines kept a stern rein on his men to avoid a retaliatory bombardment from european ships on board the vessels was chaos as an escaping throng squeezed between guns pushed into sail lockers and tucked under longboats even madmen were evacuated from the citys asylum and chained to a gunwale raving in the confusion mothers sobbed children wailed dogs barked and army officers climbed aboard with pet monkeys macaws and parrots the vessels were so jammed that some of the baggage was heaved overboard by impatient sailors a few blacks fled as well as whites some servants refusing to abandon their masters and some whites and mulattos chose the risk of staying ashore but the overwhelming effect of the surrender was a final division of the races the ships their decks crammed with pale faces visibly settled in the water some quarterdecks were so crowded that the helmsman could scarcely turn the wheel the vessels did not so much sail as lumber out of the crowded harbor on shore the paris of the antilles newly renamed caphaitien smoldered as night fell the victors rejoiced and danced in the streets with that rhythmic energy id seen in the jungle burning homes threw lurid light on the celebration there was a pungent smell of smoke gunpowder from shots fired aloft in victory rot from broken larders and roast pig goat and chicken cooked in street bonfires i saw a few white and mulatto faces but they were rare and subdued watching the slave army from the shadows with apprehension impatient as i was i knew better than to approach dessalines at the height of his triumph he was preoccupied with organizing a nation i applied for an appointment at his convenience and remained at my inn since there was no one left to collect rent the general didnt even enter the conquered city until november i finally got to see him the following afternoon where he reigned in the ballroom of rochambeaus government house looking weary but grimly powerful the western half of hispaniola finally his he had a steady stream of visitors seeking promotion trade or redress of grievances on a long table to one side of his desk aides kept tally of what had been captured and lost officers bustled in and out on assignments to put capfrancois in order again and newly appointed ministers began forming a permanent government i realized i was witnessing something akin to the start of my own nation thirty years before i should have taken notes had i pen and paper but no i was impatient to find my family not play historian i congratulate the new spartacus i greeted after waiting more than an hour past my appointed time i have exceeded louverture and shall crown myself emperor the general pronounced napoleon himself could not stand before me napoleon was five thousand miles away and rochambeau had been no caesar but i knew better than to amend this selfassessment i changed the subject i did what you asked to help win our victory and now i can do even more for haiti i said all governments need gold maybe i can find some those legends you spoke of lend me jubal antoine and a few companions and ill search for the treasure of montezuma ill split with your regime and finally retire from public life you want my help to search for your wife and son of course then haiti has given you sense perhaps family is worth more than baubles this was a pronouncement spoken loudly enough so that all in the hall could hear it loyalty worth more than fear i understood the need to express such sentiment he was a new moses for a new kind of country but a bloodyhanded moses with a dozen years worth of enemies waiting for him to fall somehow he had to establish an ethic and i didnt envy his power or his responsibility then i can have your men to go look for my loved ones and the relics that maroons are rumored to have hidden away if my men will come back youll look where martinique the loa told me my enemy leon martel has gone there perhaps we blacks will rise in martinique next let me have a look around first he waved me away our interview over you should be sailing already next part iii chapter t he ruler of france and his wife both came from island colonies bonaparte is corsican the real spelling of his name italian and his heritage is of roman generals and renaissance plotters martinique the island of josephines birth childhood and the place where i hoped to bargain for my wife and son is languid paradise under the slow match of a volcano the island rears out of the caribbean like an emerald dream its northern half summiting in smoking pelee the isle is more dramatic upon approach than antigua atlantic breakers crashing on its eastern coast and turquoise caribbean shallows lapping its western beaches plantation homes climb lush slopes to make a checkerboard of white and green and french ships huddle for protection from the british under the guns of lavastoned fortdefrance on the islands principle bay after the horror of haiti the island looked entirely serene from the sea but i knew my little company of negro warriors couldnt simply spring ashore and ask for the address of leon martel theyd freed themselves and thus were the worst nightmare of the ruling whites on this island my black platoon included the cheerfully practical jubal the logical antoine and six other negroes hungry for more adventure and a glimpse of aztec gold excitement is addictive we sailed from capfrancois with a dutch trader looking for a hire that would keep him a safe distance from british forces assaulting his own nations islands the caribbean sugar isles changed flags as frequently as a courtesan changes clothes as rival fleets swept in and out on the trades guns thundering and marines sweeping ashore our vessel was the coastal lugger nijmegen with two masts a small cabin that the captain mate and i slept in as segregated whites and an open deck where jubals comradesonce they got over seasicknessmade a comfortable home under an awning rigged from a damaged sail captain hans van luven was dubious about having a negro cargo not in chains but he soon discovered that my adventurers who paid in advance with dessaliness captured coins were better company than cranky europeans they were also willing to help tack reef and anchor its as if theyre as human as the rest of us he marveled we were two weeks scudding down the leeward islands to martinique at the northern end of the windwards anchoring each night in a different bay on a different island and avoiding any sail we spotted now we were at an isle where french power was still intact our plan was to round cap salomon south of fortdefrance bay and put ashore at one of the coves on martiniques southern coast on the charts a valley led from the village of trois rivieres north toward the main settlements and i could skulk along this for more information before presenting myself to governor michel lambeau with rochambeaus papers finding my wife shouldnt be impossible astiza is the kind of woman whos noticed and unless shed been entirely hidden away gossip of her would filter into all corners of the island then fortune provided even more clarity as we tacked southeast toward our goal i noticed a peaked volcanic rock two miles offshore of martinique it was shaggy with shrub and reared almost six hundred feet out of the sea its summit came to a point and its entire architecture was quite imposing the monolith visible for miles it overlooked the sealanes toward the island of saintlucia to the south we kept well clear in case there were fringing reefs the gibraltar of the caribbean i commented idly or the prick of agwe the god of the sea jubal said if so he must be looking at ezili antoine joined in more like a diamond yankee our bearded captain replied look at it sparkle in the sun for a minute i let that comment pass by and then suddenly it jarred my slow brain diamond i sat straighter looking at the rock from the facets of the cliffs le diamant thats what the french call it it can look like one in bright light after a rain that rock is called the diamond didnt i just say so i felt a chill ezili had prophesized that the diamond would be right in front of me are you sure read the chart american my luck had turned are there caves in that rock wouldnt be surprised but i dont know anyone who goes there unless they want cactus and gull guano no water and no worth now martinique in contrast has a resource most beautiful women in the world one of them captured bonaparte i understand josephine his wife yes the crafty creole must have been a prize actually he was poor and she was desperate i said with the authority of knowing them both her first husband had just been guillotined social climbers the pair and they calculate like an abacus made for each other i suppose josephine is six years older but understood paris society she is pretty or perhaps i should say charismatic though her teeth are bad it must not be her teeth he was interested in she was the more worldly of the two at least in the beginning she netted his ambition like a fish and now she sits on top of the world you cant tell me gage that the whole stinking mess of life isnt chance piled on circumstance multiplied by calculation and divided by luck therere a thousand women ashore lovelier than josephine ill wager but what does it matter when god rolls his dice im looking for just one woman my own wife stolen by another man ja now theres trouble ran away from you eh and youre asking for more trouble to land with these blacks slaves from haiti your reception will be torches and pitchforks id been pondering that we need to camp quietly not parade into port how much do you want for your longboat there and some fishing line for expenses dessalines had given me some money looted from capfrancois being a dutchman captain van luven named a price double the crafts real worth you can be fleeced in new york or shaven in amsterdam done i said since it wasnt my coin and food that was triple done again work in close at dusk and then well launch your longboat the blacks will put me ashore and what about us ethan jubal asked i anoint you free fishermen plying your trade around diamond rock that may be where toussaint louverture the black spartacus himself told us to go i landed on martinique armed but not with something as conspicuous and primitive as a spear my work at negotiating the evacuation of capfrancois resulted in the rebels awarding me a pistol powder ball officers sword a dagger sheathed under my coat in the small of my back and a tiny gambling pistol tucked up one sleeve if i discovered a blunderbuss on this new island id buy that too i expected i might have to shoot my way to success my little company came ashore by moonlight on a beach of sand as fine and white as sugar it glowed the lapping water phosphorescent we slept by the sigh of the sea as the dutch vessel tacked for cartagena the next morning i directed jubal and his team to make a secret camp and discreetly scout diamond rock fishing to supplement the provisions wed purchased from the sharpfingered dutchman meanwhile a twohour hike down the shoreline took me to a plantation its lane and then a road and i soon hailed a passing cane wagon and begged a ride the slave teamster had no objection to my company when we came to the first village i paid two francs to switch to a swifter and more respectable carriage explaining i was a frenchspeaking american dropped rather abruptly by a dutch vessel fleeing a british frigate i said i was making my way to fortdefrance to discuss business opportunities that had arisen with renewed european war and showed my papers from rochambeau since the united states made good money selling to belligerents on all sides this explanation was readily accepted by days end i was in the islands capital a place immeasurably gayer more prosperous and crowded than capfrancois some haitian refugees had come here and inns were crowded nonetheless i bought my way into the best hotel had a bath and the finest meal since id left paris and sent word to the islands government house that i was an american trade representative with french papers requesting to see governor michel lambeau there i would inquire about beautiful but distressed greek egyptian females accompanied by a disreputable roach of a man who thieved other mens belongings and kept small children in bondage if martel was a criminal why not get french help in tracking him down id settle accounts and then search diamond rock a letter came directing me to call on the governor at halfpast ten and i brushed out my coat and trousers as best i could but when i came onto the dazzling street palms waving in the breeze i was quickly accosted by a tall thick ruggedly built european with tropic tan whose eyes darted as watchfully as a reptiles he was dressed in dour black was poorly shaven and had teeth the color of rancid butter his smell made me instinctively pull away he gripped my wrist and hand with both of his own a fierce familiarity i didnt expect his smile broad but not friendly its ethan gage is it not do i know you monsieur we met in paris i looked him warily up and down in nitots jewelry shop you knocked me over and broke the nose of my employer that got my pulse up my other hand went to the butt of a pistol and you missed me with your shot if i recall ive found it works well to practice otherwise the target survives to possibly shoot back the rascal leaned close perhaps well test that someday i warn you ive the protection of the governors of saintdomingue and martinique rochambeau has capitulated but not lambeau here he shrugged im not here to harm you but involving officialdom would complicate our cooperation at this stage my employer wishes to extend an earlier invitation hed not dropped my hand theres no need to draw your weapon and even less choice since i have friends who at this very moment are aiming at your head theyd shoot you down before you cocked a hammer i resisted the temptation to glance about trying to look calm even though i was sweating your employer is the scoundrel martel the french patriot leon martel a sharp a rogue and a ruffian ambitious expedient and bright hes been waiting for you and invites you to dine with him at his chateau in troisilets that gutter thief has a chateau friends in high places including lambeau and he has a woman and child he thinks youd like to meet so much simpler than audiences with governors that raise awkward questions so i didnt have to find satan but merely wait on him at tea hes imprisoned my wife and son au contraire hes their host while theyre grateful for his hospitality theyre also quite impatient for your arrival everyone needs you to start start what find what were all seeking together so we can all take what we need he finally dropped my arm one thing we can agree on youre as greedy as us chapter we walked with two of his companions past the massive basalt walls of fortdefrance and down to a dock with ferry once aboard brawny black oarsmen rowed us across the wide harbor to the village of troisilets which looks northeast to the rest of martinique my escort who introduced himself as the ravenspies apparently get to adopt dramatic nicknamessaid that josephine had grown up in this suburb and that some of the islands finest families lived there theyve been urging their native daughter to explain to her husband the necessity of sustaining slavery and believe shes had some success yes bonaparte believes her which has meant slaughter in saintdomingue like martel this rogue favored black for his fashion as did his poorly washed companions the costume is damnably hot in the tropics but looks appropriately intimidating raven seemed ridiculously pretentious to me so i thought of him as crow and his escorts as vulture and buzzard all three could use a preening martinique will never be allowed to become haiti crow said as we rowed it was said with more hope than certitude revolutionary fervor does not apply to the black man here martiniques slaves will decide that we make freedom more costly than servitude with torture and execution violence monsieur is the price of prosperity there was a carriage waiting crow gave me a little history of this island as we clopped into the lush vegetation of fig and gumbo trees the road like a green tunnel that glowed with light martinique had developed in much the same way as antigua but with a french flavor the abundant mountains and rainfall meant waterpower took the place of windmills here slaves sugar fever and caste up that lane is where josephine was raised he pointed shes quite the social climber as able as nelsons emma hamilton bred born and trained to it there are no politics more cutthroat than island politics im not surprised that a creole and a corsican rule revolutionary france islanders are survivors we went two miles beyond and came to a gracious chateau in the french style not as imposing as lord lovingtons mansion on antigua but with more grace artfully planted trees created a cascade of flowers on the periphery of lawns and the place had the heady scent of hibiscus orchids and oleander cedars soared in back of eucalyptus and chestnut trees everything swollen by the humid climate to gigantic size banana leaves were as wide as windmill paddles vines hung like cables on an opera stage bright as a convention of cardinals were the flame trees a riot of red against the cream of the house this was astizas prison it looked just like the place id dreamed of retiring to we dismounted and walked up a gravel drive then crow stopped short gesturing for me to wait and a little figure ran out from the gardens he spied us stopped considered and hesitated like a fawn my heart lurched and i fell to my knees to put us nearer in height harry he looked skeptical recognizing me and yet trying to file me with proper memories its papa i was wounded to have to remind him its all right horus astiza called i looked past my son she stood by a red anthurium pretty as a flower in a white french dress her safety and her beauty and poise was a relief that was also startling id expected my family to be manacled to a dungeon wall but they looked turned out for an italian holiday had they negotiated some weird parole harry finally came cautiously over to me looking serious as only a threeyearold can look when something of uncertain gravity is going on he studied me for any changes i missed you harry are you all right clearly he was which was selfishly disappointing id expected a blazing rescue of distraught prisoners mama said we had to wait for you i want to go home my god how the heart can careen in ones chest crashing from rib to rib with longing and remorse i want to go home too wherever that was will you play with me its boring here of course ill play with you my voice caught as i spoke can you show me your favorite place theres a pond with fishies then lets catch one i stood one minute gage two more of martels ruffians appeared and a gang surrounded me i was humiliatingly relieved of pistols sword and knife while my son watched then they stepped back a few minutes to demonstrate our goodwill crow said but hurry martel is waiting ive been waiting for six months dont begin our partnership with a poor attitude partnership everything is different now different as twins by my eye this bunch were evil as the diab of the woods of haiti and uglier than zombis risen from the grave the henchmen watched sourly as my family reunited astiza kissed me quickly and whispered im sorry but i had to go to him while harry pulled my leg with impatience ill explain more later she said the fish were skittish so we made some boats out of leaves and set the flotilla sailing above the carp then crow said time and astizas hand slipped from my fingers as if i were hot make a bargain she murmured why didnt you wait for me at the ball he promised me horus we knew youd come there were old stories from martinique so he told me it must end here then they led her away i stepped inside the mansion looking for a weapon to slay leon martel but there was nothing of course and i was hopelessly outnumbered i was ushered into a room by half a dozen bandits and two women who i assumed must be the pimps whores were shown a back door had he raped my wife there sat martel smug as a cat with cream his nose satisfyingly bent but the firm set of his features giving him an aura of command this kidnapper of my wife and child smiled as if we were old friends which was doubly annoying i certainly didnt trust him and he was a fool if he trusted me martel gestured to a chair monsieur gage at last its been far too long sit sit after your long journey i confess i doubted your pugnacious reputation and yet here you are bright as a button and taut as a bow after the battle of vertieres and the sack of capfrancois please relax you deserve it word is that you helped negotiate the citys surrender saving countless lives it must be splendid being a hero a feeling youll never know your manners he winced i had correspondence from our defeated army and was told youre not shy about calling people unkind names even general rochambeau in front of his officers its a wonder you havent been killed in a duel or shot by a firing squad men have tried its much easier to be polite i only say what is true if honesty offends you youll be upset all day martel sadly shook his head we started poorly in paris i should have believed you were the ignorant halfwit you claimed instead of continuing to try to drown you but my nose hurt very much from the size of it i shouldnt wonder despite that i took splendid care of your son care as his jailer am i a better father to horus than you i contend ive spent more time with him than you have his entire life and kept him closer and safer your wife whom ive also treated with propriety tells me you didnt even know youd spawned him left him alone in a ship of barbary pirates and dawdled in paris to play diplomat instead of giving him the security he deserves bastards get better treatment than your boy youre in my debt a better father how i longed to kill him easier to be polite martel my voice had low menace he leaned back in his chair in a show of easy superiority happy to turn his monstrosities around his mother elected to accompany me rather than you so theres intelligence on that side of the family we relaxed while waiting researching history martinique is in the legends you know now here you are no doubt with information that will leave everybody happy youll get your family i the treasure and france the ancient aviation secrets of the aztecs he had the cheek that came from having me outnumbered a dozen to one and i was half tempted to start my own war right there but that would gain me nothing id endure him until i didnt have to how can i trust you he spread his arms expansively a gesture of generosity how can you not when ive yet to kill you lets start with my emerald but of course hed expected this and the devil hauled it out with the aplomb of catherine the great tossing it at my feet like a worthless pebble im not a thief monsieur gage the hell you arent i only borrowed it to encourage our partnership then return it like a borrower if you want manners at that we stared like rival lions its amazing what the eyes can convey contempt from martel and hatred from me hatred and a stubborn determination that our partnership needed to be modified in the extreme starting now or by god id throttle him then and there and punch in his throat before his bullyboys could get me off him satisfyingly i finally saw the scoundrel drop his eyes and nod crow reluctantly came forward picked up the emerald and handed it to me with more grace without a word i reached inside my shirt and hauled out the same magnifying glass id used to ignite the powder kegs at vertieres taking my time i studied the gem remembering its beauties as vividly as the charms of my wife so untrusting martel said it was the same stone i pocketed the jewel finally a start you know where the remainder of montezumas treasure is he asked i know where it may be he smiled then lets go look france and america united just as soon as i have my family back and your agreement to a third not all of whatever we find i actually had no intention of giving him any of the booty except maybe an aztec jade dagger to his heart but i needed this manipulator just a little while longer if i could bundle astiza and harry to jubal and his men wed shuck these french criminals and the british entirely restore some of whatever we found to dessalines and keep a generous share for ourselves id retire a gentleman after all this was assuming the hoard existed your family will be reunited monsieur when we have the treasure you will have the treasure monsieur when i am reunited then im afraid were at an impasse except that i already have your family while you as yet have nothing he looked at me coolly ive returned your gem as a gesture of goodwill ive presented your wife and child unharmed you must extend courtesy to me tell me what you know and ill release them napoleon sir would hold you in contempt for such blackmail he shook his head no man is more practical and ruthless than bonaparte if were being honest here i considered if i shared what i guessed about diamond rock there was nothing to prevent martel from shooting me keeping my wife and selling my child actions i was certain he was perfectly capable of yet he was right i didnt have anything to exchange for them yet since you want a pirate pact ill comply i said loot for family but im going to test what i know with my own companions not yours if i find something im going to trade part of itnot all of itfor my family i want the flying machines if you harm my wife and son you get nothing if you try to betray me you get nothing if you bungle a discovery that could cost napoleon the chance to cross the english channel and conquer england bonaparte will have you shot be very careful leon martel this was the kind of thieves bargaining he understood and if you find nothing you do not get your family he countered if you dont share with me the secret technology of the aztecs i will kill you myself if you take your secrets to the english bonaparte will make you a hunted man no matter where in the world you flee be very careful ethan gage we stared again and with that monsieur i believe we have established an excellent relationship he finished id like a word with my wife not possible shes a very clever woman and quite impatient by now im relying on her to interpret what clues you find or what the treasures mean let your desire to talk to her spur you on the sooner we have the aztec treasure the sooner you reunite if you touch her ill destroy you i dont need your woman i have many of my own he sighed as if exhausted by my distrust i want another kiss from her then i said stubbornly and a hug from my son i wanted but could not admit it to be reassured i wanted love shed left me in capfrancois to go with this monster im afraid not au revoir monsieur gage poke about as you wish with what you know and come back when youre ready to consummate our alliance treasure has a way of bringing people together chapter d iamond rock le diamant looked lonely and somber when jubal and his men ferried me out to its imposing bulk scrub and cactus clung to cliffs spattered with salt and guano the caribbean heaved uneasily against the rocks base the sea making a sigh like a giant sun and cloud wrestled for control of the sky looks as impregnable as the pyramids i said jubal looked at the sheer cliffs empty like the desert we had the place to ourselves submerged volcanic reefs surrounded the monolith so ships steered clear seabirds wheeled around this gibraltar as if playing sentry undersea gardens of seaweed undulated in the shallows time had carved caves into its flanks but there was no easy landing place we can anchor in the lee and swim ashore jubal said the boys here will remain in the longboat and pretend were fishing wear some shoes those cliffs look rugged shoes are for the white man i grip with my feet so i plunged in with boots and jubal did not the sea was a delight soothing as a bath and i wondered again at doctors abhorrence of it i bobbed a moment feeling buoyant of care then i remembered what i was here for and we swam i timed a swell let it pitch me toward a shelf of basalt and clung while it receded then i heaved myself up jubal following i balanced in my boots on narrow ledges while he wrapped his feet as adhesive as a limpet a rather awkward place to secrete a treasure i said yes and it sticks up like a flag my companion observed not secret at all maybe ezili meant something else was i mistaken no she knew this would draw me we clambered about looking unsuccessfully for hiding places and then slowly worked our way to the top clutching rubbery vines and resting on outcroppings there were several small caves in the monolith shallow and weatherbeaten but none gave sign of occupation the recesses were barely deep enough to provide shade let alone hide the riches of montezuma the top of diamond rock was roomier than it appeared from the sea with a craterlike depression that held a pool of rainwater a shelf gave just enough room to camp but there was no sign of excavation hidden hatchways or secret doors the view was magnificent martinique soared into tropic clouds in hazed green glory surf prancing on its headlands parts of the caribbean glittered where shafts of light from the broken overcast turned patches of sea silver at six hundred feet elevation we counted several sails that had been over the horizon at sea level the rock gave command of the southern approaches to fortdefrance like an eagles nest one vessel a warship by the look of her was trimmed as if to go into fortdefrance and i had a boys delight in looking down at her like an eagle when harrys bigger ill bring him up here you have to get him back first and persuade his mother he wont fall straight down the deep blue of ocean turned to sapphire and turquoise mingled with the shadow of submerged rock our little longboat bobbed like a toy yet the monolith seemed as impregnable as the great pyramid had been which id penetrated only with astizas help there wed found an underground lake a sluiceway and jubal what about an underwater entrance a cave american a submerged sea cave leading perhaps to a grotto inside that would make sense as a hiding place wouldnt it only if you can get in and get back out weve both proven we can swim with caimans and cannon fire he smiled i prefer not to jump from here no lets pick our way down and spy underwater we used the longboat to circuit the rock looking for likely spots but nothing was obvious we finally anchored again on the southeast side in an area id judged promising from above it was spotted with submerged outcrops and the sea seemed to undercut the rocks base ill try first i dove opening my eyes in the salt water and being startled by the clarity it was like looking through bottle glass my first three dives yielded nothing just a maze of underwater rocks and ravines with clean sand on the bottom but on the fourth i spied triangularshaped darkness and as i neared a current swept me forward as if toward a drain i caught the face of rock at the opening hesitating huge sea fans waved in the surge total blackness beyond the emerald is in the diamond that promise didnt prevent me from being wary i kicked for the silvery surface i found a cave but ive no idea where it goes the current wants to suck you inside let me try said jubal i can hold my breath a long time you might not be able to get out he outwrestled a caiman once put in antoine we werent sure who was drowning whom then tie a rope when you need to come back give a tug and well haul you to the surface jubal nodded knotted a line inhaled several deep breaths to fill his lungs as deeply as he could and went over with a great splash we played out the hemp our boat rocking gently on the surface i counted two minutes went by then three i began to worry surely jubal couldnt hold his breath this long was he dead i waited for a tug but none came four minutes impossible maybe we should pull him in i muttered a rebel named philippe put his hand on my arm not yet monsieur that jubal he know what he is doing so we waited me fearing my new friend was drowned finally there was a tug urgent and insistent i hauled as frantically as a fisherman whose net is full jubal burst the surface to blow like a whale grasping the gunwale a moment to rest water beaded his head like diamonds mon dieu where did you go the current captured me whoosh poor jubal was carried like a leaf so i felt frantically upward and finally there was air i came up all breath gone and was in some kind of cavity with a crevice giving dim light its small no treasure but the water still goes somewhere too far for jubal so finally i had enough breath to dive again but now i cant swim against the current so i tugged and you pulled it sounded like a death trap but also the kind of place you might hide something not easily refound by poseidons lungs how the devil can we follow the cave to its end we needed robert fultons plunging boat the nautilus but of course id managed to help sink that submarine in tripoli harbor its hard to plan for all contingencies we need a way to take our breath with us my black friend said and then it came to me a solution as simple as jubals canoe just as harry had made me think of dams and destruction my companion made me realize we could make do with a much cruder submarine i think i know a way to get in my friends i dont know about getting out ah it sounds like an ethan gage plan my doughty platoon looked at me as if i really was a savant and i congratulated myself for a moment on my cleverness then a geyser shot up not a hundred yards from our anchored longboat and following close was the crack of its cannon echoing across the water we whirled in alarm that warship that wed spied from the summit wasnt making for fortdefrance it was bearing down on diamond rock flying not the french tricolor but the union jack of the royal navy what the devil the british had nothing better to do than shoot at a rowboat of negro fishermen who are they antoine asked the enemy i said except when theyre friends which i suppose they are except when they arent dont worry european politics confuses even me could they suspect that the treasure was here but that was impossible wasnt it i was the only one with ezilis clue lets raise anchor lads and row for shore before they send another cannonball our way as encouragement im going to lie down on the boards here so that all they spy are harmless black fishermen yes we play the fool we pulled as fast as we could apparently the cannon shot had been only a warning to stay clear the frigate hove to a half mile from the monolith and lowered its own longboat the english seemed to have no interest in pursuing us i think theyre going to explore the rock jubal said i peeked up there was a great bustle on board the warship and a crowd of redcoats of all the times to take an interest in this jutting phallus of thorn and bird nests the english chose now i have very strange luck and our task had just gotten much harder chapter im afraid i need your help few sentences have been harder to spit out leon martel looked as triumphant as a caesar viewing a barbarian chieftain in chains he had my wife he had my son and now he thought he had me the british arrival at diamond rock was going to make us allies of convenience id seen his kind of smile a thousand times when gambling it was the smile of a man who has seen the others cards and knows he has a winning hand bonaparte would be pleased he said napoleon sent me to negotiate for louisiana not to hunt for aztec flying machines if he knew what were trying to do hed throw us in the asylum with de sade dont be so sure we were sitting on the terrace of martels opulent headquarters which i still didnt understand how he could afford the jungle was a throbbing wall of green birds and frogs sending up chorus enough to mask any conversation from eavesdroppers he took a sip of wine sighing in appreciation at the vintage having me as a supplicant gave him even more pleasure and you need my help because the british navy has claimed diamond rock the british now he sat erect im afraid theyre making a fort of it it was typical albion cheek the limeys had sailed in as smart as you pleased scaled the caribbean gibraltar like a bunch of goats and winched artillery to the summit now they could bang away with impunity at any french vessel that ventured near the cannon fire would force ships approaching from the south to make a long detour to safety to the west which in turn required them to beat against wind and current to get into fortdefrance many trading vessels wouldnt bother crippling martiniques economy to add insult to injury the english flew their flag from their perch theyd even christened the monolith hms diamond rock but it was a ship that couldnt be sunk it was rudeness that bordered on the inspirational and i couldnt help admire the wicked genius of it yet the jack tars were squatting over what might be the worlds most fabulous treasure like an ignorant goose atop an egg it doesnt realize is golden england martel exclaimed again with the same venom id heard from napoleon theyre gobbling everything because their superior navy allows it i believe its called war we have a cowardly fleet no a leaderless one your best naval officers fled or were executed during the revolution it takes decades of experience to command a ship of the line and your nation called such experience royalism you chased it away martel scowled someday france will have its revenge but for now were on the defensive the english have been pirates and barbarians since the retreat of the roman empire no one knows that better than america you and france are natural allies gage i tried to tell you that in paris by drowning me in a tub of water i am sometimes impatient but bad introductions can lead to good friendships now were partners in search of a treasure that will have great importance strategically historically and scientifically england will finally be conquered and the world will find itself at peace under the visionary direction of napoleon bonaparte you will be rich i will be powerful and well dine with the first consul and bring josephine gossip of her home village of troisilets he certainly had imagination since ive the same fault i was anything but encouraged too much vision tends to obscure reality yet my negroes and i needed technical help and a way to distract the british so here i was plotting with a renegade policeman with my wifes reluctant blessing when id returned to martels chateau after scouting the rock i insisted upon meeting astiza before striking a bargain since my enemy sensed that my truculence had softened hed allowed us to meet alone in the plantation library it was a passionate reunion id earlier watched a land crab on the beach stalk and pounce on a mate buried in the sand with the singlemindedness of a landlord on rent day id done much the same with my beloved striding across the room like a frenzied youth to seize and kiss her my hand roaming from her waist to bottom while another clutched a breast it had been a long separation while i groped i was secretly alert for any sign of hesitation that might hint at infidelity or violation but no she kissed me back with ardor of her own gasping when we broke for air and melted against me in a way that made me want to take her on the carpet damnation that crow and his guards were right outside the door did he assault you i asked if hed tried one of us would be dead why didnt you wait for me in saintdomingue she kissed me again and leaned against my shoulder he said that he had horus and that the ultimate goal was likely martinique if i wanted my son we must take temporary leave from my dangerous husband meanwhile he tempted me with his own research into the legends ethan i didnt want to go into the jungle with dessalines when my son was in capfrancois in the hands of a madman so i went with martel in hopes of safeguarding our boy until you found us and i couldnt explain youd disappeared from the library and there was no time to find you id folded myself into a dumbwaiter i thought youd been taken to rochambeau i almost killed the general so impulsive and so unnecessary why would i be tempted by a lizard like rochambeau when i already had adonis as my husband well i liked that truth be told im a handsome rascal when we retire theyll want the two of us at the best parties were very stylish shes also learned when to ignore me martel knew the city was about to fall he wanted out and knew youd follow i didnt choose horus or leon over you i simply made the only choice i could im going to kill martel you know he knows too so hell be prepared when you try its what men do isnt it all i want is a chance to get away from him as a family i dont care about this treasure or war can we please do that ethan simply get away absolutely but i dont think well have an opportunity until hes distracted by treasure we find it bargain fight and flee and this treasure is under a rock as massive as the great pyramid maybe weve found an underwater cave but need a means to get through it and now the british are sitting on top thats where martel comes in the treasure is cursed ethan the aztecs put a spell on it i saw troubling things in the little temple i made in the hecate when we crossed the atlantic and read more here you mustnt be tempted let the french have it theyll regret their discovery we just need to get away what did you read martel discovered reports of a pirate ship in these waters manned by black maroons two centuries before they circuited martinique as if looking for a hiding place perhaps this rock youve found since they didnt prey on merchant ships the speculation was that they were burying treasure instead of seizing it planters have dug martiniques shores ever since without success but that isnt the odd thing i found more documents martel doesnt know about records of what weeks later their pirate vessel was found drifting at sea and no one was aboard all the maroons had vanished no bodies no combat no clue i felt a chill they went ashore and the ship broke anchor perhaps perhaps she looked at me steadily but heres my question ethan if they came from saintdomingue did these blacks come here to hide a treasure or get rid of it were they determined to return for it or bury it so deep that no one ever found it again you think they were cursed think of all the trouble a single emerald has caused both to yussef karamanli in tripoli and now us i shook my head first of all i believe in luck but not in curses second i already have the emerald back and its still going to finance our retirement third its foolish not to take a kings ransom should we find it so let martel be cursed or let jubal and the blacks take it and strike a deal between their gods and the aztec ones we just need a chance to escape together but wont have one until were all as rich as montezuma frankly i also wanted a peek your family for the gold dont forget and dont be greedy agreed but to win we must have a plan of revenge so heres what well do l acking a robert fulton or a working submarine the scheme id come up with was inspired by jubals overturned canoe wed use a diving bell a device dating back to ancient greece the idea is simple invert a cauldron and drop it in the water so that it traps air just as the canoe did you can test the idea by putting a bucket upside down in water dive surface within the container and breathe in the space of the upended vessel if possible refresh the pocket of air with a hose a diving bell the size normally used to salvage ships with barges and air pumps would be unwieldy in the cave under diamond rock such an apparatus would also attract the attention of the english my scheme was less complicated wed sheathe a rum barrel with lead to give it the necessary weight and tightness to remain underwater while trapping air a small window would be fit on its side to look out through and to navigate by foxfire the phosphorescent luminescence sometimes found in rotting bark would shed a little light without a hose and pumps wed refresh our atmosphere from leather bags filled with air id wear this keg on my shoulders with a harness my torso would be in the caribbean but my head would have something to breathe wed attach a rope as we had to jubal it was cleverness worthy of a savant except it wasnt original with me in fact we looked at diagrams in a book in martels rented library to help puzzle the thing out other tomes showed plans for the kind of warship wed need if the cave goes nowhere i give a tug and am hauled back out i reassured astiza when we met with martel and jubal in the library to hold a council of war with a woman and a negro was extraordinary but these are modern times if theres treasure then i ferry out an armful at a time and the english well distract them with a naval attack on the side of the rock opposite from where were working martel said all in trust her tone was skeptical of course not madame business partners use contracts and lawyers not trust well have you and your husband will have the hoard but theres honor among thieves is there not monsieur gage a friendly exchange and your family free to go to the united states i suppose as far as we can get from you a third goes to haiti jubal insisted martel frowned i am not accustomed to bargaining with blacks and a free haitian is not accustomed to consorting with men who are allied with slave masters my massive friend said so we do as a slave does whats that partner with whom we must and spit afterward martel laughed youd make a fine criminal in the paris underworld and you a fine field hand with a cane bill and straw hat the frenchman regarded his gigantic new ally uncertainly in two weeks well have the dark of the moon he finally said best to work when its hard for the british to see and then well be done with each other once and for all i said chapter as we made preparations i belatedly realized wed slipped into a new year and that id entirely missed christmas martel did give three chances to play with my son the two of us under guard so harry and i dug a cave crept through the shrubbery and threw rocks at the pond but i was mostly kept busy in boatyard and workshop astiza oversaw the sewing of leather air bags as the moon waned martiniques dazzling sunshine also darkened giving way to sultry haze jubal watched the sky for omens its bad weather coming more like september than january he muttered we must hurry a squall could give us cover i reasoned this kind of storm is no cover jubal warned it upends the sea we want to dive before it begins and be done before it climaxes a little rain to blind the british pray for that and ill pray for the success of your plan to checkmate the french our scheme was necessarily complicated we needed daylight to dive but with england atop the rock we could approach only under cover of darkness our strategy then had three steps jubal martel and i would be the treasure divers and wed approach diamond rock at night antoine and the rest of jubals men would join crow vulture buzzard and the rest of martels men on a bomb ketch a sailing ship designed to fire at the summit of the rock by using a high arching mortar mounted in the bow the ketch had two masts astern of the huge gun with both squarerigged and foreandaft sails and would be skippered by a few seasoned sailors on loan from the governor of martinique my wife and son would sail as hostages a french bombardment of the captured rock would commence the next day and wed use the distraction to begin our dive any treasure would be found removed and stored on the sea bottom then the ketch would return under cover of darkness and wed retrieve the loot from the bottom sand before escaping in other words everything had to happen perfectly leon martel came readily with jubal and mehe had arrogant courage so long as my family was pawnand the three of us rowed toward le diamant on a moonless night taking a bearing because the course was ink except for the dazzle of phosphorescence in our wake i worried that the english might see our sparkle but then decided our longboat was so small that the danger was remote we pulled in silence nothing in the universe except our tail of blue fire the wind was warm my mood anxious there was swell the kind that heralds a distant storm in the middle of our longboat were the converted rum barrel and air skins an hour at the oars brought us to within sound of waves slapping against diamond rock looking up i could see the glow of british lanterns at the summit we coasted to a small indention on the cliff that faced martinique and pulled into a cove that was little more than a crevice the width of our longboat an overhang shielded us from easy view by the garrison we tied off arranged the diving bell for quick deployment and settled down to wait for dawn sleep was elusive so ethan what will you do as a rich man jubal finally asked i shifted uncomfortable and nervous as little as possible martel snorted no one would bore more quickly than you monsieur gage you dont know your own character so what would you do leon whores and horses money is power and power is rule i want men answering to me instead of my answering to them another reason to keep my distance and you jubal i want to rebuild my homeland haiti was the most beautiful country in the world before the war it could be again doesnt that sound nobler than our motives martel so noble that i want to buy your black friend and put him to work his race can restore our plantations no longer frenchman mark my words your damned revolution will prove a mistake it was your own revolution that gave us the idea freedom and equality france preached and now planters on every island lay awake in the dark of the night waiting for their throats to be cut for liberty he gave our temporary ally a ghostly grin are you going to cut mine no because im already a free man and were partners as you say this is much better than having a slave is it not for both you and me thats what your race must understand martel rolled to one side to doze all right then ethan be bored jubal throw your money away on a country that will never appreciate it ill buy status and position in france and rule like a lord at least youre candid i allowed im honest everyone is corrupt but only i admit it the sun came over martinique flooding our little crack but also shining into the eyes of any english sentries who happened to look in our direction unless they climbed down on some improbable mission i felt us reasonably invisible as light came jubal quietly slipped over the side with a wooden buoy holding an anchor and line he swam to a spot directly in front of the submerged cave dove down to set the anchor and adjusted the length of the line so that the marker was just underwater then he led a rope from the buoy back to our boat when the time came we could swiftly pull ourselves to the anchored buoy to deploy the diving bell the sun climbed higher the sea turning from black to blue and then to aquamarine i watched martel lazily watching me he was waiting for me to try to kill him while thinking of any number of ways to betray me corrupt indeed jubal lounged between us like a referee before a prizefight finally we heard shouts from above and even a trumpet the tide has turned and theyve spied your wifes present martel whispered by afternoon we can act as much as i hated to admit it martel and i had things in common we were both instinctual opportunists and clever improvisers it wasnt easy assaulting the english on their rock because their new gun battery was higher than the masthead of any ship accordingly the renegade policeman had used my papers from rochambeau to enlist the governor of martinique in an elaborate diversion we refit an eightyfoot vessel into a bomb ketch christened pelee copying the habit of naming such weapons after volcanoes workers removed its foremast reinforced the deck with timber cribbing and installed a massive mortar the gun was so heavy that the new ketch listed slightly at the bow in theory the mortar could lob shells high enough to reach the summit but pelee was a clumsy sailor its canvas set too far back to properly balance distraction was its real mission we told the governor nothing about treasure but assured him that one lucky hit on a british magazine could blow their entire garrison to hell were using the expertise of the doughty mercenary and sage savant ethan gage hero of the pyramids martel said governor lambeau entirely missing his ironic sarcasm the chance of success was enough to persuade the loan of a fortress mortar that weighed more than a ton victory over this british ship on a french rock could lead the governor to promotion back in france lambeau too wanted to escape home before taken by fever that manipulation by my criminal ally was clever enough even better was astizas suggestion of a preliminary ruse so calculated that i wished id thought of it myself the same night we rowed to the rock the ketch drifted between le diamant and martinique to drop several halffilled kegs into the sea by dawn they were bobbing past the rock opposite our hiding place we heard excited cries when the garrison scrambled to salvage this flotsam everybody loves to beachcomb even better the kegs were half full of rum obviously youve studied the english navy i told astiza im a student of human nature and know how lonely and stupefyingly boring it must be to be stationed on that rock those halffull kegs will be a quarter full by the time theyre hoisted to where the commander can inspect them and british aim will be degraded accordingly nor will their lookouts be as alert the first goal in any battle is to help the enemy destroy itself you sound like napoleon my lovely ive studied with you my devious electrician so how could i get martel to help destroy himself when the time came it was hot and boring while we bobbed waiting for the gunnery duel to begin orbiting birds clearly annoyed by this human interest in their castle occasionally spattered our boat with retaliatory guano the sky turned grayer as rum was sneaked voices from the top of the rock increased in volume laughter songs angry commands heated lectures yes the liquor had gone to work then more shouts when the bomb ketch was spotted bearing down on the rock opposite us the mortar on its deck a gaping mouth maybe this insanity would really work what if the treasure wasnt here then either martel or i would never emerge from the cave alive i guessed at two oclock we heard the bang of the mortar and then a crash as a bomb erupted somewhere above fragments of stone and shell flew wide and pattered the sea around like a rain of gravel martel smiled it has begun all eyes will be on the ketch there was another thud answering the first and another and another as english guns replied an artillery duel was soon fully under way we expected that even drunken english gunnery would eventually drive away our ship and i worried a lucky shot might hit my wife and son we had to be quick casting off from diamond rock we swiftly pulled ourselves out to where jubal had set the buoy and readied our makeshift diving bell the guess that were in the right place is mine so the risk is too i said manfully im not really that brave but i wanted as much control over our situation as i could manage so i slipped over the side holding our longboat by one hand and a sack of musket balls in the other the leaded rum barrel was upended over my head its leather harness keeping me in position when i let go the side of our boat my head and shoulders were above water my body immersed and my only view was through the small glass wed fashioned the weight of lead and musket balls sank me like a sack of grain and i plunged about fifteen feet before my feet landed on an underwater rock i looked out at the sea i was in a bubble of breathable air inside the diving bell i swayed and steadied a line led from our contraption to the buoy through a ring and on to the stern of our longboat the leather air bags were tied behind me my companions would pull themselves back out of sight while i explored but in a quarter hour would haul back on the keg whether i was attached or not if things were going well i was to tack a white handkerchief like the white cloths wed tied onto the powder barrels on saintdomingue it would be a sign id found the treasure then martel could decide whether to follow me inside the diamond i gave myself half odds so i made martel swear a promise if i drown you must release my wife and son agreed theyll then be of no use see i am a gentleman youre a schemer yes were brothers you and i now i took stock at the bottom of the sea i could see barely the triangular opening of the cave and the glorious sea fans at its entrance that undulated as if waving encouragement ethan in here was it ezili speaking or some other siren luring me to my death the thud of artillery carried through the water i spilled some of the musket balls to give myself more buoyancy trimming the diving bell was like operating the altitude of a balloon and i hovered a few feet off the rock id initially landed on then the current caught me and i was pulled toward the dark opening the barrel scraped a side caromed toward the other bounced again and slid into blackness it was like falling into a hole with no way to climb back out but what was inside might change the world chapter i was briefly in utter blackness there was a quick blue glow as if a crevice was letting in light from abovewas that where jubal had taken breath and then darkness again as forbidding as a sewer on i swirled bobbing in my barrel id gambled that the rock was only a few hundred yards wide and that the cave couldnt go far but what if the ocean descended to the very bowels of the earth only the need to bargain for my family kept me from panicking and signaling to be pulled back out suddenly i yanked to a stop and at first i thought my companions were trying to reverse me i looked out my porthole for a landmark but all was dark outside the little window i had a faint glow inside my contraption from the bottle of fox fire but it illuminated little but my own hands then i realized the trailing line must have snagged i loosened my harness plunged my head down into the sea and reached outside the barrel with my arm to jerk the line finally freed and the barrel floated forward once more i hurriedly rose back into its air space and continued like a leaf in a drain blind and stuffy then i slammed rock and could feel with my feet a cliff face i was at a dead end pinned by current darkness like pitch my breath going stale i refreshed my air first hauling in one of astizas leather bags and bringing its stopper into my little air space inside the diving bell i released the plug and felt my head clear and now time to explore i released myself from the harness took a breath and swam out and upward feeling for the cave ceiling instead i broke clear of the surface i was in a grotto i sucked in air i could breathe the cliff where the diving bell had grounded was wet rough and silent there was no sound of guns or sea i felt until i found a ledge above water i dared go no farther lest i lose the position of the diving bell so i calculated the few feet id come carefully worked my way that distance back and felt the barrel with my feet i reached inside my shirt for the white cloth dove and pushed its tack into the barrels soft lead this would signal it was safe to enter the cave just as i did so the bell jerked as if with a life of its own and began to be hauled in by my companions the quarter hour was up i swam to the ledge and hauled myself out let there be light having learned my lesson at the battle of vertieres i unwrapped an oilskin parcel with flint steel tinder candle and a phosphor bottle i carefully uncorked the latter invention and withdrew a splinter it flared just enough to light my fuzz of oiled cotton and wood shavings then i lit the candlewick and shadows retreated even more i put the wax taper in a crevice seeming bright as a chandelier after utter blackness the pool id emerged from glittered finally i looked about i was sitting below a rock dome that peaked fifteen feet above the surface of the sea there was a crevice above an old volcanic vent that must be providing distant air everywhere but where i sat the dome plunged sheer into the sea but behind i turned and jumped an alligator crouched giving me a toothy grin as if it had been waiting patiently for dinner to crawl out of the sea its teeth gleamed but this monster was golden i realized its eyes great emeralds and its rows of teeth quartz crystals it was long as my arm behind receding into the shadows was a reef of gold and silver id found a dragons hoard of necklaces and crowns great silver wheels with mysterious writing and sculpted animals studded with gems on some the turquoise and jade was bright as the sunny caribbean and the workmanship as exquisite as anything in nitots jewelry shop there were also little hillocks of loose emeralds green as a model of ireland id found montezumas lost treasure or at least what was left of it this remnant equaled the wealth of a thousand kings whole armadas could be financed i calculated palaces erected armies recruited cathedrals built how had the salvagers been persuaded to leave it here as if in answer i realized there were adjacent piles of white and i looked more closely bones lots of them skeletons clustered around the hoard like soldiers at a campfire their skulls looked at the treasure as if in reproach flesh and clothing long rotted away the maroons had apparently never reemerged killed to keep a secret trapped by the current or sacrificing themselves to bury a discovery too dangerous to harness as astiza suggested superstition all i knew is i didnt want to join them i crawled to the booty for inspection there were hideously beautiful metal masks jadetipped swords and golden necklaces as heavy as slave collars golden toys rolled on tiny wheels and simple cast bars of precious metal were stacked like bricks i suspected the conquistadors had melted some of the aztec art down for transit finally there were curious triangular objects i didnt recognize at all sausageshaped machines with delta wings and helmeted riders they were contraptions different than anything id ever seen except that they reminded me of the reckless canvas goose at fort de joux that madman george cayley had launched into the air they were in short flying machines or at least representations of one maybe martel was more than just a lunatic was there really enough detail to allow french savants to devise something to fly the english channel i knelt as if before saints overcome by the fabulousness of the find and bewilderment at its meaning how and why had escaped slaves salvaged this from some stormwashed reef and carried it here for hiding theyd avoided the temptation of spiriting it away and spending why had they no greed or had the treasure tricked and trapped them here there was a splash behind and i jumped again but it was only martel surfacing from the diving bell as lithe as a seal he hauled himself up beside me shook water from his thick hair like a dog me quickly shielding the candle from this idiocy and then gaped at the wealth of an empire for a moment even he was at a loss for words eventually he crawled to one of the peculiar birdlike toys gingerly holding it as if it were magic and might fly away on its own he had an almost boyish look of wonder and triumph i told you so gage dietrich william the emerald storm chapter i realized why no one had ever retrieved the treasure of montezuma when i attempted to exit with a handful the seawater didnt deadend in the cavern it found another underwater crack and continued possibly all the way through diamond rock this meant there was a constant tide running into this cave and none out without help it was a tunnel of no return no wonder it contained bones of the dead i plunged into the pool strapped inside the diving bell and jerked the rope for jubal to pull me out and thats the only way i emerged alive escape was like trying to breast a river while encased in a sausage my black friend had returned the longboat to its hiding place and swum to a perch above the cave entrance to handle the towline but even with that platform he had to haul like a longshoreman his reward was when i unstrapped myself surfaced and held up a golden necklace heavy enough to make its wearer stoop from the weight its really there jubal by damballahs scales that collar alone is enough to start rebuilding my country ezili favors us i think ezili favors herself as our french partner favors himself everyone has their own dreams yes once we got the treasure out wed have more temptation than schoolboys at a brothel in the meantime we all had to work on trust ill swim this underwater to the buoy anchor drop it on the bottom and go get more he pointed toward the sky hurry the weathers getting worse i looked the sea was grayer waves higher i could still hear the artillery duel but it was beginning to be muted by the drum pound of surf i hoped our bomb ketch would pull away soon before my family got hurt maybe that will make it easier to sneak under the noses of the british agwe the sea loa is restless somethings wrong ethan jubal if you saw the wonders of that cave youd realize that everything is finally very right his nod conveyed doubt why did the maroons bring and hide it here why did they never come back for it they left their bones we wont maybe we should just leave martel now and go with the necklace and the longboat no his men have my family and theres an entire treasury down there this is payback for all youve suffered jubal years of war the loss of your lover i dont think life balances its ledger he sighed how many trips to carry it all out dozens i cant pull that long the black glanced upward there were flashes like thunder against the clouds the crash of british artillery its too hard to pull you or monsieur martel through the tunnel so many times you send him out next to help me then you fill a sack tie it to the barrel and we just pull that we empty the treasure you pull back this line and together we transfer all the gold and jewels to the anchor the last time you come out with the diving bell agreed i trust you but you shouldnt trust martel ethan i was a slave i dont trust nobody so we set to work and work it was i strapped myself back into the barrel and drifted into the cavern to inform martel of our plan i was amazed at how much shorter the distance seemed now that i had traversed it before martel was at first as skeptical at leaving me alone with the treasure as i was of leaving him with jubal i explained that first i had nowhere to go without his help and second as we transferred i would be leaving him with the growing heap of gold but not the toy birds or whatever you want to call them flying machines those stay until i come and if you try to betray me or kill jubal you lose them and remember my blacks are aboard your ketch as is your wife and child and my inspectors and sailors the only way this will succeed is if we all work together ive tried to explain that to you from the beginning monsieur gage its good to have partners no and with a gallic snort he plunged into the diving bell and jerked on the line to be pulled out the water helping neutralize the golden alligator that weighed at least a hundred pounds and that he cradled in his arms i set to work before my candle burned down completely we set up an efficient system jubal and martel traded tasks one swimming gunnysacks of gold and precious stones out to our anchor depository the other tugging on lines to haul out the treasure or to signal me to pull the empty bell back with each relay i loaded a gunnysack with loot hung it on the floating barrel and watched it jerk away before returning empty ten minutes later slowly the aztec hoard diminished my labor as mechanical as if i were shifting coal the hoard was only half depleted when i swam down to attach a sack and found a crude note that jubal or martel had tacked inside the air chamber before i pulled it back storm coming finish now i didnt argue yes i left a dragons nest of gold behind but we had enough treasure to buy napoleons palace at saintcloud three times over the candle was guttering so i took the flying models tucked them in my shirt filled the gunnysack with some last precious idols strapped myself into the leaded rum barrel and gave a tug i still braced for betrayal if the line went slack from being cut i was determined to grab the rough sides of the tunnel and try to kick my own way up and out but no my journey went smoothly hands grabbed i came to the surface with the last of the treasure blinking away water light was rapidly failing i heard no more gunfire did the british hit our vessel no we would have heard cheers the twilight was an odd ominous green and the swells were growing higher it was so hazy i couldnt see the top of the rock i bobbed uneasily up and down in the waves and i could hear our longboat scraping where it was hidden in the cleft the air felt very heavy yes no time for more gold i said when will the ship come back midnight martel said you brought the flying machines if thats what they really are yes youll win my consternation if you make them into something that actually flies your challenge is accepted monsieur french science leads the world you have the lunacy of a true savant martel and you the nerve of a good grave robber compliments exchanged we swam to the tiny cove where the longboat was moored hauled ourselves aboard donned more clothesi had a vestand gobbled cheese and wine our bread alas had gone soggy and i missed a spoon of sugar too jubal eyed the storm while martel tried to puzzle out the triangular objects and i watched martel the first priority was to safeguard astiza and harry waiting on the ketch and then if all else failed i still had the emerald ive learned to be cautious around my enemies so id swallowed it in case martel tried to take it back from me to time its emergence correctly i shouldnt eat much anyway so i dropped my share of the spoiled bread overboard and watched fish come to gobble so can you fly to london i idly asked martel look here are the wings and here a man sitting between to steer this is sculpted from something the aztecs had seen im certain of it but did the wings flap this will require much study ive been on a glider that crashed it would be a brave man who first mounts a contraption based on a toy i will be that man night came and we lost all sight of martinique it was as if we were marooned no stars overhead the wind continuing its alarming rise surf was beginning to boom against stone the longboat bucked uneasily up and down anchoring the ketch to scoop up the treasure wouldnt be easy time dragged were the french not coming id row to shore before dawn rather than risk another day here then there was a scrape above and bits of grit and pebbles rained a hundred feet above a horn lantern swayed in the wind look a glim i whispered to the others pointing to the light men were working down the cliff had they seen us one if by land two if by sea the british were coming chapter life is never simple my captured family and i were now within imminent gunshot range of english french and haitian rivals the weather was deteriorating toward a real storm and fish had gotten all our rolls i was sticky with salt windburned thirsty and weary any man who tells you adventuring is a lark is a liar maybe the english wont see us if we row out to the buoy jubal whispered back in these seas well splash like a duck i said theyll see no more if we meet them with steel martel suggested he drew a stiletto as wicked as a warlocks wand and it gleamed in the night like a shard of ice the bastard looked as anticipatory about sliding it between a mans ribs as i do about stroking a woman our renegade policeman was a dog needing to be put down but we could use his bite now youve certainly more pluck than i can muster i said to encourage him could you show us how to stalk please jubal and i will guard the rear until pelee heaves to well keep your flying machines safe as well he looked at the lantern bobbing above i prefer that we cut english throats together gage just to continue our partnership i rather like the albions despite our differences at lexington and concord theyre terribly earnest but have a dry sense of humor slitting english throats seems more of a french than an american task dont you think not that my hopes and prayers dont go with you youll strand me on the rock excellent idea not if youre quick i lied but before martel could demonstrate his assassination skills or even more conveniently be killed more pebbles rained down and a shout came from above theres a boat down here too late the frenchman muttered he tucked his stiletto away unwrapped an oilcloth uncovered a brace of pistols and tossed one each to jubal and me he took up a third stood in our bouncing craft aimed and fired there was a cry and the lantern tumbled bouncing into the air like a meteor and then plunging in the sea leaving us in darkness again vive napoleon frogs the british sailors exclaimed muskets flashed above and balls pinged and whined about our heads couldnt we have discussed our strategy before you cried out like a charging regiment i grumbled french elan and a commendable shot in these conditions martel replied pelee will be here soon make them hesitate gage so jubal and i fired too british pistols banged back i heard the richest variety of curses this side of a portsmouth alehouse and then we were all busy reloading more lights appeared at the top of the rock and a general alarm was raised a trumpet sounded and drums rattled wed spent the entire day slipping out treasure from under the british noses and now in the dead of night wed raised the entire garrison was martel trying to get us killed we cant fight the whole bloody fort i said lets row for martinique and you lads can come back for the treasure later ill take astiza and harry and be on my way leaving an emperors ransom hurt of course but i had my emerald on deposit theyll wonder what we were here for dive and find it martel replied we need that treasure gage no man should understand the importance of money better than a drifting pauper like yourself alas he had a point we work all our lives for filthy lucre in hopes of not working at all it makes no sense but then neither does love fashion or the american congress a cannon boomed from atop diamond rock they couldnt depress the barrel enough to hit us the shot flying overhead but the spout of water it raised out to sea reminded us that retreat had its own perils then more musket shots rose from above one ricocheting off rock and thunking into the wood of our longboat too close while the overhang gave us protection we ultimately were fish in a barrel in our little cleft of a cove i looked up more lanterns ropes slithering in descent as they uncoiled id no doubt sailors and marines would soon be swinging down them like angry apes i could see musket muzzles poking out from crevices above pivoting to look for us like the antenna of insects i envied jubal his dark skin figuring it made him more invisible there they are the cry echoed down in that tight cove ready muskets swung to aim at us i winced wondering if i was about to expel my emerald long before id planned to and then a boom of a different cannon this time from the other direction and with a crash a cannon ball hit the cliff above and rock splinters flew in all directions men howled it was pelee leaning hard in the wind as she scudded out of the night smoke drifting off the muzzle of a deck gun then another of her cannon fired the flash like lightning martel whooped at the arrival of our allies and lit our own lantern in the longboat uncovering the side that faced the water to signal where we were the ketch banged again and again shot bouncing off the flank of diamond rock like a castle wall the british sailors were in full retreat scrambling upward even faster than theyd swung down their own artillery crashed in reply water geysers shooting up the french mortar on the ketch barked and a shell screamed up toward the clouds to burst in the flashes of illumination we joined the tumult by shooting our pistols again martel untied the longboat we salvage under their gun muzzles he said prepare to dive where bullets cant reach us i didnt have a better plan jubal and i pushed off toward pelee and the buoy wed set musket fire peppered the water cannons crashed but the french ketch had turned into the wind so close to diamond rock that the british couldnt help but overshoot her she dropped her mizzen and anchored continuing to lob with her mortar while spraying the side of the rock with swivel guns her captain a man named augustus brienne was showing elan of his own come on comrades i heard antoine call i studied the crowd on board yes there was astiza waving to me over the gunwale stay down darling harry must be somewhere below i also saw other negro heads besides antoine assuring me that the french hadnt betrayed jubals men yet there was still a chance once we got to our submerged buoy we dove over the side of our longboat eager to evacuate before british fire found it the sea was inky below its heave pulling and pushing below the surface at night i could imagine a thousand hideous things coming at me from deep but the surest way to get out of this mess was to retrieve what wed come for so i followed the buoy line to the bottom groped by the longboat anchor and seized slick metal aztec gold i swam up narrowly missing knocking my own head on the tethered launch then i kicked over to the ketch and hollered for a ladder a ropeandpeg one uncurled down the side the little ship was bouncing up and down in the seas like a coach on a potholed american road the weather both screening us and making salvage difficult i had to time my grab to avoid the scrape of barnacles that girded the vessels waterline at last i climbed partway up and slapped what id grabbedit was one of the gold necklaces i sawon deck the french gaped get it in a strongbox i ordered theres much more to come martel squeezed up beside me crying for help to lift the golden alligator yes and dont cut anchor until were all aboard he added send the blacks to help we dropped back into the sea bullets whapping into the ketchs hull and plunking into the water jubal swam by hoisted his own piece of the hoard on deck and shouted to his comrades dive freemen the faster we fetch the faster we leave men leaped from the ship and swam with us back to the buoy even crow and buzzard jumped in to help down we ducked like otters groping for gold and then swam gasping to pelee s far side the ships coughing mortar gave fits of illumination british cannonballs kept arcing over us to fall harmlessly into the sea beyond and their gunners swore like the sailors they were frustrated they couldnt depress their cannon barrels far enough and no doubt wondering what the devil we were doing down there finally they tried just pitching a cannonball by hand this to a certain extent worked the sphere fell three hundred feet hit an outcrop and bounced outward toward our salvage operation there was no good aim but the ball made a disturbing impact when it splashed into the sea a few yards from where we swam madness but gold too i dove again with our team of bandits the treasure was transferred quickly we thrashed blindlyone poor lad got a handful of urchin spinesand it gradually became harder to find whatever was left i could hear the plonk of ricocheting cannonballs as they struck the water and finally thought wed done a good nights work id decided to suggest this to martel when there was another splash different this time and something bobbed on the dim surface i dove and felt a last time for treasure suddenly there was a thud kick and agony in my ears i was punched sideways and the surface of the sea erupted then a confusion of sounds and things hitting the water i swam up dazed other heads poked up around me all of us rising and falling on the waves that pounded and thundered against diamond rock several ears bled one man floated facedown and still our longboat and buoy had disappeared martel shouted something my ears were ringing what he swam closer looked at one ear and then turned me to shout in the other powder keg ah the english had dropped a fused one with enough air to let it float and the mine had gone off next to our precious longboat our buoy rope marking the treasure had slithered to the bottom time to leave jubal shouted we didnt have to be persuaded another barrel came down and we swam for our lives it erupted with fury and a huge fountain of spray as we scrambled up the side of pelee like squirrels one black took a splinter and fell with a cry back into the sea we fished him out blood running something thumped our side it was the diving bell kicked out of our boat by the explosion with more sentiment than sense i insisted we haul it aboard the leaded rum barrel thumped down its little glass porthole intact then i collapsed on deck dripping and exhausted an ax swung the anchor cable parted and a jib unreeled to catch the wind the ketchs bow swung as sharply as a wayward compass needle cannonballs still crashing and then we were off flying from diamond rock a shout went up from the british side as they saw us sail through the range of their guns but by now rain was beginning to fall obscuring us further their cannon boomed and a lucky shot might still have sunk us but we had only a couple balls scream harmlessly through our rigging wed snatched one of the most fabulous treasures in history out from under english noses and chances were they didnt even know what wed taken when the storm abated theyd probably clamber down and scratch their heads evidence of our expedition churned away by the storms surf they might signal an english frigate however to hunt us down so we hoisted more canvas the overload pushing a rail into the sea and were off like a racehorse men scrabbling to catch treasure sliding on deck and carry it to storage below id no doubt more than a few trinkets disappeared into trousers or shoes but we had no time for inspection the ship raced bucking and pitching in the building waves with the sickening swoops of cayleys glider pelee was badly balanced with the mortar and rolled more than was normal still wed recovered what the conquistadors had lost the sad night of cortes had been reversed i wearily sat against a mast and looked for astiza there she was in the stern as planned exactly as id told her to be i waved again our smiles a flash in the night the signal confirmed that harry was tucked safe in a sail locker and that payback could soon begin chapter we sailed from the artificial thunderandlightning storm coming from the british output on diamond rock a blind bombardment of artillery like bolts from olympus the monolith was finally lost behind us in rain and mist spray flying from wave tops stars hidden the nearby mountains of martinique were invisible now the only sign of the isle was the white glow of warning surf had martinique been a lee shore wind blowing toward it wed have been hardpressed to keep off its reefs but the wind was boiling out of the southeast pushing us northwestward into the open caribbean hurricane coming jubal shouted in my ear not this season i protested this one is from agwe or perhaps the god of montezuma god should favor us were putting treasure to libertys use the wind snatched my words away like leaves in a tempest only if we win my friend was looking at martel the renegade policeman was snapping orders like an admiral sailors ran to the lines looking apprehensively up at our rigging my god i said hes going to try to jibe in this wind hell risk snapping the boom he wants to sail into fortdefrance wed expected as much once under french guns any chance of our keeping some treasure would be gone regardless of the promises martel made my family would still be at his mercy my black companions would be reenslaved the scoundrel would return to paris triumphant with triangular toys i rose from the mast and put my hand on a sailors arm no the man hesitated his muscle jumping under my palm for your own safety get to the rail but then a sword point pricked the back of my shoulder its time for you to go below out of the weather monsieur gage martel had put on a greatcoat over wet clothes its hem stuttering in the wind well make you warm in the dungeons of fortdefrance i thought we were partners leon indeed we were but all partnerships must end it was the betrayal wed been waiting for counting on martels squad of scoundrels had pistols out pointing at jubals men and swords in case guns didnt fire in the tropic rain they meant to take it all not just the flying toys but every necklace every idol every golden alligator even the emerald again if he held me captive long enough for my body to expel it or hed slit me from arse to throat to get at it if he knew where id put the jewel jibe in this wind and youll risk the mainmast i warned its our only chance to make martinique and i dont believe youre a sailor gage leave it to experts who are i glanced at captain brienne at the helm eyeing the booms and yards of the sails as nervously as a groom his approaching bride to haiti martel downwind i tried for a fair division as promised he smiled come gage you knew it had to be this way from the beginning were all pirates here it was either me imprisoned in haiti or you imprisoned in martinique and im not a man to share so down the hatch you can say goodbye to your son a final time while we run for the harbor your wife and boy can hire as domestics or she can work as a whore shed make good money at it youll win delivery back to france in chains to answer to napoleon its an honor to merit such trouble im napoleons agent you idiot are you really that naive maybe theyll give you louvertures old cell which im told was very large im not a cruel man just determined and arrogant only around my inferiors he motioned with the sword tip go go i dont want to stab you in front of your wife i hate the sobs of women which was as good a cue as any i looked beyond him to the stern of our ship astiza ready ethan there was a squeal of metal and she pivoted a swivel gun on the stern rail and aimed its muzzle down the deck captain briennes eyes went wide and he ducked down packed with musket balls and waiting for hours i told martel he considered my wife the calm captive of martinique had disappeared now astiza looked the avenging banshee her dress and coat shuddering in the howl of wind wet hair loose and flying like a flag a glowing match was sheltered in her hand you must be joking martel tried shes a woman a mother tell her to get away from that gun before she hurts herself she is a mother and you took her cub i warned i advise you put your sword down partners you said its still not too late shes bluffing he called to his men use gage as a shield they shoved jubals blacks whom theyd surprised toward me everyone swaying and stumbling to the ungodly roll of the ship bunching into a target we had just an instant before ropes clasped around us but antoine had drilled the men ashore training and timing is everything now i said jubal and his blacks joined me in dropping flat to the deck no martel roared astiza fired the swivel gun banged and there was a sizzle as a cone of lead balls swept the deck like a wicked broom french ruffians cried and toppled as bullets tore flesh balls pinged off the mortar on the foredeck whining away or whapping into wood martel staggered from an impact and i tripped him and leaped atop hurling his sword overboard and holding his own knife to his throat jubals men were doing the same to the others in an instant the situation was reversed the sailors at the rigging had frozen including the one id warned astiza had stepped from the stern to captain brienne at the wheel to hold a pistol to his body stay your course or youll have no backbone martel was gasping with pain one ball had torn his belly another his arm no woman would do that he complained i could feel the stickiness of his blood my woman would to a man who stole her child damn you he coughed wetly i watched everyone but her youve damned yourself listen to the wind gage his voice was a bubbling wheeze its rising toward a hurricane if we dont make port now we never will jibe for fortdefrance and ill parley with the governor and split fairly with you i promise if we dont make port were doomed split what you just lost your share of the treasure including your foolish flying machines thats what comes of breaking an agreement those models are the property of the french government i think theyre the property of the haitian government now or perhaps ill take them to london you can explain your mistakes in a letter to bonaparte bonaparte will hunt you to the ends of the earth if you flee with this treasure hes expecting ancient secrets to help him conquer britain this isnt about money its about power youve understood nothing from the beginning if napoleon were here hed have less mercy on you than i will the first consul is my patron hed be appalled that renegade french policemen have tortured kidnapped and betrayed martel groaned fool youre the fool for assaulting my family gage do you think i have license to accost you in paris dally with rochambeau and be set up like a prince in martinique youve a talent for roguery i give you that its all been at the orders of bonaparte the theft of the emerald the kidnapping of your son the hunt for the legend napoleons not your patron hes your foe he didnt keep you in paris for louisiana which was near bargained already he flattered you to follow this treasure manipulating you with the theft of your family youve been his plaything from the beginning what nitot told josephine about the emerald who told napoleon who told fouche who told me youve been our puppet since saintcloud im merely an employee it wasnt i who stole your son and wife it was bonaparte who knew youd never volunteer to look for aztec technology on your own but he knew you might be tricked into it with the right incentive such as a kidnapping and that you have a knack for learning clues that elude ordinary men whether you explored for dessalines the british or france hardly mattered youd come after your family and when you did napoleon would get his due youre lying the corsican wants those flying machines and is perfectly willing to sacrifice a family to get them hell sacrifice a million families for a chance at england your only hope gage is to return to fortdefrance and throw yourself on french mercy napoleon will forgive but never forget napoleon forgive for betraying my family thats what the great do to remain great and the lesser accept their calculations for a moments favor thats all we can hope for im amazed how naive you remain after all the treacheries youve endured its true i am by instinct goodnatured and want to believe the best of people except when i have to shoot or stab them its a fault i suppose so now my mind reeled like the heave of the ship martel had been working for the same first consul whod supposedly deputized me to work on the sale of louisiana and that master considered me entirely disposable of course napoleon felt himself impregnable in his own grand palaces i dont believe you but my tone betrayed me you think an unemployed policeman can order a bomb ketch lambeau converted this ship on napoleons orders not mine why didnt bonaparte hire me directly because you kept insisting youd quit i felt dazed a wash of seawater ran from side to side of the deck mixed with blood from dead and wounded men now i had a choice of surrender to martels government or a ride in a hurricane with a wounded crew at one anothers throats i only wanted to retire i said hollowly you can only retire when the powerful say you can retire and you martel wounded wet five thousand miles from home im a policeman a soldier i accept my fate i glanced about considering astiza still stood behind the helm and our captain as the ship surged on surfing down growling swells brienne looked frightened at our course but clung fatalistically to the wheel martels look was mocking pitying disdainful proud pained as if he were the moral superior so i had to jolt him into place perhaps what you say is true well let dessalines finish your interrogation to make sure finally he paled monsieur that is monstrous he has his own ideas of justice for slaveryloving frenchmen i dragged the bleeding bastard to the hatch leading to the hold youve a gift for conversation im sure you can persuade him youre a traitor to your race if you give me up to dessalines dont talk to me about treachery i warn you gage ill never go ill kill myself first youre too much the villain to dare i dragged him down the ladder bumping and found that chains had been prepared for our own capture so i snapped them in place around him and the other scoundrels and took the ring of keys i almost let martel bleed to death but at the last moment wrapped rags around his wounds so we could save him for later torture i can be ruthless too in a sail locker i found harry rolled into a ball and terrified by the gyrations of the ship i crawled in and hugged him harry its papa are you all right he was crying wheres mama guiding our ship i reached out to touch him and he shrank his fear was wounding ill take you to her youll stay in the captains cabin i bundled him in my arms its almost over son i want to go home the cabin is like a home i carried him up to astiza ill guard brienne i shouted against the wind you keep harry in the captains quarters i handed her one of martels flying models hes betrayed us from the beginning but this is what he came for she looked this is what the aztecs saw not what they made she guessed theyre too crude the indians were copying something extraordinary agreed but ill show one to fulton anyway keep harry warm she retreated to the compartment in the stern i turned to captain brienne who looked more frightened of the sea than my pistol can we hold this course its too late to jibe the masts would break so we run downwind but feel for yourself i was shocked at the pull of the wheel and feared the rudder would snap the ship was trembling as we surfed down the seas we needed to take down more sail trying to manage the clumsy bomb ketch was like holding a halter on a drunken cow it would be better now without the mortar monsieur the captain said i looked at the gun the ketch rolled as if an anvil was tied round its neck agreed but its impossible in these seas he went on if we try to cast it overboard the gun will break loose go through the gunwale and take half the hull with it so we must make port instead any bay we choose has to be downwind on an island that isnt french we may not have that choice its not a choice to be recaptured either jubal you help reef sail and ill fetch a chart we just need to ride this out i said it with more confidence than i felt remembering astizas foreboding ill get my men to help the sailors the black said and pray to agwe mary neptune or benjamin franklin his nod was grim soon thats all well have strength for ive never been so tired ethan not even in the cane fields pray to ezili too chapter a ship under control is in balance between the push of the wind and the resistance of the sea a rudder squirting it forward but if overcanvassed and badly balanced vessels can veer dangerously out of control at briennes direction we lashed a rope to the wheel to ease the strain of holding it got down our remaining shreds of canvas and rode bare poles before the wind but still had to steer carefully the storm kept shifting in a great gyre of cyclonic fury cranking to push us more and more to the north for hour after hour in the night all i could see was the dirty gray of sea foam as breaking waves rushed past our stern quarter a boil that bore all the malevolence of whatever gods wed offended despite the latitude i was numb with cold and dull with exhaustion astiza emerged from briennes cabin and kept me alive with rum and sausage harrys gone to sleep she told me so has martel i envy them i think the frenchman might die of his wounds better for him than meeting dessalines our bow was invisible in the dark but i could hear seas breaking there as if against a rock then a surge of water down the length of the deck that poured back off the diving bell had been lashed to the mainmast its window looking back at us like a cyclops eye the ship lifted itself from each swell as if old and weary french sailors and black freemen got the sails off except for two that had ripped to shreds and flailed in the wind and then hunched and clung like crustaceans everyone praying to their favorite saint the storm shrieked as id never heard anything before it strummed the spars till they whistled and drummed a moan that ate at me i waited for the entire shaking ship finally to come apart to dissolve into woody spray and be flung by the wind in a sleet of sawdust until nothing marked where wed ever been yet the bomb ketch while clumsy was also stout the ship wallowed like a sturdy toy staggering up from every swell and with each rise hope flickered maybe we could ride it out wed dive into a trough water would pour across and then wed surface a weary whale without any clear announcement of dawn our surroundings eventually grew lighter visibility slowly extending to the tip of the bowsprit and then beyond lead seas raced beside and we staggered up slopes of great watery hills for a view of salt mist before sliding into darker valleys id grabbed a chart but there was no possibility of telling where we were my vague plan was to return to capfrancois deliver the treasure and prisoners and then simply get away no lingering in paris no playing the diplomat i was done with great affairs and needed a thousand years to make up for the trauma id inflicted on my family id still find us a place where nothing ever happened will harry come through i asked astiza when i visited hes sick but his stomach has emptied she looked as exhausted as me he doesnt even know who he is ethan captivity separation war what a life ive given him im sorry astiza she looked doomed seeing something i couldnt we cant take the treasure to saintdomingue i promised the blacks she shook her head the treasure is cursed look at this storm it will do them more harm than good it was buried in that rock for a reason you say every treasure is cursed hasnt it been were not cursed to be poor i dont believe that what if the maroons werent storing the treasure but getting rid of it what if theyd found it wicked what if they went into that cave knowing they couldnt get out simply to save their own people no they were trapped by the current the treasure should go to mexico mexico there are no more aztecs just spanish overlords crueler and greedier than french and british combined its too late weve made a devils bargain ezili is a trickster ethan it was one womans suspicion of another well get to port and it will feel so right i tried to sound more confident than i felt weve been through worse remember not with a child she bit her lip this storm will have to pass sometime and miraculously it did first there was a gap in the clouds and light flooded down pushing back the boundaries of how far we could see wed been sailing through an atmosphere in which the border between sea and air was indistinct a fog of whipped spray and spume we breathed mist we tasted salt heavy as we staggered up watery slopes and weightless as we plunged down our universe was the heaving ocean but as the light broadened and brightened the wind began to drop precipitously the change was eerie the howl of the rigging subsided as if a discordant orchestra had taken an intermission pelee still lurched and dipped on chaotic seas but now the sound was the slap of slack lines against wood the creak of mortar against tackle the groan of the hull and the gush of sloppy water blue sky appeared overhead the blacks and french sailors shakily stood and looked up in wonder wed been reprieved in all directions was a dunescape of cresting seas water streaked white there was so much salt that even as wet wood gleamed the ship looked dusty little streams ran up and down gunnels and the air still smelled thick yet in minutes the tempest had turned into a weird calm was this divine intervention had god answered the catholics had astiza found the correct prayer was ezili present and helping jubal rotated looking around no land was in sight just a wall of clouds a few miles distant in every direction rearing into the sky this is very odd its like being in a well astiza looked thousands of feet up to that blue dome of sky its salvation i tried the treasure isnt cursed its blessed if ever there was a sign from god this is it dont you think our ketch swayed like a crazed cradle confused seas pitching it this way and that men crossed themselves ive heard of this brienne said fatalistically a false lull a miracle i insisted with more spirit than i felt we need to answer this mercy with our own when the waves subside well start a fire in the ships oven and make something hot for everyone even martels survivors jubal divide the crew into three shifts and let some sleep when the storm settles completely the french sailors can take some sights and well set a proper course the stars tonight will be brilliant after such a wind we can navigate lets tie down what is loose heave the dead overboard and get ready to hoist a steadying sail again astiza food into harry people began to do as i suggested four of martels ruffians were dead from wounds and exposure these were rolled without ceremony into the sea sinking in our wake i checked below my archenemy was still breathing and he opened his eyes to give me a weary baleful stare crow and his companions had a gimlet eye as well what happened to the wind martel asked its dropping what does that mean you lost martel his head lolled fatalistically water i gave him some and the need for the kindness made me doubt my own instinct for revenge should i really give him to dessalines but hed planned to send me a prisoner to france hadnt he i returned above debating the ship had become even more ungainly without the stiff wind so i asked brienne which sail to risk canvas would steady our roll and begin to give us a feeling of command he glanced around none monsieur surely a staysail would help would it not he pointed the clouds to our stern had drawn much closer while those at our bow were drawing away its what i feared we were simply in the storms eye the well of light was moving away from us our ship drifting from one side of it to the other the sky dimmed as if the almighty were drawing a curtain it was not a miracle monsieur but cruelty were not through the storm were in its middle and then with doubled violence the storm struck again chapter now the wind rose above comprehension and visibility vanished with hope rain and spray combined into a kind of soup you could almost drown in and the seas were cresting mountains they broke with thunder that competed with the ceaseless trumpeting of the sky and green water smashed down on pelee as if to drive us to the bottom the ship staggered the mast tips cutting great arcs and the weight of the mortar held the bow under for agonizingly long submergences then wed slowly stagger to the surface again water pouring off each watery pummel stripping away parts of our vessel like a remorseless rasp boats barrels lines and guns broke and disappeared i feared the bomb supply below would break loose and roll like marbles until a strike and spark set them off blowing us to pieces i waited for ropes to snap chains to break anchors to carry away we raced across the caribbean with only sheds of flapping canvas steering down swells like a sled before a force that was terrifyingly implacable i clutched the wheel with captain brienne and jubal i thought the worst was over the hurricanes make a great wheel and weve simply gone from one rim to another now it will get worse he pointed were too sluggish i looked at the mortar its muzzle had become a pot seawater slopping out pelee was dangerously unbalanced the huge gun yanked against the deck every time we rolled planks bulging and seams working the ship wouldnt point as intended or ride as designed what can we do everythings a risk wait i think so except for us at the wheel everyone else retreated below we lurched for an hour in the gloom timbers groaning as the waves grew higher then the decision was made for us jubal pointed surf i squinted the compass was spinning so wildly as we bucked and plunged that i had no idea of our true heading or what land we might be near but through the miasma i could see a menacing line of white on some lee shore marking a reef cliff or beach we had to steer around it or wed wreck but the hurricane was pushing us remorselessly toward disaster i turned to brienne can we claw off the land by sailing into the wind a jib might do it but only if we arent so bow heavy we cant sail as close to the wind as we need the mortar is a millstone i thought you said it too dangerous to get rid of and too unwieldy not to now we need to chop or saw ill get the men jubal had to shout it inches from my ear such was the fury of the storm theres a carpenters locker in my cabin brienne instructed jubal dropped to the main deck below i staggered into the captains cabin and explained to astiza why i was breaking out axes and saws were going to get rid of the mortar she nodded clutching a listless harry with one arm and holding on to a ships rib with the other she was seated with legs askance on the deck to brace herself as the vessel gyrated my wife and son both physically ill the floor was littered with smashed ceramics flung captains hats and a tin pot that rattled like a toy as it tumbled from one side to the other sheets of water obscured the stern windows the roar of the waves in here was like the boom of surf in a sea cave throw away the treasure ethan that will lighten us more than the mortar we cant survive on superstition i wasnt giving the loot up not after what wed all endured i looked at my son half unconscious were just having an elephant ride harry he pressed his face to his mothers breast in response pushing aside the fear we were all doomed i grabbed an armful of tools and went below the hold was almost black lit by one wildly swinging lamp water leaked from above and churned from the bilges below with an ungodly stench of sewage and vomit the noise was less catastrophic but the blind motion was terrifying the deck would drop as if were levitating and then lurch to slam like a bucking bull i had to slap some of jubals men to get them out of catatonic panic were going to get rid of the mortar stiffly tentatively holding on to the deck beams overhead men began to rise i turned to a sailor whos the ships carpenter he pointed to an older man crouched in the gloom stir yourself show us where to use these axes and saws or were all going to drown thats a big gun to move even in dry dock the carpenter muttered if we chop out the pins we can lever it overboard while timing the roll a sweet trick if you can manage it and disaster if you cant if it gets away it will crush the ship like a boot on a wedding cake and if it stays in place it will take us down like an anchor on a balloon we divided into two crews those in one group began hacking at the foundation of the mortar from the bottom wielding their tools overhead as best they could others crawled to chop and saw at the gun base from the exposed deck above tying themselves to a line that we stretched from mainmast to bowsprit to keep the men aboard as waves washed the deck hurry hurry i shouted to them as they climbed up the ladder to the outside were nearing a reef but time the final release to a wave when we can safely roll the monster monsieur gage what about us it was martel sitting in the hold in chains where the former slaves had locked him he seemed more alert now and pointed to his fellows just stay out of our way he grimaced from the pain of his wounds it will go faster with more help and four of my men are still fit enough to labor chain me like a dog if you must but for heavens sake use stout backs to save your wife and son i hesitated i trusted leon martel about as much as an arthritic earl should trust the flexible filly of a wife he bought with illgotten inheritance but time was of the essence every second we saved getting iron off our bow gave us a better chance to steer away from that lee shore i had a pistol and a knife and he and his scoundrels did not dont leave us here to drown american one of his men added well some of the bastards were dead others wounded and the starch had been beaten out of everyone so i unlocked the four healthiest ones including crow they wept with gratitude you have chosen as a saint would crow assured then work to save your life and ours rocks are near the hammering and rasping had become more frantic i turned to join the others on deck but id promised martel a fatal meeting with dessalines hadnt i the last thing that bastard wanted was a successful conclusion to our voyage and the only way his henchmen would get freedom and the treasure was by dooming the rest of us they figured all this i realized later theyd plotted with the desperation of the condemned so i was clubbed from behind i fell and skidded dazed the shackle key ring leaving my fingers someone snatched it up and i heard the rattle of more chains unlocking i rolled and tried shooting but my pistol was soaked and snapped uselessly a wounded ruffian staggered at me and an ax fell toward my head i jerked to one side just in time the weapon thunked into the deck sticking which gave me time to heave up and shove a knife into the bastards ribs he was buzzard i think he gasped stiffened and fell everything was in awkward slow motion from the sickening heave of the deck the other gang members were ignoring me crawling forward to frantically knock open strongboxes and stuff their pockets with treasure where was martel i yanked out the ax from the floorboards the bloody knife in my other hand the frenchman was crawling the opposite way making for the stern a length of chain was still hooked to one ankle and dragging like a lizard tail was he trying to hide no hed seized a hatchet with horror i realized what he meant to do leon stop he turned eyes haunted lips a crooked sneer mercy is always stupid if you dont work the ship well die and if i do ill still die but slowly and in a great deal of pain for the long cruel pleasures of the haitian rebels goodbye ethan gage ill take my chances with the sea he wriggled into the compartment where the wheels cables led down to pulleys and the straining rudder no i cried theres a shoal i scrabbled desperately after him perhaps his plan if he had one was to throw the vessel into such chaos that his own men could retake the ship more likely he simply wanted to take us down with him i wont let you kill my family you killed them by defying me he called you killed them by letting your wife shoot me me martel your only hope i threw the knife but he was too far away and wedged tightly amid the wheel ropes the blade bounced harmlessly off a timber i charged with the ax but couldnt reach him in time he swung his hatchet grunting against the pain and chopped one of the rudder cables for bonaparte the rope was already tight as a harpsichord wire strained against the relentless push of the ocean now it snapped like a whip lashing him as it did so he was flung like a toy ribs audibly cracking and smacked against the slack cables of the suddenly useless rudder evil satisfied martel glanced up toward the deck where my wife and son waited instantly we lost steerage the ship spun and everyone tumbled screaming as they realized we were lost if our orientation to the waves couldnt be controlled a loose mortar could be catastrophic ill see you in hell gage i grabbed the ladder to ascend to the quarterdeck to shout warning the storm was catastrophic as we yawed i dimly saw jubal and his fellows in front of me clinging for purchase each wave that cascaded down the decks length washing wood chips with it the mortar was rocking violently its foundation loose but instead of tipping it carefully wed created a oneton peril now the ship was turning broadside entirely out of control captain brienne clung to the wheel looking at me with horror what have you done it was martel and then calling ahead jubal dont loosen the mortar get back my friend heard his name he pulled himself by line toward the mast one ear cupped the entire ketch began to tilt we were broaching sideways to the seas a monster comber rose a cathedral of water and because we were at the far edge of the storm now a watery sun thrust beams of light on the chaotic sea for just a moment the crest of the wave glowed green as an emerald then it broke an explosion of foam and rushed down like a mountain avalanche jubal grabbed the mast just in time i braced myself in the hatchway the breaker hit we rolled completely sideways masts parallel to the sea and light vanished we were underwater or rather smothered in a mattress of foam tons and tons of seawater slamming as if to drive our vessel to the bottom even submerged i heard a snap as the mortar its pins half chopped through broke loose it tore out of the deck and smashed overboard plunging for the bottom like a stone a ragged mouth in the deck marked where it had been water surged through the sudden gap and poured into the hull the gun had also broken the stays holding up the foremast so it went over lines jerking like dancing snakes the ships rigging was broken and all hope of controlling the vessel was gone several of jubals companions and french sailors vanished into the sea with the gun pulled underwater by the rope they had tied to miraculously pelee s ballast worked its leverage and we rolled upright again staggering then another crack like a tree falling in a forest and the mainmast went over a broadside wave and the mast and my black friend were washed away like driftwood i looked back at the wheel it had disappeared too so had brienne with water pouring in the loss of the mortar had the opposite effect wed intended the ship settled at the bow even more sluggishly than before and pitched in the seas as aimlessly as a piece of driftwood the angle of the deck was steepening as the vessel began to sink i crawled toward the captains cabin fighting through surf all was lost and there was only one thing left to accomplish now i had to save astiza and harry chapter it was an uphill climb to the cabin of the pelee we were at the complete mercy of the sea being driven toward a reef every man left now to god and glory the strongboxes were broken the glorious artifacts of tenochtitlan clutched desperately like talismans by drowning men or rattling loose like seashells in the surf my own mind fogged with fury that napoleon bonaparte himself had set this disaster in motion as martel claimedthat hed used my family and me as puppetswas beyond ordinary political calculation id spent nearly a year plummeting toward this disaster in pursuit of ancient trinkets that were no more likely to produce real flying machines than scribbles at an asylum my son had been kidnapped and his mind likely scarred all to further lunatic aims of invading britain madness what i could do now was what id been trying from the beginning to save my family the cabins latch had broken and its door flapped and banged i hoisted past it to the chaotic cave the cabin had become awash in water and broken furniture the tier of stern windows was half smashed in shards of glass sliding in seawater it was dim to see astiza holding harry what happened everything upended i saw her by briennes bunk her face cut youre hurt afraid are we going down martel cut the rudder cable were nothing more than a driftwood wreck i love you ethan she called it yards out of reach you did what you thought best i clung to that thought like i did to a bulkhead but had more urgent things that needed saying or so i thought the confirmation of my love for her could come later so do we miscalculate the dim light was growing even darker and i could see a mountain of water rising astern a wave higher and higher green and glassy streaked with foam the largest wave in fact that id ever seen it filled the view from the windows then it filled the sky the masts are gone we need to get out maybe we can find a hatch cover or grate to float off theres a reef nearby which likely means land the cabin exploded the rogue wave blew in the last of the windows to shove out the air and kick me against the boards the cabin filled with the sea foam boiling against its ceiling beams then the ocean sucked out as i tried to grip hauling at my weary fingers i gasped for air neckdeep in swirling water where were my wife and son astiza the storm answered me pelee was upending the decks becoming walls and i climbed its floor like a ladder leaping for the windows in the wreckage of the stern mullions hung like ragged ribbons beyond was the wilderness of water that had sucked out my wife and son i didnt hesitate i crawled through stood on the stern and watched the useless rudder come out of the sea to flap like a broken whale fluke then i dove as far as i could i managed to thrash to the backside of a comber trying to bury the ship which meant that instead of being pulled under by the vessels sinking i successfully struggled a few yards away kicking against the suck of the disappearing ketch even with my head above water it was hard to breathe the boundary between sea and air was indistinct i looked wildly about where was my family something bumped me and i frantically grasped it was the ships wheel a modest float but wood enough to help keep me from drowning i clung like a kit raccoon to its mothermy ship my treasure my friends and my family all gone the weight power and chill of the churning seawater seemed unbelievable i thought pelee was gone too but no at the edge of visibility she rose again like an emerging iceberg picked up by a wave curling toward that wicked line of white that marked a reef or a beach was martel still aboard her broken stern climbed toward the sky the rest still under and the entire mass of the vessel was hurled forward in the wave as if shot from a sling then the comber broke with a roar and there was a larger crash as thousands of tons of wood hit something solid splinters of oak and coral tossed up in the air like an exploding grenade the vessel had disintegrated after colliding with a reef fragments were whipped away by the wind ethan i whirled in the water astiza she rose in view to the top of the swell clutching what must be harry and then sank out of sight in the trough on the other side kicking while holding the broken wheel i began swimming to where i guessed she must be faster than i thought possible for a long minute i thought id lost her again in the chaos and then rain parted and i saw her hair like a tendril of seaweed playing on the water as she struggled to float i thrashed toward her shed disappear under the waves then rise again in tired struggle i kept fearing shed sink for good before i could get to the pair of them but no i made it i grabbed her hair and hauled her to me as she hacked and coughed i roughly took harry i feared the boy dead but he blinked at my squeeze and spat out seawater he was in shock incongruously on astizas neck was the golden pendant napoleon had granted us that n surrounded by a laurel leaf maybe that was the curse i yanked it off her and let it drop in the sea around my own neck was still the magnifying glass for the emerald i had swallowed the three of us clung to the wheel fragment but now our weight was almost doubled the wood sank and we sank with it the sea closing over our heads astiza released her grip and we floated up again harry and i carried by the wheel and my wife thrashing we need more wood i cried there salvation one of the ships masts rolled in the tempest like a log she gasped and paddled to me again exhausted as she grabbed we sank again so i decided to let go but when i tried she insistently pushed harry and the wheel against me and let go herself we surfaced ethan youre stronger hold on you take it too it wont float the three of us she coughed my strength is almost gone hold harry and well both swim for the mast then you take the wheel she shook her head harry needs it i cant carry him anymore ethan im fading she was drifting out of my reach keep the wood and our son come here ill help you swim dont you dare let him sink her eyes were glazed but her tone still urgent you mustnt let him go ethan hes your responsibility now she made swimming motions but they were feeble she almost lolled in the waves trying to take a breath in my exhaustion she was a thousand miles away this way i dont think she heard me because i sobbed the words and didnt have the strength myself to chase both her and the mast harry was wheezing half full of water and the wheel seemed pitifully inadequate i glanced back the breakers on the reef were close furious crashing down to throw off huge clouds of spume would any of us survive crossing those shallows we needed the mast a wave closed over harry and me pushing us down and so i kicked until finally the wheel fragment helped bring us up the mast rolled closer where was astiza there on a swell i saw the wave lift her up as if shed floated free of our miseries her beautiful black hair framed against green water like a sea fan as her head slipped below the surface the wave kept lifting her up up up so that i saw her entire body for a moment suspended as if captured in glass backlit by a watery sun a silhouette that left me aching with longing regret and shame her legs her dress suspended in green amber there was something else in the wave too a dark blob just below the surface it was our diving bell i realized like a waterlogged cork when the mainmast went over it must have floated free then astiza slid onto the swells backside and was gone astiza it was a croak not a cry harry and i went under again about to follow his mother i had energy for one last rise breaking clear the wheel beginning to loosen the wood our last hope slipped away so we sank a final time we too were doomed and then something gripped and hauled as strong as the arm of poseidon we erupted out of the water and were thrown onto the mast i retched trying to get air hold white man it was jubal hed been clinging to the timber and snagged us i tucked my arm inside a rope and as harry threatened to slip free the negro grabbed him and pulled my boy to his own chest his other arm locked on the mast as if welded no he was tied hed lashed himself to the wood astiza it was merely confusion i was about done hold and then it was our turn to be lifted skyward higher and higher impossibly high rising on the crest of a breaker as if the mainmast of pelee had become a flying machine itself we were hurled forward impossibly fast toward whatever was beyond that line of white and then fell as it broke we plummeted down like going over a waterfall thunder as the wave hit and broke on the coral the whole mast underwater we bumped and skidded on the reef i clung from instinct not sensibility while we rolled then somehow we were beyond tumbled upright into the air for another agonized breath and skimmed toward a beach where sand was almost black the log grounded started to suck back out and then another wave struck and we lurched even farther in water hammered sand filled every orifice and i had no sense of where i was or what i was doing let go jubal was waistdeep yanking to free me from the rope i came clear body battered harry hung from jubals arm as if dead the sight of my son was the only thing that kept me going so i stood staggering in the swirling surf and then we awkwardly plunged toward land the mast pursued as if to knock us flat after saving us i fell and it struck but it just knocked me farther ashore i crawled in foam while the wooden spar rolled away from me a final wave carried me far enough to get clear of the sea i wiggled upward like a turtle i was on terra firma i looked back at the fury wed survived the reef was a leaping boil of crashing waves and the water between it and shore a soup of foam beyond was a tormented sea some swells picked out by the sun and glowing green and blue and others shaded by dark cloud and gray as iron my body ached as if beaten by a club i was half blind from salt reddened from cuts and scratches and emptied of will i was also alive and horrified by that fact because it meant that i was still conscious enough to recognize that astiza whod seen our fate as she peered into the future was gone chapter i shuddered as id never shuddered in my life from cold exhaustion anxiety sorrow harry i couldnt stop shaking i looked dimly about there lay a great still form almost as dark and massive as a sea lion it was jubal lying on his side on the beach blowing sand made a horizontal hail that stung like insects i couldnt stand or even properly crawl on hands and knees the strength required was beyond me so i bellied toward him pitted by grit dreading the vacancy i might find on his other side but no there was little horus coughing and shivering as the great black hero kneaded his chest and served as human windbreak jubals staring eyes bulged from exhaustion like stones of quartz and obsidian he was enfeebled as i was but he gave a weary grin alive the negro had saved my son and me i dragged myself around so we formed shelter on both sides of harry the beach was dark volcanic sand just yards behind us mountainous surf was crashing but i couldnt bear to look at it i dreaded that it might give up the corpse of my wife so the three of us fell unconscious when i woke it was late day the sun was lost behind black cloud to the west where i presumed the hurricane had gone but the sky to the east was clearing the sea was pitching chaos and i was stiff with cold in this tropic clime we were pimpled with blown sand and surf had thrown so many great white drifts of foam upon our strand that it looked as if it had snowed palms had been stripped of most of their fronds no bird dared fly yet the world had been scoured groaning i sat up i felt completely hollowed of strength of emotion of purpose id presided over catastrophe id failed in what i now realized was the only important task in my life to love and be loved and to preserve that love by all means possible and necessary love the mambo had said that was the basis of faith my wife was gone for jewels and glory the vanity of my being important the nudging of world affairs shed suspected her fate when we first crossed the atlantic wed tried to steer destiny a different direction futility and yet shed gone with me onto pelee in the end never breathing a word of fear somehow she thought it would save harry somehow she still loved me shed said i clung to those words with wonder it took a while to steel myself to squint up and down the beach yes there were bodies there none looked like that of a woman jubal was stirring too can you take the boy up into the scrub while i check for survivors he followed my gaze we both knew there wouldnt be any why expose harry to a line of corpses oui ill look for uncontaminated water and meet you at that shattered palm he pointed and i nodded my mouth was cotton too i stood bent as an old man and staggered down to where the drowned rolled at the edge of the surf out beyond the waves still boomed on the reef and a thousand fragments of wood had been cast ashore from pelee enough to build a warm fire if i could figure out a way to light it i fingered my chest the magnifying glass was still around my neck maybe tomorrow if the sun came out astonishing how quickly we begin to think of the future even when defeated by the past we close ranks like a roman legion stepping over its own dead the beach was a quarter mile long between headlands i found five corpses two blacks three whites one had his mouth set in a rictus of a snarl it was martel napoleons agent seemed smaller and deflated in death his clothes shredded by coral his shoes missing his feet wrinkled and white our nemesis would have only one aerial flight it seemed a glide down to hell his eyes were open and staring with horror as if hed seen that descent yet was he really a tool of the first consul could his last act have been to lie about napoleon simply to torment me to mislead me that the political prometheus id been tied to for years the great bonaparte had betrayed me and my family for a miniature model of what might or might not be a flying machine i still had one of the toys in my pocket and reached to finger it with horror i felt a chain as well astizas pendant with napoleons cursed n had not sunk in the ocean it had perversely fallen back into my vest like a curse i couldnt get rid of was martel laughing from hades right now amused to think hed left me trusting nothing i nudged with my foot to roll over his body as i did so an arm flopped free its sleeve disintegrated the skin was so laced with coral cuts that for a second i didnt even spy the design on the inside of his bicep then it startled me i leaned closer it was a tattoo burned into his skin was a n surrounded by a laurel wreath the mark of bonaparte that the villain could tuck privately against his body leon martel hadnt lied he had not been a renegade policeman a refugee from the criminal underworld or at least not just that hed truly been napoleons agent as if on gods cue i doubled over then my gut wrenched and i scampered up the beach to answer natures urgent call at the edge of the scrub a gush of waste and seawater came out of me the filthy torrent leaving me shaking and there it was spattered with shit the stone id arguably sacrificed my wife and happiness for the wretched emerald cursed indeed i looked out to sea somewhere on that reef was the treasure of an ancient empire and id leave it to jubal whether to lead haitians back someday to dive if they dared salvage when the sea was smooth sapphire and angry gods were remote i couldnt bear it anymore and my own stone i was sorely tempted to kick it away or bury it in the sand its beauty was bitter reproach but then i thought of my boy motherless now and his father with no trade but gambling and adventure what kind of upbringing could i give him life doesnt stop and he had all of his ahead if astiza was truly gone i was his sole parent now and would have to decide what to do next maybe philadelphia and quakers to help put sense into him that i didnt have maybe hed absorb franklins wisdom when i had not i owed him time and hope or maybe a school in london where id be closer to my enemies so grimacing i wiped the damnable stone off and pocketed it too determined to sell it as a trust for my son i must remain destitute myself to remind me of the dross of dreams i must commit to something larger than my own retirement i had to find grim meaning out of disaster so i limped to make reunion with jubal and harry papa no cry gladdened my heart more that at last he seemed to recognize and need me he clung like a little monkey sobbing for reasons he didnt fully understand himself finally he asked which he must wheres mama there was no corpse id seen the diving bell and other jetsam yet there could be no reasonable hope either swimming horus i hadnt the heart to tell him what must be true shes not coming i sighed i hope shes saved herself somewhere else well pray for that you and me because shed like that im cold and scared of the ocean were safe for now and tomorrow well find help i miss mama me too more than i believed possible and so we wept united by tragedy ive missed you more than you know we slept as best we could the wind slowly dying in the night and by the next morning the sun was bright and birds were flying above a ravaged forest the sea had settled a great deal and thankfully sucked the bodies back out of sight of jubals remaining comrades including antoine we saw no sign so id killed them too i still trembled lest the sea give up astiza so long as it didnt there was the cruelest kind of hope i knew she must be dead so why did my heart deny it because there was something magical about her id sensed when digging her out from that first cannonshattered room in alexandria i couldnt imagine the world without her light id watched her drown yet didnt have the instinctual sense of loss i would have expected wed ended but i didnt feel it i needed a body and didnt have one where are we jubal asked i looked inland a huge mountain rose in the haze its top smoking perhaps montserrat i think we should walk the coast looking for a settlement or a boat antigua is not far and from there we can get passage home i found some plantain and coconut you hungry boy harrys gaze was a million miles away but not his appetite yes so that was it id been married and apparently widowed in less than a year and as stripped to my core as it was possible to be my survival was the worst punishment i could imagine i would see her suspended in that last green swell the rest of my life and yet her spirit still inhabited us why did i feel nagging hope i looked down at harry how what when would i tell him yet i was surprised by his expression he looked more determined than devastated lets look for mama while we walk did he share my instinct i swallowed yes and not find her lifeless body i prayed we started trudging down the beach i told jubal how he could decide whether to come back for the treasure astiza said it was cursed but maybe only for some of us ill ask cecile fatiman shell decide what to do be careful i think ezili misled me shes a jealous goddess what will you do next jubal try to rebuild my country and you ethan i was silent looking east at the watery horizon as we hiked martel said he was sent to betray me by the leader of the french i was an errand boy manipulated into a fatal quest so you must flee to america i thought that at first but britain i think to establish my boy in a good school i need to make him a future its the one country that has the resources to stand up to the french the english have flooded the continent with gold and spies to undermine bonapartes dictatorship which suggests jubal my real task which is revenge its the only meaning i can think of im going back to france harry needs a father ethan hell have one but first theres one task i owe the world you must forget the world no im going to hunt down and kill napoleon bonaparte
