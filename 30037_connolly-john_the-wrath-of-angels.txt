for professor ian campbell ross i i prefer winter and fall when you feel the bone structure of the landscape the loneliness of it the dead feeling of winter something waits beneath it the whole story doesnt show andrew wyeth at the time of his dying at the day and the hour of it harlan vetters summoned his son and his daughter to his bedside the old mans long gray hair was splayed against the pillow on which he lay glazed by the lamplight so that it seemed like the emanations of his departing spirit his breathing was shallow longer and longer were the pauses between each intake and exhalation and soon they would cease entirely the evening gloaming was slowly descending but the trees were still visible through the bedroom window the sentinels of the great north woods for old harlan had always said that he lived at the very edge of the frontier that his home was the last place before the forest held sway it seemed to him now that as his strength failed him so too his power to keep nature at bay was ebbing there were weeds in his yard and brambles among his rose bushes the grass was patchy and unkempt it needed one final mow before the coming of winter just as the stubble on his own chin rasped uncomfortably against his fingers for the girl could not shave him as well as he had once shaved himself fallen leaves lay uncollected like the flakes of dry skin that peeled from his hands his lips and his face scattering themselves upon his sheets he saw decline through his window and decline in his mirror but in only one was there the promise of rebirth the girl claimed that she had enough to do without worrying about bushes and trees and his boy was still too angry to perform even this simple service for his dying father but to harlan these things were important there was a battle to be fought an ongoing war against natures attritional impulse if everyone thought as his daughter did then houses would be overrun by root and ivy and towns would vanish beneath seas of brown and green a man had only to open his eyes in this county to see the ruins of old dwellings suffocated in green or open his ears to hear the names of settlements that no longer existed lost somewhere in the depths of the forest so nature needed to be held back and the trees had to be kept to their domain the trees and what dwelled among them harlan was not a particularly religious man and had always poured scorn on those whom he termed godbotherers christian jew or muslim he had no time for any of them but he was in his way a deeply spiritual being worshipping a god whose name was whispered by leaves and praised in birdsong he had been a warden with the maine forest service for forty years and even after his retirement his knowledge and expertise had often been sought by his successors for few knew these woods as well as he it was harlan who had found twelveyearold barney shore after the boys father collapsed while hunting his heart exploding so quickly in his chest that he was dead within seconds of hitting the ground the boy in shock and unused to the woods had wandered north and when the snow began to descend he had hidden himself beneath a fallen tree and would surely have died there had harlan not been following his tracks so that the boy heard the old man calling his name just as the snow covered the traces of his passing it was to harlan and to harlan alone that barney shore told the tale of the girl in the woods a girl with sunken eyes and wearing a black dress who had come to him with the first touch of snow inviting him to follow her deeper into the woods calling on him to play with her in the northern darkness but i hid from her and i didnt go with her barney told harlan as the old man carried him south upon his back why not son said harlan because she wasnt a little girl not really she just looked like one i think she was very old i think shed been there for a long long time and harlan had nodded and said i think youre right for he had heard tales of the lost girl in the woods although he had never seen her himself unless dreams counted and he prayed to his god of air and tree and leaf that he might always be spared the sight of her there was a time though when he had felt her presence and he had known as he was searching for the boy that he was once again drawing close to her territory he shuddered and thought carefully before he spoke if i were you son i wouldnt mention the girl to anyone else he said at last and he felt the boy nod against him i know he said they wouldnt believe me anyway would they no i reckon theyd think you were suffering from shock and exposure and theyd put it down to that most of them but you believe me dont you oh yes i believe you she was real wasnt she i dont know if thats the word id use for her i dont reckon that you could touch her or smell her or feel her breath upon your face i dont know that you could see her footprints indented in the snow or discern the stain of sap and leaf upon her skin but if youd followed her like she asked then id never have found you and im certain that nobody else would ever have found you either alive or dead you did well to keep away from her youre a good boy a brave boy your daddy would be proud against his back began the convulsions of the boys sobs it was the first time he had cried since harlan had discovered him good thought harlan the longer it takes for the tears to come the worse the pain will you find my daddy too said the boy will you bring him home i dont want him to stay in the woods i dont want the girl to have him yes said harlan ill find him and you can say goodbye to him and he did harlan was already in his seventies by then and he had a few more years left in him but he was no longer the man he once had been even though he and he alone had found barney shore age was part of it that was for sure but so too were the losses he had endured his wife angeline had been taken from him by a cruel alliance of parkinsons and alzheimers one year before barney shore spoke to him of predatory girls he had loved her as much as a man can love his wife and so nothing more need be said the loss of his wife was the second such blow that harlan would receive in less than a year shortly after she passed away paul scollay harlans oldest and closest friend had sat on a bucket in the little woodshed at the back of his cabin put his shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger the cancer had been nibbling at him for a while and now had got a taste for him he put an end to its feeding as he had always told his friend that he would they had shared a drink earlier in the day just a beer or two at the pine table beside that very woodshed with the sun setting behind the trees as beautiful an evening as harlan had seen in many a year they had reminisced some and paul had seemed relaxed and at peace with himself which was how harlan had known that the end was near he did not remark upon it though they had simply shaken hands and harlan had said that he would see paul around and paul had replied ayuh i guess so and that was the end of it and though they spoke of many things in those final hours there was one subject upon which they did not touch one memory that was not disinterred they had agreed years before that they would not talk of it unless absolutely necessary but it hung between them in the last of their time together as the sun bathed them in its radiance like the promise of forgiveness from a god in whom neither of them believed and so it was that at the time of his dying at the day and the hour of it harlan vetters summoned his son and his daughter to his bedside the woods waiting beyond the god of tree and leaf moving through them coming at last to claim the old man and he said to them once upon a time paul scollay and i found an airplane in the great north woods fall was gone vanished in wisps of white cloud that fled across clear blue skies like pale silk scarves snatched by the breeze soon it would be thanksgiving although it seemed that there was little for which to be thankful as the year drew to its close people i met on the streets of portland spoke of working second jobs to make ends meet of feeding their families with cheap cuts of meat while their savings dwindled and their safety nets fell away they listened while candidates for high office told them the answer to the countrys problems was to make the wealthy wealthier so that more crumbs from their table might fall into the mouths of the poor and some while pondering the unfairness of it wondered if that was better than no crumbs at all along commercial street some tourists still wandered behind them a great cruise ship perhaps the last of the season loomed impossibly high over the wharves and warehouses its prow reaching out to touch the buildings facing the sea the water supporting it invisible from the street so that it seemed a thing discarded marooned in the aftermath of a tsunami away from the waterfront the tourists petered out entirely and at the great lost bear there were none at all not as afternoon melted into evening the bear saw only a small but steady stream of locals pass through its doors that day the kind of familiar faces that ensure bars remain in business even during the quietest of times and as the light faded and the blue of the sky began to darken the bear prepared to ease itself into the kind of gentle warm mood where conversations were hushed and music was soft and there were places in the shadows for lovers and friends and places too for darker conversations she was a small woman a single swath of white running through her short black hair like the coloring of a magpie with an sshaped scar across her neck that resembled the passage of a snake over pale sand her eyes were a very bright green and rather than detracting from her looks the crows feet at their corners drew attention to her irises enhancing her good looks when she smiled she looked neither older nor younger than her years and her makeup was discreetly applied i guessed that most of the time she was content to be as god left her and it was only on those rare occasions when she came down to the cities for business or pleasure that she felt the need to prettify herself as my grandfather used to term it she wore no wedding ring and her only jewelry was the small silver cross that hung from a cheap chain around her neck her fingernails were cut so close that they might almost have been bitten down except the ends were too neat too even an injury to her black dress pants had been repaired with a small triangle of material on the right thigh expertly done and barely noticeable they fitted her well and had probably been expensive when she bought them she was not the kind to let a small tear be their ruination i imagined that she had worked upon them herself not trusting in another not willing to waste money on what she knew she could do better with her own hands a mans shirt pristine and white hung loose over the waist of her pants the shirt tailored so that it came in tight at the waist her breasts were small and the pattern of her brassiere was barely visible through the material the man beside her was twice her age and then some he had dressed in a brown serge suit for the occasion with a yellow shirt and a yellowandbrown tie that had come as a set perhaps with a handkerchief for the suit pocket that he had long ago rejected as too ostentatious funeral suits my grandfather called them although with a change of tie they served equally well for baptisms and even weddings if the wearer wasnt one of the main party and even though he had brought out the suit for an event that was not linked to a church happening to an arrival into or departure from this world and had polished his reddishbrown shoes so that the pale scuffing at the toes looked more like the reflection of light upon them still he wore a battered cap advertising scollays guide taxidermy in a script so ornate and curlicued that it took a while to decipher by which time the wearer would in all likelihood have managed to press a business card upon you and inquire as to whether you might have an animal that needed stuffing and mounting and if not whether you felt like rectifying that situation by taking a trip into the maine woods i felt a tenderness toward him as he sat before me his hands clasping and unclasping his mouth halfforming slight awkward smiles that faded almost as soon as they came into existence like small waves of emotion breaking upon his face he was an old man and a good one although i had met him for the first time only within the hour his decency shone brightly from within and i believed that when he left this world he would be mourned greatly and the community of which he was a part would be poorer for his passing but i understood too that part of my warmth toward him arose from the days particular associations it was the anniversary of my grandfathers death and that morning i placed flowers upon his grave and sat for a time by his side watching the cars pass by on their way to and from prouts neck and higgins beach and ferry beach locals all it was strange but i had often stood by my fathers grave and felt no sense of his presence similarly for my mother who had outlived him by only a few years they were elsewhere long gone but something of my grandfather lingered amid the scarborough woods and marshes for he loved that place and it had always brought him peace i knew that his god for each man has his own god let him wander there sometimes perhaps with the ghost of one of the many dogs that had kept him company through his life yapping at his heels scaring the birds from the rushes and chasing them for the joy of it my grandfather used to say that if god did not allow a man to be reunited with his dogs in the next life then he was no god worth worshiping that if a dog did not have a soul then nothing had im sorry i said what did you say an airplane mr parker said marielle vetters they found an airplane we were in a back booth of the bear with nobody else near us behind the bar dave evans the owner and manager was wrestling with a troublesome beer tap and in the kitchen the line chefs were preparing for the evenings food orders i had closed off the area in which we sat with a couple of chairs so that we would remain undisturbed dave never objected to such temporary changes of use anyway he would have more significant worries that evening at a table near the door sat the fulci brothers with their mother who was celebrating her birthday the fulcis were almost as wide as they were tall had cornered the market in polyester clothing that always looked a size too small for them and were medicated to prevent excessive mood swings which meant only that any damage caused by nonexcessive mood swings would probably be limited to property and not people their mother was a tiny woman with silver hair and it seemed impossible that those narrow hips could have squeezed out two massive sons who had it was said required speciallybuilt cribs to contain them whatever the mechanics of their birth the fulcis loved their mother a lot and always wanted her to be happy but especially so on her birthday thus it was that they were nervous about the impending celebrations which made dave nervous which made the line chefs nervous one of them had already cut himself with a carving knife when informed that he was to be solely responsible for looking after the fulci familys orders that evening and had requested permission to lie down for a while in order to calm his nerves welcome i thought to just another night at the bear you mind me asking you something ernie scollay had said shortly after he and marielle had arrived and id offered them a drink which theyd declined and then a coffee which theyd accepted not at all i replied you got business cards right yes i removed one from my wallet just to convince him of my bona fides the card was very simple black on white with my name charlie parker in bold along with a cell phone number a secure email address and the nebulous phrase investigative services so you got a business just about he gestured at his surroundings then how come you dont have a proper office i get asked that a lot well maybe if you had an office then you wouldnt get asked it so much he said and it was hard to argue with his logic offices are expensive to keep if i had one id have to spend time in it to justify renting it that seems kind of like putting the cart before the horse he considered this then nodded maybe it was my clever use of an agricultural metaphor although i doubted it more likely it was my reluctance to waste money on an office that i didnt need in which case i wouldnt be inclined to pass on any associated costs to my clients one ernest scollay esq included but that was earlier and now we had moved on to the purpose of the meeting i had listened to marielle tell me of her fathers final days and her description of the rescue of the boy named barney shore and even though she had stumbled a little as she told of the dead girl who had tried to lure barney deeper into the forest she had kept eye contact and had not apologized for the oddness of the tale and i in turn had expressed no skepticism for i had heard the story of the girl of the north woods from another many years before and i believed it to be true after all i had witnessed stranger things myself but now she had come to the airplane and the tension that had been growing between her and ernie scollay the brother of her fathers best friend became palpable like a static charge in the air this i felt had been the subject of much discussion even argument between them scollay appeared to pull back slightly in the booth clearly distancing himself from what was about to be said he had come with her because he had no choice marielle vetters planned to reveal some if not all of what her father had told her and scollay had known that it was better to be here and witness what transpired than to sit at home fretting about what might be said in his absence did it have markings i asked markings numbers and letters to identify it its called an nnumber here and its usually on the fuselage and always begins with the letter n if the plane was registered in the united states oh no my father couldnt see any identification marks and most of the plane was hidden anyway that didnt sound right nobody was going to fly a plane without registration markings of some kind are you sure very he said that it had lost part of a wing when it came down though and most of the tail was gone did he describe the plane to you he went looking for pictures of similar aircraft and thought that it might have been a piper cheyenne or something like it it was a twinengined plane with four or five windows along the side i used my phone to pull up an image of the plane in question and what i saw seemed to confirm marielles statement about the absence of markings the plane had its registration number on the vertical fin of its tail if that was gone and any other markings were on the underside of the wing then the plane would have been unidentifiable from the outside what did you mean when you said that most of the plane was hidden i asked had someone tried to conceal its presence marielle looked at ernie scollay he shrugged best tell the man mari he said wont be much stranger than what hes heard already it wasnt a person or people that did it she said my father told me that it was the forest itself he said the woods were conspiring to swallow the plane they would never even have found the airplane had it not been for the deer the deer and the worst shot of paul scollays life as a bow hunter scollay had few equals harlan vetters had never known a man like him even as a boy hed had a way with a bow and with a little proper training harlan believed that paul could even have been an olympic contender he was a natural with the weapon the bow becoming an extension of his arm of himself his accuracy wasnt merely a matter of pride to him although he loved hunting he never killed anything that he couldnt eat and he aimed to despatch his prey with the very minimum of pain harlan felt the same way and for that reason he had always preferred a good rifle with which to hunt he didnt trust himself with a bow during archery hunting season in october he preferred to accompany his friend as a spectator admiring his skill without ever feeling the need to participate but as paul grew older he came to prefer the rifle to the bow he had arthritis in his right shoulder and in a half dozen other places too paul used to say that the only major part of his body in which he didnt have arthritis was the one place where he would have appreciated a little more stiffness if the good lord could have seen his way to answering that kind of prayer which in pauls experience he never did the good lord apparently having better things with which to occupy himself than male erectile dysfunction so paul was the better shot with a bow and harlan the superior hunter with a rifle in the years that followed harlan would muse upon the likelihood that had it been he who took the first shot at the deer none of this business for good or bad would have happened but then they had always seemed opposites in so many ways these two men harlan was softly spoken where his friend was loud dry where he was obvious driven and conscientious where paul often seemed aimless and unfocused harlan was thin and wiry a fact that had sometimes led drunks and fools to underestimate his strength even though only a strong man could have carried a griefstricken boy for miles across rough snowcovered ground without stumble or complaint even in his seventies paul scollay was softer and fatter but it was padding over muscle and he was fast for a big man those who did not know them well had them pegged for an odd couple two men whose diverse personalities and appearances allowed them to form a single whole like two matching pieces of a jigsaw their relationship was much more complex than that and their similarities were more pronounced than their differences as is always the case with men who maintain lifelong friendships with each other rarely allowing a harsh word to pass between them and always forgiving any that do they shared a common outlook on the world a similar view of their fellow man and their obligations toward him when harlan vetters carried barney shore home on his back the beams of flashlights and the raised voices guiding him at the last to the main search party he did so with the ghost of his friend walking by his side an unseen presence that watched over the boy and the old man and perhaps kept the girl in the woods at bay for after barney shore had spoken of her harlan had become aware of movement in the trees to his right a roving darkness obscured by the falling snow as though the mere mention of her existence had somehow drawn the girl to them he had chosen not to look though he feared that was what the girl wanted because if he looked he might stumble and if he stumbled he might break and if he broke then she would fall upon them both boy and man and they would be lost to her it was then that he called upon his old friend and he could not have said if paul had truly come to him or if harlan had simply created the illusion of his presence as a source of comfort and discipline all he knew was that a kind of solace came over him and whatever was shadowing them in the forest had retreated with what might have been a disappointed hiss or just the sound of a branch surrendering its weight of snow until at last it was gone from them entirely and as he lay on his deathbed harlan wondered if the girl had remembered him if she had recalled him from that first day the day of the deer the day of the airplane they had started late harlans truck had been acting up and pauls was in the shop theyd almost not headed out at all but it was beautiful weather and they had already made their preparations their clothing their checked woolrich jackets their wool pants from renys and their union suits the onepiece garments of underwear that would keep them warm even when wet had been stored overnight in sealed bags of cedar to mask their human scent and they had eschewed bacon and sausage patties in favor of oatmeal for breakfast they had food in sealed containers and each carried a bottle in which to pee as well as a flask from which to drink dont want to go getting those two mixed up paul would always say and harlan would laugh dutifully so they had pleaded like children for harlans daughter to allow them to use her car and she had eventually relented she had recently returned to live with her parents following the breakup of her marriage and spent most of her time mooning around the house as far as paul could tell he had always considered her to be a good kid though and thought her an even better one after she handed over her car keys to them it was already after three when they parked the car and entered the woods they spent the first hour or so just jawing and giving each other the pickle heading for some old clearcut that they knew which now had second growth timbers beloved of deer alders birches and popples as men of their age tended to call poplar trees they each carried a winchester and moved softly on their rubbersoled ll bean boots harlan had a compass but he barely glanced at it they knew where they were going paul carried matches a rope to drag the carcass and two pairs of household gloves to wear while dressing the animal and to protect against ticks harlan had the knives and shears in his pack harlan and paul practiced what was known as still hunting not for them the use of stands or canoes or groups of men to drive the deer onto their guns they relied solely on their eyes and their experience seeking traces of buck sign the rubs where the bucks were drawn to smoothbarked aromatic trees like pine and balsam and spruce the deer beds where they lay down and the desire lines that the deer used to traverse the shortest distance between two points in the woods thereby conserving their energy as it was now afternoon they knew the deer would be moving to low ground where the cold air would drive scents down so they walked parallel to the ridge lines harlan seeking trace on the ground while paul kept an eye on the surrounding woods for movement after harlan came upon red hairs caught on some blades of grass and signs of big deer rub on a mature balsam both men grew silent the hunt drew on the urgency of it growing as the light dimmed but it was paul who caught first sight of the deer a big ninepoint buck probably weighing close on two hundred pounds by the time paul spotted him the bucks tail was already raised high in alarm and it was preparing to run but it was only thirty feet away from him if that paul went for the shot but he rushed it he saw the deer falter and stumble as the bullet struck and then it turned and fled it was such a spectacular miss that he would scarcely have believed it if he hadnt witnessed it with his own eyes the kind of misfire he usually associated with neophyte hunters from away who fancied themselves as wilderness men even while their fingers still bore the inkstains of their office jobs hed known more than one guide whod been forced to finish off a wounded animal after his client or sport had failed to find the mark the sport lacking the energy the guts or the decency to follow the trail of the wounded animal in order to put it out of its misery back in the day theyd kept a blacklist of such sports and guides were discreetly warned of the risks of accompanying them into the woods hell paul scollay himself had been among those whod been forced to track a wounded deer and finish it off hating the suffering of the beast the waste of its life force and the stain that the slow manner of its dying was destined to leave upon his soul but now he had become just such a man and as he watched the agonized buck vanish into the dark woods he could barely speak jesus he said at last what the hell was that ham shot said harlan cant be sure but he could go far paul looked from the rifle to his fingertips and back again hoping that the blame for what had transpired might be found in damage to the sights or a visible weakness in his own hand there was nothing to be seen and later he would often wonder if that was the sign the moment when his body began to fail when the process of contamination and ruination commenced as though the cancer had sprung into being in the seconds between squeezing the trigger and firing the bullet and the error had been caused by his body spasming minutely in sudden awareness of the first cell being turned against itself but all that came later for now all harlan and paul knew for sure was that they had caused a mortal injury to an animal and they had a duty to end its suffering a pall had been cast over the day and harlan wondered how long it would be before paul went hunting again not that season certainly it wasnt in pauls nature to return to the woods and prove that the miss had been a oneoff no he would brood over it and consider his gun and practice some on the range at the back of his house only when he had racked up bull after bull would he consider aiming once again at a living animal the buck left a clear trail for them to follow dark red blood and panic excrement splashed on bushes and leaves they moved as fast as they could but both were older men now and the pace quickly wore on them the buck disoriented and in agony was not cleaving to any known trail and it seemed to be making no attempt to cut behind them to familiar ground their progress slowed soon they were bathed in sweat and a low branch gave harlan a bad scratch to his left cheek that bled into the collar of his shirt it would need stitches but paul pulled a couple of adhesive strips from the first aid pack to hold the cut together and eventually it began to clot and the bleeding stopped although the pain made harlans eyes water and he thought that there might be a splinter buried in the wound the woods grew darker the branches meeting above their heads to cut off the sunlight and then the clouds came and what little light there had been was suddenly obscured and the air grew colder around them all warmth now gone so quickly that harlan could feel the sweat cooling upon him he examined his compass it told them that they were moving west but the last known position of the sun gave the lie to it and when he tapped it again the needle shifted position and west became east and after that the needle didnt spin exactly not like it did in those fantasy films that they showed at the movie theaters in summer but it refused to remain fixed you keep that with your knife asked paul a knife could throw off the magnetism of a compass no i never do as if hed make that kind of amateur error well somethings up with it ayuh harlan and paul knew that they were heading north though neither of them suggested that they should turn back and leave the buck to its fate not even as the day died and the foliage became denser the trees older the light dimmer soon it was dark and they resorted to flashlights to guide them but they did not give up on the animal the blood was not drying out which meant the injury was fatal and the buck was still suffering they would not leave it to die in pain ernie scollay interrupted the tale that was my brothers way he said harlans too he added although it was clear that his focus was on his late brother they werent going to give up on the buck they werent cruel men you have to understand that do you hunt no i said and i watched as he tried to hide a kind of smugness as though i had confirmed a suspicion he had of me and of my innate city softness then it was my turn to add something not animals and maybe it was petty but there was some small pleasure to be derived from watching his expression change anyhow he continued my brother never wanted to see a living thing suffer animal or human he swallowed and his voice broke on his next words not even himself at the end marielle reached out her right hand and placed it gently upon ernie scollays knitted fingers ernie is right she said you should know mr parker that they were both good men i think they did the wrong thing and their reasons for doing it werent wholly justified not even to themselves but it was uncharacteristic of them i said nothing because there was nothing to be said and they were moving ahead of themselves they were no longer talking about the buck but what came after all i would have by which to judge these two dead men was the tale itself and that was not yet ended you were telling me about the buck i said it was standing at the edge of a clearing swaying on its legs blood and froth at its mouth the lower part of its hide soaked in red harlan and paul couldnt figure out how it had kept going for so long yet it had barely slowed until the last mile or so when they at last started to catch up with it and now here it was seemingly dying where it stood but as they drew closer it inclined its head toward them and then back in the direction of the clearing the trees were so thick at either side of it that if it had the strength to do so it could only go on or come back in their direction and it seemed torn between the two choices its eyes rolled and it sighed deep in itself and shook its head in what harlan thought was almost resignation with the life that was left to it the buck turned and ran at them harlan raised his gun and blasted the animal in the chest its momentum took it onward even as its forelegs collapsed beneath it and it came to rest barely inches from its killers harlan thought that hed never felt worse about an animal and he hadnt even fired the original errant shot the bucks strength its desire to survive had been enormous it had deserved to live or at least to die a better death he looked to his friend and saw that his eyes were wet it came right at us said harlan but it wasnt charging us said paul i think it was trying to run away from what asked harland after all what could be worse than the men who were trying to kill it i dont know said paul but its the damnedest thing the damnedest thing agreed harlan but it wasnt the damnedest thing it wasnt at all ernie scollay excused himself and headed to the mens room i went to the bar to retrieve the coffee pot in order to freshen our cups jackie garner walked in while i was waiting for the coffee to finish brewing jackie occasionally did a little work for me and he was a bosom buddy of the fulcis who looked up to him the way they did to the handful of people whom they considered saner than themselves without being square he was carrying a bunch of flowers and a box of fudge from the old port candy company on fore street for mrs fulci yeah she likes fudge not almond though she has an allergy we wouldnt want to kill her i said it might cast a pall over the celebrations you okay jackie looked flustered and distracted my mom he said jackies mother was a force of nature she made mrs fulci look like june cleaver acting up again nah shes sick nothing serious i hope jackie winced she doesnt want people to know how bad is it can we talk about it another time sure he slipped past me and there were cries of delight from the fulcis table they were so loud that they made dave evans drop a glass and reach for the phone to call the cops its okay i told them thats their happy sound how can you tell nobody got hit oh thank god cupcake cathys made her a cupcake birthday cake she likes cupcakes right cupcake cathy was one of the bears waitstaff she had a sideline in baking the kind of cupcakes that led strongwilled men to propose marriage in the hope of ensuring a regular supply even if they were married already they figured their wives would probably understand she likes cake as far as i know mind you if there are nuts in it it could kill her apparently she has an allergy dave paled jesus christ i better check cant hurt like i told jackie garner hard to see the evening recovering from the death of the birthday girl i took the coffee pot to the table refilled our cups then gave it to one of the waitresses to bring back marielle vetters sipped delicately from her cup her lipstick left no mark its a nice bar she said it is how come they let you use it for this her left hand drifted lightly through the air her index finger raised a gesture that contained both elegance and amusement something of it was in her face too the faintest hint of a smile despite the nature of the story that she was engaged in telling i work the bar sometimes so youre a parttime private investigator i prefer to think of myself as a parttime bartender anyway i like it here i like the staff i even like most of the customers and i guess its different right different from not hunting animals thats right you werent just kidding either no i wasnt the smile came again a little uneasier this time ive read about you in the newspapers and on the internet what happened to your wife and child i just dont know what to say susan and jennifer were gone taken from me by a man who thought that by spilling their blood he could fill the emptiness inside himself the subject of them frequently came up with new clients i had come to realize that whatever was said came with the best of intentions and people needed to mention it more for their own sakes than for mine thank you i said i heard i dont know if its true that you have another daughter now thats right does she live with you i mean are you still you know no she lives with her mother in vermont i see her as often as i can i hope you dont think that i was prying im not a stalker i just wanted to find out as much as i could about you before i started sharing my fathers secrets with you i know some cops in the county nobody in maine ever referred to it as aroostook county just the county and i was tempted to ask them about you as well i figured they might be able to tell me more than i could find online in the end i decided it would be better to say nothing and just see what you were like in person and hows that working out okay i guess i thought youd be taller i get that a lot better than i thought youd be slimmer or i thought youd have more hair she rolled her eyes and they say women are vain are you fishing for compliments mr parker no i figure that pond is all fished out i let a few seconds elapse why did you decide not to ask the police about me i think you know the answer already because you didnt want anyone to wonder why you might need the services of a private investigator thats right lots of people hire investigators for lots of reasons cheating husbands im not married anymore and for the record i cheated on him i raised an eyebrow are you shocked she asked no i just wish hed had my card business is business it made her laugh he was a jerk worse than a jerk he deserved it so why else do people hire you she said insurance fraud missing persons background checks it sounds dull its safe for the most part but not all the time not for the kind of investigation that ends up with your name in the papers the kind that ends with people dying no but sometimes investigations start out as one thing and mutate into another usually because someone tells lies right from the start the client its been known to happen i wont lie to you mr parker thats reassuring to hear unless that itself was a lie my the world has taken its toll on your idealism hasnt it im still idealistic i just keep it safe behind a carapace of skepticism and i dont want you to hunt anyone down either at least i dont think so not in that sense anyway ernie may disagree with me on that one did mr scollay try to dissuade you from coming here i asked how did you know that a trick of the trade hes not very good at hiding his feelings most honest men arent he believed that we should keep quiet about what we knew the damage was done in his view he didnt want his brothers memory besmirched in any way or my fathers either but you didnt agree a crime was committed mr parker maybe more than one once again why not go to the police if everyone went to the police youd be a fulltime bartender and a parttime private investigator or no private investigator at all ernie scollay was returning from the mens room he removed his baseball cap as he walked and ran his fingers back through his thick white hair if i was conscious of a tension between him and marielle i was more conscious of the fact that ernie was frightened so was marielle but she hid it better ernie scollay the last of the honest men but not so honest that he didnt want to keep his brothers secrets hidden he glanced at marielle and me trying to ascertain if we had been discussing anything that we shouldnt have while he was absent where were we he asked at the clearing i said paul and harlan looked to the clearing the buck lay dead at their feet but the fear it had emanated was still with them harlan tightened his grip on his rifle there were four bullets left in his magazine and paul had the same something had spooked the buck perhaps drawn by the smell of its blood and they didnt want to face a bear with their hands hanging or god forbid a mountain lion because theyd both heard stories about the possible return of big cats to the state nobody had seen one for certain for the best part of twenty years but they didnt want to be the first they stepped around the remains of the buck and advanced on the open space it was only as they drew nearer that they smelled it dampness and rotting vegetation a body of still black water lay before them so dark that it was more pitch than liquid with the promise of a viscosity to match staring into it harlan caught only the barest reflection of his own face the water appeared to absorb more protons than it should have sucking in the beams of their flashlights and what little illumination filtered through the branches above allowing almost nothing of it to escape harlan took a step back as he felt his sense of balance faltering and he bumped into paul who was standing directly behind him the shock caused him to teeter and for a moment he was about to fall into the pool the ground seemed to tilt beneath his feet his rifle fell to the ground and he raised his arms instinctively and flapped them at the air like a bird striving to escape a predator then pauls hands were on his torso pulling him back and harlan found a tree against which to lean circling its trunk with his arms in a desperate lovers embrace i thought i was going in he said i thought i was going to drown no not drown suffocate or worse for just because he was certain that no living thing moved through its depths certain certain how certain north was north and east was east but such certainties did not apply in this place of that at least he was convinced it did not mean that the pool was empty it stank of malevolence of the possibility that something more than the sucking power of its mass might drag you down if you fell into it harlan was suddenly aware of the silence of this place he was conscious too that night was coming on quickly he could see no stars in the sky and the damn compass was gone all to hell they could be stuck out here and he didnt want that to happen not one damn little bit we ought to leave said harlan this place feels wrong he realized that paul had not spoken since they found the pool his friend stood with his back to him the muzzle of his gun now pointing at the ground you hear me said harlan i think we should get out of here its bad this whole damned place is look said paul he stepped to one side and shined his flashlight across the expanse of the pool and harlan saw it it was the shape that marked it out although the forest had done its best to obscure its lines at first glance it looked only like the trunk of a fallen tree one much larger than those that surrounded it but a portion of one wing protruded from the foliage and the flashlight made parts of the fuselage glitter neither of the men knew much about airplanes but they could see that it was a small twinengine prop now minus the starboard engine lost during the crash along with most of that wing it lay on its belly to the north of the pool its nosecone hard against a big pine the forest had closed over the path that it must have torn through the trees upon its descent although that in itself was not so remarkable what was strange and what gave the men pause was that the plane was almost entirely covered with vegetation vines had wrapped their tendrils around it ferns had shaded it shrubs had masked it the very ground itself appeared to be slowly absorbing it for the plane had sunk some distance into the earth and the lower portion of the port engine was already lost the plane must have been here for decades harlan thought but the portions of it that were visible through the greenery did not appear that old there was no rust no obvious decay as he would tell his family during his final days it was as though the forest were absorbing the plane and had accelerated its growth accordingly so that this end might be more rapidly achieved paul began walking toward the wreckage harlan released his hold on the tree trunk and gave the pool a wide berth as he followed his friend paul used his rifle butt to test the earth around the slowly sinking plane but the earth was hard not moist itll soften during the spring thaw said harlan that might explain the way the plane is going down i guess said paul but he did not sound convinced all the windows of the plane were covered with ivy including those at the cockpit for the first time harlan acknowledged the possibility that there might still be bodies in there the thought made him shudder it took them a while to find the door so thick was the cloak of vegetation they used their hunting knives to hack at the ivy it came away reluctantly coating their gloves with a sticky residue that gave off a sharp caustic odor paul got some of it on his exposed forearm and he would carry the burn scar that it left until the day that he took his own life when they had exposed the shape of the door they found that the sinking of the plane had left an inch or more of it beneath the earth so they had to hack at the ground to make enough space for the door to open out a little by that time the blackness was upon them maybe we ought to come back when its light said harlan you think wed even be able to find this place again asked paul its not like any part of the woods ive ever seen harlan took in their surroundings the trees a mix of tall evergreens and huge misshapen deciduous were older here this area had never been logged paul was right harlan couldnt even have said where they were exactly north that was all he knew but this was maine and there was a lot of north to go around we cant find our way back in the dark anyway said paul not with the compass on the fritz and no stars to guide us i figure we got to stay till first light stay here harlan didnt like the sound of that at all he glanced at the black pool its surface smooth as a plate of obsidian vague memories of old horror movies came to him bfeatures in which creatures emerged from ponds just like that one but when he tried to put a name to the films he found that he could not and he wondered if he had made up those images all by himself you got a better idea said paul we have supplies we can light a fire wouldnt be the first time we spent a night in the woods but not in a place like this harlan wanted to say not with a pool of notquitewater calling to us and the wreck of a plane that might well be a tomb for anyone still inside if they could get far enough away from it then the compass might begin to function properly again or if the sky cleared they could navigate their way home by the stars he tried to find the moon but the clouds had smothered all and there was not even the faintest glow to be seen harlan looked at the plane once again paul had his hand on the exterior handle of the door you ready for this he said no said harlan but i reckon youd best go ahead anyway weve come this far we may as well find out if theres anyone left in there paul turned the handle and yanked at the door nothing happened either it was stuck fast or it was locked from the inside paul tried again his face contorted with effort there was a grinding sound and the door came free harlan raised his hand to his face expecting the smell of dead but there was only the musty odor of damp carpets paul poked his head inside and passed the flashlights beam around the interior after a couple of seconds he climbed in take a look at this he called to harlan harlan steeled himself and followed his friend into the plane the empty plane empty i said empty said marielle vetters there were no bodies nothing i think that helped it made it easier for them to keep the money the money was in a big leather holdall behind what harlan figured was the pilots seat in every film hed ever watched the pilot sat on the left and the copilot sat on the right and he had no reason to believe that this plane would be any different harlan and paul stared at the money for a long time beside the holdall was a canvas satchel containing a sheaf of papers sealed in a plastic wallet for further protection it was a list of names typewritten for the most part although some had been added by hand here and there sums of money had been included some small some very large also again sometimes typewritten and sometimes handwritten notes had been added to some of the entries mostly words like accepted and declined but occasionally just a single letter t harlan couldnt make much sense of it so he turned his attention back to the money it was mainly in fifties used and nonconsecutive with some twenties thrown in for variety some of the wads were held together with paper wraps others with elastic bands paul picked up one of the bundles of fifties and did a quick count thats five thousand dollars i reckon he said the flashlight picked out the rest of the money there were probably forty similar bundles of cash in there not counting the twenties two hundred thousand give or take he concluded jesus i never seen so much money neither of them had the most cash harlan had ever held in his hand was which hed got from selling a truck years before to perry reed up at perrys used autos perry had screwed him over on that truck but then nobody ever went to perry the pervert for a fair deal they went to him because they were desperate and needed money fast having that much cash was the closest harlan had ever come to feeling rich he hadnt felt wealthy for long though because the money had gone straight to servicing his debts now harlan knew that both he and paul were thinking the same thing who would know neither would have considered himself a thief oh theyd shaved a few dollars here and there from the irs but that was your duty as a taxpayer and an american someone had once told harlan that the irs factored cheating into their calculations so they kind of expected you to do it and by not holding out on them you messed up their system you caused more trouble by not cheating on your taxes than you did by smudging your return the fella said and if you looked too square then the irs would start thinking that maybe you were hiding something and next thing you knew they had their claws in you and you were scouring the attic for receipts for ninetynine cents just to stay out of jail but now they werent talking about a hundred dollars here and there kept back from uncle sams purse this was potentially a serious criminal enterprise which raised the second question where had it come from you think its drug money asked paul he watched a lot of tv cop shows and immediately associated any cash sum too large to be kept in a wallet with drug dealing it wasnt like drugs werent a thing here either they flowed across the border like driven snow but they mainly came in by truck and car and boat not by plane its possible said harlan i dont see no drugs though could be they sold them already and these are the proceeds said paul he flipped through the bills with his index finger and seemed to like the sound they made a lot a larger object in the cash bag caught harlans eye and he pulled it out it was a copy of the gazette out of montreal dated july just over one year earlier take a look at that he told harlan its not possible said harlan this plane has been here longer than that its almost part of the woods well unless the gazette delivers to crash sites she hit the ground sometime around july fourteenth said paul i dont remember hearing nothing about it said harlan a plane goes down you figure somebody is going to notice and come asking especially if it went down with a couple hundred thousand dollars on board i mean hush said paul he was trying to remember something about a reporter except i think someone did come asking he said at last a moment later harlan caught up the magazine woman he said then grimaced as paul added and the man who came with her ernie scollay shifted in his seat his unease was more obvious now it was the mention of the man and the woman that had provoked it did she have a name i asked she gave a name said marielle but if it was her own then she never wrote for any newspaper or magazine that my father could find she called herself darina flores and this man you mentioned he wasnt the kind to give a name said ernie they came separately and didnt keep each others company but harlan saw them talking together outside the womans motel it was long after dark and they were sitting in her car the interior light was on and harlan thought they might have been arguing but he couldnt be sure harlan already thought there was something hinky about them both that just confirmed it for him the next day they were gone and the woman didnt come back again the woman didnt come back again but the man did i said beside him marielle trembled slightly as though an insect had crawled across her skin oh yes she said he came back for sure darina flores was as beautiful as any woman harlan had ever seen he had never been unfaithful to his wife and each had given up their virginity to the other on their wedding night but if darina flores had offered herself to harlan a possibility as unlikely as any that harlan could imagine short of his own immortality then he would have been sorely tempted and might somehow have found a way to live with the guilt her hair was chestnut brown her face olive complected and there was a hint of asian to her eyes the irises so brown that they shaded to black in a certain light it should have been disconcerting even sinister but instead harlan found it alluring and he wasnt alone there wasnt a man in falls end and perhaps a couple of women too who didnt go to bed at night with impure thoughts of darina flores after meeting her she was the talk of the pickled pike from the moment she arrived and probably the talk of lesters too although harlan and paul didnt frequent lesters because lester leforge was an asshole of the highest order who had played loose with pauls cousin angela when they were both nineteen and had never been forgiven for it although harlans son grady drank in lesters whenever he came back to falls end just to spite his father darina flores took a room at the northern gateway motel on the outskirts of town she told folk that she was putting together a magazine feature on the great north woods an attempt to capture something of their grandeur and mystery for the kind of people who not only subscribed to glossy travel magazines but had the money to visit the places described therein she was she said particularly interested in stories of disappearances both recent and notsorecent early settlers any maine equivalents of the donner party hikers who might have vanished even airplanes she added because shed heard the woods were so dense that planes had come down in them and never been found harlan wasnt sure how stories of folk going missing or resorting to cannibalism would appeal to wellheeled travelers with a lot of disposable income but then he wasnt a journalist and anyway the dumbness of people had long ago ceased to surprise him so he and paul and ernie and a few others recycled all the old tales they could recall for the delight of darina flores embellishing the details where required or making them up entirely where necessary darina flores dutifully noted them down and bought rounds of drinks on her expense account and flirted outrageously with men who could have been her grandfather let alone her father and as the night drew on she gradually brought the conversation back to airplanes you think she might have a you know a thing for airplanes jackie strauss one of the towns three resident jews had asked as he and harlan stood side by side in the mens room making space in their bladders for more beer and by extension more time with the divine darina flores why you hiding an airplane that i dont know about asked harlan i was thinking maybe i could borrow one and offer to show her around you could join the mile high club said harlan i got a fear of flying said jackie i was hoping we could just stay on the ground and do our business there jackie how old are you seventytwo next birthday you got a dicky heart any business you did with that woman would probably kill you i know but its how id like to go if i survived my wife would kill me anyway better i go in the arms of a woman like that than give my lois the pleasure of beating me to death after and so the men fed darina flores tales both real and fantastic and she in turn fed their fantasies and a pleasant night was had by all except ernie scollay who wasnt drinking at the time because he was on medication and who had noticed that darina flores barely sipped at her vodka tonic and her smile rose no further than her upper lip never even coming close to those extraordinary eyes that grew darker as the night drew on and she had long ago stopped writing and was now listening yet not listening just as she was smiling yet not smiling and drinking yet not drinking so ernie tired of the game before the others and he excused himself and left he was walking to his truck when he saw april schmitt who owned the towns other motel the vacationland repose standing outside the motel office smoking a cigarette in a manner that could only be described as distracted april didnt smoke much ernie knew this knowledge based upon the fact that he and april were content to share a bed when the mood struck them each of them being generally inclined to solitude yet still requiring a little company on occasion april only smoked when she was unhappy and ernie preferred april to be happy as that state of mind was more conducive to bedsharing and darina flores falsely affable or not had put him in the mood for some female company you okay hon he asked laying a hand gently on the small of her back the heel of it resting upon the swell of her still fine buttocks its nothing she said youre smoking its never nothing when youre smoking there was a guy came asking for a room i didnt care for the look of him so i told him we were full up she took a drag on the cigarette then looked at it in disgust before throwing it to the ground still only half smoked and stamping it out she wrapped her arms across herself and shivered even though it was a warm evening tentatively ernie put an arm around her shoulders and she leaned into him she was shaking and april wasnt a woman who scared easily her fear drove any carnal thoughts from his mind april was a frightened woman ernie loved her in his quiet way and he did not wish her to be frightened he asked me why the vacancy light was on if we were full said april i said that id forgotten to turn it off was all i could see him looking at the lot i mean there are only four cars in it so he knew that i was lying he just smiled the ugly piece of shit he smiled and his fingers moved and it was like he was stripping the clothes from my body and the flesh from my bones i swear i felt his fingers on me in me in my in my private parts he was hurting me and he wasnt even touching me christ she started to cry ernie had never seen her cry before it shocked him more than what she had said the swearing included because april didnt swear much either he held her tighter and felt her sobbing against him fat bald son of a bitch she said gasping the words out piece of shit bastard touching me like that hurting me like that all over a fucking motel room you want me to call the cops asked ernie and tell them what that a man looked at me funny that he assaulted me without laying a hand on me i dont know this guy what did he look like fat fat and ugly he had a thing on his throat all swollen like a toads neck and he had a tattoo on his wrist i saw it when he pointed at the sign it was a fork a threepronged fork like he thought he was the devil himself bastard miserable rapist bastard what ernie had stopped talking what is it he had seen the look on my face i could not hide it i know who he was i know his name after all i killed him nothing i said and he caught the lie but chose to set it aside for now brightwell brightwell the believer go on i said finish the story darina flores left after two days with little to show for her efforts but a hole in her expense account real or imagined and a store of old tales that were barely on nodding terms with reality if she was disappointed she didnt show it instead she passed around some cards with her phone number printed on them and invited anyone who remembered anything useful or pertinent to her article to call her some of the more optimistic men of the town strengthened by a beer or three tried calling the number in the days and weeks after she left but got through only to an answering service on which darina floress dulcet tones invited them to leave a name number and message with a promise to get back to them as soon as possible but darina flores never called anyone back and over time the men grew tired of the game now squatting in the wreckage of a plane in the great north woods harlan and paul thought back on darina flores for the first time in years and once the floodgates of memory were opened a torrent of related incidents followed each inconsequential in itself but suddenly meaningful when taken as a whole in the light of what they had just found city men and women who hired guides for hunting or hiking or in one unlikely case birdwatching but who seemed to have little interest in nature while being very clear on the areas that they wished to explore to the extent of marking them carefully in the form of grids on their maps harlan recalled matthew risen a guide since deceased talking to him of a woman whose skin was a virtual gallery of tattoos that seemed almost to move in the forest light she had not spoken a single word to him during the long hours of a deer hunt that ended with a single desultory shot at a distant buck a shot that might possibly have scared a squirrel who was halfway up the tree struck by the bullet but posed no danger to the deer itself instead her partner did all of the talking a garrulous man with red lips and a pale waxen face who reminded risen of an emaciated clown and never even unslung his rifle chatting and joking even as he gently overruled his guides choice of direction moving them away from any deer and toward what risen had not been able to figure that out but now harlan and paul thought they knew they were looking for the plane said paul all of them looking for the plane and the money but it was harlan who wondered if it was less the money that interested those strangers than the names and the numbers on the papers in the satchel as he and paul scollay sat by the fire that they had made the barest flicker of it reflected on that black water he kept coming back to the list of names even as they discussed the cash and those who had come to seek it the list made him uneasy but for no reason that he could figure out you could use the money said paul you know what with angeline getting sick and all harlans wife was showing the first signs of parkinsons she was already in the middle stage of alzheimers and harlan was finding it harder to take care of her needs meanwhile paul was always being chased by some bill or another there would be hard times ahead as old age tightened its hold on them and theirs and neither man had the kind of funds that would permit any difficulties to be handled with ease yes thought harlan i could use the money they both could that still didnt make it right i say we keep it said paul it stays out here much longer and it will sink into the ground along with that plane or itll be found by someone even less worthy of it than we are he tried to make a joke of it but it didnt quite work its not ours to keep said harlan we ought to tell the police about this why if this was honest money then honest men would have come looking for it it would have been all over the news that a plane had gone down theyd have been scouring the woods looking for wreckage or survivors instead what did we get but some woman pretending to be a reporter and a swarm of creeps who were no more hunters or birders than the man in the moon the bag lay between them paul had left it open probably deliberately so that harlan could see the money inside what if they find out said harlan and his voice almost cracked as he spoke is this how evil is done he asked himself in small increments one foot after the next softly softly until youve convinced yourself that wrong is right and right is wrong because youre not a bad person and you dont do bad things we use it only as necessary said paul were too old to be buying sports cars and fancy clothes we just use it to make the years that are left a little easier for ourselves and our families if were careful then nobody will ever find out harlan didnt believe that oh he wanted to but secretly he didnt it was why in the end though they took the money he chose to leave the satchel where it was with its lists of names intact harlan sensed their importance he hoped that if the plane was eventually found by those who had been seeking it they would accept his offering as a form of recompense for their theft an acknowledgment of what was truly important perhaps if the papers were left for them they wouldnt come looking for the money that had been a long long night when they werent talking about the money they were talking about the pilot or pilots where had they gone if they had survived the crash why hadnt they taken the money and the satchel with them when they went to look for help why leave them in the plane it was paul who went back inside paul who examined one of the passenger seats and found that its arms had been broken paul who found two pairs of handcuffs discarded beneath the pilots seat he showed all that he had discovered to harlan now how do you suppose that happened and harlan had sat in the seat and gripped the broken armrests pulling them up then hed examined the handcuffs each set with the key still in the lock i think someone was cuffed to this chair he said and they got free after the crash or before could be they even caused it they both stepped out of the plane then and the blackness of the pool was mirrored in the blackness of the forest and the beams of their flashlights were swallowed up by both somehow they managed to sleep but it was an uneasy rest and while it was still dark harlan woke to find paul standing over the embers of the fire his rifle in his hand his aged body tensed against the night what is it said harlan i thought i heard something someone harlan listened there was no sound at all but still he reached for his rifle i dont hear anything someones out there i tell you and every hair on harlans body seemed to stand on end at that moment and he got to his feet with the alacrity of a man a third of his age because he felt it paul was right there was a presence out there among the trees and it was watching them he knew it as surely as he knew that his heart still beat and the blood still coursed through his veins jesus whispered harlan his breath was catching in his chest a sense of profound vulnerability washed over him and in its wake he was engulfed by a terrible despair he felt its hunger its need if it was an animal out there then it was like none that he had ever encountered can you see it asked paul i cant see nothing but i can feel it they stayed that way harlan and paul their weapons ready two frightened old men facing an implacable presence in the dark until both sensed that whatever was out there had departed but they still agreed to alternate watches until dawn paul dozed first while harlan stayed awake but harlan had been more tired than he thought his eyes began to close and his shoulders sagged he would experience flashes of dreaming before he jerked awake and in those moments he dreamed of a little girl dancing through the woods although he could not see her face clearly she approached the fire peering through the smoke and the flames examining the two old men growing bolder in her approaches until in the final dream she was reaching out a hand to touch harlans face and he could see that some of the nails were broken and the rest were filled with dirt and he smelled the rotting of her he stayed awake after that he stood to keep sleep at bay sleep and the girl because that stink had still been there when he woke up it was real but they took the money in the end thats what it came down to they took the money and they used it to make their lives a little easier when the cancer began flipping pauls cells like the tiles on an othello board turning them from white to black he discreetly pursued a range of treatments some orthodox some not and he never lost hope not even when he put his gun in his mouth at last because for him it was not an act of ultimate despair but the embracing of his last best and surest hope and harlan vetters wife was looked after in her own home as the parkinsons quickly combined with the alzheimers to create critical mass and he was forced to move her into residential care it was the best facility that he could find within easy reach of falls end she had her own room flooded with light and a view of the woods because she loved the woods as much as her husband did harlan visited her every day and in summer he would put her in a wheelchair and together they would head into town for ice cream and there were days when she would remember who he was for a few moments and she would hold his hand in her own and his strength would seem to still the trembling for the most part though she would stare vacantly ahead of her and harlan could not decide if that absence was better or worse than the fear that would occasionally animate her features when everything was strange and terrifying to her the town her husband even herself when paul scollays sister found that her husband had gambled away their savings her brother stepped in and money was put into a highyield account to which only she had access her husband meanwhile was encouraged to seek treatment for his addiction spurred on by a conversation that hed had with paul during which pauls shotgun was conspicuous by its presence and because they lived in a small town they knew when someone was hurting a job lost an injury suffered a child yielded up to the care of grandparents because the mother couldnt cope and an envelope would be placed on the doorstep during the night and a little of the pressure would be anonymously relieved in that way they salved their consciences although both men remained haunted by the same strange dreams visions in which they were pursued through the forest by an unseen entity ending up at last before the black pool where something was rising from the depths always threatening to surface but never appearing before they woke rarely too did a day pass during those years without harlan and paul fearing that the plane would be discovered and some trace of their presence at the wreckage would be revealed they were not sure which they feared more the law or those who might have a personal interest in the plane and its contents but those fears faded and the nightmares came less frequently the money was gradually spent until only a little of it remained and harlan and paul had started to believe that they might just have committed a victimless crime when the man with the distended neck returned to falls end it was a cold january afternoon in when the man known as brightwell if man he truly was reappeared harlan vetters had always hated these winter months theyd been bad enough when he was a young man with stamina and muscle tone and strong bones but now he had significantly less of all three and had grown to dread the first fall of snow his wife used to find it amusing when he began railing at the photographs in the winter catalogs that started turning up in their mailbox in august or at the glossy store advertisements tucked inside the maine sunday telegram as summer ended all of them depicting happy grinning people wearing warm clothing and holding snow shovels as if three or four hard months of winter was just about the best damn thing that could be imagined and even more fun than disneyland nobody in this state posed for those photos i tell you that he would say they ought to fill these things with pictures of some poor bastard up to his knees in snow trying to dig his truck out with a spoon and angeline would pat him on the shoulder and say well they wouldnt sell too many sweaters that way would they and harlan would mutter something in turn and shed kiss him on the crown of his head and leave him to his business knowing that later she would find him in the garage checking that the plow attachment for his truck was undamaged that the flashlights worked and there were batteries to spare that the backup generator was in working order and the woodshed was dry and this before the first leaves had even begun to drop from the trees in the weeks that followed he would make a list of all that was needed both food and equipment and then he would set out early one morning to the big suppliers in bangor or if he felt like the ride portland returning that same evening with tales of bad driving and twodollar cups of coffee and donuts that werent as good as the ones laurie boden served at the falls end diner dont know why after all how hard could it be to make a donut she would help him to pack his purchases away and there would always be hot chocolate mix more than a whole town could ever drink in the longest winter imaginable because he knew that she loved hot chocolate and he didnt want her to be without and there would be some small treat for her at the bottom of the box something that he had chosen himself in a boutique and not in one of the big department stores it was the real reason why he drove so far she knew so that he could find her something that wasnt available locally a scarf or a hat or a small item of jewelry with maybe a box of candy or cookies thrown in with it and often a book some big hardback novel that would keep her going for a week when the snow settled upon them it amused and touched her to think of him in a fancy womens clothing store fingering varieties of silk and wool and interrogating the saleswoman on issues of quality and price or browsing the aisles of a bookstore with his notebook open to a page filled with titles he had jotted down over the preceding months a list of books that she had mentioned in passing or novels about which he had read himself and thought she might like she knew that he would have spent as much time if not more on choosing those gifts for her as he did on buying all of his winter supplies and he would glow with delight at the pleasure she derived upon discovering what he had brought for her because here was the thing while her friends sometimes complained at their husbands absence of taste and their seeming inability to buy anything appropriate for christmas or birthdays harlan always chose right even the smallest of his gifts spoke of the consideration he had given to their suitability and over their many years together she came to understand that he thought of her a great deal and she was always with him and these small tokens were simply occasional physical expressions of her deep and abiding presence in his life so on the day of the great expedition she in turn would have a hot meal waiting for him and a pie she had baked that day peach or apple not too sweet the crust slightly burned just the way he liked it the two of them would eat and talk and later theyd make love because he had never stopped loving her he loved her still even though she no longer always knew who it was that loved her there was ice on the road that day black and treacherous and harlan was forced to drive to the nursing home at a pace barely above walking even for an old timer like himself he experienced a profound sense of relief at the sight of the redbrick building looming against the pristine blue of the sky the fairy lights still illuminated on the bushes and trees the tracks of birds and small mammals crisscrossing the compacted snow lately the imminence of his own mortality had begun to press upon him and he had found himself taking more care than usual when driving he did not wish to predecease his wife oh he was certain that his daughter would care for her if that happened because marielle was a good girl but he knew that in her infrequent moments of clarity his wife found some reassurance in the routine of his visits and he did not wish to add to her fears by his absence he had to be careful as much for her sake as for his own he stomped the snow from his boots before entering the reception area and greeted evelyn the pretty young black nurse who worked the desk from monday through thursday and every second saturday he knew all of their schedules by heart and they in turn could set their watches by the times of his arrival and departure good afternoon mr vetters how you doin today still fighting the good fight miss evelyn he replied just as he always did cold one huh the worst brrrr harlan sometimes wondered if black people felt the cold more than white people but he was too polite to ask he figured it was one of those questions that was destined to remain unanswered for him hows the old girl she had a troubled night mr vetters said evelyn clancy sat with her for a while and calmed her down but she didnt sleep much last time i checked she was napping though so thats good clancy worked only nights he was a huge man of indeterminate race with sunken eyes and a head that looked too small for his body the first time harlan had met clancy hed been coming out of the home in his civvies and harlan had briefly been in fear of his life clancy looked like an escapee from a maximum security jail but as harlan had got to know him hed discovered an immeasurably gentle soul a man of seemingly infinite patience with his elderly patients even those who like harlans wife were often scared of their own spouses and children clancys presence worked like a sedative with fewer negative side effects thanks for letting me know said harlan ill go through and see her now if thats okay sure mr vetters ill bring some hot tea and cookies in a while if you and your wife would like that im sure wed like that just fine said harlan and the young womans genuine solicitude caused a tickle in his throat just as it always did whenever one of the staff showed some small kindness like this he knew he was paying for their services but he appreciated the fact that they went the extra yard hed heard horror stories about even the most expensive care facilities but nobody here had ever given him the slightest cause for complaint he trotted down the warm hallway aware of the pain in his joints and a dampness in his left shoe the leather was coming away from the sole he hadnt noticed it before a couple of stitches would see it repaired though he lived frugally mostly out of habit but also to ensure that his wife could spend the rest of her days in this place he hadnt wasted a dime of the money from the plane although the thought of it never failed to cause his stomach to tighten years later he was still awaiting the hand upon his shoulder or the knock on the door and the voice of authority flanked by uniforms telling him that they wanted to talk to him about an airplane he seemed to be the only visitor that afternoon he supposed that the state of the roads had kept a lot of people at home and he passed patients napping or watching tv or simply staring out of the windows there was no conversation it had the silence of a cloister there was a separate secure wing accessed by a keypad beside the doors for those who were more troubled than the rest more likely to wander when they got confused or frightened his wife had been there for a couple of years but as the parkinsons got worse her capacity for roaming was reduced and now she was not even able to leave her bed without assistance in a way he was happier that she was in the general area the secure wing for all its comforts felt too much like a prison the door to his wifes room was slightly ajar he knocked gently upon it before entering even though he had been told that she was sleeping he was more conscious now than ever before of maintaining her privacy and her dignity he knew the distress that a sudden invasion of her space could cause her particularly if she was having one of her bad days when she failed to recognize him at all his wifes eyes were closed when he entered her face turned to the door he noticed that the room was cold which surprised him they were very careful about ensuring that the patients did not get too cold in winter or too warm in summer the main windows were kept locked and could only be opened with special keys mostly to prevent the more disturbed patients from climbing out and injuring themselves or running away the smaller top windows could be opened slightly to let some air in but harlan could see that they were all sealed shut he stepped further into the room and the door slammed behind him it was only then that he smelled the man when harlan turned he was standing against the wall smiling a dead smile the swollen purple goiter at his throat like a huge blood blister waiting to burst take a seat mr vetters he said its time we had a talk it was strange but now that the worst had happened harlan found he was not afraid even as he hoped that it might not be true he had always known that someone would come and sometimes in those dark dreams a man had appeared on the periphery of the pursuit his profile deformed by his own obesity and a terrible growth that distorted his already bloated neck this was the form that vengeance would take when it came but harlan was not about to confess not unless he was given no other option he assumed the role that he had always determined he would play if this moment came the innocent he had practiced it well he could not have said why but he believed it was important that this man did not discover the location of the airplane in the great north woods and not just because of the money that harlan and paul had taken the ones who had come looking for it over the years because once he and paul had come to understand their purpose they grew better at spotting them better at recognizing them from the tales told by bemused guides bore no resemblance to one another some like darina flores were beautiful and some like this man were profoundly ugly some looked like businessmen or schoolteachers others like hunters and killers but what they all had in common was a sense that they meant no good for god or man if they wanted something from that plane and harlan had a fixed memory of those papers with their lists of names then it was the duty of rightthinking men to ensure that they didnt get it or so harlan and paul told themselves in an effort to make some small recompense for their larceny but neither were they so naive as to believe that their theft of the money might be allowed to go unpunished that if they revealed what they knew of the planes location to darina flores or someone like her the truth would be enough to buy them peace in their final years even the knowledge that the plane existed might be enough to damn them because theyd both examined that list and some of those names were fused in harlans brain he could recite them if he had to not many of them but enough enough to see him dead then again if the man was here it was probably because of the money the money would have drawn him perhaps harlan and paul had not been as careful as they thought what are you doing in my wifes room he asked youre not supposed to be here its for family and friends only the man wandered over to where harlans wife lay and stroked her face and hair his fingertips trailed across her lips then parted them obscenely angeline mumbled in her sleep and tried to move her head a pair of pale fingers entered her mouth and harlan saw the tendons flexing in the mans hand i told you to sit down mr vetters if you dont ill tear out your wifes tongue harlan sat who are you he asked my name is brightwell what do you want with us i think you know well sir i dont i want you gone from here so ill do my best to answer any questions you might have but youll have had a wasted trip by the end the sleeve of brightwells coat fell back from his arm as he continued to stroke angelines hair and harlan saw the mark upon the mans wrist it looked like a trident i understand that your wife has parkinsons and alzheimers thats right it must be very difficult for you there was no trace of sympathy in his voice not as difficult as it is for her oh i dont believe thats true brightwell glanced down at the sleeping woman he removed his fingers from her mouth sniffed them then licked at their tips with a tongue that was almost pointed in texture and color it reminded harlan of a piece of raw liver the man allowed his other hand to rest on angelines brow her mutterings grew louder as though the pressure of his hand troubled her yet still she did not wake look at her she barely knows who she is anymore and i guess that most of the time she doesnt know who you are either whatever you loved about her once is long gone shes just a shell a hollow burden it would be a mercy for you both if she simply slipped away thats not true said harlan brightwell smiled and his hard dark eyes looked at and into harlan and they found the place where harlan hid his worst thoughts and even though brightwells lips did not move harlan heard the word liar whispered he could not hold brightwells gaze and he felt shame as he bent his face to the floor i could make it happen said brightwell a pillow over the face a little compression on the nose and mouth nobody would ever know and then youd be free you stop talking like that mister you dont dare say that again brightwell tittered it was a strangely effeminate sound he even covered his mouth with his free hand while he did so im just playing with you mr vetters to tell you the truth somebody would find out if she died under um unusual circumstances its easy to murder but its harder to get away with murder that of course is true of most crimes but particularly so with killing you know why that is harlan was keeping his head down and his focus fixed on his shoes he was afraid that this man might stare into his eyes again and see his guilt then he began to feel concerned that this might be taken as the aspect of a guilty man that he was in effect admitting the crime before he had even been accused of it he composed himself and forced himself to look up at this loathsome intruder no said harlan i dont know its because murder is one of the few crimes that is rarely committed by practiced criminals said brightwell its a crime of rage or passion and so is usually unplanned murderers make mistakes because theyve never done it before they have no experience of killing that makes them easy to find easy to punish theres a lesson to be learned from that crime of any kind is a pursuit best left to professionals harlan waited he tried to keep his breathing under control he was grateful for the cold in the room it stopped him from sweating such sacrifices youve made for her said brightwell and his hand began stroking angelines hair again you cant even afford new shoes i like these shoes said harlan theyre good shoes will you be buried in them mr vetters asked brightwell are those the shoes youll want peeping out of your casket when they come by to mourn you i doubt it i reckon you probably have a pair in a box in your closet for just that eventuality youre a careful man youre the kind of man who plans ahead for old age for illness for death i dont think itll make a difference to me one way or another how im tricked out when im dead said harlan they can put me in a dress for all i care now would you mind taking your hand off my wife i dont like it and i dont believe she does either brightwells hand left angelines skin and harlan was grateful she grew calmer and her breathing deepened this is a nice place said brightwell comfortable clean i bet the staff are kind no minimum wage employees here right i guess not no whore nurses stealing small change from the lockers taking the treats left by little children for grandma brightwell continued no bored deviants slipping into rooms in the dead of night fingering the patients giving them a little something to remember a relic of the good times you never know though do you i dont like the look of that man clancy i dont like the look of him at all i can smell the badness on him like knows like ive always trusted my instincts when it comes to deviancy harlan didnt reply he was being baited here and he knew it best to remain silent and not get angry if he became angry he might give himself away still no harm done right your wife wouldnt remember anyway she might even enjoy it after all its probably been a while lets give old clancy the benefit of the doubt though looks can be so deceptive i find he grinned and fingered the growth at his throat exploring its wrinkles and abrasions to return to the matter in hand what im saying is that it must cost more than small change this kind of ongoing care a man would have to work long hours to make the payments loonnnng hours but youre retired arent you mr vetters thats right i guess you put the pennies aside for a rainy day like i say a careful man i was still am you were part of the warden service werent you harlan didnt bother asking how the man knew so much about him the fact of the matter was that he was here and hed done his research harlan shouldnt have been surprised and therefore he wasnt i was did it pay much being a warden enough and then some enough for me anyways i accessed your bank account details mr vetters it never seemed like you had more than nickels and dimes in your accounts relatively speaking i never trusted banks i kept all of my money close by all of your money brightwells eyes opened wide in mock astonishment why just how much of it was there all that could be quite a lot that could be thousands even tens of thousands was it mr vetters was it tens of thousands was it more harlan moistened his mouth and throat he didnt want his voice to crack no weakness there had to be no frailty in front of this man no there was never very much of it it was only the sale of my parents house after my momma died that left me with a cushion you might say something that might have been doubt flickered across brightwells face a house they lived over by calais said harlan he pronounced it callas like the singer the way everyone did in the state me being the only child it came into my possession fortunate given what happened to angeline fortunate indeed now harlan met brightwells gaze i told you at the start sir i dont know what you came looking for here but i warned you that you wouldnt find it id be grateful to you if youd leave us now ive had enough of your company at that moment angeline opened her eyes she stared at brightwell and harlan expected her to start screaming he prayed that she wouldnt because he didnt know how the intruder would react he was capable of killing to protect himself of that harlan was sure he could smell death on the man but angeline did not scream she spoke and the sound of it brought tears to harlans eyes she spoke in a voice that harlan had not heard for so long in the soft beautiful tones of her middle years yet there was another voice behind hers one deeper than her own i know what you are she said and brightwell looked at her in surprise i know what you are she repeated and i know what lies imprisoned within you soulkeeper binder of lost men hunter of a hidden angel now it was her turn to smile and it seemed to harlan more terrifying even than any expression he had yet seen on brightwells face angelines eyes were bright and her tone was mocking almost triumphant your days are numbered he is coming for you youll think that youve found him but its he who will have found you leave here hide while you can dig yourself a hole and cover your head with dirt and maybe hell pass you by maybe bitch said brightwell but his voice was uncertain your dying mind is spewing inanities old hateful thing trapped in a rotting body said angeline as if he had not spoken pathetic soulless creature stealing the souls of others for company run but it will do you no good hell find you hell find you and destroy you you and all the others like you fear him the door to the room opened and the nurse named evelyn appeared carrying a tray on which she had placed two cups and a plate of cookies she stopped short at the sight of brightwell who are you she asked get help said harlan rising from his chair now evelyn dropped the tray and ran seconds later an alarm began to sound brightwell turned to face harlan this isnt over he said i dont believe what you told me about that money ill be back and maybe ill steal whats left of your wife and carry her in me once ive finished with you with that he swept by harlan angelines belllike laughter following him although the home had instantly been locked down no trace of him was found in the building or the grounds or in the town the police came said marielle but my father said that he didnt know what the man wanted hed simply entered my mothers room and found this brightwell leaning over her when the police tried to question my mother she was already gone and she never spoke again the end came quickly for her after that my father told paul about what had happened and they kept waiting for brightwell to return then paul died and it was just my father who was left to face him but brightwell never came back why are you telling me this because the last word that my mother whispered to my father after that man fled was your name when it comes down tell the detective tell charlie parker and that in turn was the last thing that he whispered to me after he told us the story of the plane in the woods he wanted you to hear this story mr parker thats why we came and now you know around us music played and people talked and ate and drank but we were no part of it we were cocooned in our corner surrounded by the silkwrapped forms of the dead you knew who this man brightwell was didnt you said ernie i saw it on your face the first time we described him to you yes ive met him will he be coming back mr parker asked marielle no i said you seem very certain of that i am because i killed him good said marielle and the woman what about the woman i dont know i said with luck maybe somebody killed her too south south down interstates and winding roads past cities and towns hamlets and scattered houses across rivers and open fields to a car on a lonely dark stretch to a woman leaving home a woman who if she could have heard the tale being told in a quiet bar in the port city might well have said i know of these things barbara kelly had just left home when she saw the red suv a woman perhaps a decade younger than herself was hunched over the right front tire struggling with a lug wrench when the headlights found her she looked frightened as well she might this was a dark relatively unfrequented stretch of road used mainly by residents making their way to and from the houses at the top of the narrow laneways that fed into buck run road like tributaries on a night like this with clouds gathering and a brisk breeze making it feel colder than it was there would be even fewer cars on the road than usual sunday evenings tended to be quiet around there at the best of times as the residents resigned themselves to the end of the weekend and the imminent resumption of the weekly commute the lanes all had names inspired by the natural world raccoon lane doe leap lane bullfrog lane a decision made by the developers without any apparent reference to the reality of their surroundings barbara had never seen a doe here leaping or otherwise had never heard a bullfrog and the only raccoons she ever saw were dead it didnt matter much in the end she had not raised the subject with her neighbors or with anyone else she had grown used to blending in it made it easier for her to conduct her business now here was an suv with a flat tire and a woman in trouble a child stood beside her a boy of five or six he was wearing black shoes and blue jeans and a blue windbreaker was zipped up to his chin the rain began to fall the first drop landed with a loud pop on barbaras windshield and her view became almost entirely obscured before she had time to hit the wipers she saw the boy huddle into himself under a tree to escape the downpour he pulled up the hood on his windbreaker while the woman doggedly continued trying to change the wheel she seemed to have managed to get one of the lug nuts loose and wasnt about to stop now barbara admired her gumption even though she could see how clumsily the woman was handling the wrench barbara herself would have done a better job she was good with her hands she slowed down just as the jack slipped the woman stumbling back as the suv came down heavily on the damaged tire she put her hands out behind her to stop herself from striking her head barbara thought that she heard her swear even above the noise of the rain and the engine the boy ran to her his face was contorted and barbara guessed that he was crying under ordinary circumstances barbara would have driven on she was not prone to helping others it was not in her nature quite the opposite in fact her life had until recently been devoted to their slow ruination barbara was an expert in the small print that taketh away the legalese in contracts that permitted them to be manipulated in favor of the creditor but not the debtor then again this assumed that the contracts she negotiated were available to be read and examined which was only sometimes the case the particular contracts in which barbara kelly dealt were largely verbal in nature except when it was advantageous to have them otherwise sometimes they involved money or property occasionally they involved people for the most part they were promises of assistance made and accepted favors to be called in at opportune moments each was a small cut to the soul another footstep on the path to perdition her work had made her wealthy but it had also sapped most of her humanity true she would sometimes choose to engage in random acts of philanthropy both small and significant but only because there was a power in pity now as she drew to a halt beside the woman and the child she felt something of that power mingled with an element of sexual excitement even tired and wet the woman was clearly beautiful the surge of desire was both unexpected and welcome it had been a long time since barbara had felt it not since the lump had appeared in her armpit it hadnt even hurt at first and shed dismissed it as just one of those things shed never been hypochondriacal by nature by the time it was diagnosed as lymphoma her lifespan was already being counted in weeks and months with the diagnosis came fear fear of pain fear of the effects of treatment fear of mortality and fear of damnation for she understood better than anyone the nature of the bargain that had been struck voices had begun to whisper to her in the night sowing seeds of doubt in her mind they spoke of the possibility of redemption even for one such as her now here she was slowing down for a stranded woman and child a warmth spreading from between her legs and she did not yet know if she was stopping for reasons of goodwill or selfinterest or so she told herself barbara rolled down the window you look like youre in trouble she said the woman was back on her feet because of the headlights and the rain she hadnt been able to tell if it was a man or a woman at the wheel of the approaching vehicle but now the relief showed she came forward the rain streaming down her face her mascara had run combined with her dark dress and coat it made her look like a mourner at the end of a particularly difficult funeral but one radiant in her grief the boy hung back waiting until his mom told him that it was okay to approach no it wasnt just that barbara was very good at picking up on the responses of others and there was something in the boys reaction that went beyond obedience to his mother or a childs innate caution he was suspicious of barbara clever boy thought barbara clever sensitive boy damn tire blew said the woman and the jack doesnt seem to be worth shit do you have one i can use no barbara lied mine gave out a couple of months back and i never got around to replacing it i tend to wait for a helpful cop when i get into trouble or i just call triple a i dont have triple a and i havent seen any cops helpful or otherwise havent you heard they melt in the rain the woman tried to smile she was already soaked through they may not be the only ones well this is down for a while and its not such a good idea for you to wait with your car said barbara there have been a lot of accidents at the bend in the road just ahead people take it too fast especially in bad weather if someone hits you youll have bigger worries than a flat tire the womans shoulders sagged what do you suggest i do i live just up the road from here you can almost see my house from that big pine back there come up get dry and ill call roy my neighbor when the rain stops once she had told the lie about her own jack she could hardly offer to change the tire herself he lives to help out damsels in distress hell have that tire changed in no time in the meantime you and your son can have a warm drink and wait in comfort he is your son isnt he there was an odd pause before the woman answered oh yes of course thats william billy to me and to his friends that pause was interesting thought barbara im barbara she said barbara kelly im caroline hi pleased to meet you the two women shook hands slightly awkwardly through the open window caroline gestured to the boy come here billy and say hello to the nice lady reluctantly or so it seemed to barbara the boy came forward he was not a goodlooking child his skin was very pale and barbara wondered if he was ailing if this woman was really his mother and there was already some doubt about that then there was little of her in him the boy seemed destined to grow into an ugly man and something told her that he was not a child with many friends this is barbara caroline told him shes going to help us the boy didnt speak he simply stared at barbara with those dark eyes like raisins set in the dough of his face so she said hop in youre sure were not imposing no not at all id just be worrying if you insisted on staying out here so ill be happier if i know that youre safe you need anything from the car just my purse said caroline she turned away and left barbara and the boy alone with his hood up and his windbreaker zipped he looked older than his years he reminded her uncomfortably of a doll come to life or a homunculus he regarded her balefully barbara did not let her smile waver she had all kinds of medicines in her house and she could easily put a child to sleep his mother too if it came to that for she could almost taste caroline and the warmth had begun a slow insistent throbbing repentance could wait the two women chatted as they drove to the house it seemed that caroline and william had been on their way to visit friends in providence rhode island when the tire blew barbara tried to figure out where they might have been coming from to have found themselves in her neck of the woods when she asked caroline said that she had taken a wrong turn somewhere and barbara did not pursue the matter further you been to providence before asked barbara couple of times when i was a student i was a lovecraft fan yeah i never really got lovecraft he was too hysterical for my liking too overblown thats not an unfair criticism i guess said caroline but perhaps he was that way because he understood the true nature of the universe or thought he did you mean ancient green demons with weird stuff covering their mouths hah not like that although who knows no i mean the bleakness of it its coldness its absence of mercy the word mercy struck at barbara like a blade she could almost feel the infected lymph nodes responding to the stimulus of the word a painful counterpoint to the demands of her lower body im like a walking metaphor she thought cheerful said barbara and the woman beside her laughed a puncture in the rain will do that to a girl she said barbara signaled right and they turned into the short drive that led to her house the lights were on inside it looked warm and welcoming i never asked said caroline but where were you going when you found us we havent taken you away from anything urgent i hope a church barbara almost replied i was going to a church no said barbara it was nothing important itll wait she showed them into the living room she brought them towels with which to dry themselves and invited them to remove their shoes they both did so although the boy seemed reluctant nevertheless he insisted on keeping his windbreaker zipped and the hood raised it made him look even more like a malevolent dwarf barbara could see that he was overweight perhaps he was embarrassed by his appearance the woman smiled at him indulgently then followed barbara into the hallway as she hung up her coat to dry hes very much his own man she said sometimes i wonder who is really in charge in our home barbara glanced at the womans ring finger she wore no wedding band caroline knew where she was looking and waved her left hand still free and single she said the father hes not around anymore said caroline and although she spoke lightly an undertone made it clear that any further questions on the subject would not be welcomed what about you you married only to my job what do you do im a consultant it was her standard reply to the question that sounds very vague i advise on contracts and negotiations youre a lawyer i have legal training caroline laughed ill let it drop she said sorry said barbara and laughed in turn my work isnt very interesting oh im sure thats not true you seem too smart a person to end up doing a job thats dull another one deceived said barbara such modesty so you may be married to your job but do you fool around on the side barbara caught a glimpse of herself in the hallway mirror and turned away she did not consider herself attractive her hair was lank and dull her face unremarkable she could count her sexual partners on one hand with fingers to spare no she said i dont fool around much at all caroline looked at her quizzically do you prefer women to men the bluntness of the question surprised barbara why do you ask just a vibe its not a judgment or anything barbara let a couple of seconds go by yes she said i prefer women to men in fact ive only ever dated one man i was young it didnt take ive always been sexually attracted to women caroline shrugged hey ive been with women i prefer men but i was wild in my youth she winked at barbara jesus thought barbara this one is really something shes perfect it was almost as if she were an offering the word was both unexpected and apt could they have known the direction of her thoughts could they have sensed the doubts that assailed her was this their way of keeping her with them a gift like a fly cocooned in silk presented to the spider who stalked the web it was not beyond the realms of possibility after all that was how they worked that was how she worked still the idea troubled her she wanted a minute or two alone to consider it the womans presence was somehow overpowering and the boy was an enigma he watched them both with a knowingness his eyes unblinking in that desolate bleached face would you like something to warm you up asked barbara coffee or tea coffee would be fine what about william or billy oh hell be okay just as he is he has a sensitive stomach its been acting up this trip better to just leave him be barbara went to the kitchen after a minute during which barbara could hear her speaking softly to the boy caroline followed she leaned against the counter while barbara poured water into the coffee machine and the slow trickle began her presence was starting to make barbara uneasy perhaps it had been a mistake to invite her in but then if she had been sent by them why had she not come directly to the house unless she had been on the way to the house when her tire was punctured you have a lovely home said caroline thank you barbara realized that she sounded abrupt i mean its nice of you to say i decorated it myself you have very good taste by the way i didnt mean to be insensitive back there you know about your sexuality i just think that its better to be clear on these things before we go any further are we going further asked barbara would you like to barbara looked out of the kitchen window the falling rain resembled static on a tv screen obscuring the picture so that she could not follow the unfolding narrative only the woman named caroline was clear to her her reflection apparent in the glass like a waning moon im right about her thought barbara i feel that im right all traces of desire of lust were gone now it was the disease barbara realized it had debilitated her more than she thought in the past she would have been alert to a trap like this having set so many of them for others theyd been watching for her waiting for her they knew they knew what is your name barbara asked i told you my name is caroline no said barbara what is your real name the reflection of the womans face flickered in the glass like an image projected from a faulty instrument for a few moments she even seemed to disappear and there was only darkness where once she had been i have many names she said as her face was slowly illumined back into existence lit from within except that it was different now even in the rainslicked glass barbara could tell that she had changed she was more beautiful yet also more terrifying but which is the true name which is closest to what you truly are darina said the woman you can call me darina barbara shuddered her legs felt weak and she was grateful that she had the kitchen sink to support her she suddenly wanted to feel cool water on her face at worst it would hide her tears if she began to cry ive heard of you she said they send you after those who renege youre the shadow in the corner the blood on the glass another smaller face joined the womans the child had come why are you here asked barbara were you sent as a temptation as a reward no i am neither of those then why because you have already been tempted and we fear that you may have succumbed tempted by what by the promise of salvation i dont know what you mean who is the boy is he really your son in the stories barbara had heard of this woman there had been no mention of a child sometimes when it suited her ends she had worked with others but they were similar in nature to herself barbara had encountered one of them many years before a bloated imp of a man his neck swollen by a filthy goiter an outward manifestation of his spiritual pollution the sight of him the stench of him had provided her with the first true insight into the nature of those whom she served and of the price that would ultimately have to be paid perhaps she now thought that was the moment when the seed of doubt had been sown and the lymphoma had been the final stimulus she had required to act a reminder of the greater torment to come but that man was dead now or so they said the ones like barbara who whispered behind their masters backs but had never gone as far as she had had never resorted to betraying them yes he is my son said darina approaching barbara from behind my son and so much more she reached out and laid her hand on barbaras shoulder forcing her to turn to look her in the face her eyes had gone completely black no distinction between pupil and iris twin eclipsed suns suspended against pristine whiteness beside her the boy stared unblinkingly at barbara there was something familiar about him she thought but then the womans hand moved from barbaras shoulder to her armpit languidly brushing against her left breast along the way her fingertips found the swollen lymphs and barbara felt a coldness seeping through her system how did you think you could keep this hidden from us she asked ive kept it hidden from everyone why should you be any different barbara replied and she was briefly astonished at her own bravado even darina appeared surprised and the boy scowled in disapproval darinas fingers pressed harder into barbaras flesh and a pain shot through her that was unlike any she had experienced before it was as though the woman had reached out to each individual cancer cell and they had responded to her touch the strength went out of barbaras legs at last and she sank to the floor the woman and child standing over her now as tears sprang from her eyes the pain that had flared throughout her system slowly reducing to a dull awful glow because we are different said darina we could have helped you how how could you have helped me i am dying can you cure cancer she laughed that would be the kind of joke youd appreciate the capacity to prevent pain and misery held back from those who need it no said darina but we could have brought your pain to an end it would have been as if you had fallen asleep and when you woke all pain would be gone a new world would be waiting for you your reward for all that you had done for us and in the blackness of her eyes barbara saw the furnace flames and smelled the smoke on the womans breath and tasted burned flesh lies all lies any rewards were received in this life not the next and they were dearly bought the price of them was the loss of peace of mind the price of them was endless guilt the price of them was the betrayal of strangers and friends of lovers and children barbara knew after all she had looked for those who might be exploited and formulated the agreements to which they appended their names and signed away their futures in this world and the next but instead the woman continued you began to doubt you were frightened and you looked for a way out that i understand i cannot condone it but i can understand it you felt fear and distress and you sought a means to assuage them but to confess to repent to betray she grasped barbaras face in her hands her fingers digging into the skin below her cheeks and all for what for the promise of salvation here let me whisper to you listen to my truth there is no salvation there is no god god is a lie god is the name given to false hope the entity that brought this world into being is long gone we are all that remain here and elsewhere no said barbara i do not believe you she kept a gun by her nightstand but she had never had cause to use it she tried to figure out a way that she might get to it then realized there was no way the woman would fall for any trick whatever she planned to do she had to do it here in the kitchen her eyes began to cast about for potential weapons the knives on their magnetic rack the saucepans hanging from their ornate hooks above the kitchen island behind her the coffee pot was bubbling the plate had started to overheat a week ago shed meant to have it fixed or replaced when it began to act up but she hadnt managed to get around to it instead shed simply started using instant for herself afraid that the glass on the pot might crack if she didnt keep an eye on it we are the only hope of immortality said darina watch and ill prove it to you but barbara had no intention of watching anything the car keys were on the table in the hall if she could make it to her car shed find her way to safety she had already reached out to those who might be in a position to help her they could hide her shelter her they might even be able to find a place for her to rest a bed in which to die in peace as the disease had its way with her sanctuary that was the word she would seek sanctuary darina sensed the threat as barbara rose although she could not pinpoint its source she simply knew that the cornered prey was about to strike back she moved quickly but not as fast as her intended victim barbara grabbed the coffee pot and threw its contents into the womans face a chorus of happy birthday rang out from the direction of the fulcis table i went over to join in with it and we sang around a candlelit heap of cupcakes while the fulcis smiled proudly at their mother and mrs fulci beamed with love for all and dave evans somehow found the strength to sing a couple of words while praying that no stray almonds had found their way into the cupcake mix the candles were blown out cupcakes were passsed around and mrs fulci didnt die jackie garner prepared to leave and took two cupcakes with him one for his girlfriend and one for his mother i made a mental note to ask him more about his mothers health when the opportunity presented itself then returned to the booth at the back where marielle vetters and ernie scollay were exchanging words it looked like marielle was trying to convince ernie that theyd done the right thing by talking to me and ernie was reluctantly agreeing so thats our story said marielle vetters what do you think you want something stronger than coffee now i asked because i do ernie scollay consented to a small whisky and marielle accepted a glass of cab sauv i had the same although i barely sipped it i just liked having it in my hand there was also the fact that ernie hadnt relaxed for a single moment since hed entered the bar he may not have been much of a drinker by his own admission but now that the story was told he clearly felt that hed earned a glass for his efforts some of the tension went out of his body with the first sip he leaned back in the booth and tuned out of the conversation his thoughts elsewhere perhaps with his dead brother standing beside pauls closed casket what do you want me to do i asked i dont know said marielle we felt that we had to tell you what happened both of my parents mentioned you before their deaths why didnt he come to me himself after his wife spoke of me i said he told me that he didnt think it would do any good and paul scollay counseled him against it too they were always frightened about the money they were afraid that if they came to you then youd report them to the police but you were supposed to hear about what my father did which was why he waited until the law could do nothing to him before he spoke to me of you as for me i guess i wanted you to advise us we were afraid that man brightwell might come back but if what you say is true theres no chance of that my hand tightened involuntarily on my wine glass marielle was wrong i had been warned not to kill brightwell he was supposed to be taken alive because there were those who believed that the entity that animated him the dark spirit that kept his decaying body moving would depart at the moment of his death and migrate to another form only the host body died the infection remained frankly i didnt think there was enough whisky and wine in the world to make ernie scollay and marielle vetters happy to hear that anyway it might not even be true after all who would be foolish enough to believe such a thing no no chance i said little chance perhaps how did you first come across him said marielle i encountered him in the course of a case a few years back he was i searched for the right word but couldnt find it so i settled for unusual my father had served in korea he didnt think anything could frighten him more than hordes of chinese coming at him over the brow of a hill but brightwell did he had that capacity he terrified he tortured he murdered no loss to the world then precious little how did he die that doesnt matter its enough to know that hes dead ernie scollay came back to us from wherever his thoughts had taken him he worried at the base of his tie rubbing it between his fingers as though trying to remove a stain eventually he said what would happen if the police found out about what harlan and paul did ah there it was are you still worried about the money mr scollay its a lot at least for a man like me i never had that much money in my life and i sure dont have it now could they make us pay it back its possible look lets be straight with one another here an act of theft was committed out there in the woods the money wasnt theirs to take but you werent aware of the source of the money until harlan vetters confessed on his deathbed right your brother never spoke of this to you did he mr scollay no he answered and i believed him my brother wasnt above doing some poaching when it suited him and i know that he used to smuggle liquor and tobacco too once upon a time i got used to him having money in his pocket one day and none the next but i chose not to ask him how he came by whatever he had marielle looked at him in surprise paul was a smuggler ernie shifted awkwardly in his seat im not saying he was a master criminal or nothing but he wasnt above engaging in illegalities it was a wonderful turn of phrase i was starting to like ernie scollay more and more did my father know about pauls smuggling asked marielle i guess so he had eyes in his head but he didnt oh no no not harlan scollay caught my eye and a corner of his mouth rose mischievously making him look decades younger not that i know of anyway its an evening of revelations i said as far as the money is concerned any potential criminal action died when those men died a civil action well thats another matter if you were to go to the police and tell them what you know and someone came forward with proof of ownership of that money as a consequence then its possible that an attempt could be made to seek restitution from the estates of the deceased men id have to seek advice on that though im just speculating for now and if we remain silent said marielle then that plane stays where it is until someone else discovers it assuming that ever happens who knows about it just you two marielle shook her head no my brother was there when my father told his story he knows most of what i do most that was an interesting choice of word why most grady is a troubled man hes had problems with alcohol and drugs my fathers dying hit him hard theyd always fought and even on my fathers deathbed they struggled to make up i think grady felt angry at my dad and guilty for what hed put my dad through by acting like a douche for most of his life he found it difficult to be in the same room as him the story my father told he told to us over the space of two days sometimes hed fall asleep or lose his concentration hed become anxious or frustrated and wed have to calm him down and let him rest but he always came back to the tale but by then grady wouldnt always be around he was hooking up with old buddies reliving his youth it wasnt quite a party for him but sometimes it sure seemed that way in the end he wasnt even there when my father finally passed away one of my dads friends had to go drag him from a bar before the body went cold can you trust him to keep his mouth shut her shoulders sagged i couldnt even trust him to stay sober for the funeral you have to make the possible consequences of loose talk clear to him did your father leave much in his will hardly anything at all the house a little money in the bank most of his savings she paused at the word smiled resignedly and continued went to caring for my mother who gets the house everything was split evenly between us even with all of gradys problems my father didnt want to be seen to favor one child over another im trying to secure a bank loan to buy out gradys half of the house he doesnt want to live up in the county again and he certainly doesnt want to be tied to falls end there arent enough bars for him and his exes are mostly married or overweight or gone to texas the novelty of being back in falls end wore off about the same time that my dad died do you want me to speak to your brother no i imagine you can be quite persuasive but its better if i talk him around myself we get on okay grady and i his beef was with our father not with me well make sure he understands that if he talks the house itself may be at risk and in that case nobody will get anything and you mr scollay did your brother bequeath you anything when he died just his truck and even then he still owed payments on it he was only ever renting his house money went through my brothers fingers like sand im just glad that he held onto enough of that forest cash to make fighting his sickness easier for him but it was all pretty much spent by the time he died i guess thats as it should be that money was tainted from the moment they found it and im glad i dont have to worry about any of it now in conclusion i got no interest in anybody else hearing about that plane in the woods in an ideal world youd forget we ever told you anything at all and that seemed to be that as far as they were concerned marielle asked me about payment for my time and i told her that all id done was listen to a story over coffee and wine in a bar that hardly counted as billable hours ernie scollay looked relieved he probably didnt believe that anyone down in the cities did anything for nothing he asked marielle if she was ready to go and she said that shed follow him in a few minutes just as soon as he brought the truck around he looked a little reluctant to leave as though fearful that there might be further disclosures go on now ernie said marielle i just need a moment or two with mr parker here about a private matter im not going to speak out of turn he nodded shook my hand and headed out into the evening a private matter i said private enough this brightwell who was he really none of that bullshit about him being unusual or nothing i want to know the truth you could say that he was a member of a cult they called themselves believers that trident symbol on his wrist was an identifying mark for whom for others like himself and what did they believe in they believed in the existence of fallen angels some of them even believed that they were angels themselves its not an uncommon delusion although they took it to a rarefied level did brightwell believe he was a fallen angel he did she considered what i had just said what did my mother mean when she spoke of a hidden angel there were two possible meanings the first was a legend arising out of the great banishment of the rebel angels and their fall from heaven to earth that one repented and even though he believed he had no hope of forgiveness for his transgressions he continued to make recompense turning his back on his angry despairing brethren eventually concealing himself amid the great sprawling mass of humanity but i shared with marielle the second possibility brightwell believed that he was the servant of twin angels two halves of the same being one had been found by its enemies a long time before and imprisoned in silver to prevent it from roaming but brightwell and the other angel had continued to search for it they were consumed by their need to free it jesus and did he find what he was looking for he died finding it but yes he thought that he did at the end that woman darina flores could she have shared the same beliefs if as it seems she was with brightwell when he came to falls end then its possible but she didnt have a mark like that i asked my father it might have been hidden ive never heard of darina flores until tonight she sat back and stared at me why was brightwell so interested in that plane are you asking me to find out she considered the question and then some of the tension released itself from her no i think youre right and ernie is too we should just stay quiet and leave the plane where it is in answer to your question brightwell wasnt interested in money or not as an end in itself if he was curious about that plane it was because of something else if your father was right about a passenger being on that plane cuffed to a seat then its possible this individual was the object of brightwells curiosity that or the papers your father saw those names had meaning theyre a record of some kind so the cash was only a means to an end for brightwell he confronted your father at your mothers rest home because he and presumably the flores woman were looking out for unusual spending patterns the cost of your mothers care qualified do you think brightwell accepted my fathers lie about the source of the funds even if he didnt he never had the chance to pursue the matter he died in the same year that he confronted your father again she gave me the stare she wasnt a fool ernie scollay might principally have been worried about the police or someone coming after him for money that he didnt have but marielle vetters had deeper concerns you called them believers plural even if the woman wasnt one that still implies that there are more of them out there more like him no i said there were never any others like him he was unpleasant in ways that you cant even begin to imagine as for the believers i think theyve been wiped out but this flores woman may be something different thats why its better if you and mr scollay keep a lid on this if shes still out there you dont want to bring her down upon yourselves a horn tooted in the parking lot ernie scollay was growing impatient your rides here i said ernie knew about the plane before i did said marielle his brother told him the story before he died and it was only when i came to him with the rest of it that he felt compelled to seek advice hell stay quiet now hes a good man but hes no fool ill work on my brother too he can be an idiot but hes a selfaware idiot he wont want to put easy money at risk and youre not going to say anything either no she said which just leaves you im not bound by issues of client confidentiality since strictly speaking youre not a client but i know what these people are like im not going to put you your family or mr scollay at risk she nodded in understanding both at what i had said and its subtext and rose i have one last question mr parker she said do you believe in fallen angels i did not lie to her yes i think i do from her bag she produced a sheet of paper it looked old and had clearly been unfolded and refolded many times she placed it by my right hand what is it i asked my father left the satchel on the plane but he took from it one sheet of names he couldnt say why i think he saw it as some form of additional security if something happened to him or to paul then this might have provided a clue to the identity of those responsible she rested her hand on my shoulder as she passed just dont mention our names she said and then she was gone in the pristine kitchen of a connecticut house barbara kelly was fighting for what little life she had left darina flores took an instant to react to the pain as the coffee struck her face she screamed and raised her hands as though she could simply wipe the liquid from her face then it began to burn and her shrieks rose in pitch as she stumbled back against the kitchen island her legs tangled under her and she fell to the floor the boys mouth formed a silent o of shock he froze and barbara pushed him aside so hard that the back of his head hit the marble countertop with a hollow sickening sound that set her teeth on edge she didnt look back not even when she felt darinas nails raking at her ankle barbara almost lost her footing but she held her nerve and kept her eyes fixed on the hall stand and her car keys and the front door she grabbed the keys in passing yanked the door open and found herself out in the pounding rain the car parked a few feet away in the drive she clicked the unlock button on the fob the lights came on and the car beeped its welcome she already had the drivers door fully open when something landed on her back wrapping its legs around her belly as its hands tore at her hair and eyes she turned her head and saw the boys face close to the left side of her own his mouth opened revealing nasty rodentlike teeth and he bit hard into her cheek tearing at the flesh until a chunk of it came away now it was barbaras turn to scream she reached behind her pulling at his windbreaker trying to yank him off he held on tightly and now his jaws were coming in for a second bite this time at her neck she slammed him hard against the body of the car and felt the wind go out of him she did it again and this time she followed through with the back of her head his nose broke against her skull and he released his grip on her but he knocked the keys from her hand as he fell he slumped to the ground one hand protecting his ruined nose she turned on him and aimed a sharp kick at his ribs god her face hurt she could see her reflection in the glass a jagged red hole the size of a silver dollar in her cheek she looked to the gravel and found the keys she bent to pick them up and when she stood again darina was behind her barbara had no time to react before the knife sliced at her left leg cutting the tendons behind the knee she went down hard and the full weight of the woman struck her followed by more pain as the second sweep of the blade disabled barbaras right leg now she was the one being kicked as the woman forced her onto her back forced her to gaze upon what barbara had done to her looks darina would never be beautiful again most of her face was a deep scalded red her left eye was red and swollen from the way she held her head barbara could tell that she was now blind in that eye good thought barbara even as she writhed in agony against the hard gravel her legs on fire what have you done to me said darina only the left side of her mouth moved and then just slightly slurring the words i fucked you up you bitch said barbara i fucked you up good darina raised her ruined face to the heavens allowing the cooling rain to fall upon it the boy appeared beside her his nose had swollen and was streaming blood where is your threeheaded god now asked darina where is your salvation she pointed at the boy show her she said to him show her the meaning of true resurrection the boy lowered his hood exposing an uneven skull that was already balding wisps of hair clinging to it like lichens to rock slowly he unzipped his jacket revealing his neck to her and the purple goiter that was already swelling there no said barbara no no she put her hands out as though they might have the power to ward him off and then her arms were being grasped and she was being pulled back into the house her screams lost against the thunder and the rain her blood spilling then vanishing washed away just as surely as hope and life were about to be she began to whisper an act of contrition ii what beckning ghost along the moonlight shade invites my step and points to yonder glade elegy to the memory of an unfortunate lady alexander pope north again north of new york north of boston north of portland north to the last places they were lost andrea foster knew it even if her husband wouldnt admit it he never admitted his failings if he could avoid it but she could tell that he wasnt sure of where they were he kept looking at his map as if its neat details of hills and trails bore any relation to the haphazard reality of the forest around them and consulting his compass in the hope that between paper and instrument he might be able to find his bearings still she knew better than to ask if he had any idea where they were or where they were going hed just snap and sulk and an already irksome day would deteriorate further at least theyd remembered to bring the percent deet spray so the insects were being kept at bay although probably at the cost of some kind of longterm damage to brain cells if it came down to a choice between being eaten alive in the woods right now and a deterioration of her mental functioning somewhere down the line shed take her chances with brain death hed assured her that insects wouldnt be a problem at this time of year but here they were small flies mostly but shed also had to fight off a wasp and that had bothered her more than anything else wasps had no business being alive in november and any that survived would be in a foul mood shed killed the wasp by swatting it with her hat and then crushing it beneath her boot but shed seen others since then it was almost as if the deeper they went into the woods the more of the insects there were there was still some repellent in the dispenser but it was running disturbingly low she wanted to get back to civilization before it ran out entirely it was warm too logic said that the shade of the trees should have cooled them some but that didnt seem to be the case she had found herself struggling for breath on occasion and her thirst never seemed to be slaked no matter how much water she drank she usually liked day hikes but after this one shed happily spend a couple of days in a nice hotel drinking wine taking long baths and reading a book once today was over and they were back in falls end shed talk to chris about heading up to quebec or montreal a little earlier than theyd planned shed had enough of the great outdoors and she suspected that secretly he had as well he was just too stubborn to admit it just as he was too stubborn to hold up his hands and confess that if they werent quite up shit creek they could smell it from where they were shed only reluctantly agreed to this trip pressure of work meant that chris had been forced to cancel his summer vacation plans so she and their daughters had joined her sister and her kids in tampa for ten days while chris stayed in new york it was the downside of being selfemployed when the work was there you had to take it especially with times being so tough but he loved the maine woods they reminded him of his childhood he said when friends of his parents would offer them the use of their camp at the forks for a couple of weeks each summer so this was a nostalgic trip for him particularly since his mother had passed away in january and andrea could hardly have refused to accompany him she had been a little reluctant to go traipsing through the woods during hunting season but he assured her that theyd be fine especially decked out as they were in reflective orange orange was not her color orange was not anybodys color she looked to the sky there was an oppressive clouding to it which concerned her there might even be rain coming although she couldnt recall it being forecast damn it said chris there should be a stream around here if we follow it itll take us back to town he looked left and right hoping for some glimmer of silver listening for the sound of running water but there was nothing not even the song of a bird she so badly wanted to shout at him i dont hear a stream do you hear a stream no because theres no fucking stream here were lost how long have you been leading us in the wrong direction how fucking hard can it be to distinguish between north south east and west youre the great outdoorsman you have the compass and a map come on tonto figure it out he turned to look at her as if shed screamed so loudly in her head that some atavistic part of his brain had picked up on it it should be here andrea he said ive been heading east following the compass he sounded bewildered and he looked like a small boy some of her anger at him diminished show me she said he handed over the compass and pointed a manicured finger at the map he was right they seemed to be heading east and at their rate of progress they should have been at the little head stream by now she tapped the compass more out of habit than anything else slowly the needle turned degrees what the hell said chris he took the instrument back from his wife how can it be doing that he jabbed at the compass with his own finger the needle didnt move could we have been going west all this time asked andrea no i can tell east from west we were heading east i think for the first time he sounded genuinely worried they had an emergency kit and some food but neither of them had any desire to spend the night out in the woods without the proper equipment in fact they werent fans of sleeping outdoors at the best of times both of them liked their creature comforts and a long days hike was made worthwhile by the promise of a little luxury and a good meal at the end of it she looked up at the sky again but there were only glimpses of it to be seen between the trees they were thicker here and more ancient some of them must have been centuries old their trunks distended and tumorous their branches like broken limbs that had been set wrongly the terrain was rocky in places and there was a stench on the air it smelled like old stew made with innards maybe you could climb a tree and get our bearings she said and giggled thats not helpful said chris he scowled at her and she giggled again she didnt know why she was laughing they were lost and while it wasnt as bad as being adrift in the woods when snow was falling and there was a chance that they might freeze to death their cell phones had no signal they still only had limited supplies and the temperature was bound to fall once darkness came nobody knew that they were out here either theyd checked out of their motel in rangeley shortly after dawn just in case they found somewhere more interesting along the way north and their car was now parked on the main street of falls end it might be days before someone noticed that it hadnt moved shed told chris that they should have made a provisional booking somewhere in falls end but hed replied that it was too early to start thinking about that and the town seemed quiet anyway and if they made a start on the hike theyd be back by late afternoon that was one of his other faults he hated committing to anything in advance even a motel room in a small town when they went out to dinner in a new city he would walk her from restaurant to restaurant examining each menu in turn always looking for the perfect food in the perfect place there had been evenings where they had walked and debated for so long that everywhere good was either closed or full by the time chris made a decision and theyd ended up eating burgers in a bar her husband simmering at missed opportunities and whats that stink said chris it smells like cheap meat was boiling in a pot and then it went off she replied it might mean that theres a house nearby out here i didnt see any road you notice how thick the trees are there could be a fourlane highway a stones throw from here and we wouldnt know about it until we heard a truck theres no highway out here she wanted to say there isnt even a hiking trail we lost that when you decided to explore and now look at the mess were in she remembered a cartoon shed seen in a magazine once depicting a family in the wilderness surrounding a father who was examining a map the caption read what matters isnt so much where we are as who we blame for it if theres a house there may be a phone chris went on at the very least we can ask for directions back to town andrea supposed that he was right although she wasnt sure how much time she wanted to spend dealing with someone who lived so deep in the great north woods anyone who had come this far to find some solitude wasnt necessarily going to welcome two lost city dwellers smelling of sweat and deet into his lovely secluded home there said chris he was pointing to his right what i saw someone she looked but could see nothing the branches of the trees moved creating a faint rustling odd she had felt no breeze are you sure there was a man among those trees im sure of it hey hey over here were lost we need a little help he put his hand to his forehead to shade his eyes sonofabitch i think hes heading away from us hey hey andrea still couldnt see anyone but she joined in with her husbands shouts just in case the man was concerned at the presence of a solitary male on his territory please she called we dont mean any harm we just need to get back on the trail chris folded the map and stuffed it into his rucksack come on he said to her come on where were going after him what are you crazy if he doesnt want to help us thats his business chasing after him isnt going to make things better jesus andrea there has to be some kind of code of the forest right its like the law of the sea you dont leave people stranded when theyre in trouble all were looking for is directions andrea had never heard of a code of the forest and she was pretty sure that none existed even if it did then just as with the law of the sea there would be those who did not abide by it she didnt know what the forest equivalent of a pirate might be and she didnt want to find out people went missing in these woods and some of them were never found again they couldnt all have been eaten by bears could they what if he has a gun she said i dont have a gun why would he shoot me you know deliverance was just a movie anyway that was somewhere in the south theyre different down there this is maine he set off after the man only he had seen andrea trailed after him she had no choice the woods were thick and she didnt want to lose sight of her husband the only thing worse than being in their current situation would be to find herself in it alone he was setting a fast pace now that was chris all over once he eventually got an idea fixed in his head hed pursue it full speed to its conclusion like a lot of men she knew he couldnt follow more than one clear line of thought for any length of time but he had a determination that she sometimes lacked wait up chris she said well lose him youll lose me he paused his left hand outstretched to her from the top of a small incline while he continued to look ahead is he still there no hold on hes back again hes staring at us where she strained her eyes squinting into the forest gloom i still cant see him i think hes raising his arm he wants us to follow him yep thats definitely it hes showing us the way are you sure what else would he be doing uh leading us deeper into the woods why would he want to do that because people are just bad sometimes because he means to hunt us i dont know he might want to steal from us he wouldnt have to lead us deeper into the forest to do that he could just hold us up right here chris had a point but she still felt uneasy lets just be careful okay im always careful no youre not thats how i got pregnant with danielle remember he flashed that grin at her the one that had attracted her back at college the one that had made her climb into bed with him the first time and she responded in kind with that sly sexy smile that always caused the hairs on the back of his neck to rise up and other parts of him to rise too and both of them made the same wish that they were in bed together with a bottle of wine halfdrunk beside them and the taste of it on their lips and tongues as they kissed its going to be okay he said i believe you she replied but no more hiking for a while after this promise promise she took his hand and he squeezed it as she stood beside him she saw the man for the first time perhaps it was the cloud cover combining with the natural gloom of the forest but it seemed to her that he was dressed in some kind of a cloak he wore a hood over his head so that she could not see his face he was clearly beckoning to them though her husband had been right about that she felt an ache in her stomach a cold pain shed always had a good sense about other people although chris just tended to smile indulgently when she spoke of it men were different they were less attuned to their own potential vulnerability women needed that added awareness of the dangers that surrounded them shed passed it on to their girls she hoped attuning them to it this man meant them some harm she was sure of it she was just glad that the girls were safe with her parents in albany and not out here in the woods she tried to speak but then chriss hand slipped from hers and he was moving again following the slowly waving figure following him deeper and deeper into the woods and she followed after it was the day after my meeting with marielle vetters and ernie scollay the month of november was set to die a sticky death it seemed a snowstorm had hit early in the month presaging a long cold winter but no further snows had followed and slowly the temperature had climbed until there were days when a sweater seemed too much to wear and nights when the bars let their doors stand open to allow a little air to circulate now there was at least a north wind blowing and from the window of my office at home i watched the cordgrass of the scarborough marshes perform delicate dances at the breezes call on my desk before me was the typewritten list given to me by marielle it consisted of seven names six men and one woman beside four of those names were sums of money ranging from to the other three names each had the word contacted handwritten beside them followed by accepted in two cases and refused in one just one of the names was familiar to me and then only after i had crosschecked a box number to make sure that it was the same person aaron newman was a reporter with one of the new york newspapers a political writer with what appeared to be extremely good sources his profile had risen recently following a series of articles exposing a married congressmans contacts with a pair of nineteenyearold boys whom he may or may not have paid for sexual favors naturally the congressmans career had immediately gone down the toilet and his wife had helped to flush the bowl by failing to appear at any of his tearyeyed press conferences the flock is easily led show them a penitent with a forgiving spouse and theyll consider forgiving too but give them a penitent alone on a platform and theyll start looking for rocks to throw newmans name did not have a sum of money beside it only the word accepted the name of a second man davis tate rang a bell somewhere and the miracle of google did the rest tate was a talk radio shock jock a minor celebrity on the extreme right the kind who gave a bad name to ordinary conservatives who didnt immediately hate on sight anyone who wasnt like them in race creed or sexual orientation tates name had a letter a handwritten after it along with three asterisks either he was a very good student or davis tate had accepted or been accepted with more than usual enthusiasm one of the others a woman called solene escott had a twelvedigit number beside her name but it didnt work as a telephone number and when i tried an internet search on it i came up with nothing even when i included her name alongside a further trawl produced a handful of solene escotts including a banker a writer and a housewife who had died in a car accident in october somewhere north of milford new hampshire i looked again at those twelve digits beside solene escotts name which unlike the others on the list was typed in red then separated them into two sixdigit numbers the first set ended in the second in the first numbers conformed to the date of solene escotts birth according to her obituary and the second set matched the date on which she died but according to the newspaper found in the plane it had gone down in july three months before solene escott perished either someone connected to that plane had a direct line to god or solene escotts death had been planned well in advance the obituary also gave me the name of solene escotts husband solene had kept her own name when she married her husbands name was kenneth chan apparently known to his friends and associates as kenny his name was typed above solenes on the list beside it was written the word accepted it took me another hour to come up with a possible identity for one further name on the list and again it was solene escott who provided the link the only person with refused beside his name was one brandon felice a brandon felice had been killed in a gas station robbery outside of newburyport massachusetts in march there was no apparent reason for his death according to an eyewitness a salesman who had been drinking coffee in his car across the street when the robbery occurred felice had been pumping gas into his mercedes when two masked men pulled up in a buick both armed with pistols one of the men ordered the attendant to empty the register while the other forced felice and a woman antonia viga who had been putting air in the tires of her minivan to lie on the ground when the first raider emerged with the cash having first shot and seriously wounded the attendant the second walked to where felice and viga were lying and shot both of them in the back of the head the men then drove off and the buick was later found burned out off route the buick had been stolen earlier from back bay in boston the raiders netted a total of in the course of the robbery and were never found brandon felice was linked to solene escott through her husband kenny chan felice escott and chan had been involved in a software startup company branken developments inc in which each of them held a onethird share felice had not been married and had no children upon his death his share was acquired by a company named pryor investments meanwhile solene escotts share in the company had passed to her husband following her fatal accident id never heard of pryor investments but another search revealed a little about the company it was a very discreet operation working on behalf of clients who preferred that their business dealings should remain as anonymous as possible the only time that pryor made the news was when something went wrong most recently in when it was found to have inadvertently broken an embargo on new investment in burma one of pryors junior partners appended his signature to a contract from what was ostensibly a foreignincorporated and headquartered subsidiary of a shelf company in panama but which was traced back to pryors offices in boston pryor had received a fine following an investigation by the treasury departments office of foreign assets control and the junior partner had been punished with the equivalent of an hour on the naughty step garrison pryor the companys ceo described it as an isolated incident and an error of detail whatever that meant branken developments meanwhile had specialized in security algorithms for the defense and weapons industries and became a significant player in its field in the company had quietly ceased trading its operations were folded into a subsidiary of the defense department and kenny chan had retired reputedly a very wealthy man pryor investments was once again involved it had brokered the deal for a percentage of the profits from the sale the twist to the tale lay in the fate of kenny chan in he was found dead in his own safe surrounded by share certificates various forms of gold currency and about in cash the safe was big but not big enough to take kenny chan comfortably so someone had broken his arms and legs to make him more malleable it was some time before his body was discovered and it was unclear whether he had suffocated or choked to death on the swiss gold franc found lodged in his throat so kenny chans wife died in a car accident that appeared to have been planned in advance and his business partner was shot for no reason during a gas station robbery a few months later kenny chan subsequently made a killing by selling his accumulated shares in his company before someone made a killing of a more literal kind on kenny chan with robbery apparently not the motive at the very least mr chan had led an interesting if relatively brief life solene escotts death was treated by police as an unfortunate accident the investigation into brandon felices death appeared to have dried up with no resolution and kenny chans demise remained quite the mystery the other two names on the list meant nothing to me although i discovered obituary notices for any number of people who might have been them without something more than the names in isolation it seemed that i wasnt likely to get any further with the list and all the time i kept coming back to brightwell brightwell a killer of men and women a harvester and repository of souls a being whose image had appeared in photographs from the second world war hardly different from the face of the man who had still been murdering for his cause sixty years later and who bore a startling resemblance to a figure in a centuriesold painting of a battlefield fighting alongside a fallen angel i had killed him and yet i had been led to doubt whether one such as he could ever be dispatched with a bullet or a blade i still heard whispers of creatures reborn of the transmigration of spirits and had witnessed the consequences of vengeance pursued through generations brightwell and those like him were not of the order of men they were other so what had drawn brightwell to the town of falls end and how was the list connected that afternoon i began clearing my desk of other work there wasnt very much to clear business had picked up some in the last few months but it still didnt amount to a whole lot the previous year the case of a missing girl with which id become involved through my lawyer aimee price had attracted a lot of attention and it had led to offers of similar work id turned down all but one a man named juan lozano a spanish academic and translator who had married an american woman from the northern maine town of harden had hired me to find his wife theyd had an argument over sex he told me and shed left him sexual relations between them had virtually ceased over the previous two years and he had accused her of having an affair theyd had a shouting match hed stormed out and when he returned she was gone he just wanted to know that she was okay he said nothing more id accepted his money because i thought that finding her would be easy her credit cards were still being used and withdrawals had been made from atms in the dc area using her bank card in the two days prior to my first meeting with lozano beatrice his wife was either alive and well or someone was using her cards and being careless about it i flew down to dc and rented a car it took me less than a day to find beatrice lozano she was holed up in a motel called the lamplighter in a small town near chesapeake bay the battered rental she had picked up a week earlier from a firm that wasnt giving hertz and avis any headaches about competition parked directly outside the room when i knocked on the door she didnt bother to put the security chain in place before opening it the room was dark but even when she stepped into the sunlight i couldnt tell if she was plain or pretty she was in her midthirties and spreading slightly her face was pale her short hair greasy and plastered to her skull her skin dotted with pimples there were fresh open cuts to her arms and hands as we spoke the thumb and index finger of her right hand moved to her left and the nails began to dig into the flesh creating a new wound for her to explore her eyes were dead and the skin around them was so dark that it looked like shed been beaten did he send you to look for me she asked after i told her who i was if youre talking about your husband then yes he did are you going to take me back to him do you want to go back no then i wont but youll tell him where i am he hired me to find out if you were okay i said if its what you want ill inform him that i saw you and you seemed fine itll be a lie but thats what ill tell him a lie she frowned youre tearing holes in your skin youre not sleeping or if you are youre having bad dreams youve been moving from motel to motel but you havent planned what youre doing well enough to avoid using credit cards your husband didnt seem too familiar with your wardrobe but he was pretty certain that you hadnt taken many clothes with you when you ran so it was a snap decision on your part you havent run away with anybody because i can see only one suitcase in the room behind you and no sign of a man or another woman sharing the room and if you had run away with someone i think youd probably be paying more attention to your appearance no offense meant none taken she managed to raise a smile you sound like sherlock holmes every private detective wants to be sherlock holmes except maybe without the gay undertones we were still standing outside her room it didnt seem like the best place to discuss the intimate details of her life do you mind if we sit down somewhere to talk about this mrs lozano it doesnt have to be your room if youd rather keep that private or if youre concerned about admitting a stranger we can find a quiet diner a coffee shop a bar whatever you prefer if youre worried about your safety with me you shouldnt be im not going to do anything to harm you and if you want to call the police at any time you can do that and ill stay with you until they come i can also give you the name of a couple of cops in maine and new york wholl vouch for me i reconsidered well maybe not new york and possibly just one in maine he might also swear some when you mention my name no she said no police she stepped back into her room we can talk in here despite the no smoking sign beside the tv the room smelled strongly of old tobacco there was no closet just a rail from which hung three empty wire coat hangers there were two beds separated by a single nightstand on a carpet the color of pea soup and one of the skirting boards was coming away from the wall mrs lozanos case lay on the floor beside the bed on the right it contained a pitiable array of clothes some cheap toiletries and a paperback book she sat on the edge of one bed and i sat facing her on the other our knees almost touched why did you leave mrs lozano i asked her face crumpled she began to cry did your husband hurt you she shook her head no hes a good man a sweet man i took a paper tissue from the box on the nightstand and handed it to her thank you she said do you love your husband mrs lozano i asked yes i love him very much thats why i ran away i wanted to protect him from what she gagged as though the words she wanted to say had to be vomited up not spoken it took her three tries to produce them im protecting him from my brother she said why what does your brother do this time she did vomit she put her hand to her mouth and puked bile into the palm he rapes me she said my brother rapes me beatrice lozanos maiden name was reed her older brother was a man named perry reed who sold used cars to people who didnt know what they were buying and crystal meth oxycontin and canadian prescription medicines to people who did he also ran a couple of titty bars with dancers who qualified as hookers if you examined the fine print closely enough perry reed was slick plausible sociopathically violent and had begun raping his sister when she was fourteen it stopped when she was in her late teens and left for college occurred sporadically during her twenties and had resumed with some intensity shortly after she got married perry would come to the house when her husband was away although sometimes he would summon her to the auto dealership or to one of the apartments he owned in and around harden if it wasnt being rented at the time she always went because he had warned her that hed kill her husband if she ever refused him or if she spoke a word to him or anyone else about what they did together in their private moments when her husband accused her of having an affair something had broken inside her shed run away because she couldnt stay in harden and she couldnt talk to her husband about what her brother did to her all this she told me a stranger in her bedroom in the lamplighter motel perry has men who work for him she said theyre as bad as he is he told me that even if he couldnt get to juan they would and then alex wilder would haul me into the woods and he and his friends would take turns raping me before burying me alive and i believe my brother mr parker i believe him because nobody knows him as well as i do who is alex wilder hes my brothers righthand man they share everything theyve even shared me sometimes she swallowed alex is rough with me i gave her another tissue she blew her nose in it arent you going to ask me why ive put up with it for so long she said no she stared at me for a long time thank you she said after we had spoken for a while longer i went outside and called her husband i told him that his wife was safe and i asked him to pack some clothes in a bag for her and take it to the offices of the lawyer named aimee price in south freeport i then called aimee and shared much of what i had heard leaving out only names and locations will she testify i dont know and its appalling but her brother could always claim it was consensual it would be her word against his i dont think so in cases like this the victims testimony is crucial thats immaterial for now she needs immediate help i know some people in dc if she wants to stay down there for a while convince her to talk to a counselor do you know anything about this perry reed just rumors but i plan to find out more that evening i drove beatrice lozano to a sexual trauma specialist in prince georges county and she was immediately admitted to a shelter for abused women one week later her husband came down to visit her and she spoke to him of what she had endured but there remained the problem of perry reed because beatrice lozano refused to testify against him something had to be done about him something had been done two gentlemen of my acquaintance had taken the matter in hand while i was speaking with marielle vetters and ernie scollay in the great lost bear perry reed i heard was going to lead this evenings news chris put his hands on his knees and paused for a breath the air was so damn still and it tasted foul that stink of rotting food was stronger now and he had lost his bearings entirely he thought that theyd been following the unknown man northwest but he could be wrong he had it seemed been wrong about everything else that day now the stranger had disappeared from sight and as far as chris was concerned they were even more lost if there was such a thing as gradations of being lost the flies had grown more persistent too even the deet spray wasnt keeping them away and hed been stung on the back of the neck by a wasp which hurt like hell hed killed it under his hand which gave him some satisfaction hed have to look up the life cycle of wasps when he and andrea got home wasps in november was just plain bizarre the light had changed as the sun began to set the lines of the trees were already less clearly defined as though someone had dropped gauze across the landscape he no longer had any concept of time when he looked at his watch he found that it had stopped they were trudging through a darkening fairytale world and he was ashamed to admit that he was afraid he looked back andrea was struggling she indulged his amateurs taste for outdoor pursuits but she had never really embraced them she suffered through them because he enjoyed them and also for the promise of luxury at the end of a day in the wild maybe it was the catholic in her she was the religious one she still went to church on sundays hed given up on his faith a long time ago in a way the child abuse scandals had provided him with an excuse to feel better about himself and his reluctance to sacrifice an hour of his weekend to the religion of his childhood he did occasionally feel a lapsed believers pang of guilt and was not above making the odd plea for assistance in times of trouble now as he watched his wife drink thirstily from her water bottle he offered up a prayer for their safe return to falls end or anywhere that even resembled a settlement lord i cant say that im going to return to church or that im even going to be much of a better man but we need some help here he whispered if not for my sake then for hers please get us safely back to civilization as if in answer to his prayer their guide if that was what he was appeared among the trees again he lifted his arm enjoining them to follow him hey where are we going chris called to him talk to us we cant keep doing this were tired jesus andrea joined him she pulled down the collar of his jacket to expose the wasp sting and hissed in sympathy that looks bad she said she slipped her pack off and found the tube of antiseptic lotion in the small firstaid kit carefully she applied it to the sting youre not allergic to wasp stings are you you know im not ive been stung before they dont affect me badly uh this one is really big and it seems to be spreading i swear i can feel it in my spine i have some lorazepam in my suitcase she said that should help you might need to see a doctor if it doesnt start going down in the distance one more thin shape among the trees she could see the man watching them how long have we been following him i dont know my watch has stopped stopped yeah mine too they compared watches the time on andreas watch showed five minutes later than her husbands but andrea always set her watch five minutes fast both watches had stopped at the same time thats weird said chris this is all weird said andrea and its going to be dark soon her voice cracked slightly on the word dark she was holding it together but only barely we could go back the way we came but what good would that do he said wed be back in the same position that we were in earlier we have to trust him why because thats what people do when they have no choice he means us harm come on not this again im telling you and id swear hes leading us in circles you dont know that i dont know it but i feel it she saw the strangers head tilt slightly as though he had heard what she said she couldnt get over how dark his silhouette was even when the light had been good shed been unable to tell how he was dressed or discern the lineaments of his face he was like a shadow given life whats he doing now the mans gestures had changed he was pointing to his right jabbing a finger in that direction once he was sure that theyd seen what he was doing he raised the same hand and waved them farewell then disappeared into the trees away from whatever he had been pointing at hes leaving said chris hey where are you going but the man could no longer be seen the shadow had been absorbed by the greater shade of the forest well said chris we may as well go see what he was pointing at could be a road or a house or even a town andrea adjusted her pack on her back and followed her husband her eyes kept returning to the patch of darkness into which the stranger had vanished straining to penetrate it she wanted him to be gone but she was not certain that he was she sensed him waiting in there watching them it was only when her husband spoke that she realized she had stopped walking she willed her feet to move but they wouldnt she wondered if this was how vulnerable animals reacted when faced with a predator and if that was why they died hes gone said chris wherever he was taking us were almost there the hairs on the back of her neck were standing on end her skin prickled he isnt gone she wanted to tell him we cant see him but hes still out there hes led us somewhere but its nowhere that we want to be the slightest of breezes arose it was almost a blessing until they smelled the stench carried upon it there were birds in the air now crows she could hear their cawing she wondered if crows were attracted by dead things its stronger now said chris it smells like a rendering plant you know paper mills smell real bad that could be whats causing it a paper mill out here out where we dont even know where here is we were so lost we could have traveled to canada and not realized it come on he reached out for her hand again but still she did not respond in kind no she said i dont want to go fine he said you stay here and ill go see whats up there he moved away from her but she grabbed at his pack holding him back i dont want to be left here alone he smiled it was his other smile the indulgent patronizing one that he gave her when he thought she was failing to grasp something very simple the one that made her feel about nine years old she thought of it as his man smile because only men ever used it it was ingrained in their dna this time though it didnt make her angry just sad he didnt understand chris came to her and gave her an awkward hug well see what he was pointing at then make our decision okay said chris okay her voice sounded tiny against his chest i love you you know that right i know youre supposed to tell me that you love me too i know that as well he gave her a playful poke in the ribs come on ill buy you a drink a cocktail with champagne with champagne lots of champagne hand in hand they walked to the rise as predicted the evening news bulletin contained a lot of information about perry reed and his activities both business and personal at pm the night before while i was still mulling over what i had just been told of airplanes and lists henry gibbon and alex wilder two close associates of reed king of the far northeasts used auto dealers were stopped by police and dea agents as they drove their respective vehicles from the parking lot of a biker bar ten miles east of harden when the cars were searched the trunks were found to contain a combined total of worth of oxycontin and heroin which came as a surprise to gibbon and wilder as a they were not heroin dealers and b the trunks had been empty when they parked the cars in addition wilders car contained substantial quantities of child pornography on a number of usb drives and a cell phone with more than a dozen suspected providers of child prostitutes among its saved contacts both cars were registered to one perry reed of harden maine at one am a fire swept through the auto lot at perrys used autos in harden aided by high winds and thirty gallons of ethyl alcohol as accelerant destroying his entire inventory all of the buildings on the lot and the titty bar adjacent to it at am perry reed was arrested following a search of his house that produced a large quantity of discs and usb drives containing twentyfive thousand pornographic images of children and a cell phone programmed with numbers identical to those found on the phone in alex wilders car in addition police discovered an unlicensed llama pistol with pearl grips and a chrome finish a pistol that would following examination be found to have been used in the shooting dead of two men in an apartment in brooklyn the previous year and possibly the severe beating of their female companion whose head injuries had left her in a persistent vegetative state their numbers too would be found on both wilders and reeds cell phones and perry reeds prints would be found on the weapon having been lifted from a coffee mug in his office and transferred to the gun before it was planted a fact that was obviously unknown to the police and indeed to perry reed one of the detectives was later heard to comment that perry reed was officially in more trouble than any other single human being hed ever encountered in the course of his entire career closely followed by alex wilder with henry gibbon a distant third the arrests were credited to an anonymous tipoff and everyone seemed pretty satisfied with a good nights work with the possible exception of perry reed who was pleading innocence and demanding to know who had burned down his auto lot and titty bar but since perry reed was now facing the likelihood of a lifetime in prison nobody cared very much what he thought very unfortunate for perry i said to angel later that night as he and louis sat in a booth at the back of the great lost bear the same booth in which i had spoken to marielle and ernie the night before both men were drinking mack point ipa from the belfast brewing company and making dave evans feel uneasy for reasons that he couldnt quite put his finger on angel and louis were from new york although that wasnt why they made dave nervous neither was it their homosexuality dave welcoming anybody to the bear who didnt spill beer insult the staff or try to steal the bars bear head mascot but louis killed people and angel sometimes helped him and if they didnt openly advertise this particular service then the air of potential lethality that hung around them both was usually enough to convince the more sensible of citizens to keep their distance i sometimes wondered how like them i was becoming they had set up reed and his associates but i had formulated the plan a moral philosopher might have said that i was becoming like those whom i fought but he would have been wrong i was my own unique form of monster it was almost like the man wanted to go to jail said louis as he mused upon the fate of perry reed he did seem to be trying very hard i agreed i wonder where all of those drugs came from we borrowed them from some bikers said angel borrowed well it was more of a permanent loan drugs and a gun and child pornography i said some people might call that overkill other people might call it making sure said louis well thats what i paid for remind me how much were getting again asked angel you want another beer yeah i want another beer then you can consider it a one hundred percent bonus i said i dont quibble its not my style i called for another round when it arrived i drank their good health and passed them a bulging brown envelope beatrice lozanos husband had delivered it to my door earlier that afternoon he didnt speak didnt say thank you didnt give any sign that what had occurred in harden might be linked in any way to what had happened to his wife he just handed me the envelope and walked away i know you dont need the money but its nice to be appreciated i said better to have it and not need it angel slipped the money into his pocket aimee price say anything to you about what happened to reed nope smart woman eventually shell cut you loose you know that possibly possibly not no possibly about it she strikes me as one of those strange lawyers who seem concerned about the law not as concerned as you might think when it suits her needs maybe shes not so strange after all maybe not you want to hear something really strange from you if you think its strange we should call the national enquirer get them to sit in i took a sip of my beer its about an airplane and as we spoke andrea foster lay dying there was blood in her mouth blood on her hands blood in her hair only some of it was her own she lay still reliving the events of the last days and hours of her life she hovered above herself and her husband saw them ascending the incline making their way toward whatever it was that the stranger had been pointing at she watched them pause heard chriss exclamation of surprise then shock she saw fallen idols a shattered image of the buddha ganesh covered with blood and filth a pietà from which the sculpted heads had been removed and replaced with those of dolls she saw a wall of wood she saw shadows intersecting two crosses the remains of the men who had died upon them now reduced to bones with more bones piled at the foot of each cross she saw dead birds hanging by their feet from branches she saw chriss mouth open to say something his panic clear and a long tongue erupted from his jaws a tongue with a point and barbs and as chris fell forward she saw the arrow that had pierced him its shaft a bright yellow its fletching red and white he spasmed at her feet and she held him as the light left his eyes she had not even had a chance to cry before she heard footsteps behind her approaching fast and two blows to the head took away all of her pain for a time now she lay against timber the sky above her lit by a pale yellow moon no roof here and only the barest shapes of trees the wall opposite her was pasted with pages torn from books of worship bibles and korans texts in english and hindi and arabic in symbols and letters both familiar and unfamiliar all of the pages had been defaced with pornographic pictures the pages were further smeared with dark stains some recent some old and she knew it to be blood there was an immense pressure on her head as though her brain was swelling inside her skull perhaps it was was that what happened if you were hit hard enough on the head she couldnt move her legs she couldnt speak she was a trapped soul but soon she would be freed a shape appeared at the door he was still only a dark silhouette a being of blackness she had not yet seen his face but his skull was curiously misshapen warped like his spirit if she could have spoken to him what would she have said spare me sorry no not sorry it was not their fault they had done nothing wrong they had simply become lost and in doing so they had become prey he had lured them deeper into the forest with the unspoken promise of safety and rescue and then had turned upon them his arrow bringing her husband down and his fists and his blade doing the same for her chris oh chris she tried to reach for the silver cross around her neck a present from her mother on the occasion of her confirmation but it was gone he had taken it from her and in the moonlight she saw it shining among the pages on the wall close by her head and she picked out the droplets of fresh blood upon it now she could hear the stranger breathing and interspersed with his exhalations were her own failing breaths until the final one caught in her throat and she began to shudder death advanced on her and the stranger followed racing to keep up there were no falls at falls end and the principal endings there were those of civilization ambition and ultimately lives sensibly the founding fathers of the town had decided that even in its earliest incarnation a name like civilizations end or ambitions end or dead end might have hobbled the communitys chances of progress and so an alternative identity was sought a stream was found to feed into prater lake and that stream began its life on a patch of rocky high ground known as the rises cascading down in a manner that might loosely be said to resemble a waterfall as long as nobody had seen an actual waterfall against which to measure it hence falls end with no possessive apostrophe to trouble it on the grounds that such additions smacked of pretension and pretension was for the french across the border that particular stream no longer flowed into prater lake it had simply ceased burbling past the outskirts of the town some time at the start of the last century and an expedition of the curious and the concerned aided by a couple of local drunks who fancied some air discovered that water no longer tumbled from the top of the rises speculation as to what might have caused the blockage included seismic activity a redirection of water flow due to logging and courtesy of one of the drunks the actions of the devil himself this latter suggestion was quickly discounted although it later gave its name to a local phenomenon known as the devil of the rises after it was pointed out that seen from a certain angle some of the rocks appeared to form the profile of a demonic figure if one was prepared to squint some and discount the fact that seen from a slightly different angle it resembled a rabbit or if one moved along just a bit farther nothing at all the towns proximity to the great north woods and the areas reputation for fine hunting meant that falls end was if not thriving then surviving which was good enough for most people especially those who were aware of the difficulties being faced by similarly sized but less fortunately situated towns elsewhere in the county there were a few modest motels that stayed open yearround and a slightly more upscale lodge that opened from early april to early december offering both intimate cabins and stylish rooms to hunters and leafpeepers with money to burn falls end also had a pair of restaurants one fancier than the other and in which locals ate only on special occasions such as weddings graduations anniversaries or lottery wins finally falls end boasted a grand total of two bars one named lesters tavern that stood on the towns western edge and another the pickled pike that lay at the center of the narrow strip of stores and businesses that constituted falls ends beating heart these included a bank a coffee shop a grocerycumdrugstore a taxidermists a lawyers office and falls end bait fish the latter stocked hunting and fishing equipment and had recently discovered a lucrative sideline selling flyfishing feathers to hairdressing salons for use on women who thought it exotic to add rooster feathers to their hair a development that had occasioned some discussion in lesters tavern since there were a great many people in falls end and elsewhere who felt that fly feathers had no business being anywhere other than at the end of a line and should adorn nothing more unusual than a hook although harold boncoeur who owned falls end fish bait had been known to remark that he found the thought of a woman with feathers in her hair wicked sexy he had not mentioned this to his wife though for mrs boncoeur favored blue rinses and perms and thus was not a likely candidate for feathering nor was she likely to listen with any great understanding to such fantasies on the part of her husband so it was that there were worse places to live than falls end grady vetters had lived in a couple of them and was in a better position to judge than most of his peers including teddy gattle with whom he had been friends since childhood a friendship that had remained firm even during the long periods of gradys absence from town in the manner of such friendships grady and teddy simply picked up their conversation each time from where they had previously left off regardless of months or years spent apart it had been that way between them ever since they were boys teddy felt no resentment toward grady for leaving falls end grady had always been different and it was only natural that he should try to seek his fortune out in the wider world teddy just looked forward to gradys return whenever that might be and the stories he would bring with him of the women in new york and chicago and san francisco places that teddy had seen on television but which he had no desire to visit the size and scale of them being frightening to him teddy was already a little lost in the world he held on to his life in falls end the way a drunk holds on to his bed when his head is spinning he could not imagine what it would be like to be set adrift in a big city he thought that he would surely die better that grady should be the one to negotiate the wider world like the explorers of old and leave teddy to falls end and his beloved forest and what of gradys efforts to make his mark in that world of skyscrapers and subways teddy couldnt and wouldnt have said it mainly because he didnt allow himself to dwell too long on the matter but it was possible just possible that teddy was secretly pleased grady vetters hadnt become the big shot artist he had always hoped to be and the women he screwed in those faraway cities remained the stuff of stories and were not there in the flesh to stoke the secret fires of teddys envy now here they were grady and teddy together once more smoking cigarettes out back of lesters sitting at the bench tables placed there for precisely that purpose and the starlight flickering through pinpricks in the night sky grady had told teddy that you couldnt see the stars in some cities so bright were their own lights and teddy had shuddered he loved these cloudless nights loved to pick out the constellations loved to navigate his way through the woods by their position in the heavens he saw no contradiction in his fear of the immensity of cities and his comfort with the vastness of the universe he watched a shooting star cross the sky burning itself out in the atmosphere and he looked at his best friend and thought that grady vetters was the closest thing to a shooting star he had ever encountered close up and just like one of those stars he was destined to burn out to nothing the barest of breezes stirred the fairy lights that adorned the back of the bar but not strangely the front a circumstance dictated by a town ordinance that teddy did not understand since it wasnt as if falls end was so pretty that it couldnt do with a little more color along its main street on the other hand it lent the back of lesters a vaguely magical air sometimes when teddy was returning to town from one of his trips into the forest whether as a guide or as a solitary hunter or simply because he wanted to be away from people for a time he would glimpse the lights of lesters twinkling through the branches and it was a sight that he always associated with comfort and warmth and belonging for teddy the lights of lesters meant home grady didnt like lesters as much as teddy did oh hed always have a good time there on his first night back in town shooting the breeze with familiar faces and joshing with old lester who had a fondness for grady because lester was something of a frustrated artist himself whose godawful watercolors hung on the walls of the bar and were always for sale although teddy couldnt recall anyone ever taking lester up on that offer no matter how low he priced them the paintings changed a couple of times a year mostly to give the impression that somebody somewhere was cornering the market in the primitive unique vision of lester leforge instead of the reality which was that lesters paintings now took up so much space in his garage that he had to park his car in the drive to lester grady vetters was a success hed exhibited his work in minor galleries and had even been reviewed in a friday edition of the new york times back in as part of an emerging artists show somewhere in soho lester had carefully cut out the review plasticized it then stuck it behind the bar beneath a handlettered sign that read local boy makes it in the big apple that was as good as it had ever got for grady vetters and now it seemed to teddy that his friend was less an emerging artist than a submerging one gradually sinking beneath the weight of his own failed expectations his inability to hold down a job of any kind his ongoing love affairs with booze pot and inappropriate women and his hatred for his father which hadnt eased any despite the old man apparently making gradys fondest wish come true by dying at last everybody believed that grady vetters was smarter than teddy gattle even teddy himself but he knew that for all gradys talk about old harlan and how much of a hardass he was and how he had meant nothing to his only son and vice versa grady was worse off than ever now that his old man was gone despite everything grady had wanted to impress his father and any success he had made of his life was largely down to that desire without him grady had nothing to aim for because he didnt have enough selfrespect and selfmotivation to pursue his painting and drawing for the love of the thing itself he was also destined teddy thought to carry through life the knowledge that his father had died unreconciled with his only son and at least fifty percent of the blame for that and maybe a good deal more lay with the younger party but jesus grady was in a foul mood tonight kathleen cover was in lesters with her husband and some of his buddies and their wives kathleen and grady had enjoyed a fling a couple of years back while davie cover was off fighting the ragheads in some place that davie couldnt even spell and certainly couldnt have found on a map before he was sent there it might have been considered low and even unpatriotic to fuck a mans wife while he was off serving his country except that davie cover was a bedbug on the ass of life and the president of the united states himself would have felt dutybound to fuck kathleen cover as a way of spiting her husband had he ever been forced to spend any time in davies company davie cover was a bully and naturally since the two went together a coward a man with the social skills of a scorpion and the higher intellectual functions of one of those insects that could keep existing on a basic level even if their heads were cut off hed joined the national guard because he craved the veneer of authority offered by a weekend warriors uniform and the official sanction for his actions that it implied then airplanes had started flying into buildings and suddenly the us was seemingly at war with every country that was more than half sand except maybe australia and davie had found himself separated from his wife of six months and the mother of his child little davie the fact of their marriage not being unconnected to the existence of that child most everyone in falls end possibly including some of davies blood relatives felt a sense of profound relief at davie covers departure and waited hopefully for the appearance of his name in an obituary column surprisingly though davie cover had thrived in the army in no small part because he was put on a prison detail and therefore spent most of his time in uniform tormenting seminaked men by alternately beating them boiling them freezing them and pissing in their food hed liked it so much that hed stayed on for an extra nine months and he might still have been there had his enthusiasm for the uncontracted aspects of his job not brought him to the attention of superiors with a conscience and more to the point a desire to protect their own reputations and davie cover had found himself quietly discharged by that time grady vetters and kathleen cover had been conducting a discreet but passionate affair for almost a year and grady had even considered asking kathleen to run away with him she could bring little davie along too because he was a cool kid especially as his father wasnt around to make him otherwise but then davie cover came home and kathleen dropped grady like hed brought crabs to her bed and when he persisted with his attentions she threatened to tell her husband that grady had come on to her repeatedly while he was away and had once even tried to rape her out back of lesters grady had left falls end again shortly after and had not returned for more than a year he just didnt understand what happened at the end between kathleen and him and judging by his mood tonight he still didnt but teddy did because in some things he was much smarter than his friend would ever be teddy knew that kathleen cover had falls end in her veins she was never going to leave that place for the wider world frightened her almost as much as it frightened teddy kathleen and her husband had more in common than grady could ever have imagined and grady had just been a way to kill time until davies return grady had believed himself to be something exotic something more than her husband could ever be and maybe he was but secretly kathleen cover despised him for it and teddy suspected that her happiest moment in the relationship had come when shed dumped grady and taken her husband back into her bed if she could shed have made grady watch davie humping her while she smiled back at him over her husbands hairy boilspattered shoulder so that was why they were out back of lesters smoking and spitting with grady staring off into the woods raging silently and teddy beside him keeping him company waiting for grady to make a decision about what to do next just the way that it had always been teddy had already paved the way for a possible departure from lesters and the memory of kathleen cover by telling grady about a party at darryl shiffs place and darryl knew how to throw a good party he had a nice sideline in distilling his own alcohol using a pair of fivegallon oil cans two pressure cookers and some scavenged plastic and copper tubing darryl was classy too he oakaged the alcohol by adding to it a little wood smoked and charred so that the natural sugars caramelized it lent his moonshine a distinctive color and taste and the batch he was offering for tasting tonight had been aging for over a year so thered be free booze at the party and it was rumored some outoftown women too grady needed a woman even more than teddy did which was saying something given that teddy perpetually walked around town with something in his pants resembling the state of florida in miniature grady blew a smoke ring then another and another trying to fit each between the dissipating dream of the last teddy slapped at a bug on his neck then wiped the smeared remains of it on his pants it looked like a big bitch too if this went on any longer theyd find his withered remains beside this bench in the morning every drop of his blood now residing in the digestive systems of half the female mosquitoes in maine overwintering mosquitoes were rare this far north and the rest should all have been dead teddy wondered if there might not be something in all of this global warming shit after all although he kept it to himself in falls end coming out with pronouncements like that was tantamount to communism how much longer we going to stay out here grady he asked i just squashed a bug looked like a jet plane you want to go back inside said grady you do you can just go right ahead i dont unless you want to do you want to go back in i mean not so much teddy nodded i guess theres no point in telling you she aint worth it aint worth what all this mooning all this aggravation you ever been with her god no teddy said it with some feeling and grady seemed to take it as meaning that kathleen cover was out of teddys league which was true on the other hand teddy wouldnt have climbed into the sack with kathleen cover if god himself had sent the archangel michael down with entry instructions and a diagram the woman was such bad news she should have arrived with a pastor in tow and a letter of condolence from the government teddy would rather take his chances with the mosquitoes at least with them he had a chance of not being sucked completely dry she was fine said grady very fine teddy wasnt about to argue so he let a couple of beats go by and another bite damn but hed be swollen in the morning it really was beyond understanding how is your sister doing asked teddy teddy thought that marielle vetters was fine very fine not that hed ever done anything about it not with grady still living and breathing and assuming marielle might even be willing to consider him which teddy doubted teddy had been around the vetters family for so long that he almost counted as blood but it wasnt just his longstanding proximity that might have given marielle pause teddy wasnt an attractive man he was short and overweight and had started balding almost as soon as adolescence hit he lived in his childhood home left to him by his mother in her will along with and a fourth generation oldsmobile cutlass supreme his garage and yard were littered with bike and automobile parts some acquired legally and some not so legally he did custom jobs when asked and regular repairs to keep the roof above his head teddy was good enough at his work that some of the bikers had been known to use him paying him hard cash along with a little weed or blow and sometimes one of the hookers they ran as a sweetener if they were particularly pleased with what hed done he still had some of their weed stored away hed been saving it for a special occasion but now he was considering offering to share it with grady if it would just get them away from lesters shes okay said grady she misses my old man they were always tight you hear any word yet on whats coming to you teddy knew that harlan vetters had split his worldly wealth evenly between his children there wasnt much money in the bank but the house would be worth something even in these hard times it was a big old rambling place with a lot of land adjoining it land that bled into the forest on three sides so that there was little chance of anyone building nearby harlan had kept it nice too right until the end marielle talked to the bank about taking a loan to buy me out with the house as security and theyre still talking said grady and his tone made it clear that it wasnt a subject he wished to pursue teddy took a long drag on his cigarette right down to the filter hed heard whispers about this because his old buddy craig messer was engaged to a woman who worked as a teller at the bank and this woman had said that rob montclair jr whose father managed the bank didnt care none for grady vetters and was doing his damnedest to ensure that the bank didnt go lending money to his sister the reasons for his hatred were lost in the mists of high school but that was the way of small towns little hatreds had a way of lying dormant in their soil and it didnt take much to make them germinate marielle could go someplace else for a loan but teddy felt sure that the first thing shed be asked was why she wasnt talking to her own bank about this and then someone from the second bank would call rob montclair jr or his poppa and the whole sorry business would start over again you know teddy i hate this place said grady i figured said teddy he wasnt resentful grady just saw falls end differently he always had i dont know how you can stand to stay here i aint got nowhere else to go theres a whole world out there teddy not for people like me said teddy and the truth of it made him want to die i want to go back to the city said grady and teddy understood that this wasnt a conversation between equals grady vetters wasnt just the center of his own universe but a planet around which men like teddy orbited adoringly as far as changes in the direction of grady vetters conversation went the best that his friend could hope for would be enough about me what do you think of me which city said teddy only a little of his resentment showed not that grady noticed any city any place but here why dont you then go back to what you were doing and wait for the money to come because i need the money now i got nothing i been sleeping on couches and floors these past six months this was news to teddy last he heard the whole art business had been paying well enough for grady hed sold some paintings and there were more commissions in the pipeline i thought you was doing okay you told me that youd sold some stuff they didnt pay much teddy and i was spending it as soon as it came in sometimes before it came in i had it bad for a while this teddy did know about heroin scared the shit out of him blow you could take or leave but with heroin you were a fullblown livingoutofdumpstersandsellingyoursisterforquarters addict although teddy would have paid more than quarters for marielle vetters yeah but youre all good now right better said grady there was a frailty to how he said it that made teddy fear for him better than i was thats something said teddy not sure what else to say look i know falls end aint for you but at least here you have a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in and people wholl look out for you if you got to wait a while for the money to come through better here than on someones floor its all relative man yeah all relative maybe youre right teddy he gripped the back of teddys neck and smiled at him and there was such sadness in his eyes that teddy would have given a limb to make it go away any residual anger at gradys selfishness now forgotten but he just said so you want to go over to darryls theres no percentage in staying here grady tossed his cigarette butt sure why not you got any weed i couldnt listen to darryls shit with my head straight yeah i got some i dont want to bring it to darryls though shitll be gone before i got time to find my rolling papers lets go back to mine pick up some beers have a smoke when your heads in the right place we can join the party sounds good said grady they finished their beers and left them on the bench then scooted round the side of the bar so they didnt have to see kathleen cover and her shitbird husband again they got bitten some more on the way to teddys truck so back at the house teddy hunted down a bottle of calamine while grady put on some music csny four way street couldnt have been more mellow if buddha himself was on backing vocals and then teddy produced the baggie of weed and it was very good weed and they never did make it to darryl shiffs party but instead talked long into the night and grady told teddy things that he had never told anyone before including the story of the airplane that his father and paul scollay had found in the great north woods thats it said teddy through a fug of smoke thats how you do it he stumbled to his bedroom and grady heard closets being searched and drawers being emptied on the floor and when teddy returned he was holding a business card in his hand grinning like it was a winning powerball ticket the plane man you tell them about the plane that night a message was left on the answering service for darina flores the first time any such message had been received in many years it had begun in her dark bedroom darina flores drifted in and out of consciousness the painkillers disagreed with her causing tremors in her legs that tore her from sleep they also provoked peculiar dreams she couldnt have called them night terrors for she was herself virtually without fear but she experienced sensations of descent of falling into a great emptiness and she felt the absence of grace with a pain that was unfamiliar to her the god she served was a pitiless one and there was no consolation from him in times of distress he was the god of mirrors the god of form without substance the god of blood and tears trapped in her misery she understood why so many chose to believe in the other god to follow him even though she saw in him only a being as heedless of suffering as her own perhaps the only true difference was that her god took pleasure in agony and grief at least one might argue he had a sense of involvement she had always considered herself to have a high tolerance for pain but she had a fear of burns and a reaction to them that was disproportionate to the severity of the injury even a minor burn the careless brushing of a candle flame a match held for too long caused blistering to her skin and a fierce throbbing that found an echo deep inside her a psychiatrist might have speculated on childhood trauma an accident of youth but she had never talked with a psychiatrist and any mental health specialist would have been forced to travel further back than distant memories of her childhood to find the source of her terror of burning because her dreams were real she had fallen and she had burned and somewhere inside she was still burning the other god had made it so and she hated him for it now her inner pain had its most ferocious external manifestation yet the extent of it hidden from her by dressings and the refusal to allow her a mirror barbara kelly had surprised her in the end who could have guessed that she would prove to be so weak and yet so strong that she would seek to save herself at the last by turning to the other god and in doing so would inflict such damage on the woman sent to punish her my beauty she thought now gone temporarily blind in one eye with the possibility of lasting damage to her vision caused by the old grounds in the coffee pot sticking to her pupil she wanted to shed her body like a snake slews off its skin or a spider leaves its old carapace to wither she did not want to be trapped in a disfigured shell in the darkness of her agonies she feared that it was because she did not wish to see the corruption of her spirit reflected in her outer form each time she woke the boy was there waiting his ancient eyes like polluted pools against the pallor of his skin he still had not uttered a word as an infant he had rarely cried and as a boy he had never spoken the doctors who examined him chosen for their trustworthiness their commitment to the cause could find no physical defect to explain the boys silence and his mental functions were adjudged to be well above average for his age as for the goiter upon his neck that troubled them and there had been discussions about removing it she had demurred it was part of him after all that was how she had known it was him she had thought that it was possible when she felt him kicking in her womb a sense of his presence had suffused her as though she were enveloped in his embrace as though he were inside her more as a lover than a developing child and it had grown in intensity throughout her second and third trimesters so that it became almost oppressive to her like a cancerous growth in her belly expelling him from herself had come as a relief then she had looked upon him as he was placed in her arms and her fingers had traced his lips and his ears and the delicacy of his hands and had paused at the swelling upon his throat she had gazed into his eyes and from the blackness of them he had looked back at her an old being resurrected in a new body and now he was beside her stroking her hand as she moaned upon the sweatdampened sheets while they were finishing with barbara kelly darina had summoned help but their nearest tame physician was in new york and it took time for him to reach her strangely there was not as much pain as she might have anticipated not at first she attributed it to her rage at the bitch who had turned upon her but as kellys life slowly seeped from her beneath blades and fingers so too the torment in darinas face seemed to increase and when kelly at last died it screamed into red life with her passing deep seconddegree burns that was how they described them any more severe and there would have been serious nerve damage which would at least have numbed the pain she thought there was still the possibility that grafts might be necessary but the doctor had decided to hold off on that decision until a degree of healing had occurred some scarring was inevitable he said particularly around her injured eye and there would be significant contracture of the eyelid as the scarring proceeded the eye hurt more than anything else it felt like needles were being pushed through it and into her brain the eye was patched and would remain so even after the other dressings were removed already her skin was blistering badly she had been given lubricant for the eye as well as antibiotic drops the boy took care of them all and salved her blistered face and the physician visited each day and commended him on his efforts even as he kept his distance from him his nose wrinkling at the faint odor that seemed to rise from the boy regardless of how many showers he took or how clean his clothes were his breath was the worst it stank of decay darina had grown used to it from long exposure but it was still unpleasant even to her but then he was an unusual boy mostly because he wasnt really a boy at all hurts she said she still had trouble speaking if she moved her mouth more than a fraction her lips bled the boy who was more than a boy put some gel on his fingers and gently applied it to her lips he took a plastic bottle with a fixed straw in its cover slipped the straw into the undamaged side of her mouth and squeezed some water through she nodded when she was done thank you she said he stroked her hair a tear rolled from her uninjured eye her face felt as though it were aflame the bitch she said look what the bitch did to me and im burned but she is burning too and her pain will be greater and longer than mine the bitch the burning bitch she was not due another painkiller for a couple of hours so he turned on the tv as a distraction together they watched some cartoons and a comedy show and a dumb action movie upon which she wouldnt ordinarily have wasted her time but that now acted as a soporific the night drew on and the sun rose she watched the light change through the crack in the drapes the boy gave her another pill then changed into his pajamas and curled up on the floor next to her bed as he saw her falling asleep his head on a pillow and a comforter covering his body only from the waist down she felt her eyes begin to close and prepared to exchange real pain for the memory of pain from the floor the boy watched her unfathomable in his strangeness messages accumulated most were inconsequential still the boy made a careful note of each one and handed it to her when she was sufficiently alert to understand what she was being shown minor tasks were postponed for a time major ones diverted elsewhere she willed herself to recover there was too much that needed to be done but for all of the boys solicitude and all of the care he took with her phone some contacts went unexamined for a time the boy did not have access to the old darina flores answering service it had come into existence before he was born and there had been no reason to acquaint him with it anyway it had been many years since contact had been made through that number and so it was that a message inquiring if she was still interested in news of an airplane that might have crashed in the great north woods remained unlistened to for days and a little time was bought but only a little i called gordon walsh a detective who now worked out of the maine state polices southern major crimes unit in gray walsh was about the closest thing i had to a friend in the msp although it would have been stretching the point to call him an actual friend if walsh was my friend then i was lonelier than i thought actually if walsh was anybodys friend they were lonelier than they thought you calling to confess a crime he said anything to help you maintain your unblemished arrest record you have something in particular youd like me to fess up to or should i just sign a blank form and leave you to fill in the details you wont even have to fill in your name because its already there just put your x on it and well do the rest ill think about it maybe if you helped me out with something it might encourage me to make the right decision you have any friends in the new hampshire mcu no but ill have minus friends there if i set you on them youre a walking formula for negative friendship equity i waited i was good at waiting at last i heard him sigh come on give it to me kenny chan killed in his house in bennington in how did he die he was broken up and folded into his own safe yeah i think i remember that one it was part of a spate of safefoldings back in the day robbery only of his joie de vivre whoever did it left the cash in the safe with him i take it you pulled up the names of the investigating detectives nalty and gulyas yeah helen nalty and bob gulyas nalty wont talk to you shes straight edge and in line for promotion to auc auc was assistant unit commmander gulyas is retired i know him a little he might talk as long as you dont interrupt hes not patient like i am itll be the usual deal if you find out something useful then it goes straight to him and he whispers it in a sympathetic ear i finished and if i get in trouble i dont mention his name i owe you on this one you owe me on more than this one but you can start paying now go on perry reed the auto shop guy i watch the news what about him i heard a story that a couple of members of the saracens motorcycle gang might recently have been relieved of a delivery of narcotics at gunpoint thats a tragedy of course and theyve proved strangely unwilling to file a complaint but the story has it that one of the guys who robbed them might have been black and the other white or whiteish they were very polite they said please and thank you one of them may even have used the words would you mind and he complimented one of the saracens on the quality of his boots the quantity and description of the narcotics in question is pretty similar to what we took from perry reed and his guys so reed ripped off the saracens that doesnt sound wise reed did not rip off the saracens i dont think he burned down his own auto lot and titty bar either even though we found ethyl alcohol in his garage i think perry reed has been set up and the kiddy stuff is just the icing on the cake and the description however basic of the two men who stole from the saracens rings bells that seem to echo in your vicinity is perry reed a supplier of narcotics yes is perry reed a pimp yes and a trafficker of women and a suspected rapist both statutory and otherwise its said he and his buddies break in the girls before passing them along how long has he been doing all this years decades and now you have him whats the problem you know what the problem is i want to see him in jail but for stuff that he did do not for stuff that he didnt i can only tell you what ive heard which is the drugs were on their way to reed anyway but he always uses middlemen for receipt of deliveries ive also heard that if you get a court order for the phone records of the numbers found on the cell phones youll find that perry reed and alex wilder were both in touch with known traffickers of underage girls most of them chinese and vietnamese although they had room for thai and laotian too the gun only what ive read in the papers pearl grips classy as long as youre not seen in public with them the auto lot and titty bar well that just looks like arson but im no expert and the kiddy porn it was in his possession and he has a reputation walsh said nothing for a time still sounds to me like somebody might have had a personal motive for seeing perry reed locked up until his hair turns white alex wilder too i gave him a little not much but enough maybe frightened asian girls werent the only women they were raping there was the sound of the phone shifting and i knew that walsh was making a note so what am i left with here that its not legal but its just would you prefer it the other way around he grunted it was as close to acquiescence as walsh was likely to get ill tell bob gulyas to expect a call he said thank you whatever just remember i wasnt kidding about that piece of paper with your name on it if i dont have it then somebody else does its only a matter of time oh and you tell your friends that i said hello i left a message for bob gulyas and he returned the call within the hour in the course of a twentyminute phone conversation during which it became clear that he knew more about me than i might have been comfortable with which suggested that hed been talking to walsh gulyas told me as much as he knew or was willing to share about kenny chans murder a gale force wind had set off the alarm in chans home and his security company had been unable to contact him his girlfriend was listed as a secondary keyholder she hadnt heard from him in five days and it was she who found the body whoever killed him had taken the trouble to leave the combination written in lipstick on the safe along with kenny chans name and the years of his birth and death so you figure a woman was involved i said his girlfriend had some cosmetics and clothing in a drawer in his bedroom said gulyas but the lipstick didnt match so unless it was a guy who killed him and just happened to be the kind who carried lipstick in his pocket then yeah we figured a woman what about the girlfriend cindy keller she was a model shed been working on a shoot in vegas and only got back the night before the body was found hed been in there for a couple of days by then so she was in the clear sounds like the end of a run of bad luck for kenny chan i said first his wife then his business partner all he had to console him in his grief was the money he made from the sale of his company still better than being poor and grieving i guess gulyas laughed oh we looked hard at kenny chan after felice was shot but there was nothing to connect him to the gas station killings beyond circumstantial evidence yeah it seemed his partner was blocking the sale of the company and yeah his murder was a lucky break for chan but if he planned it then he planned it well he was so clean even his shit gleamed and his wife gulyas didnt laugh this time she was on the oneohone near milford looks like the car skidded hit some trees and burst into flames any witnesses none it was late at night on a quiet stretch of road how late two thirty am what was she doing out by milford at two thirty in the morning we never got an answer to that there was speculation that she might have been having an affair but thats all it was if she was screwing around then she hid it well so it all remains one big mystery with three heads ill tell you something mr parker i smelled what you smell but in the end we were advised to let it lie the word came from real high up and that word was defense because chans company had been folded into the defense department exactly and pryor investments i had two meetings with them the first was shortly after chan died because we found a batch of papers relating to his dealings with pryor in a safe deposit box in a bank in boston not in his own safe no odd yeah anything in the papers not that i could see they seemed pretty straightforward but what i know about business and investments you could write on a stamp so you went to pryor and got stonewalled by a couple of suits oh they were sweet as pie but told us nothing and the second visit chans death led us to reexamine the felice killing and to glance again at the accident that killed chans wife pryor obviously cropped up there too what happened different suits same result we even got face time with the big suit himself garrison pryor he used a lot of words like tragedy and regrettable without ever looking like he knew what they meant shortly after we heard the invocation of national security and that was it it wasnt as if we didnt have other major crimes to deal with and you have to learn when to fade away either temporarily or permanently you were a cop you learn that lesson no good thats why walsh said i should talk to you we done here i think so i get to ask what this is about not yet can i have a raincheck on a beer and if i find something you can pass on ill share it with you ill make a note of it do that i appreciate you taking the time to talk talk son i never said a word to you and he hung up so could i have walked away from marielle vetters tale leaving the plane in the great north woods to sink finally into the ground dragged down if the testimony of the late harlan vetters and paul scollay was to be believed by some intent on the part of nature itself possibly but i knew that it would have come back to haunt me in the end not simply the nagging knowledge that the plane was out there nor my curiosity about the nature of the partial list of names that vetters had taken from the wreckage but because of brightwells involvement in the search it meant that the plane was part of the pattern of my life and perhaps within it might lie some inkling of the greater game that was being played one in which i was more than a pawn but less than a king angel and louis too had elected to become involved for brightwell had killed louiss cousin and anything that concerned the believers and their legacy was of interest to louis his capacity for vengeance was limitless but there was one other who had been intimately involved in the matter of brightwell and the believers one who knew more than anyone else about bodies that decayed but did not die and migrating spirits more perhaps than he had even admitted to me his name was epstein and he was a rabbi and a grieving father and a hunter of fallen angels i called new york and made arrangements to meet him the following evening the kosher diner lay on stanton and was situated between a deli that was popular with flies judging by the number of black corpses in the window and a tailor who had clearly never met a piece of polyester that he didnt like epstein was already at the restaurant by the time i arrived the sight of one of his goons on the door gave his presence away this one wasnt wearing a yarmulke but he fitted the type young darkhaired jewish and built from bricks and protein he would be armed too which probably explained why his right hand was buried deep in the pocket of his navy coat while his left was not epstein didnt carry a gun but the people who surrounded him and ensured his safety most certainly did the kid didnt seem surprised to see me approach but that was probably because id passed one of his buddies two blocks earlier and hed kept watch on me to make sure nobody was following angel in turn was a block behind him while louis shadowed him from across the street in this way epstein and i provided gainful employment for at least four people and thus ensured that the wheels of capitalism kept turning the restaurant was as i remembered it from my last visit a long wooden serving counter to the right beneath which was a series of glass cases which would usually have contained overstuffed sandwiches and some carefully created specialties beef tongue polonaise in raisin gravy stuffed cabbage leaves chicken livers sautéed in white wine but were now empty and a handful of small round tables along the left wall on one of which a trio of candles flickered in an ornate silver sconce there rabbi epstein sat similarly unchanged he had always struck me as a man who had probably been old before his time and so his later years had simply accrued without altering him unduly only the death of his son might have added to his white hairs and the fine wrinkles on his face the young man put to death by those who shared something of the beliefs of brightwell and his kind if not their nature epstein rose to shake my hand he was elegantly dressed in a lightweight black silk suit and a white shirt with a carefully knotted black silk tie it was another unseasonably warm evening but the ac in the restaurant was off had i been wearing something similar to epsteins suit in this heat id have been leaving puddles on chairs but epsteins hand was dry to the touch and there was not even a hint of moisture on his face by contrast my shirt was stuck to my back beneath my blue wool sport coat from the back of the restaurant a woman appeared darkhaired browneyed and silent the deaf mute who had been present on the first occasion that epstein and i had met here years before she placed a glass of ice water in front of each of us and some sprigs of mint her eyes turned to me as she did so and she looked at me with something like interest i watched her walk away she was wearing oversized black jeans belted at her slim waist and a black camisole top her hair hung in a single braid down her tanned back tied with a length of red ribbon at the end as when last we met she smelled of cloves and cinnamon if epstein saw the direction of my gaze he did not acknowledge it he fussed with the mint crumbling it into his water then stirred it with a spoon there was silverware on the table soon food would start to arrive it was how epstein preferred to conduct his business epstein seemed distracted almost as though he were in some discomfort are you okay epstein waved a hand in dismissal an unfortunate incident on my way here nothing more i was paying a visit to the stanton street shul and a man not much younger than i called me a mockey bastard as i passed him its been many years since i heard that term used it troubled me the age of the man who said it the obsolescence of the insult it was like stepping back to another time he recovered himself stretching as though the memory of the insult was a physical thing that he could force from his body still ignorance has no sellby date its been a while mr parker it seems that youve been busy since last we met i continue to follow your entertaining career with much interest i had a suspicion that whatever epstein knew about me he hadnt gleaned from the newspapers epstein had his own sources including the senior fbi agent named ross at the new york field office a man whose responsibilities included maintaining a file with my name on it a file that had come into existence following the deaths of my wife and child a lesser man might have felt paranoid i just tried to make myself feel wanted instead i wish that was reassuring to know i said oh ive tried to help you here and there you know that your help has nearly got me killed but think of the lifechanging experiences that youve had as a result im still trying to avoid the most lifechanging one of all dying and making a success of it i see here you are alive and well i await the reason why with much curiosity but first let us eat liat has prepared food for us i believe and although she could not have heard him and his back was to her so that she could not read his lips the woman called liat emerged from the kitchen at that very moment carrying a tray covered with stuffed cabbage and derma a selection of sweet and hot peppers three kinds of knishes and two bowls of salads she moved another table close to ours so that we would have space to eat no fish said epstein he tapped a finger to the side of his head i remember these things my friends think im phobic i said we all have our peculiarities i knew a woman once who would faint if someone sliced a tomato in front of her i have never been able to discover if there is a medical term for it the closest ive come is lachanophobia which appears to be an irrational fear of vegetables he leaned forward conspiratorially i must confess that on occasion i have used it as a way to avoid eating broccoli liat returned with a bottle of goose bay sauvignon blanc poured each of us a glass then a third for herself she took the glass with her and sat on the counter her legs crossed before her she placed on her lap a book a copy of norman macleans young men and fire she did not eat neither did she read although she opened the book before her she was watching my lips and i wondered how large a part she was playing in this particular game of epsteins i tried the wine it tasted good kosher i asked i couldnt quite keep the surprise from my voice you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise as its remarkably palatable but yes its from new zealand so we ate and talked of families and the troubles of the world and steered scrupulously clear of darker matters until liat came to clear the table and coffee was brought with a separate jug of milk for me and always i was conscious of how she kept her eyes on my lips all pretense of not watching me now set aside i noticed that epstein had turned slightly so that she would be able more easily to see his lips as well as mine so said epstein why are you here brightwell i said brightwell is gone epstein replied leaving the ambiguity to hang between us not dead but gone epstein knew better than anyone the nature of brightwell for now i said yes we might have achieved a more permanent solution had you not shot him to death it was satisfying nonetheless im sure that it was so is hitting a cockroach with your shoe until it starts to crawl again but whats done is done why bring him up now so i told him the story that marielle vetters had passed on to me leaving out only the identities of those involved and any reference to the town in which they lived an airplane said epstein when i was done i know nothing about any airplane i will need to consult perhaps others have heard what else do you have i had made a copy of the list of names that marielle had given to me the womans father took this from the plane i said as i slid the photocopy across the table it was part of a cache of papers in a satchel under one of the pilots seats he left the rest in the wreckage according to his daughter epstein took his wireframed spectacles from his pocket and carefully hooked the ends over his ears he had a way of appearing frailer than he was a pantomime of squints and grimaces it was a role he played even with those who knew better than to be taken in by it perhaps it was just habit by this point or maybe even he could no longer separate the deception from the reality epstein was not a man who tended to show surprise he had seen too much of this world and something of the next for them to hold too many secrets from him but now his eyes widened behind the magnified lenses and his lips moved as though he were repeating the names to himself as a kind of litany do those names mean anything to you i asked i had not yet told him about kenny chan and the earlier fates of his wife and former business partner it wasnt that i didnt trust epstein but i saw no reason to give him all that i had learned not without something in return perhaps he said this one he showed me the paper his finger resting halfway down the page beneath the name calvin buchardt he worked quietly for a number of liberal causes for many years he was involved with the aclu searchlight naacp as well as antiauthoritarian movements in south and central america he was a textbook white male with a conscience i didnt find his name in any of my searches you might have found him had you looked for calvin book only a handful of people knew his real name why the secrecy he always claimed that it was for protection but it was also a way of distancing himself from his family legacy his grandfather william buchardt was a neonazi of the most virulent kind a supporter of appeasement in his youth and an ally of segregationists homophobes and antisemites throughout his life calvins father edward refused to have anything to do with the old man once he reached maturity and calvin took that a step further by acting as a discreet supporter of the kind of institutions that his grandfather would have put to the torch it helped that he had a little wealth to his name then whats he doing on this list i suspect that the answer lies in the manner of his passing he was found gassed to death in a parking garage in mexico city it emerged that calvin was more like his grandfather than his father after all he had been betraying his friends and their causes for decades labor leaders civil rights workers lawyers all given over to their enemies because of calvin buchardt are you telling me that he killed himself in a fit of remorse epstein carefully repositioned his coffee spoon i expect that he did feel remorse at the end but he didnt kill himself hed been tied to his car seat and his tongue had been removed along with all of his teeth and the tips of his fingers he had made the mistake of betraying lions as well as lambs officially his remains were never identified but unofficially he returned his attention to the list and emitted a small tsk of distaste davis tate he said that one i know something of i said a preacher of intolerance and calumny said epstein hes a hatemonger but like most of his kind he lacks a logical consistency and any kind of backbone hes rabidly antiislamic but he also distrusts jews he hates the president of the united states for being black but lacks the courage to reveal himself as a racist so he codifies his racism he calls himself a christian but christ would disown him he and his kind should be prosecuted for hate speech but the powers that be get more exercised about a nipple showing during the superbowl fear and hatred are good currency mr parker they buy votes in elections he took a sip of wine to wash tates name from his mouth and now you mr parker i can only assume that you did some digging of your own and found something of interest to yourself among these names this woman solene escott was the wife of a man named kenny chan i said the numbers beside her name correspond to the dates of her birth and death she was killed in a car accident but that plane went down before not after she died her death was planned brandon felice a little farther down was kenny chans business partner he was killed in the course of a gas station robbery not long after escott died there was no reason to shoot him the thieves were masked and theyd got their money declined epstein read the word written beside felices name and is that a letter t after the word looks like it what does t stand for terminated i suggested possibly probably is the husband still alive he was stuffed into his own safe and left there to rot surrounded by his wealth do you have a narrative in mind kenny chan struck a deal to have his wife and partner killed but the deal came back to bite him in the end poetic justice perhaps you say his wife was killed in an accident accidents can be made to happen and there were no witnesses what do you know about a company called pryor investments i may have read the name but no more than that why pryor investments was closely involved with the sale of kenny chans company the police investigating chans death were discouraged from bothering pryor it seems that he may have links to the defense department ill see what we can find out said epstein he carefully folded the list placed it in the inside pocket of his jacket and stood where are you staying tonight he asked my expartner walter cole offered me a bed at his place id prefer it if you stayed here it may be that ill need to contact you urgently and it would be easier to do so if you remained with liat she keeps an apartment upstairs youll be quite comfortable i assure you one of my men will remain nearby just in case i take it you were shadowed here epstein was familiar with angel and louis theyre outside let them return to their beds they wont be needed youll be safe i give you my word i called angel on my cell phone and told him the plan you happy with the arrangement he asked i looked at liat she looked at me i think i can live with it i said and hung up the apartment was more than comfortable it occupied the top two floors of the building the rest being given over to storage it was decorated in a vaguely middle eastern style a lot of cushions a lot of rugs the dominant tones of red and orange accented by lamps in the corners instead of a central ceiling light liat showed me to a guest bedroom with a small private bathroom next door i showered to cool myself down when i came out the lights were off downstairs and the apartment was quiet i put a towel around my waist and sat by the window looking out on the streets below i watched couples pass hand in hand i saw a man arguing with a child and a woman remonstrating with them both i heard music playing in a building nearby a piano étude that i could not identify i thought it was a recording until the player stumbled and a woman laughed in an easy loving way and the mans voice answered and the music ceased i felt like an outsider here even though i knew these streets this city it was not mine though it had never been mine i was a stranger in a familiar land liat entered the room shortly before midnight she was wearing a cream nightdress that ended above her knees and her hair hung loose on her shoulders i had been sitting in darkness but now she lit the bedside lamp before coming to me she took my hand and bid me rise in the lamplight she examined me she traced the scars of old wounds touching each one with her fingertips as though taking an account of the toll on my body when she was done she placed her right hand against my face and her expression was one of intense compassion when she kissed me i felt her tears against my skin and i tasted them upon my lips it had been so long and i thought accept this small gift this tender fleeting moment liat only later did i discover the meaning of her name liat you are mine i woke shortly after seven beside me the bed was empty i showered dressed and went downstairs the apartment was quiet when i entered the kitchen a middleaged man was preparing the days food and in the restaurant a woman in her sixties was serving coffee and bagels to a short line of customers where epstein and i had sat the night before an elderly couple now shared a copy of the forward where is liat i asked the woman behind the counter she shrugged then fumbled in her apron and produced a note it was not from liat but from epstein it read progress being made please stay another night e i left the restaurant one of epsteins young men sat at a table outside drinking mint tea he didnt glance at me when i appeared nor did he try to follow i had coffee at a bakery on houston and thought of liat i wondered where she was and i thought that i knew i believed that she was telling epstein of my wounds i spent the rest of the morning drifting browsing in bookstores and what few record stores remained in the city other music at th and broadway academy records on west th street before meeting angel and louis for lunch at the brickyard in hells kitchen you look different said angel do i yeah like the cat that got the cream except maybe a cat that thinks the cream might have been spiked this woman you were staying with liat what did she look like exactly old i said really and gray you dont say i bet she was a heavyset woman too very i knew it so she bore no resemblance to that slim darkhaired piece of work who was pouring the wine last night none whatsoever thats very reassuring then i guess were not celebrating the end of the longest dry spell since the dust bowl no i said were not celebrating anything you ordering the chicken wings yep try not to choke on a bone im not sure i could find it in my heart to save you louiss mouth twitched it might have been a smile for a man who just got laid by one of the chosen people you dont look too happy he said thats a large assumption you saying im wrong im not saying anything okay man be coy is telling you that its none of your damn business either way being coy yes it is fine then im being coy well either you didnt get laid or you did get laid and it was no good because you still dont look completely happy he was right i couldnt have explained why even if id wanted to except that i had learned nothing of liat beyond the scent of her body the curve of her spine and the taste of her while i felt that she had looked deep into me it was nothing to do with her silence even as she came her eyes were wide and her fingers touched my oldest deepest wounds while her eyes sought the scars on my soul and i sensed her memorizing those too so that she might tell others of what she had discovered it was a strange night thats all i said good sex is wasted on you said angel with feeling youre a lost cause epstein left a message on my cell phone inviting me to meet him at our usual venue at nine that night i wasnt sure how comfortable i was staying in liats apartment again it wasnt that i minded being used for sex so much as i minded being used for something else under the pretense of sex i called my old nypd mentor and partner walter cole and told him that i might need that offer of a bed after all he told me in turn that theyd let the dog sleep outside tonight and i could have its basket i think walter was still sore that id once named a dog after him even if it was a very nice dog once again angel and louis drifted along behind me as we approached the diner and once again i was shadowed by epsteins people the same dour darkhaired young man was standing outside the restaurant when i arrived still wearing a jacket that was too warm for the weather and holding on very tightly to the gun beneath it if anything he looked even more unhappy than the last time wed met you should try a loose shirt i said or a smaller gun go fuck yourself he said he didnt even look at me when he spoke you learn that language at hebrew school standards are falling fuck you prick he said still not looking at me he was dumb as well as hostile if youre going to mouth off at someone then gun or no gun its a bad idea to allow them a free swing at you i didnt take the opportunity to sock him in the jaw or the kidneys though i was afraid that he might shoot his foot off worse i was afraid that he might shoot my foot off did i do something to upset you i said he didnt reply just blinked and scowled some more it was strange but i thought he might have been trying not to cry you need to watch your manners i said i could see his jaw tensing as his teeth clenched he looked like he might be about to take a swing at me or even pull that gun but he brought himself under control and let out a breath the rabbi is waiting for you he said thanks its been nice talking to you lets not do it again sometime i stepped into the restaurant liat was still not present instead the older woman who had handed me the note earlier that day was fussing about behind the counter and epstein was seated at the same table as before when i sat down epstein raised an index finger to the woman she produced two cups of thick dark arab coffee and two small glasses of ice water then disappeared into the kitchen a minute or so later i heard a door slam closed somewhere upstairs there would be no food and no kosher wine tonight it seemed i get the feeling ive used up my hospitality quota i said not at all said epstein if youd prefer wine there is a cooler behind the counter and some food has been prepared for you should you be hungry coffee is fine what were you and adiv talking about outside just exchanging pleasantries epsteins eyes twinkled you know his name means pleasant in both arabic and hebrew pleasant and grateful well its very appropriate he has quite the career ahead of him as a greeter he has feelings for liat said epstein he was young much younger than liat these things hurt a lot when youre young then again they also hurt like a bitch when youre older and how does she feel about him she does not say he replied he let the double meaning hang where is she elsewhere she will join us soon she has tasks to accomplish first for you he nodded she told me of your wounds there were to be no secrets here then i didnt know that you read sign language i have known liat for a long time we have learned to communicate in all sorts of ways and what did she say of my wounds she told me that she was surprised you were still alive i hear that a lot so many injuries so many times when you should have died but you did not i wonder why you have been spared maybe im immortal you would not be the first man to think it i myself still hope to beat the odds but no i dont think that youre immortal someday youll die the question is whether youll come back again like brightwell and his kind do you think that you might share something of their nature no i sipped the coffee it was too sweet for me arab coffee always has been you seem very certain of that im not like them that wasnt the question is this a test call it an exploration of ideas call it what you want i dont know what youre talking about do you dream of falling of burning no yes i dont believe you what do you dream is that why you brought me back here to interrogate me about my dreams there is truth in them or an attempt to understand truths i pushed the coffee away let this go rabbi it wont lead us anywhere profitable behind me the door opened i looked back expecting to see the darkhaired youth with the thwarted feelings instead it was the object of his desire liat was dressed in blue jeans and a long coat of sky blue silk her hair was braided once again she looked very beautiful even with the gun in her hand two of epsteins young men joined us from the kitchen they were also armed one of them walked to the front of the restaurant and pulled the shades cutting us off from outside while liat pulled down another shade on the door the second gunman kept an eye on me while epstein removed the cell phone from my pocket it buzzed in his hand the number of the caller was blocked your friends i assume said epstein they worry about my health in the big city answer it tell them everything is fine the man who had pulled down the window shades had blond hair and a soft blond beard it gave him an unfortunate and inappropriate resemblance to a nazi he also had a suppressor which he fitted to the muzzle of his pistol before pointing it at my head answer it repeated epstein i did as i was told long ago angel louis and i had agreed a series of redflag words for circumstances just like this one i used none of them now but simply told them that all was well if i called them in there would be bloodshed and nothing would ever be the same again better to wait and see how this played out i had to believe that epstein did not want me dead and i knew that i had done nothing that might cause him to turn against me i thought i could trust you i said once i had ended the call my sentiments exactly are you armed no thats unusual for you are you certain i stood slowly put my hands up and turned to face the wall i smelled liats scent and felt her hands upon me and there i was thinking we had something special i said to her but she of course did not reply she stepped back and i sat down again this time there were no sly looks as she leaned against the counter her face betrayed nothing why are you behaving like this i asked epstein you know what ive done ive fought the same fight that you have those wounds didnt come out of nowhere i sacrificed a son said epstein and i a wife and child they were lost to you before all this began no theyre part of it i know they are you know nothing you dont even know yourself the first question one must ask of a thing is what is its nature what is your nature mr parker i wanted to spring at him for his dismissal of the deaths of my wife and daughter i wanted to take his throat in my hands and crush it to pummel him until there was nothing left but a mask of blood i wanted to put a gun in the mouths of his thugs his religious soldiers and watch them squirm if those whom i had thought of as allies were prepared to turn their guns on me then i had no need of enemies i took a breath and closed my eyes when i opened them again the anger had begun to fade if this was a provocation i would not rise to it youre quoting marcus aurelius i said either youve read the meditations or a serial killer novel ill give you the benefit of the doubt and assume the former in which case youll know he also warned that each day one would meet violent ungrateful uncharitable men and their actions arose through ignorance of good and evil if you want to understand a mans nature he said look to what he shuns and what he cleaves to i think i overestimated you rabbi underneath your cultivated veneer of calm and wisdom youre a confused frightened man and i know it he replied i will admit to it but you you refuse to look too deeply into yourself for fear of what you might find there what are you mr parker what are you i stood slowly the man with the suppressor on his gun tracked me im the man who killed the one who took your son i said and i saw him flinch i did what you and your people could not now what are you going to do rabbi shoot me bury me somewhere deep along with the others youve found the ones who think theyre fallen angels or risen demons do it im tired whatever wrong ive done whatever my failings ive tried to make reparation for them i have nothing left to prove to you if you think i do then youre a fool for a moment nobody moved and nobody spoke liats eyes moved from my face to the rabbis he glanced at her and i saw him give her the barest nod from the pocket of her coat she produced a sheet of paper and tossed it on the table before me what is it i asked its a list of names said epstein its similar to the one that you gave to me yesterday but it came from a different source its more recent i didnt touch it i left it where it lay dont you want to look at it no im done with you im going to walk out of here and if one of your knuckledraggers wants to shoot me in the back along the way then let him but youll all be dead before the night is out angel and louis will tear you apart and for the next eleven months rabbi every time one of your children rises to say kaddish for you theyll receive a piece of you in the mail epstein raised his right hand then let it fall gently the guns were lowered and i heard a click as a hammer was slowly eased down the fear and anger that had briefly animated epstein left him and he was once again as he had always been or seemed to be if you wish to leave none here will stop you he said but look at the list first why epstein smiled sadly because your name is on it when i was seventeen and my mother and i were living with my grandfather in scarborough maine following my fathers death a man named lambton everett iv would come visit and he and my grandfather would share a beer on a seat in the yard or if the weather was cold theyd share something stronger blended scotch mostly on the grounds that they werent single malt men or if they were then they couldnt afford to be so on a regular basis and therefore there was no point in raising false expectations for their palates lambton everett iv was a long string of misery a man who never owned an item of clothing that fitted him correctly in part this was because his body was so indiscriminately proportioned that no cloth that was not cut to measure could ever have accommodated his limbs without leaving a sock peeping or a forearm exposed halfway to the elbow shirts hung from him like collapsed sails from a mast and his suits appeared to have been stolen randomly from the dead yet even had his suits been made from the finest italian wool and his shirts spun from silks beloved of kings lambton everett iv would still have looked like a scarecrow that had tired of its frame and wobbled unsteadily from its field to seek pastures new with his downturned mouth and his huge ears and his balding pointed head he was a source of genial terror at halloween and prided himself on the fact that he didnt have to dress up as a ghoul to scare the children there hadnt even been three lambton everetts before him the numeral was an affectation a private joke that not even my grandfather understood it lent him a certain gravitas among those who didnt know him well enough to be able to spot the fraud and gave his friends and neighbors something over which to shake their heads which is a very important gift to bequeath to others in certain circles but my grandfather liked lambton everett iv because he had known him for a long time and believed that his flaws were minor and his decencies major lambton everett iv appeared never to have been married and it was said that he was a bachelor of the most pronounced kind he seemed to have little sexual interest in women and none whatsoever in men there were those who were convinced that lambton everett iv would die a virgin my grandfather speculated that he might possibly have tried intercourse once if only to strike it from the short list of things he felt that he should do before he passed away but it turned out that my grandfather didnt know lambton everett iv at all or rather he knew only one lambton the face that lambton had chosen to present to the world but that face bore no more relation to the reality of the man than a mask bears to its wearer lambton shared little with my grandfather about his past my grandfather knew him only in the present in his maine existence and he accepted the fact of this with no rancor in his bones he knew lambton to be a good man and that was enough for him lambton everett iv was found dead in his house in wells on a gray tuesday morning in december he had failed to turn up at the big bowl for his regular monday morning session and telephone messages did not elicit a response from him two members of his bowling team visited him shortly after breakfast the next morning they rang the doorbell with no result then walked to the back of the house and peered in through the kitchen window where they saw lambton lying on the floor his hand clutched to his chest and his face frozen in an agonized grimace he had gone quickly the coroner later said the pain of the heart attack had been immense but brief my grandfather was one of four men who carried the casket from the church on the morning of the funeral but he was surprised to be informed by lambtons lawyer that lambton had nominated him as executor of his will the lawyer also gave my grandfather a letter addressed to him in lambtons messy scrawl it was short and to the point it apologized to my grandfather for springing the executorship on him but promised that it would not be an arduous task lambtons instructions for the disposal of his estate were relatively simple mostly involving the dispersal of the proceeds of the sale of his house and possessions among a number of named charities ten percent was to be given to my grandfather to do with as he saw fit along with a goldandonyx pocket watch that had been in lambtons family for three generations my grandfather was also directed to an album of photographs and newspaper clippings in lambtons bedroom closet the contents of which lambton requested he share only with those who might understand them it is difficult for men and women to keep secrets these days especially concerning matters that might at some point have found their way into the media a quick internet search can expose even the most personal of histories to the light and a generation has grown used to being able to access such information with the click of a mouse but it was not always so i think now of my grandfather seated at lambton everetts kitchen table the album open before him in the fading winter daylight and the sense he had that lambtons shade was somewhere nearby watching him carefully as his secret pain was exposed at last later my grandfather would say that in looking through the album he felt like a surgeon lancing a boil releasing liquid and pus scouring the infection so lambton everett iv might be permitted the peace in death that had been denied him in life the album revealed another lambton everett a young man with a wife named joyce and a son called james he was still recognizably himself according to my grandfather a gangling man an awkward yet strangely handsome individual smiling contentedly beside his tiny pretty wife and his grinning son in the final picture taken of them his wife and child were twentynine and six respectively lambton was thirtytwo the picture was dated may the place ankeny iowa three days later joyce and james everett were dead harman truelove was twentythree years old he had been dismissed from his job slaughtering hogs for undue cruelty to the animals his sadism exceptional even in a profession where casual brutality was the norm inflicted by men of subnormal intelligence on animals that were probably smarter than themselves and certainly more worthy of continuing their existence harman trueloves response to his firing was to set fire to the pens housing the hogs awaiting slaughter burning two hundred of the animals alive before hitting the road with only a single change of clothing sixtyseven dollars and a set of butcher knives he hitched a ride as far as bondurant with a man named roger madden who lied and said that he was going no farther just to get harman truelove out of his truck because as he later told police the boy wasnt right harman ate a bowl of soup in the hungry owl diner left a quarter as a tip and started walking he had decided that he would stop when the sun began to set which it did just as he reached the house of joyce and lambton everett and their son james lambton who had traveled to a conference of insurance adjusters in cleveland was not home but his wife and child were and they spent a long night with harman truelove and his knives lambton got the call in cleveland the following day harman truelove had been picked up by police as he headed northwest on foot toward he said polk city he hadnt even bothered to change his clothes and he was sticky with blood he had left a trail of it from the everetts bedroom all the way through the house and halfway down their garden path curiously he had cleaned his knives before he left this my grandfather learned from the album at lambton everetts kitchen table he would later recall softly touching the face of the woman and the boy in the picture with his fingertips and allowing his hand to hover over lambtons image just as he might have done if the man were seated before him seeking to express his sorrow and regret yet conscious that lambton was a man who had always refrained from unnecessary physical contact even his handshakes had been as delicate as the touch of an insects wings against ones skin my grandfather had always considered it merely to be another of lambtons peculiarities like his refusal to eat meat of any kind and his particular hatred for the smell of bacon or pork now the odd details of lambtons personality began to take a new form each making a terrible kind of sense in the context of what he had endured in life you should have told me my friend my grandfather said aloud to the listening silence and the drapes behind him shifted slightly in a cool winter breeze although the day outside was still as stone you should have told me and i would have understood i would never have mentioned it to another soul i would have kept your secret but you should have told me and he was overcome by the knowledge of his old friends suffering now at an end no almost at an end for the story was not yet fully told and there were more pages to come not many but enough harman truelove refused to confess to his crime he declined to speak to the police or even to his own public defender and did not answer when his lawyer asked him where the bruises on his face and body had come from for the police had tried hard to make him talk there was a trial although few witnesses were called for harman trueloves guilt was never in doubt something of harman trueloves past was revealed in the course of the police investigation but more was kept hidden and only a handful of people were privy to it years of physical abuse dating back even to his time in the womb when harmans father an alcoholic itinerant laborer and serial despoiler of women had tried to induce an abortion in harmans mother by kicking her repeatedly in the stomach the subsequent death of his mother when harman was two years old ostensibly by her own hand in a bath of lukewarm water although the coroner was heard to wonder why a woman who had been intent upon slitting her arm open with a straight razor might also have bathwater in her lungs the years spent on the road with his father beating following beating until harman truelove could not speak without stammering and the death at last of that terrible man who choked on his own vomit while lying unconscious in a drunken stupor his twelveyearold son found beside him holding his fathers cold hand gripping it so tightly that the rigor mortis had sealed the childs hand in the fathers and the police had to break the dead mans fingers to release his son by mutual agreement the prosecutor and defender decided that it was unnecessary to share such information with the jury and only after harman truelove had left this earth did it become public knowledge before sentencing lambton everett requested a moment with the judge a dour yet fair man named clarence p douglas who despite being at least two decades from retirement tended to inhabit his role in the manner of a man who was set to throw it all in the following day and claim his watch and pension with subsequent plans for nothing more arduous than fishing drinking and reading he didnt seem to care whom he offended by manner or decision just as long as whatever he did was in accordance insofar as was possible with the requirements of both law and justice a record of their conversation found its way into the local newspapers following douglass eventual retirement since lambton everett had placed no stipulation of secrecy upon him and douglas clearly felt that it did not reflect badly on the man quite the opposite the article in question was one of the final entries in the album although my grandfather felt that it had been placed there with a degree of reluctance as it had not been as carefully cut and pasted as the others and was separated from the previous cutting by two blank pages my grandfather took the view that it had been added out of a desire for completeness but lambton everett was somehow embarrassed by it in the oaklined quiet of his chambers the judge was requested by lambton everett to spare harman truelove from death by hanging at the state penitentiary in fort madison he did not want the boy to be executed he said the judge was surprised and more he asked lambton why harman truelove should not be subject to the full vengeance of the law you dont need me to tell you sir said judge douglas that what harman truelove did was evil as bad a thing as i ever heard of and lambton who knew some but not all of harman trueloves past replied yes your honor what he did was as close to pure evil as makes no difference but the boy himself isnt evil he never had the start in life that the rest of us had what followed wasnt much better and i think it drove him crazy somebody took a child and twisted him until he wasnt even human any longer i looked at him in that courtroom and i reckoned that he was in even more pain than i was dont misunderstand me your honor i hate him for what he did and i cant ever forgive him for it but i dont want his blood on my conscience put him away somewhere that he cant hurt anyone ever again but dont kill him not in my name judge douglas sat back in his leather chair folded his hands across his belly and thought that lambton everett might well be the most unusual individual who had ever set foot in his chambers he was more used to hearing the hounds baying for blood ready to tear apart the accused themselves if the law wasnt prepared to sate them few lambs crossed the threshold of his courtroom and fewer merciful men i hear you mr everett he said i even admire you for your sentiments and it could be youre right in some of what you say but the law requires that the boy should die i suggest otherwise and theyd curse my name right along with his until the day they put me in the ground if it helps you to sleep any easier his blood isnt on your hands nor on mine and maybe ruminate on this if that boy is in as much pain as you think then it could be that the kindest thing anyone could do for him is to put an end to it once and for all lambton everett took in his surroundings the leather furnishings and the booklined walls as clarence douglas marked the traces of grief upon his face he had not met lambton until the case came to trial but he was well versed in trauma and loss what kind of man he wondered pleads for the life of another who has cut apart his wife and child not merely a good one he decided but a man who carried something of christ himself within him and clarence douglas felt humbled in the mans presence mr everett i can tell the boy that you asked for his life to be spared should you choose to do so it could also be arranged for you to visit with him and you could tell him yourself if you had any questions you could put them to him and see how he responds questions said lambton looking up at the judge what questions could i have for him well you might want to ask him why he did what he did said clarence douglas he never told anyone why he murdered your wife and son he never said anything at all barring the word no when they asked him if it was he who had taken the lives of your wife and boy even though theres no doubt that it was his hand that did for them one word thats all they got out of him ill tell you the truth mr everett there are doctors psychiatrists and their kind who are curious as all hell about that boy but hes as much an enigma to them now as he was when they put the cuffs on him even allowing for his history theres no explanation for what he did there are folk whove had worse upbringings than him worse by a country mile but they never killed an innocent woman and her little boy because of it he shuffled awkwardly in his seat for there was a dreadful intensity to lambton everetts gaze that made clarence douglas regret he had ever started talking about the murderer harman truelove that he had ever even agreed to admit lambton everett into his chambers there is no why said lambton slowly and deliberately there can never be even if he came up with some answer for me it would have no meaning no weight in this world or the next so i dont want to talk to him i dont even want to look at him again after this day i just didnt want to add to his suffering or to mine i didnt want to add to the suffering of the world itself i figure it has enough to be getting along with its never going to run out im sorry mr everett said clarence douglas i wish there was something more that i could do for you so lambton everett returned to the courtroom and the jury read their verdict and judge clarence douglas passed sentence and some time later harman truelove took the long drop and lambton everett eventually traveled northeast making for the sea and he came to rest at last in wells although he said nothing of his past still he brought it with him in his heart and in his mind and in an album of old photographs and yellowed newspaper clippings my grandfather turned back to the picture of lambton with his family yes he was still recognizably a younger version of the man that my grandfather had known but the years had exacerbated his awkwardness and the flawed dimensions of his limbs it struck my grandfather that people sometimes spoke of men and women being broken by grief and loss and they meant by that a psychological or emotional fracturing but lambton everett resembled a man who had been physically broken one who had been torn apart and then imperfectly reassembled and he had spent the remainder of his life struggling with the physical legacy of what had been visited upon him my grandfather closed the album and he shut his eyes and he registered lambton everetts presence nearby could almost smell the scent of pipe tobacco and old spice that had been so much a part of him go on now said my grandfather go to them theyve waited for you long enough he thought that he heard the drapes flutter once more behind him and there was a sound that might have been an exhalation like a second dying and then the scent faded and he felt the emptiness of the room and he opened his eyes again as his ears discerned a soft ticking ah he said ah on the table before him was lambton everetts pocket watch the one that he had bequeathed to my grandfather in his will but my grandfather had not taken it from the closet in which he had found it alongside the album he had left it on lambtons bed he was certain of it as certain as he was of anything in this world he slipped the watch into his pocket and put the album under his arm and that night while i watched he burned the record of lambton everetts pain on a pyre behind his house when i asked him what he was doing he shared with me lambton everetts story and it came to be a foretelling of what was to pass in my own life for like lambton i would see my wife and child torn apart and i would travel to this northern state and there my pain would find its form now seated at that small dark table on the lower east side the paper epstein had given to me held tightly in my hand i thought again of lambton everett and that bond i had imagined as linking our experiences was severed what kind of man pleads for the life of one who has taken his wife and child from him judge douglas had asked himself a good man was the answer a man worthy of salvation but what kind of man takes the life of one who has murdered his wife and child a vengeful one a man driven by wrath twisted by grief lambton everett had appeared broken in form but the best of him had remained intact within it was as if his body had been forced to absorb entirely the impact of the blow in order for his spirit his soul to remain unsullied i was not lambton everett i had taken many lives i had killed over and over in the hope that it might ease my pain but instead i had fueled it had i damned myself by my actions or had i always been damned was that why my name was on this list liat pour mr parker a glass of wine said epstein i will take one as well the list contained eight names unlike the document given to me by marielle vetters it was printed not typewritten davis tates name was on this list too but his apart my own name was the only one that i recognized there were no other letters or symbols beside it no numbers that might be dates or figures it stood alone and was printed not in black ink but in red liat placed two glasses on the table and filled them both with red wine not white she left the bottle where did you get this list i asked epstein a woman contacted us through an intermediary a lawyer in our employ said epstein she told him that she had been engaged for decades in a process of blackmail bribery and solicitation she had hundreds of names of which this list was just a taster she said that she had been responsible for the destruction of families careers even lives on whose behalf on behalf of an organization with no true name although some of those like her termed it the army of night do we know anything about it we i realized that there were still guns surrounding me and my life might well be in the balance here but i would not give them the satisfaction of yielding to their doubts about me oh im sorry are we still playing that game you still havent explained why your name is on that list said the blond man and i didnt catch your name i said yonathan he replied well yonathan i dont know you well enough to submit to your questions neither do i know you well enough to care if something happens to you when this is all done so why dont you just keep quiet and let the grownups talk i thought that i caught liats smile but it was gone before i could be sure yonathan bristled and his face went red had epstein not been present he might have lunged for me even with epsteins presence to hold him in check he still looked like he might take his chances i was glad liat had left the wine bottle i hadnt touched my glass but the bottle was close by my right hand if yonathan or anyone else tried to lay a hand on me i planned to shred some skulls before i went down enough said epstein he scowled at yonathan before returning his attention to me the question remains pertinent why is your name on that list i dont know i said hes lying said yonathan even if he knew he would not tell us yonathan clearly had testosterone issues the hormones were clouding his brain get out said epstein but yonathan began i told you once to keep quiet and you did not listen go outside and keep adiv company you can brood together yonathan looked like he might be about to start objecting again but it took only a scowl from liat to convince him otherwise he left with as much bad grace as he could muster even going so far as to nudge me with his shoulder as he passed you need to organize one of those staff training weekends i said to epstein take them out into the wilderness then lose them and start all over again he is young epstein replied they all are and theyre concerned as am i youve managed to get too close to us mr parker and now your very nature is in doubt there was too much tension in the air i felt like i was taking it in with every breath i paused for a moment and tried to let myself relax it was difficult under the circumstances but somehow i managed tate apart who are the others on this list i asked some have been definitely identified two are members of the kansas and texas houses of representatives respectively one liberal one conservative both are tipped for greater things another is a corporate lawyer the rest were still working on but they appear to be for want of a better term regular people did this woman give any indication as to why she had chosen to provide these particular names our lawyers received a followup email from a temporary yahoo account it claimed that substantial bribes had been paid to three of those on the list two more had been blackmailed one over hidden homosexual tendencies the other over a series of affairs with much younger women documentary evidence sent as attachments to the email appeared to support her claims so that accounts for five of the names did she say anything about me i saw the possibility of a lie flicker on epsteins face he tried to hide it but he couldnt she didnt mention me did she no said epstein not initially but when your lawyer passed the list on to you you instructed him to ask her right yes and what did she say she could not confirm if any approaches had been made to you she said that she had not put your name on the list and you had not been her responsibility so who added my name to the list that doesnt matter it does to me because its left me under the gun you know who was responsible brightwell said epstein she said brightwell insisted that it should be added when shortly before you killed him we were coming close to it now the point of all this the nexus of epsteins doubts about me do you think i killed brightwell because i knew he put my name on this list well did you no i killed him because he was a monster and because he would have killed me otherwise epstein shook his head i dont think that brightwell wanted to kill you i suspect he was convinced that you were like him brightwell believed you were a fallen angel a rebel against the divine you had forgotten your own nature or had turned against it but you might still be convinced to turn again he saw in you a potential ally or an enemy thats what were trying to establish really it feels like a kangaroo court all thats missing is the noose youre being overdramatic i dont think so there are a lot of guns on show and none of them belongs to me just a few more questions mr parker were almost done i nodded what more could i do the woman said something else about you she said that your name had recently come up again that there were those within her organization who considered you to be important it was why she chose to send that particular list of names to us epstein reached out and took my hands in his the pads of his index fingers pressed against the pulses on my wrists to my right i felt the intensity of liats regard it was like being hooked up to some kind of human lie detector except this one would not be fooled did they ever approach you with an offer or a bribe no did they ever threaten you people have been threatening me for a decade brightwell and his kind among them and how have you responded you know how ive responded i have their blood on my hands in some cases so do you do you belong to this army of night no i heard a buzzing to my left a wasp was bouncing against the mirror above my head from the sluggishness of its movements it looked like it was dying the sight of it recalled another meeting with epstein one in which he spoke of parasitic wasps that laid their eggs in spiders the spider carried the larvae as they developed and they in turn altered its behavior causing it to change the webs that it spun so that when the larvae finally erupted from its body they would have a cushioned web upon which to rest while they fed upon the remains of the arachnid in which they had gestated epstein had told me that there were entities who did the same to men dark passengers on the human soul carried unawares for years even decades until it came time to reveal their true natures and then they consumed the consciousness of their hosts i watched epstein follow the progress of the dying insect and i knew that he was remembering the same conversation id know i said by now i would know if i carried one of them inside me are you sure there have been too many opportunities for it to emerge too many times when it could have changed the course of events by doing so if it dwelled within me it could have shown itself and saved some of its own but nothing came to save them nothing again epsteins eyes flicked to liat and i understood it was her response that would determine what happened next the gunmen watched her too and i saw them ease their fingers beneath the trigger guards in anticipation a tiny bead of sweat leaked from epsteins scalp like a tear from some hidden eye liat nodded and i felt myself tense to receive the bullets instead epstein released his hold upon my wrists and sat back the guns vanished and so did the remaining gunman only liat epstein and i stayed let us drink mr parker said epstein we are done i stared down at my hands they were trembling slightly i stilled them with an effort of will go to hell i said and i left them to their wine iii i rage i melt i burn the feeble god has stabd me to the heart acis and galatea john gay darina flores sat in an armchair the boy sitting unmoving at her feet she stroked his thinning hair the scalp damp yet curiously cold against her fingertips it was the first time she had left her bed since what she now thought of as the incident she had insisted that the dosages of pain medication should be decreased for she hated the wooziness and the loss of control it brought instead she was striving for a balance between tolerable pain and a degree of clarity the doctor had come again that morning he had removed the dressings from her face and she had watched him closely as he did so seeking some clue in his eyes to the damage that had been inflicted upon her but his expression remained disinterested throughout he was a slight man in his early fifties his fingers long and tapering the nails professionally manicured he struck her as mildly effeminate although she knew that he was straight she knew everything about him it was the main reason why he had been chosen to treat her one of the great benefits of having detailed personal knowledge of an individual was the way in which it deprived that person of the ability to decline an invitation its healing as well as can be expected under the circumstances he told her how does your eye feel like there are needles sticking in it she replied youre keeping it lubricated thats important will my sight her throat felt very dry and she had trouble enunciating her words she thought for a moment that there might have been some damage to her tongue or her vocal cords until she realized that she had hardly spoken more than a few words in days when she tried again speech came more easily will my sight be restored i expect so in time although i cant guarantee that youll ever have perfect vision in that eye she resisted the urge to lash out at him so casual was his tone the cornea is also likely to grow opaque in the long term we could of course examine the possibility of a corneal transplant its a relatively commonplace procedure now generally done on an outpatient basis the main issue is securing a suitable cornea from a recently deceased individual that wont be a problem she said he smiled indulgently i didnt mean that we should do it right now neither did i his smile faded and she noticed a slight tremor creep into his fingers i havent looked at myself she said there are no mirrors in the room and my son has kept the ones in the bathroom covered those were my instructions said the doctor why am i so terrible now he was good she gave him that he did not look away and he did not betray his true feelings about her its too early the burns are still raw once they begin to heal well have options sometimes patients will look at themselves in the immediate aftermath of an accident like yours and they will despair thats true of any serious injury or illness the early days and weeks are always the hardest patients feel that they cant go on or dont want to go on in your case time will heal your wounds and as ive told you what time cant heal surgeons can weve come a long way in our ability to treat burn victims he patted her on the arm a gesture of comfort and assurance that he had probably made to his patients a thousand times before and she hated him for it hated him for his lies and his blank visage and for even thinking he could get away with patronizing her he sensed that he had overstepped some mark so he turned his back on her and began putting away his equipment and dressings still her obvious antagonism seemed to have goaded him and he could not resist attempting to assert his superiority over her you should have gone to a hospital though he said i warned you at the beginning had you submitted to proper care i might be more optimistic about any possible outcomes now well just have to do our best with what we have the boy appeared beside him the doctor had not even heard him enter the room and so it seemed to the older man that he had somehow materialized out of the shadows drawing black atoms from the ether to reconstitute himself in the gloomy room in his hand the boy held a photograph of a girl aged sixteen perhaps a little younger her hairstyle and mode of dress indicated that the picture had not been taken recently he turned the photograph so that it faced the doctor like a conjuror displaying the crucial card in a sleightofhand trick the doctor paled visibly remember your manners doctor said darina dont forget who disposed of the evidence of your last botched procedure use that tone with me again and well bury you next to that girl and her fetus the doctor said nothing more and left the room without looking back now here she was out of bed for the first time since that bitch had scarred her she wore a loose opennecked shirt over a pair of sweat pants and her feet were bare it was hardly elegant but wearing a buttoned shirt meant that she did not have to pull anything on over her head and the sweats were comfortable and nothing more the boy had brought her a glass of brandy at her request she sipped it through a straw in order to avoid stinging her damaged lips with liquor maybe it wasnt the best idea to mix alcohol and painkillers but it was only a small glass and she had been thirsting for a proper drink for days the boy began playing with his toy soldiers in their big wooden fort they were knights on foot and on horseback made from tin and carefully painted she had bought them for him at a booth in pragues old town square the artisan who sold them also made imitation medieval weapons and heavy gauntlets and helms but it was the soldiers that had caught her eye she bought hundreds of dollars worth of them sixty or seventy in total the boy was only a year old then she had left him in the care of a nanny in boston the first time she had been separated from him since his birth and had traveled to the czech republic to retrace his steps all she knew was that this was the country to which he had departed in his final days the last place in which he had drawn breath before that stage of his existence was ended and a new one begun he had no memory of it and so could not recall the trauma of his dying it would come as he grew older but she had hoped to unearth some clue as to what had occurred there she found nothing those responsible had covered their tracks too well but she was patient and the boy would have his revenge it surprised her how the old and the new could coexist inside him he was so like a regular child now lost in games of war but this was the same boy who had helped her to torture barbara kelly to death at times like that his older nature took over and he seemed almost surprised at the damage that his hands could wreak she checked email on her laptop and began listening to the messages that had been left on her various phones there was nothing of consequence on the main numbers and it was with some surprise that she found a message waiting for her at one of the oldest of the numbers the one that had been earmarked for a very particular cause and on which she had almost given up by now the message began haltingly the voice slightly slurred alcohol and more a little toke possibly to take the edge off uh hey this is a message for um darina flores you dont know me but a while back you came to falls end maine asking about a plane she put down the glass while she listened to the rest of the message no name left only a number but unless the caller had acquired a throwaway phone for the express purpose of calling her his identity would be easy to establish she played the message again concentrating on every word registering hesitations emphases intonation there had been a lot of pointless calls in the early days a lot of frustrated men with fantasies of getting her in the sack and a couple of drunken anonymous calls from women expressing the opinion that she was a bitch and a slut and worse she had responded to none but recalled them all she had an extraordinary memory for voices but she could not remember ever having heard this one on the system before and there were details in this message fragments of knowledge and description that told her this was worth pursuing that this would not be a wasted journey there was truth here small details that could only have come from someone who had actually seen the plane and one in particular that made her gasp a passenger the caller mentioned a passenger she rose and headed for the bathroom a small nightlight burned in the outlet by the toilet far from the big mirror which the boy had covered with a towel but darina turned on the main bathroom light as she entered she reached for the towel and felt the boys hand on her arm she looked down at him and was touched by the expression of concern on his face touched and unnerved its okay she said i want to see he let his hand fall she removed the towel even through the dressings the appalling damage to her face was clear darina flores began to cry walter cole sat in his armchair a beer in his hand and a dog at his feet he had put on some weight and there was more white in his hair than i remembered but he was still recognizably the man who had been my first partner when i made detective and whose family had consoled me when my own was taken from me his wife lee had greeted me with a kiss when she answered the door and an embrace that reminded me there would always be a place for me in their home years before i had found their daughter when like a child in a fairytale she got lost in the woods and was taken by an ogre i think lee viewed it as a debt that could never be repaid i looked upon it as some small return for keeping a light in the darkness for a man who had once been forced to look upon the butchered bodies of his wife and daughter now it was just walter and me and a yawning dog that smelled faintly of popcorn i had not spoken to him of epstein not yet instead i had eaten a late supper of leftover meat loaf and a baked potato walter had joined me even though he had already eaten which probably went some way toward explaining why he was now more than the man i remembered i had helped him clean up when we were done and we had taken our coffee into the living room so you want to tell me about it he said not really youre sitting there glowering at the rug like it just tried to steal your shoes somebody lit your fuse i misjudged an old acquaintance or he misjudged me im not sure which maybe both he still alive to tell the tale yep then he should be grateful et tu brute it wasnt a judgment just a statement of fact ive saved your clippings but i dont want to know the unofficial details that way i can plead ignorance if someone comes knocking ive reached an accommodation with what you are even if you havent what i am not what i do i dont think theres a separation where youre concerned come on charlie weve known each other too long youre like a son to me now i judged you in the past and maybe i found you wanting but i was wrong im on your side here no questions asked i sipped my coffee walter had also opened a beer for himself but i had declined one he was singlehandedly keeping the brooklyn brewing company in business there had barely been room in the refrigerator for food so i began talking i told walter of marielle vetters and the story of the plane i told him of liat and epstein and the second confrontation in the restaurant i told him more of brightwell because walter had been there when a woman came to my house asking for help in finding her lost daughter a request that had led in turn to brightwell and his believers i ever tell you that you keep some strange company he said when i was done thanks for pointing that out what would i do without you spend money on expensive hotel rooms in new york you sure you dont want a beer no coffees fine something stronger not my bag any more he nodded youre going to go back to epstein arent you youre curious about this list and the plane more than that youre interested in brightwell he got under your skin yes doesnt mean that what brightwell thought about you was true or right if youre an angel fallen or any other kind then im cleopatra that stuff is okay if youre shirley maclaine otherwise it starts to sound flaky but if you want some company dealing with the chosen people let me know i thought youd signed up for dont ask dont tell im an old man i forget what ive said as soon as ive said it anyway itll be an excuse to leave the house that doesnt involve doctors or a trip to the mall you know youre quite the ad for active retirement im going to be a centerfold for the aarp magazine they promised itll be like that burt reynolds pic from playgirl but with more class and maybe more gray hair come on ill show you to your bed if youre not going to drink beer then youre no good to me awake epstein called my cell phone before i went to sleep somewhere in our brief exchange there was an apology of sorts perhaps from each of us i slept soundly i did not dream i met epstein late the following afternoon at nicolas italian grocery and delicatessen at th and first this part of town was known as sutton place and for much of its history the rich and the poor had lived side by side here tenements coexisting alongside the homes of socialites the noise from factories breweries and wharves providing the soundtrack while artists such as max ernst and ernest fiene worked in their studios in the late s construction began on what was then known as the east river drive and subsequently became the fdr the tenements and wharves began to disappear and slowly highrises started to take the place of many of the more civilized characterful buildings still some of those with long memories remembered a time when the apartments of sutton place were occupied mostly by actors and directors when it was a haven for theatrical folk and by extension the gay community it was said that eighty percent of the population of this small area was gay rock hudson among others had an apartment in the building across the street from nicolas in those days if you told a cab driver to take you to four out of five he would bring you straight to its door the choice of nicolas as the venue for the meeting was mine nick who owned the store along with his brother freddy was exmilitary having served his time in vietnam his genius there lay in sourcing whatever was necessary food equipment booze in order to ensure the continued smooth running of the us military endeavor in southeast asia but particularly that element of the endeavor which affected the comfort and care of his unit whole camps had been sustained thanks to nicks abilities to scavenge and procure given another thousand men like him the us might even have won the war now he had settled comfortably into the role of a store owner in new york where his undoubted skills in negotiating and appropriating continued to serve him well nick and freddy were both behind the counter that morning each dressed in the stores unofficial uniform of check shirt and blue jeans although on saturdays nick eschewed the uniform in favor of a more formal black shirt a nod to the days when he would hit the town after the store closed nicolas was a relic of a better time in new york when every block had its neighborhood store and there were personal relationships between shopkeepers and their customers if you stood still for long enough in nicolas either nick or freddy would press a fresh espresso into your hand after that you were theirs forever on a crate beside the door sat dutch one of their oldest customers his coffee in his left hand a blanket across his lap concealing his right along with the gun that the hand contained on this particular afternoon the appearance of the store was deceptive although it was compact with barely enough room for a handful of customers to stand in line a flight of steps at the back led to a small storage space and that space in turn opened up into the bowels of the building behind where nick and freddy kept an office a couple of storefronts to the right of the store facing the street was an iron gate that gave access to a large yard at the rear of the block its footprint massive by the standards of real estate in the city epstein arrived shortly after i did trailed by adiv liats wouldbe suitor and yonathan the older man who had riled me during the previous nights confrontation when adiv and yonathan tried to follow epstein into nicolas walter cole appeared and blocked their way sorry boys he said space is at a premium epstein stared at walter the expoliceman said epstein he emphasized the word ex once a cop always a cop are you a guarantee of safety i live to serve like i said once a cop always a cop is there another way in asked adiv building on th and through the gate to the right said walter makes you feel better to take one entrance each then go ahead as for the store nobodys going to get past the four of us he indicated nick freddy and dutch plus were all so wired on espresso that if the mailman makes a sudden move we might even take him out go for a walk boys get some air into your lungs epstein considered the arrangement then nodded at his two bodyguards and they moved away adiv to the corner of th where he could watch both the storefront and the entrance to the apartment block and yonathan to the iron gate on first i led epstein down the stairs through the storeroom and across the hall to nicks large office where we could talk without cleanshaven young jewish men with guns threatening the peace as we walked i couldnt help but wonder where liat might be liat troubled me i hadnt slept with anyone since rachel left me and i wasnt entirely sure how id ended up in bed with liat beyond the fact that i had wanted to and she had been there and willing which were pretty good reasons in themselves but last night at the restaurant shed shown no great desire to repeat the experiment and epstein had clearly entrusted her with the task of watching me closely as he confronted me with the list and assessing my reactions to his subsequent questions asking him if hed also suggested that she sleep with me in order to examine my injuries seemed kind of crass and i might not have been flattered by the answer asking what would have happened if she had shaken her head instead of nodding at the end of the questioning might have had a more damaging effect on my feelings toward all concerned nick provided us with more strong italian coffees on a small tray and some fresh pastries epstein was halfway through a tartlet when walter cole wandered in and took his seat at a table in the corner i thought we were going to talk alone said epstein your mistake said walter i understood this to be neutral territory no you misunderstood this to be neutral territory said walter epstein turned back to me and your guardians angel and louis oh theyre around i said in fact i think they may be keeping adiv and yonathan company right about now epstein tried his best not to look unhappy at this news tried but failed outside adiv and yonathan both found themselves with guns pressed against their sides just as the sun began to set they could see each other clearly so adiv was privy to yonathans situation and vice versa adiv saw a tall black man with a shaved head and the graying beard of an aspiring old testament prophet albeit a prophet wearing a thousanddollar suit materialize behind yonathan the gate opening silently as he emerged his mouth whispering something softly into yonathans ear his left hand on yonathans shoulder his right driving the gun hard under yonathans armpit adiv whose father was a tailor just had time to adjudge the suit as remarkably well cut before a small unshaven white man resembling a bum with some access to laundry services was threatening to blow out his insides if he moved and so adiv stayed very still indeed while the man disarmed him louis was having a similar exchange with yonathan with similar consequences although he took the trouble to add and none of that krav maga shit either trigger pull on this is so light a passing breeze could set it off a huge battered wd with smoked glass windows and driven by a japanese gentleman pulled up outside the grocery store its rear doors opened to reveal a second japanese man and yonathan and adiv were bundled inside angel following as the doors closed again they were forced to the floor and their hands were secured behind their backs with cable ties their phones and wallets were taken from them along with their spare change what are you going to do to the rabbi asked adiv and angel was impressed by the fact that the kid was more concerned about the rabbis safety than his own nothing he replied my friend is going to stay by the store to make sure the rabbi is safe and we have another man inside just in case so what is this about asked yonathan its about not pointing guns at people who are on your side said angel then poked adiv hard in the ribs with the toe of his glittercovered cowboy boots oh and not telling people on your side to go fuck themselves when they try to exchange pleasantries with you just because youre sore about what they may or may not have done with your girl especially if they didnt know at the time you thought she was your girl and more particularly when she isnt even your girl to begin with because youre just holding some hidden flame in your heart for her that only you can see what are you nine years old a nice jewish kid like you should be too smart to be that dumb yonathan shot a poisonous look at adiv what said adiv you were the one who pointed the gun at him boys boys said angel recriminations will get you nowhere although i will admit that it is entertaining from up here the rabbis safety is above such concerns said yonathan striking for the moral high ground we should be back there with him youd have thought except for the fact that you were taken on a city street in daylight and are now lying in the back of a jeep heading for jersey im not in the personal protection industry as such but it suggests to me that the rabbi ought to be contracting for better staff if you dont mind me saying so and even if you do what are you going to do with us asked adiv his voice didnt crack angel had to admit that the kid had balls not much in the way of manners but definitely carrying a pair you know what the pine barrens are no a million acres of trees reptiles bobcats and the jersey devil although i admit the jersey devil may not exist its a long walk home even without the devil on your tail youre going to abandon us in the wilderness it could be worse we could be dumping you in camden county the city invincible said the japanese driver speaking for the first time what said angel in a dream i saw a city invincible said the driver is the motto of the city of camden i learn it in citizenship class you mean city invisible said angel someone probably stole it while the cops werent looking fucking city is so violent even dead people are armed personally id take my chances in the pinelands but adiv began to say but angel aimed another kick at him as he started to protest silencing him quickly its a done deal he said quiet now i do some of my best thinking in the backs of cars we sipped our espressos they were very very good so lets start again i said to epstein tell me what you know about the woman who provided the list her name was barbara kelly was she died last week how she was cut repeatedly with a blade scourged with a belt of some kind and partially blinded her killer or killers then set fire to the house probably in an effort to hide the evidence of the attack they were very careful in how they approached her torture there were no broken bones and she was still alive when the fire was started in the kitchen although probably unconscious she had quite a sophisticated alarm system with recessed smoke and heat detectors independent of the main system but running parallel to it it was also raining heavily which helped arrest the progress of the conflagration nevertheless by the time the fire department arrived the blaze had consumed part of the kitchen and spread to the living room but somehow kelly had managed to crawl into the hallway she was badly burned and died on the way to the hospital the postmortem revealed the extent of the injuries she had received prior to burning you learn anything more since then she claimed to be an independent consultant she had very little in her bank accounts and appeared to be just about keeping her head above water her income came from a variety of sources mostly small businesses appearances would suggest that she worked very hard for a modest return barely enough to cover her mortgage and living expenses except were looking into the companies but already two have been revealed as no more than names on mailboxes we believe there were other sources of income and other accounts did the police find anything at the house a laptop mentioned in her insurance submission is missing and has not been traced the hard drive had been removed from her desktop and her personal files seem to have been carefully harvested a dead end were still looking and there is an added complication isnt there always we believe that we were not the only ones to whom she sent material she had cancer and she felt that she was running out of time she wanted to make reparation for her sins she needed to know that the process had begun that her offer of information was being taken seriously who would she have sent it to the newspapers a da somewhere epstein shook his head dont you understand the whole point of this conspiracy was to acquire influence and favors either now or for the future from the two extracts weve seen we know that they own politicians and reporters dont you think that theyve also wormed their way into the lives of police officers lawmakers prosecutors she couldnt send the list through the usual channels she had to be more selective then how did she decide upon your lawyers she knew of us because we were her enemies and she gave no indication of the other recipients recipient there was just one other the only clue she gave was to warn us to act quickly because if we did not another less scrupulous than ourselves would take vengeance into his own hands and through him she would earn her salvation i knew the man she meant so did epstein there was only one individual who fitted that description who had the resources and more importantly the vocation to do as this woman wished he called himself the collector the envelope had arrived at the offices of the lawyer thomas eldritch in lynn massachusetts by standard mail lynn was known in local parlance as the city of sin in part due to its reputation for high crime rates during the peak of its industrial boom but mostly because of the ease of the rhyme nevertheless such taunts have a tendency to get under the skin not only of individuals but of entire cities and at the end of the twentieth century it was suggested that lynn should change its name to ocean park which gave fewer opportunities to amateur poets for unkind rhymes the proposal was rejected lynn had been lynn for a very long time and altering its name would be tantamount to a bullied schoolchild admitting that the bullies had won and moving to a different school to avoid further confrontation also as any schoolchild will tell you the more you protest about namecalling the louder the catcalls become eldritch was not troubled by the conjunction of the words lynn and sin he found it rather apt for eldritch was in the sin business specializing in those of a mortal nature he was though more prosecutor than final arbiter assembling details of a case confirming the guilt of the parties involved and then passing on what he had learned to his private executioner so that the ultimate sentence might be carried out eldritch understood the disjunction between the concepts of law and justice his response was to refuse to accept this fact unconditionally he was reluctant to wait for justice to be applied in the next world when it could just as easily be dispensed in this one with a concomitant reduction in the amount of evil and misery contained in this realm the possibility that he might be a party to that which he hated rarely if ever bothered him and it certainly did not cross the mind of the one who wielded the blade at the final moment but the letter was problematical the return address was a box number that did not exist and the envelope contained only two sheets of paper one was a list of names the other an unsigned covering note which read i have made errors in my life and i am afraid i have confessed my sins and seek to make reparation for them i believe that the names on this list may be of interest to you and one of your clients please believe me when i tell you that it represents only a fraction of the information i have available to me i know of the believers i know of the army of night i can give your enemies into your hands hundreds and hundreds of them if you wish to talk further you can contact me at the number below from november for one twentyfour hour period beginning at am on that date should i fail to hear back from you during this period i will assume that i was mistaken in my approaches you are not the only ones in a position to act upon this knowledge and you are not the only ones with whom i have shared it typed below the letter was a cell phone number when the number was tested it was discovered not to be in operation it was still not in operation when november arrived and passed this was the source of considerable frustration to eldritch associates as a cautious investigation of the individuals named on the list most of whom had not previously come to the firms attention revealed that a number were indeed compromised and had apparently willingly colluded in their own damnation some accompanying documentation that followed by mail a few days later apparently from the same sender confirmed this view they had sold themselves in return for influence and advancement for favors financial and sexual and sometimes simply for the satisfaction of secretly doing wrong the letter had promised a treasure trove of further information once contact was made instead there was only silence the law firm of eldritch associates was an operation that prized documents as any good law firm should it knew the value of paperwork because a thing set down on paper was difficult to erase and the fact of its existence could not be denied mr eldritch liked to say that nothing on a computer screen really existed he distrusted anything that did not make a noise when it was dropped but he was no luddite he simply prized secrecy and confidentiality and the success of the firms mission was predicated on its ability to leave no trace of its actions dealings and communications conducted through the internet left a trail that an idiot child could follow thus it was that there were no computers at eldritch associates and the firm did not accept submissions or messages by email or other electronic means even the firms phone was rarely answered and when it was picked up assistance of any kind was seldom forthcoming a caller who contacted that venerable institution in the hope of securing advice or aid relating to difficulties with the law would usually be told that the firm was not accepting new clients at present and rarely did the name of eldritch figure in any but the most esoteric of cases disputes over ancient wills in which some or all of the relevant parties had by then activated wills of their own through the workings of mortality property dealings that related to houses and plots largely unwanted and generally regarded as unsaleable often linked by some connection either peripheral or direct to crimes of blood and most infrequently offers of representation on a pro bono basis for those involved in the most heinous of crimes although in each case the defendants had already been found guilty in a court of law and the approach by eldritch associates typically involved only a carefully worded commitment to investigate the circumstances of the conviction the interviews would be conducted in person by mr eldritch himself a vision of old world refinement in dark pinstripe trousers matching waistcoat black jacket and black silk tie all overlaid with a faint patina of dust as though the lawyer had been roused from the sleep of decades for just this purpose only occasionally did someone comment upon the fact that mr eldritch bore a striking resemblance to an undertaker mr eldritch was a consummate interrogator his particular interest lay in cases where unanswered questions remained questions of motivation and more specifically of suspicion about the involvement of unknown others in the commission of crimes men and women who had somehow avoided attracting the attention of the law he had discovered that selfinterest was the great motivator and the possibility of a sentence reduction or the avoidance of the needle in a bare room tended to loosen tongues true one had to mine a great weight of lies to uncover a single gem of truth but that was part of the pleasure for mr eldritch one had to test the acuity of ones processes on a regular basis if one were not to become physically old and mentally slow being old was bad enough he couldnt afford to relinquish his faculties as well mr eldritch enjoyed these sessions with the criminal kind even when he emerged from them without useful information they kept his mind keen nobody ever won a reprieve from the death chamber or a reduction in sentence because mr eldritch took an interest in his case but then mr eldritch never made any such specific promises in fact those who spoke with him couldnt quite recall why theyd agreed to do so in the first place once mr eldritch had gone on his lessthanmerry way and eventually they seemed to forget about him entirely either of their own volition or through once again the actions of mortality statesanctioned or otherwise but those of whom they spoke with eldritch accomplices employers betrayers frequently lived to regret the fact that the old lawyer had taken an interest in their existence although their regret was destined to be as shortlived as they were in time a caller would come trailing nicotine and vengeance he would have a gun or more often a blade in his hand and as their lifeblood warmed his cold skin his eyes would scan his surroundings seeking some small remembrance of the occasion a token of a sentence carried out for collecting is an ongoing obsession and a collection can always be added to and so it was that when no response could be elicited from the phone number supplied with the list of names efforts were made to discover the identity of its owner although mr eldritch had no fondness for computers he was willing to employ others to use them on his behalf just as long as their unnatural glow did not sully his own environment the number was traced to a cell phone that was part of a batch supplied to a big box store near waterbury connecticut an electronic search of the stores sales records came up with a date and time of purchase but no name indicating a cash payment security footage from the premises was stored digitally and proved to be as easy to access as the stores inventory an image of the woman was found fifties brunette rather masculine in appearance she was timed leaving the store after which footage from the exterior cameras was examined her car was identified and its license plate checked the plate led in turn to her name address and social security number since the state of connecticut required the presentation of a social security card to issue a drivers license unfortunately by the time eldritch associates had obtained all of this information barbara kelly was already dead but now they had a name and the collector could begin his work most smokers have an impaired sense of smell as smoking damages the olfactory nerves in the back of the nose as well as the taste receptors in the mouth located on the tongue the soft palate the upper esophagus and the epiglottis the taste buds on the tongue sit on raised protrusions called papillae examined in a microscope they resemble fungi and plants in some exotic garden the collector had noticed some diminution in his capacity to taste in recent years although since he ate sparingly and unostentatiously he regarded it as only a minor irritant the ongoing damage to his ability to smell he found more troubling but as he wandered through the wreckage of barbara kellys home taking in the damage caused by fire and smoke and water he was pleased to be able to discern among the conflicting odors the unmistakable porcine stink of roasted human flesh he stood in the ruins of the kitchen and lit a cigarette he was not worried about being seen the police were no longer concerned with personally securing the scene contenting themselves with signs and tape to keep away the curious and the house was sheltered by trees from its neighbors and the road he twisted the head of his flashlight and commenced a slow and careful examination of each room starting and ending with the kitchen his worn but comfortable shoes splashing through puddles of dirty water his fingers searched dresses and jackets stinking of smoke underwear and stockings that would eventually be destroyed towels and medicines and old magazines all the detritus of a lost life he found nothing of interest but then he had expected as much still one never knew he went outside the womans car had been found fifty miles from her house burned out a second vehicle a red suv was discovered closer to the house also burned out and with its plates missing the chassis number revealed that it had been stolen from newport two days earlier curious it suggested that barbara kellys killer had arrived in one car and departed in another perhaps because the first vehicle had broken down no signs of forced access so she had invited her killer in that suggested it might have been someone known to her on the other hand she must have been aware that by sending out the list she was taking a considerable chance these were not ordinary individuals for whom she worked and they were very very careful they were particularly adept at sniffing out betrayal she would have been wary of any approaches whether from strangers or known associates the background check on kelly had revealed her sexual orientation women in fear tended to be less wary of other women a small psychological chink in their armor that kellys lesbianism might have further compounded a woman then perhaps but then the situation had changed at some point kelly had made a break for her car but was pulled back inside no dragged back inside there was grit embedded in her heels he returned to the kitchen the flames had scoured it of blood but this was where she was tortured and left to die the oven and range were electric a pity gas would have been so much more effective instead her killer had been forced to use the contents of the liquor cabinet to start the fire messy amateurish whoever was responsible had planned for a different outcome the kitchen was surprisingly neat especially given the damage to the rest of the house the surfaces were marble the cabinets polished steel and all of the kitchen utensils appeared to have been hidden away behind their doors he reconstructed it in his head seeing it as it was while its owner was still alive pristine sterile with nothing out of place apt surroundings for a woman who had hidden so much about herself he squatted beside the sink the coffee pot lay on its side its glass blackened but unbroken although the plastic on the rim had become fused to the kitchen tiles could the firemen have knocked it over possibly but the fact that it was stuck to the floor suggested otherwise he looked around the larger knives were kept on a magnetized board by the oven directly above the silverware drawer no reason to be over there unless you were preparing food how did you run how did you escape even temporarily the collector closed his eyes he had a good imagination but more importantly he had a finely honed understanding of the relationship between predator and prey in any range of given situations you couldnt go for the knives that would have been too obvious unless you were cooking and there was no indication that this was the case so what do you do what would be normal behavior even as your suspicions were perhaps becoming aroused you would offer a drink it was cold and wet on the night that you died you could have suggested liquor brandy or whisky but you would have wanted to stay alert and liquor would have dulled your responses the one who was planning to hurt you might have declined for the same reason something hot then in this case coffee you go to the kitchen maybe youre not yet worried but no you probably are youve made a mistake allowing a potential threat into your home but you havent revealed your fear youre tamping it down because as soon as its sensed action will be taken against you you have to act normal until an opportunity presents itself to strike and defend yourself you make that opportunity lets say that you threw the contents of the coffee pot and you must have hit your target because you bought yourself enough time to get to your car but not enough to escape scalding coffee probably to the face painful incapacitating but you still didnt manage to get away not just one attacker then but two or more no just two if there were three you would never have made it so far eldritch associates had obtained a copy of the medical examiners report on barbara kelly it revealed in addition to the various cuts on her body a wound to her cheek that appeared to be the result of a bite human flesh was a notoriously undependable substance for the recording of bite marks the reliability of the bite mark record could be affected by the status of the tissue under analysis the time elapsed between the bite and the creation of an impression the condition of the skin damaged by the bite pressure and the reaction of the surrounding tissue to it the size of the wound and the clearness of the marks the fact that kellys face had been badly scorched by heat caused further difficulties and meant that there was no possibility of obtaining dna samples from saliva or even of making a reasonable comparison based on dental analysis should a suspect be found what was interesting though was the fact that the bite radius was comparatively small with the first premolars and second premolars absent from both the upper and lower jaws barbara kelly it seemed had been bitten by a child shortly before she died the likelihood of a woman being present increased yes it was possible that kelly might have admitted a man with a young child but why not take the next logical step and disarm her entirely with a woman and a child why would a child bite a woman because you threatened or actively hurt its mother that was how you got away thought the collector you used something in the kitchen in all likelihood the coffee pot to attack the mother then ran it was the child that came after you distracting you for long enough to allow the woman to recover and drag you back inside well done you must have come close to surviving the collector thought that he might have been quite interested to meet barbara kelly of course his interest would have been both personal and professional if as he believed she was responsible for the corruption of so many souls then he would have been forced to take a blade to her but he admired her for the battle that she had put up at the end of her life he knew many people labored under the illusion that they would fight to stay alive under such circumstances but he had ended too many lives himself to believe that such responses were not the rule but the exception most went to their deaths without a struggle frozen by shock and incomprehension he wondered what she had told them at the end that was the other thing nobody resisted torture everybody broke it was nothing to be ashamed of the difficulty for the torturer lay in figuring out the truth of what one was being told scourge a man for long enough and if you ask him to tell you that the sky is pink and the moon is purple that day is night and night is day he will swear to it on the lives of his wife and children the trick in the early stages was to cause just enough pain and to ask questions to which the answers were already known or were easily verifiable every study required a baseline so what did she have to tell well she had promised in her letter that there were more names to be given and she had more information to provide but the kind of people who would inflict that level of pain on another human being and then leave her to burn were hardly on the side of the angels and were therefore unlikely to be sufficiently interested in the identities of those like themselves to kill for them no they would be more interested in curbing the supply of such information they would want to know whom she had approached and what she had already given them and she would have told them because the pain would have been too much for her her killers now knew therefore that eldritch associates had been provided with a list of names they might move against eldritch which would be unwise or they might seek to limit the damage caused through other means perhaps by silencing those on that particular list then there was the small matter of who else might have been approached by this woman there were few candidates who could be trusted enough in fact the collector could think of only one but then the old jew could take care of himself the collector finished his cigarette and carefully doused the tip in a pool of water before slipping the butt into the pocket of his black coat the collector regularly wore a coat regardless of the weather excesses of heat or cold had little effect on him and anyway a man always had need of pockets for cigarettes a wallet a lighter and an assortment of blades he looked to the north where eldritch was probably still sitting in his office poring over papers the thought brought him pleasure even though they had argued earlier that day and eldritch and the collector rarely exchanged a harsh word on this occasion the collector reflected it was a matter of conflicting philosophies a belief in preventive measures coming up against the lawyers requirement for evidential proof of the commission of a crime in the end though it would come down to the blade for the man with the blade always has the final word in his office a bankers lamp casting soft light across his desk eldritch looked up from the list of names as though sensing the thoughts of the other he and the collector were almost a single entity which made their earlier disagreement all the more difficult files of varying sizes on most of the individuals named on the list rested by his right hand all were compromised but fatally so eldritch was uncertain he approved of the final sanction being used in only the most extreme of cases and his view was that none of these individuals unconditionally qualified for the collectors attentions but he also acknowledged that like loaded guns or honed blades they had the potential to do great harm and it could be argued that some by their actions had already committed serious sins the question remained though was their potential to do harm as yet unrealized in most cases justification for taking their lives for eldritch the answer was no but for the collector the answer was yes a compromise of sorts had been reached one name was chosen the individual whom eldritch regarded as the most distasteful the collector would talk with him and a decision would follow meanwhile the problem of the final name remained the only name typed in red charlie parker whispered the old lawyer what have you done davis tate slumped in one of the leatherette booths of the bar and looked at his ratings for the fourth time hoping to find some cause for celebration or even mild optimism his figures should have been through the roof the economy was still unsteady the president was hogtied by his own compromised idealism and the right had succeeded in vilifying unions immigrants and welfare cases making them carry the can for the greed of bankers and wall street sharks thereby somehow convincing sane people that the poorest and weakest in the nation were responsible for most of its ills what never ceased to amaze tate was that many of those same individuals the dirt poor the unemployed the welfare recipients listened to his show even as he castigated those the union organizers the bleedingheart liberals who most wanted to help them bitterness stupidity and selfinterest he had discovered would win out over reasoned arguments every time he sometimes asked himself how this generation differed from that of his grandparents when it came to the election of a president and he had decided that previous generations wanted to be governed by men who were smarter than they were while todays voters preferred to be led by those who were as dumb as themselves he knew them well for he made his living by pandering to their basest instincts he understood that they were frightened and he fanned the flickering flames of their fear yet still his figures remained stubbornly plateaued in some states kansas for crying out loud and utah where being a liberal meant having only one wife his listenership was actually going down it was unbelievable just unbelievable he finished his beer and waved to the waitress for another what the hell is happening he asked i mean is it my voice my personality what there were those who might have said that it was all of the above and more strangely tate might well have empathized he knew that he was not particularly talented and not particularly charismatic but he could rabblerouse with the best of them he was also brighter than his enemies gave him credit for bright enough to understand that most people in america whether liberal or conservative just wanted to get along with their lives and generally didnt wish ill on anyone who had not done them actual harm they were fundamentally good people and pretty tolerant to boot for those reasons they were of absolutely no use to tate and his kind his role in life was to target those who had resentment and animosity simmering inside and put those base materials to political and social use where there is love he prayed let me sow hatred where there is risk of pardon a renewed sense of injury where there is faith doubt where there is hope despair where there is light darkness his producer becky phipps sat across from him toying with the olive in her dirty martini dirty both figuratively and literally tate had no idea what she thought she was doing ordering a cocktail in a dump like this tate didnt even want to use the beer glasses and hed wiped clean his bottle of beer before drinking from it just because this was the kind of dump frequented by regular joes didnt mean that he had to drink there too not unless it was going to boost his ratings and right now he didnt hear anyone applauding tate was also concerned that the bartender might be gay he was all muscled up but he was too tanned for tates liking and he seemed to be camping it up some for a couple of the customers who looked like queer bait the bar had been beckys choice she said it was better to have this discussion away from the usual watering holes there would be fewer distractions but also fewer ears listening in on their conversation its not a crisis yet but it could become one unless we tackle it now said becky there have been some rumblings from advertisers but assurances are being offered were talking and theyre listening theyre not cutting advertising rates are they asked tate unable to keep a hint of rising panic out of his voice that could be the kiss of death cutting rates even temporarily was a dangerous business it might be taken as an admission that the slide in listeners couldnt be arrested and that was like starting a run on a bank no but i wont lie to you the possibility has been suggested how long have we got a couple of months well get together a focus group next week do some bluesky thinking spitball the whole business tate hated it when becky used all of that business school jargon in his experience people only spoke that way when they had no idea what they were doing which was a cause for alarm in the case of his producer even if becky was a producer more in name than in practice she monitored tate guided him suggested targets for his tirades and he never disagreed with her he knew better than to do that he and becky had been together for five years and shed been good for him but his vanity made him reluctant to attribute too much of his success to her input on the other hand barbara kelly the woman who had recommended becky had also been responsible for providing seed capital and for putting him in touch with a whole network of likeminded people advertisers syndicators dealers in influence and information but barbara kelly was dead he had to tread carefully here if you think it will help said tate he tried not to sound too skeptical he lived in fear of being dropped of being sent back to the minors his third beer arrived he looked over at the bar and saw the bartender staring back at him the freak took the empty bottle from the waitress stuck his finger in the top and dumped it in the recycling bin while tate looked on he then sucked the finger that had been in tates bottle and winked did you see that asked tate what that fag bartender put his finger in my bottle and sucked it what that bottle no the last one the one i just drank from force of habit he winked at me while he did it maybe he likes you jesus you think he did something with this one too tate eyed the bottle suspiciously maybe his finger isnt the only thing he tries to put in bottles i got a wipe if you want to use it itll make the beer taste bad maybe not as bad as if the bartender stuck his dick in it but still bad youre overreacting he recognizes me im sure that he does he did that deliberately because he thinks im a homophobe you are a homophobe thats not the point i should be able to express my opinions without fear of queer bartenders sticking their fingers or anything else in my beer he could have a disease you told me he sucked his finger after you drank from the bottle not before if anyones going to catch anything its him what are you an epidemiologist and whats that supposed to mean anyway you implying that i have something he could catch paranoia maybe im telling you he knows who i am it would be great if he did said becky and the sarcasm distracted him from fingers and bottles if every bartender in new york recognized you it would mean that you were a national figure and all of your problems would be solved you mean our problems right becky sipped her drink of course i misspoke tate folded his arms huffily and turned away from her then quickly reconsidered as he found himself catching the bartenders eye again becky swore softly it was up to her to make some conciliatory gesture it always was sometimes she wished barbara kelly had never asked her to take tate under her wing he had seemed to be on the verge of breaking through in a big way at least until recently but he was a miserable whiny sonofabitch it came with the territory you couldnt spend hours every day spitting out that kind of bile then more hours working up more bile to spit out the next day and the day after and the day after that and not pollute your spirit although shed never told tate this there were times when she muted the volume in the producers booth to give her a break from his poisonous rants and she agreed with most of what he said she couldnt have done the job otherwise at least tate represented only part of her responsibilities in a way being his producer was little more than a cover story for her you smell smoke asked tate he was sniffing the air like a rat his head slightly raised he had even lifted his hands from the bar and they hung in front of his chest like paws what like fire she said no tobacco smoke he peered over the top of the booth but there was no one nearby theyd chosen the table for precisely that reason stinks like cleaning out time at the lung cancer ward for someone who was ostensibly a libertarian tate had his peculiarities and inconsistencies like so many of those who described themselves as prolife tate was only pro the kind of life that was curled up in someones womb if it emerged from that same womb and committed a crime then it was fair game for the needle similarly he was inordinately fond of war as long as that war involved kicking someones ass in a place far away from decent bars and good restaurants and was fought by the kind of men and women whom tate secretly despised when they werent wearing a uniform but he was also cautiously in favor of some form of gun control albeit a control mechanism that allowed him to own guns and kept them out of the hands of the nonwhite and the nonchristian and he certainly did not approve of those who smoked in his vicinity even while advocating the sort of lax environmental policing that in the long run was likely to have a significantly more damaging effect on the quality of the air that he breathed than the occasional breath of secondhand smoke in short becky thought davis tate was an asshole but that was why he was so useful still recruiting men such as he required a degree of care and their continued use involved careful diplomacy they couldnt be stupid or else they would be unable to perform their appointed role in the media and they couldnt be too smart in case they began questioning what they were doing or how they were being used the easiest way to ensure their continued compliance was to stroke their ego and surround them with those most like themselves hatred like love needed to be regularly fed and watered tate continued to sniff the air you sure you dont smell it he said becky sniffed there was something she admitted it was faint but unpleasant she could almost taste it on her tongue as though shed just licked a smokers fingers its old she said its on someones clothing their skin and hair too because you didnt get to smell that way unless the nicotine had ingrained itself upon your system she could almost hear the cells metastasizing she glanced over her shoulder at the very back of the bar where the light was at its dimmest she saw a figure seated in a booth against the wall a newspaper spread before him a brandy snifter in one hand the index finger of the other gently tapping a rhythm upon the table as he read she couldnt see his face but his hair looked greasy and untidy he struck her as unclean a polluted man and not just because the tobacco smell was certainly coming from him its the guy in the corner she said theres no excuse for a man smelling that bad said tate at least he wont outlive us tate was not certain but for a moment he believed that the rhythm of the mans tapping might have been interrupted and then it resumed and he forgot about it ignore him said becky hes not why were here goddamn disloyal advertisers and fat station managers without an original idea in their heads is why were here said tate its not just the advertisers and the stations we have to worry about though she replied you realize that the backers are concerned tates mouthful of beer tasted wrong it wasnt just his suspicions about the bartender misplaced or otherwise he always felt this way when the subject of the backers was raised at first their existence hadnt bothered him so much the kelly woman had approached him when he was a minor player broadcasting out of san antonio with barely a dozen statewide syndications to his name shed arranged to meet him for coffee in the lobby of the menger hotel and he hadnt been impressed with her at first she was dowdy and plain and tate suspected that she was also a dyke he had no objection to dykes as long as they were pretty that was probably as close to a liberal viewpoint as hed ever managed to come but the butch masculinelooking ones bothered him they always seemed so angry and frankly they scared the shit out of him kelly wasnt an extreme case her hair was shoulder length and she wasnt making some protest about oppressive male views of women by refusing to wear makeup or avoiding skirts and high heels no man would have given her a second look in a bar or a mall though and most wouldnt even have bothered with the first look but when she started speaking he found himself leaning forward hanging on her every word she had a soft melodious voice one that seemed to him both entirely at odds with her appearance yet also curiously appropriate if you considered her as some kind of mother figure instead of a sexual being she spoke of how there was a change coming and voices like his needed to be heard if that change was to become permanent she said that there were powerful influential figures with an interest in ensuring this was the case and they had favors to call in and money to spend davis tate didnt have to spend the rest of his career broadcasting out of a roachfilled studio in valley hi driving between it and his similarly roachfilled apartment in camelot in his pieceofshit concord hatchback he could become a big player in syndicated talk radio if he wanted to be he just had to trust in others to guide him tate might have been a serious hatemongerinwaiting but he wasnt dumb even back then he was selfaware enough to know that at best most of what he said didnt make a whole lot of sense and at worst was just damned lies but hed been saying it all for so long that even he was starting to believe it neither was his ego so out of control as to allow him to think that a northern dyke would come all the way to san antonio just because of his verbal dexterity and his unerring ability to blame the problems of hardworking white christian americans on niggers spics queers and feminists without ever having to go so far as to name them as such there was always a catch wasnt there are we talking about a loan he asked he could barely cover his rent and the repayments on his vehicle as it was and his credit card was maxed out the word loan now had the same appeal to him as the word noose no any money you receive will be offered on an entirely nonrepayable basis said kelly consider it an investment in your career she flicked through the papers on the table before her and removed a fourpage document it was closely printed and looked kind of official to tate this is the initial paperwork for the corporation we propose to set up in your name funding would come from a number of a and c bodies tate read through the document he was no lawyer but even he could tell that there was a tangle of legalese here he could also do addition and multiplication and what he was being offered amounted to many times what he was earning in san antonio with further bonuses promised as syndication increased wed also like to place a separate c organization under your direct control said kelly as youre probably aware any such organization is taxexempt and as long as it accrues less than twentyfive thousand dollars in gross yearly income is not required to make an annual return to the irs in your line of work its often necessary to provide hospitality and the more hospitable you are the more friends youll have that requires some disposable income which were prepared to provide sometimes you may even have to use those funds to put individuals in a position where they become vulnerable to pressure or exposure you mean set them up kelly gave him the kind of look his thirdgrade teacher used to give him when he failed to master a piece of simple addition but she masked it with an indulgent smile not at all she said lets say you heard that a local union organizer was known to cheat on his wife with the occasional waitress or even with some of the very immigrants whose rights he was ostensibly working to protect you could take the view that you had a moral and social obligation to expose his behavior after all its hypocrisy as well as exploitation in that case baiting a hook wouldnt be viewed as a setup he would be under no obligation to act on his appetites and you would not be forcing him to do so it would be a matter of free choice on his part thats very important mr tate in all things the freedom to choose between right and wrong is crucial otherwise well her smile widened id be out of a job tate still had the uncomfortable feeling that he was missing the point and the complexity of the legal document in his hand had only increased his suspicion that somewhere a mass of fine print was waiting to come back and bite him in the ass excuse me but what is your job exactly its on my business card she pointed at the card where it lay next to tates coffee cup im a consultant what does that mean it means that i consult how much simpler can it be but for whom you see thats why we want you mr tate for whom youre bright and you can speak well but you never talk down to your listeners you address them as equals even if theyre not you give the impression that youre one of them but you know that youre superior you have to be someone has to guide ignorant men and women someone has to explain the reality of a situation in a way thats comprehensible to ordinary people or if necessary adjust the nature of that reality slightly so it can be comprehended youre not the only person in the media to receive this approach from us youre not alone im offering you the chance to become part of a greater purpose to put your gifts to their optimum use tate was almost convinced he wanted to be convinced but still he doubted whats the catch he said and he was surprised that kelly looked pleased hed asked finally she said finally i always wait for that question its proof that we have the right person because theres always a catch right theres always something in the fine print that could come right back to bite you in the ass tate stared at her she had used almost exactly the words that he had spoken in his head he tried to remember if he might have said them aloud but he was certain that he had not dont be shocked mr tate she said in your position id be thinking the same thing she removed another sheet of paper from her briefcase and placed it before him there was a single long paragraph at the center of the page typed neatly in the middle of an ornate script was his name it reminded him of a university scroll not least because it appeared to be written in latin whats this he asked the catch she replied in your hand you hold the formal contract the minor one this is your private contract your agreement with us why is it written in latin the backers are very oldfashioned and latin is the language of jurisprudence i dont read latin allow me to summarize then tate noticed that she didnt even have to look at the page she knew its contents by heart she rattled off what sounded to him like the pledge of allegiance except it was loyalty promised not to a country but to a private body excercitus noctis the army of night catchy dont you think tate didnt think it was catchy at all it sounded like one of those reclaim the streets movements more dykes he thought and thats it thats all i have to sign nothing else it will never be publicized and you will never see the name of our organization written anywhere but here in fact the army of night doesnt exist call it a private joke basically some suitable nomenclature was required and that one appealed to the backers this particular contract is really just to reassure them we wouldnt want you to take our money and head to belize tate didnt even know where belize was but he wasnt about to head there even if he did know he was ambitious and hed never get a better opportunity than this one to advance himself in his chosen field uh who are these backers wealthy concerned individuals theyre worried about the direction in which this country is heading in fact theyre worried about the direction in which the whole world is heading they want to alter its course before its too late when do i get to meet them the backers like to keep their distance they prefer to operate discreetly through others like you exactly he looked again at the documents before him one was written in a language that he didnt understand and the rest were written in a language that he should have understood but didnt maybe i ought to run these by my attorney said tate im afraid that wont be possible this is a onetime offer if i leave here with these papers unsigned the offer will be rescinded i dont know perhaps this will be enough to convince you of our bona fides said kelly she passed him a plain white envelope when he opened it he found that it contained access details for three bank accounts including the c organization that kelly had implied was merely being considered it was called the american league for equality and freedom together the accounts contained more money than he had earned in the last ten years tate signed the papers all this money is mine he asked he couldnt quite believe it look upon it as your war chest said kelly with whom are we going to war he asked again with the whom said kelly admiringly i just love the way you talk the question remains insisted tate who are we fighting everyone said kelly everyone who is not like us one week later he was being introduced to becky phipps one year later he was a rising star now that star appeared to be on the wane and becky was alluding darkly to the backers the backers tate knew tended to act when they were displeased hed learned that early on kelly hadnt just been speculating when she spoke about the union organizer with a taste for skirt his name was george keys he liked to tell people that he was named after george orwell nobody knew if that was true or not but keys certainly came from socialist stock his father had been a union organizer all his life and his mother continued to be heavily involved with planned parenthood his grandfather meanwhile had set up a catholic worker camp in california and was personally close to the cw founder dorothy day who ticked every box on tates hate list catholic anarchist socialist radical even antifranco which as far as tate was concerned meant that she wasnt even consistent in her own wrongheadedness because the catholics were supposed to be for the fascists in the spanish civil war right if the son was onetenth of the man his grandfather was then he deserved to be wiped from the earth even without screwing mexican factory workers on the side it hadnt been difficult to bribe a whore who worked parttime as a waitress or was she a waitress who worked parttime as a whore tate could never quite tell to come on to keys with a sad story about her family back in mexico and her cousins working in indentured servitude on texas chicken farms keys bought her some drinks and the whore bought some back and one thing led to another until keys and the whore ended up back at keys place what happened after that tate didnt know and didnt care but he had photographs of keys and the woman together he then shared what he knew with his listeners and made sure the photographs were disseminated to every newspaper in the state and for an outlay of five hundred dollars he did his part in setting back union activism in the state of texas keys denied everything and tate later learned from the waitresscumwhore that all hed done back at his place was to play her some jazz that she didnt like talk about his dying mother and then start crying before calling her a cab afterward kelly had contacted him personally to say that the backers were pleased and hed received a substantial bonus in cash through becky the waitresswhore was shipped back to mexico on some trumpedup immigration charge and there she quietly vanished into the sands somewhere around ciudad juarez or so becky had hinted when she was drunk one evening and he was almost considering making a pass at her until she told him about what probably happened to the girl in mexico and how the backers had contacts down there she grinned as she said it and any desire for becky on tates part had vanished there and then and had never returned unfortunately there were other individuals who werent so pleased with what tate had done and he hadnt yet learned to be clever enough to protect himself from his own vices tate wasnt above doing a little banging of his own he wasnt married but he did have a weakness for colored girls and particularly the colored whores over at dickys on dolorosa a hangover from the days when san antonios red light district was one of the largest in the state and the least racially segregated anyway on those nights when a colored whore wasnt available tate wasnt above dipping in some dark mexican and one thing led to another and somehow it became known that davis tate frequented dickys and when he emerged one evening smelling of the disinfectant soap that dickys provided for the hygiene needs of its customers he was photographed by a white man in a car and when he objected the car doors opened and three mexicans piled out and davis tate got the beating of his life but he remembered the number plate of the car oh yes and he made the call while he was still waiting for treatment at san antonio community hospital barbara kelly had assured him that the matter would be taken care of and it was the car was registered to one francis frankie russell a cousin of george keys who did a little pi work on the side marital stuff mostly twentyfour hours later the body of frankie russell was found at the eastern edge of government canyon he had been castrated and it was suggested that he shared some of the weaknesses of his cousin and the story of the union organizer who liked screwing immigrant women illegal and otherwise was dragged up again no connection was made between russells murder and the discovery a week later of the remains of three mexican chicken farm workers dumped in calaveras lake after all they had not been castrated simply shot it was said those who knew about such matters probably a gang affair but davis tate knew better and he was very very frightened he hadnt signed up to murder all he wanted was for one beating to be avenged with another on the night that the bodies were pulled from calaveras lake he got shitfaced drunk and made a call to barbara kelly in the course of which he complained that he had not wanted the men who attacked him to be killed merely taught a lesson and kelly had replied that they had been taught a lesson and tate had begun shouting and making threats and talking about his conscience hed hung up and opened another bottle and somehow he must have fallen asleep on the floor because he wasnt sure that he was even awake when he opened his eyes and saw the beautiful darkhaired woman looking down at him my name is darina flores she said barbara kelly sent me what do you want i want to warn you about the importance of remaining faithful to the cause i want to make sure that you understand the seriousness of the document that you signed she knelt beside him and clutched his hair in her left hand while her right fixed itself on his throat she was very very strong and i want to tell you about the backers and more she whispered in his ear and her words became images and something inside davis tate died that night that memory came back to him now as becky spoke she wasnt on his side hed guessed that a long time ago she represented the interests of the backers and those who used them in turn what should i do he said how do i get these ratings back up it has been suggested that youre too subtle that youre not being radical enough you need to stir up some controversy how tomorrow youre going to hear about the disappearance of a teenage girl from upstate new york her name is penny moss and shes fifteen years old youll be given an exclusive when penny mosss remains are discovered youll be supplied with proof that her killer is a muslim convert who decided to make an example of her for wearing inappropriate dress even the cops wont know before you do the material will be sent to you anonymously well have speakers ready to comment youre about to become the eye of the storm tate almost vomited up his beer he didnt mind tearing meat from the bones of liberals because say what you liked about liberals and tate did more than most they didnt tend to voice their objections by pointing a gun at someone just as they didnt blow up federal buildings in oklahoma muslims were another matter he was happy to bait them from the safety of his radio station as long as he was just one voice among many but he didnt want to become a figurehead for antiislamic feeling he owned a nice apartment in murray hill and parts of marray hill were becoming like karachi or kabul he preferred being able to walk the streets there without endangering his life and he certainly didnt want to have to move because of a radio show but how do i know that its true because well make it true all of his taste for beer had left him if this went down the way becky was suggesting it would he was going to need a clear head only one further detail bothered him this girl this penny moss i havent heard anything about her when did she go missing later just as he was about to die he would realize that he had known the answer already had guessed it before becky even opened her lips and began to speak and he could almost have mouthed the words along with her if he chose tonight said becky she goes missing tonight back at nicolas epstein had resigned himself to the absence of his bodyguards not that he had a whole lot of choice in the matter nicks office was warm and smelled faintly of fresh baked bread and his coffee was very good at first i felt that i was being more hospitable to epstein than he probably deserved given the nature of our previous encounter but it didnt take me long to realize something about the confrontation that my anger had caused me to underestimate at the time the extent to which epstein had been frightened and frightened of me even now he remained uneasy and it wasnt due only to the absence of his protectors despite all of my protestations and liats nod of salvation i was still a troubling figure for the old man the presence of louis in the room probably wasnt making him feel any better about the situation louis could make the dead nervous your hand is shaking i said as i watched him sip from his cup its strong coffee really i could have walked on the surface of that arab stuff you served me last night if the cup had been big enough and nicks coffee is too strong for you he shrugged chacun à son goût louis tapped me on the shoulder thats french he said thanks i said it means said louis very carefully as if explaining something to a small slow child everyone to his own taste you done sometimes i wondered if angel didnt act as some kind of stabilizing influence on louis it was a possibility that i found worrying just helping said louis he looked at walter cole as if to say whats a man to do i didnt know it was french said walter see said louis to me he didnt know hes never been further east than cape may i said the closest hes been to france is patting a poodle what does it mean resumed walter what he said i just explained what it meant said louis everyone to his own taste oh said walter it sounded different the other way thats because it was in french said louis i guess said walter french people got a lot of words for stuff dont they at that point louis stopped talking to him and therefore missed the wink that walter threw my way so what now asked epstein you speak german dont you yes i speak german jesus said walter its like ellis island in here do you know what seitensprung is i continued yes said epstein it is the act of changing partners while one is dancing walter shifted in his seat and tapped louis on the arm the germans got a lot of words for stuff too dont they he said youre fucking with me man i know it no its like a whole other language i tried to ignore them and concentrated on epstein i dont know why or how i ended up on that list but you have no reason to believe that id harm you thats why i brought you here and thats why youre without your bodyguards if id wanted you dead then youd be dead and these two men wouldnt be here to witness it i caught louiss eye well one of them wouldnt be my fear as i explained to you last night is that there may be a presence within you that has not yet revealed itself said epstein and i told you that if i was like them whatever was sleeping inside me would have awakened by now there were so many times when if i was a host for something foul lying dormant in me it could have shrugged off its torpor and intervened to save those like it but it didnt it didnt because it isnt there epsteins shoulders slumped he looked old older even than he was there is so much at stake he said i know that if we were wrong about you then youd all be dead every one of you there would be no percentage in not killing you epstein did not answer he closed his eyes i thought he might be praying when he opened them again he appeared to have reached a decision seitensprung he said and nodded we dont change partners during the dance no so what now what do you think we need to find that plane said epstein why asked louis because theres another version of the list on it i said barbara kelly was killed because the people she worked for found out that she was trying to repent to save herself by revealing what she knew her list is gone but that list in the forest remains its probably older than kellys but that doesnt matter its still worth securing but we dont know where the plane is said walter you could call your friend special agent ross at the fbi i said to epstein he could look at satellite images try to track changes in the forest that might reveal the path of a fallen airplane no said epstein dont you trust him i trust him implicitly but as i told you yesterday we dont know who else is on that list it may be that even the fbi is infected the risk of alerting them to what were trying to do is too high he leaned forward on the table clasping his hands together are you sure that the vetters woman doesnt know the location of the plane she told me that her father didnt say and you believe her her father and his buddy were lost when they came across it it may be that he gave some more specific indication of the area to her before he died although if he did then she didnt share it with me you have to go back to her and discover everything that she knows everything meanwhile well try to trace the movements of barbara kelly and find out all that we can about her it may be that she secreted away a copy of the list before she died i couldnt keep the skepticism from my face epstein might have been right about kelly making a second copy of the list and storing it away from her house but if she did i was pretty certain that she gave up its location under torture marielle vetters i said epstein looked confused what he said thats the name of the woman who gave me that list her fathers name was harlan and his friends name was paul scollay they come from a town called falls end at the edge of the great north woods epsteins face cleared why are you telling me this he asked although i think he already knew the answer to the question because i trust you even after what happened last night maybe especially after what happened last night i didnt like it at the time and i dont want a repeat of it but i understand why you reacted the way that you did were on the same side rabbi the side of light he said lightish i corrected him ill talk to marielle and to ernie scollay just in case his brother might have let something slip over the years youll keep your people away from them though only liat will know their names and liat doesnt tell right no mr parker liat doesnt tell she is very good at keeping secrets he glanced at louis and walter there was more than he wanted to say about this its okay i said whatever you have to say you can say in front of them she spoke to me only of your wounds he said nothing more and i did not ask her to sleep with you in case you were wondering she did that for her own reasons i knew you got laid said louiss voice from behind me he turned to walter i knew he got laid i didnt know he got laid said walter nobody tells me anything shut up both of you i said you might also be interested to know that she believed in you from the start said epstein it was i who had doubts not her she had none but she indulged an old mans fears she said that she knew from the moment she took you inside herself goddamn i told you to shut up so said epstein he stood and buttoned his jacket we move forward youll talk to the woman today tomorrow i said id prefer to speak to her in person her and scollay along the way though i may stop off to meet with a lawyer in lynn eldritch said epstein he didnt look pleased to be speaking that name ill be careful what i tell him i suspect that whatever we know he already knows more he and his client my enemys enemy i said may be my enemy too epstein concluded we dont share their aims sometimes i think we do we may even share some of their methods epstein chose not to argue further and he and i shook hands we have a car waiting for you outside i said louis will escort you back to brooklyn and my young friends theyll be fine i assured him well mostly fine i planned to fly up to boston a couple of hours later louis and angel would drive up in a day or two along with their toys in the meantime i went back over what marielle vetters had told me because there was one detail of her tale that stood out and only because it conflicted with another story i had heard many years before it might have been nothing a piece of misremembering on my part or on the part of the man who had shared the tale with me but if marielle vetters genuinely did not know anything more about the location of the plane it was possible that i could find another means of narrowing down the search area it would just mean talking to a man about a ghost adiv and yonathan trudged south through the wilds of the jersey pine barrens they had been driven for what seemed like hours over rough terrain before eventually being dumped in the woods the man named angel had suggested to them the direction in which they should walk if they wanted to get to winslow or hammonton but they had not been sure whether to trust him and to tell the truth angel had seemed a little vague about the directions to begin with i dont like nature he told them as they stood under his gun birds calling above their heads too many trees and garter snakes and bobcats and bears bears asked adiv and garter snakes and bobcats said angel dont get too hung up on the bears why because theyre more scared of you than you are of them really said yonathan really confirmed angel he thought for a second or maybe thats spiders well happy trails the doors closed and adiv and yonathan were abandoned in a spray of dirt and mud and twigs now it was growing darker but at least they had found a road even if there were no vehicles upon it and they could not yet see any signs of artificial light i thought they were going to kill us said adiv perhaps youll be more polite in future said yonathan perhaps admitted adiv and perhaps you wont go pointing guns at the wrong people they walked on all was quiet were bound to find a store or a gas station soon said adiv yonathan wasnt so sure it seemed like theyd driven far into the wilderness and it had taken them a while simply to find something that was more than a trail he just wanted to be out of the woods before night fell in earnest he hoped that the rabbi was okay it was one thing to be personally and professionally embarrassed as they had been but if anything were to happen to the rabbi at least they left us with some quarters for the phone he said adiv checked his pocket and came out with the four coins he clutched them tightly in his fist kissed the back of his hand then opened it again he stopped and examined them more closely squinting in the poor light what is it said yonathan sonofabitch said adiv quietly he dropped the coins into yonathans hand before switching loudly to hebrew ben zona ya chatichat chara ata zevel shebaolam he shook his fist in the general direction of the southeast then slapped the back of his right hand hard against his left palm yonathan pushed the coins around with the tip of a finger canadian quarters he said the bastard davis tate couldnt get the smell of nicotine out of his mouth and nostrils he felt as though he were coated in filth outside and in even though by then the man in the corner was long gone from the bar they hadnt even seen him depart and only the newspaper and the brandy largely untouched confirmed that he had ever been there at all his presence had made tate profoundly uneasy he couldnt have said why exactly apart from that momentary pause in the tapping of the mans fingers when tate joked about his mortality but he was certain that he and becky had been the focus of the strangers attention tate had even gone so far as to corral their server while she was removing the empty brandy snifter from the booth and wiping the table clean with a cloth that stank of bleach he could see becky watching him puzzled and unamused but he didnt care that guy tate said to the waitress the one who was sitting at this table you ever see him in here before the waitress shrugged if she were any more bored shed have been horizontal i dont remember she said were midtown half the people who come in here i never see again did he pay cash or credit what are you a cop no i host a radio show yeah she perked up what station he told her it didnt register you play music no its talk radio oh i dont listen to that shit hector does whos hector the bartender instinctively tate looked over his shoulder to where hector was updating the food specials on the chalkboard even in the midst of his labors hector found time to wink at tate again tate shuddered does he know who i am i dont know said the waitress who are you it doesnt matter lets get back to the question the guy who was sitting here cash or credit i get you said the waitress if he paid credit you could ask to see the slip then youd know his name right right you should be a detective no i dont like cops especially not the kind that come in here you sure youre not a cop i look like a cop no you dont look like anything tate tried to gauge if hed just been insulted but gave up cash he said deliberately and he hoped for the final time or credit the waitress wrinkled her nose tapped her pen against her chin and did the worst impression tate had ever seen of somebody pretending not to remember he wanted to shove her pencil through her cheek instead he took ten bucks from his pocket and watched it disappear into the waitresss apron cash she said ten bucks for that you could have just told me you gambled you lost thanks for nothing youre welcome said the waitress she picked up her tray with the brandy snifter and the strangers copy of the post on top of it as she tried to pass him he took her arm hey she said just one more question said tate hector the bartender what about him hes gay right the waitress shook her head hectors not gay she said you serious said tate he was shocked sure said the waitress hectors really gay as he and becky prepared to leave tate kept thinking about the kid penny moss becky couldnt be serious could she after all she was talking about knowledge of a crime yet to be committed about the abduction and murder of a girl but to what end to foment unrest or to boost his ratings both youre part of something much larger than yourself davis becky told him she was paying their tab the fag bartender chuckling to himself as he ran beckys credit card the waitress leaning against the bar whispering to hector while he worked a feral smile on her blunt graceless face theyd given up on trying to get her to come over to the table to take beckys card tate was sure that she was telling the bartender about his earlier conversation with her he hoped that hector wouldnt think tate was queer for him he had enough problems the waitress giggled at something hector said to her and covered her mouth to reply as she saw tate watching her youre trash tate thought you were bred for this work and you wont be smiling when you see the tip not that he ever intended to set foot in this place again with its stinking customers and its weird vibe as though the bar were a portal to another realm one in which men performed unsavory acts on one another and women degraded themselves by association with them tate hated new york he hated the smugness of the place the apparent selfassuredness of even the poorest of its citizens the minimum wage flunkies who should have kept their eyes low and their heads down but instead seemed to have been infected by the citys absurd confidence in its own rightness hed asked becky to look into the possibility of broadcasting the show from somewhere anywhere else well maybe not just anywhere jesus he might end up in boston or san francisco becky told him that it wasnt possible that they had an agreement with the studio in new york that if he moved then she would have to move too and she didnt want to leave the city tate had responded by pointing out that he was the talent and maybe his wishes should take priority over the matter of her own convenience becky had given him a curious look after he said it equal parts pity and something close to hatred maybe you could talk to darina about it she said you remember darina dont you tate remembered it was why he took pills to help him sleep yes he said i remember her he knew then that he would remain exactly where becky and darina and the backers wanted him to be and they wanted him here in the city where they could keep an eye on him hed made a deal with them but he hadnt been bright enough to examine the small print on the terms then again what would have been the point had he turned them down his career would have been over theyd have seen to that he was sure of it he would never have progressed and he would still be poor and unknown now he had money and a degree of influence the drop in ratings was a temporary glitch it would be arrested theyd make sure of it theyd invested so much in him that they couldnt just cut him loose could they you okay asked becky as they walked to the door you look ill like the bitch even cared i dont like this shithole said tate its just a bar youre losing touch with your roots thats part of the problem were having no said tate as sure as hed ever been about anything im talking about this city these arent my people they despise me somebody at the bar called an order from the stool nearest the entrance hey hector im dying of thirst over here and the bartender ambled toward him keeping pace with becky and tate tate felt hector staring at him he tried to face him down and hector blew him a kiss one for all your listeners said hector you come back i got something special for you too tate didnt wait around to hear what it might be although the way hector grabbed his crotch and shook it left him with a limited number of possibilities as they reached the door his eye happened upon the newspaper rack all of the papers were already tattered and stained from use but the strangers copy of the post stood out as it was cleaner than the rest and appeared unread something had been written across the top of the front page with a black felttip it read hello davis tate grabbed the paper and showed it to the bartender did you write this he asked he was shouting but he didnt care what hector appeared genuinely puzzled i asked you if you wrote these words on the newspaper hector looked at the paper he considered it for a time no he said if that had been my message it would have read hello davis you homophobic asshole and id have added a smiley face tate tossed the paper on the bar he felt very very tired i dont hate gays he said softly you dont said hector no said tate he turned to leave i hate everyone he and becky parted at the corner he tried to discuss the writing on the newspaper but she didnt want to listen she was done with him for the day tate watched her go her tight black skirt clinging to her buttocks and thighs her breasts high and round under her navy shirt she was goodlooking tate would give her that but he no longer felt any attraction towards her because she scared him so much that was the other thing she might nominally have been his producer but he had always suspected that she was so much more she had seemed to defer to barbara kelly on the occasion of their first meeting but in the years that followed he had seen others defer to her even kelly herself becky had three cell phones and even when she was in the producers chair ostensibly keeping the wheels of the show oiled one of those phones would be pressed to her ear out of curiosity he had followed her once from the hired studio after they had finished recording a show keeping his distance trying to blend in with the crowd two blocks from the studio he had watched as a black limousine pulled up at the curb beside her and becky got in he had seen nobody else in back and the driver had not emerged to open the door for her instead choosing to remain invisible behind smoked glass three times he had followed her and on each occasion the same car had arrived to pick her up once she was out of sight of the studio producer my ass thought tate but in a way it had been strangely reassuring it had confirmed that he was involved with serious people and the wealth that had helped him to rise was not about to vanish any time soon eventually he might even have a limo pickup of his own now here he was back in the safety of his apartment building but still feeling contaminated by the stink of the bar both the taint of nicotine and the musky stench of debased sexuality and tormented by his knowledge of what might be about to happen to penny moss maybe he could google her name or search for her on facebook he could send her a message there had to be a way to do that kind of thing without revealing his identity he could set up a temporary account under a false name but wouldnt he have to wait for her to friend him first and how many penny mosses were out there it was the same problem with making a telephone call where could he start he could notify the police anonymously and tell them what he knew that a girl named penny moss was going to be abducted and killed except he couldnt say where she lived or who was going to do the abducting and killing not without mentioning becky and by doing so giving himself away he would also lose everything for which hed worked so hard his money his power his nice apartment even his life because there was the small matter of darina flores theyd send her after him and that wouldnt be good he got in the elevator and stared at his reflection in the glass as he ascended the evening played itself out before him he would sit in the dark and argue back and forth about the girl while knowing that in the end he wouldnt do anything at all eventually hed pour a drink and pretend to himself that nothing was going to happen not really no girl named penny moss would be abducted the next day and no butchers knife with her blood on it would be found on the property of some halalmuncher some religious fifth columnist who had cloaked himself in suburban normality while secretly hating everything that this country stood for this would be no innocent becky had told him they had selected a man who was a danger to all and once attention was drawn to him there would be ample evidence of his involvement in all kinds of viciousness they were doing the right thing here and as for penny moss well it might be possible to achieve their ends without killing her she didnt have to shed blood not really or not much but tate had seen the truth in beckys eyes and he knew that this was just the latest step on the road to his own damnation perhaps the final one his progress along it had been gradual slow at first but hed felt his feet starting to slide as soon as the vitriol he was spewing became directed at specific targets as soon as he stopped caring about whether what he said was even partly true or not but simply served the purpose of setting americans against americans and rendering reasoned debate impossible as soon as lives were ruined and careers and marriages were forced into collapse as soon as george keys killed himself because thats what the dumb bastard went and did his mother died the week after the union cut him loose and the combination of the two events broke him he hanged himself in his mothers bedroom surrounded by her possessions and here was the funny thing george keys was gay but he was so tormented by his homosexuality that hed been afraid to use the fact of it to defend himself against allegations that hed slept with the mexican whorewaitress there were those who blamed tate for what had happened but mostly they did so quietly davis tate was by then well on the way to becoming untouchable and damned little steps little increments of evil he put his key in the lock and opened his apartment door he registered the nicotine stench just an instant too late his reactions slowed by the beers hed drunk and his senses dulled by the smell and taste of tobacco that he had carried back with him from the bar he tried to retreat into the hallway but a blow caught him on the side of the head knocking him against the door jamb and a blade pressed itself against his neck its edge so sharp that he only realized he had been cut when he felt the blood flow and with it came the pain time to talk said a stinking voice in his ear time even to die walter cole drove me to the airport to catch the delta shuttle flight to boston hed been relatively quiet since we left nicolas walter was good at brooding you have something that you want to share i asked id just forgotten what an interesting life you lead he said as laguardia came into view in a good way or the chinese way both i guess i like being retired but sometimes i get twitchy you know ill read about a case in the newspaper or see it on the news and ill remember what it was like to be part of that the rush of it the sense of i dont know purpose yeah purpose but then lee will come into the room and shell have a beer in her hand for me and a glass of wine for herself well talk or ill help her to cook dinner you cook now god no i tried making stew once and even the dog got ill and that dog eats deer shit and doesnt blink i help lee by not trying to cook and just making sure her glass is full sometimes one of the kids will join us and the evening stretches into night and it will be good just good you know how many dinners i missed by being a cop too many too many and more now i get to make up for lost time contentment is a very underrated feeling but you only learn that as you get older and with it comes regret that it took you so long to realize what youd been missing so youre telling me that you dont want to trade your life for mine youll forgive me if im not shocked yeah thats about the size of it i listened to what was said in back of nicolas today and i felt the twitch again but i also felt the fear im too old too weak too slow im better off where i am i cant do what you do i wouldnt want to but im afraid for you charlie and i get more afraid as the years go by i used to think that maybe you could stop this that youd go to maine and just be a normal guy doing normal stuff but now i know that it isnt in the stars for you i just wonder how its going to end thats all because youre getting older and so are those two lunatics who walk at your heels and the people you go up against they just seem to get worse and worse you hear what im saying yes and i did we were coming to the delta terminal taxis crowded and farewells were made now the time was for leaving i wanted to stay walter pulled up to the curb and placed a hand on my shoulder theyll take you in the end charlie eventually therell be one whos stronger than you and faster and more ruthless or therell just be too many of them for even angel and louis to help you fight then youll die charlie youll die and youll leave your daughter with only the memory of a father and the thing of it is you just cant do anything about it can you its like i can see it written already in turn i placed my hand on his left shoulder can i tell you something i said sure you may not want to hear it its okay whatever it is ill listen youre turning into a miserable old man get out of my city he replied i hope they kill you slow grady vetters opened his eyes and watched clouds scud across the moon he had only intended to nap for thirty minutes but somehow the day had slipped through his fingers not that it mattered it wasnt like he had a job driving an ambulance or putting out fires it wasnt like he had any kind of job at all he sat up and lit a cigarette and the paperback book that he had been reading fell to the floor it was an old tarzan novel with yellow page edges and a cover illustration that promised more than the book had so far delivered hed found it on the shelf in teddy gattles living room along with a whole lot of other books that wouldnt have chimed with the perceptions of those who didnt know teddy as well as grady did teddys place was also a lot neater and cleaner than his yard might have led one to expect and the bed in the spare room was comfortable enough it had been good of teddy to offer grady a place to stay after grady and his sister had argued grady wasnt sure that if the circumstances had been reversed he would have done the same gradys head ached although he had not been drinking his head had been aching a lot lately he put it down to stress and the fact that he had already stayed too long in falls end the town had always had this effect on him ever since hed first returned after his initial semester at maine college of art in portland his mom had already been diagnosed with alzheimers by then although at that stage it was manifesting itself only as a mild disengagement from the world around her but he knew he had an obligation to return home and see her there was even a faint nostalgia for falls end having been away from it for the first significant period in his life but then hed arrived back and hed fought with his dad and hed felt the town begin to oppress him with its insularity and lack of ambition the sheer mediocrity of it like a weight upon his chest just as with the misleading cover of the edgar rice burroughs novel the cheerful welcome to falls end gateway to the great north woods sign at the entrance to the town was the best thing about the place on his last day in falls end before returning to meca he and teddy had vandalized the sign by adding the word youre as in youre welcome to falls end they thought it was funny or at least grady did teddy had seemed ambivalent about the act but he went along with it because he wanted to please grady later he told grady that the sign had been restored to its original state the next day and the finger of suspicion for defacing it had continued to point at grady and by extension teddy for many years after small towns had long memories facing gradys bed was a shelf of pictures medals and trophies relics of teddys time in middle and high school teddy had been a pretty good wrestler back then and there had been talk of scholarships being offered by a couple of colleges further south but teddy didnt want to leave falls end truth was teddy didnt even want to leave high school he liked being part of a group being surrounded by people who regardless of differences in looks or academic ability or physical prowess shared a common bond which was the town of falls end itself for teddy school days really had been the happiest days of his life and nothing since could compare with them grady stared at the photographs he was in a lot of them alongside teddy but he was smiling in fifty percent of them at most teddy was smiling in every one teddy gattle always orbiting around the sun that was grady vetters or looked at another way teddy was gradys squat shadow he was the reality that dogged gradys dreams grady wondered if he should try calling marielle again hed left one vaguely conciliatory message on her machine but she hadnt replied and he figured that she was still pissed at him hed woken up dazed and hungover after the latest party at darryl shiffs place darryl being the kind of guy who felt that a week was wasted if it included only one party at his house the hangover was bad enough worse was the fact that he hadnt woken up alone there was a girl sleeping next to him and grady couldnt remember who she was or how she got there or what theyd done together the girl didnt quite have skank written all over her but that was mostly because there wasnt much room on her skin to fit it in what with all of the other stuff that adorned it there seemed to be a disturbing number of mens names grady counted two franks and wondered if they commemorated the same guy or two different ones and when he pulled down the sheet he saw a devils tail tattooed across the girls ass a tail whose origins were lost somewhere between her slim buttocks just below the nape of her neck was a wreath of green leaves with berries bright and red holly that was her name shed even cracked a joke about the tattoo he now recalled something about guys remembering her name from behind he suddenly wanted to shower he rose to take a leak hoping that when he returned the girl might have disappeared but when he emerged from the bathroom marielle was standing at the bedroom door while a naked overly tattooed woman asked her for a cigarette and then followed up by inquiring if marielle was the wife which suggested she had her priorities all wrong when it came to the possibility that she had just slept with a married man it was about then that the shouting started with the result that grady moved out later in the morning and turned up on teddys doorstep carrying his battered suitcase in one hand his easel in the other and his paints and brushes stored wherever he could fit them he had no idea where holly had disappeared to once she got dressed but she had seemed pretty mellow about the whole business maybe shed add his name to her list of conquests possibly in her armpit or between her toes grady finished the cigarette and stubbed it out on an ashtray stolen from a bar in bangor back when bars still had their own ashtrays he padded to the kitchen found fresh bread on the table and ham and cheese in the refrigerator he made himself a sandwich and ate it standing up along with a glass of milk there was cold beer if he wanted it but hed fallen out of the habit of drinking beer in recent years and the amount of it that hed been putting through his system since he returned to falls end was playing havoc with his digestion he preferred wine but teddy only had one bottle and that was the size of a mailbox and smelled like it had been made from a base of cheap perfume and dead flowers once again grady was feeling trapped in a way that reminded him of his youth when all he lived for was to head south and leave his parents and his sister and every evolutionary deadend cell of falls end far behind hed wanted to go to art school in boston or new york but settled instead for portland where one of his aunts lived she was his mothers younger sister regarded as dangerously bohemian by the rest of her family she provided grady with a room and he got a summer job down at one of the tourist places on commercial serving up lobster rolls and fries and beer in plastic glasses he ate whatever the restaurant gave him and apart from a few bucks a week to his aunt as a token gesture toward rent and the occasional beer party in someones basement he saved everything that he earned and he was a good enough employee to be offered additional hours at another bar in town owned by the same guy and so his first year at meca had passed comfortably meca had been the right choice for him in the end the college entrusted its students with a key to the premises so he could work any time that he liked even sleeping there when he had projects due he was marked as a student to watch right from the start a young man with real potential hed even realized some of it perhaps hed realized it all and that was the problem he was good but he was never going to be great and grady vetters had always wanted to be great if only to prove to his family and the doubters up in falls end how wrong theyd been about him but the disparity between his desire and his ability between his reach and his grasp had quickly become apparent to him when he left the comforting embrace of meca and tried to make his way in the big bad art world that was when the trouble had started and now having his picture on the wall of lesters looked likely to be the best independent testimony to his value as an artist that he was ever going to see he wandered back to the bedroom the temptation to do a little weed was strong but with it would come the urge to lie down on the couch and flick through the million and one channels on teddys cable box to distract himself he set out his oils and continued working on the painting that hed started the day before marielle had kicked his ass out of her house my house that was how shed described it and hed been tempted to argue the point before he realized that she was right it was her house apart from her shortlived marriage shed lived there all her life she loved it just as shed loved their father in a way that grady never had just as she loved falls end and the woods those damned woods everything came back to them they were the only reason anyone ever came here the only reason the town thrived grady hated those woods so grady had stopped shouting at his sister right there and then he realized that it didnt matter what happened with the banks or how much the house might be worth and what his cut might be he wasnt about to put pressure on her to take out a loan that might endanger her hold on the place not in this economic climate she wasnt earning much as a schoolteacher even supplementing it with waitressing on weekends hed decided to tell her not to worry and planned to go over and clear the air the next day when or if the money came through she could send it on to him for now hed stay with teddy and paint and try to figure out where to go next there were still houses in which he hadnt worn out his welcome couches and basements where he could crash hed put up some flyers offering to do murals design work whatever it took his old man was dead what did it matter the painting was coming together quickly it showed the house and his parents and was reminiscent of grant woods american gothic except that the couple were happy not dour and in the background two children a boy and a girl pressed their faces against the inside of their bedroom windows waving at their parents below he intended to give it to marielle as an apology and as a token of what he felt for her and their mother and yes their father too he went to your show marielle had said screaming the words at him as the tattooed girl pulled on her jeans realizing that she was in the middle of a serious domestic meltdown and there was no percentage in her hanging around to see how it all panned out what he wished he hadnt drunk so much at darryls he wished he hadnt smoked that second blunt he wished hed never even spoken to the fabulous tattooed lady this was important but he couldnt get his head clear your show your lousy new york show he went to it said marielle and she was crying now the first time hed seen her cry since the funeral he took the bus to bangor and from there to boston and on to new york he went in the first week he didnt want to go on the opening night because he didnt think that hed fit in he thought youd be ashamed of him because he lived out by the edge of the woods and he couldnt talk about art and music and he only owned one suit so he went to your show and he looked at what youd done what youd achieved and he was proud he was proud of you but he couldnt say it and you couldnt see it because you were too out of it to understand and when you werent out of it you were just angry and it was all fucked up all of it you and him the way it could have been it was all lost over nothing but pride and booze and drugs and ah christ just get out get out i didnt know he wanted to say i didnt know but the words wouldnt come and ignorance was no excuse it wasnt even true he had known that his old man was proud of him or suspected as much because how many times had his father tried to reach out to him in his way and how many times had he been rebuffed now it was too late because it was always too late some revelations only came with the sound of dirt falling on a coffin the ones that mattered the ones that made for regrets so he was painting a picture for his sister and maybe for himself too it would be the first such offering he had made to her since they were children and the most important he wanted it to be beautiful he heard the sound of a vehicle slowing down and headlights raked the house as teddys truck pulled into the drive grady swore softly teddy had a heart of gold and there was nothing that he wouldnt do for grady but he liked background noise in his home the sound of the tv or the radio or music on the stereo usually something from the sixties or seventies sung by men with beards grady thought that it came from living alone for too long while being uncomfortable with his own company now that grady was around teddy liked being in his presence as much as possible hed insist that grady watch old scifi movies with him or smoke some weed while listening to abbey road or dark side of the moon or frampton comes alive the engine died he heard the doors of the truck opening and closing and footsteps approaching the house the front door was unlocked teddy always left it that way it was falls end and nothing bad ever happened in falls end doors grady realized teddy had brought company hell that meant that any small hope grady had of working for an hour or two had just gone right out the window grady put down his brush and walked to the living room teddy was kneeling on the floor his head bowed and his hands clasped behind his back he looked like a man bobbing for apples you okay teddy asked grady and teddy looked up at him his nose was broken and his mouth was bloody grady wasnt sure but even through the blood it looked as if some of gradys teeth were missing because there were gaps where there had not been gaps before im sorry said teddy im so sorry a boy jumped from behind the couch like this was all just a big game a game whose main purpose was to scare grady vetters to childhood and back which the sight of the boy had pretty much done he had the swollen unhealthy pallor of a cancer sufferer and his hair was already thinning there was bruising around his eyes his nose was swollen and his throat was distended by an ugly purple mass under other circumstances grady might almost have pitied him except the boy wore an expression that was simultaneously blank and malevolent the way grady had always imagined concentration camp executioners looked after their victims grew too many to count the boy was holding a pair of bloodstained pliers in his right hand he made a throwing motion in gradys direction with his left and four teeth landed at gradys feet roots and all grady wondered if this was a nightmare perhaps he was still asleep and if he willed himself awake none of this would be happening hed always dreamed vividly it came with being an artist but he felt the night air on his face and he knew that he was not dreaming a woman appeared in the doorway behind teddy her face partially marred by what at first might have been mistaken for a roseate birthmark but was quickly revealed as a terrible blistered burn a patch of gauze covered her left eye all of these details were incidental though next to the gun that she held in her right hand and the plastic cable ties that dangled from her left she pointed the gun at the back of teddys head and pulled the trigger there was an explosion that made gradys ears ring and teddy was no more grady turned on his heel and ran back into the bedroom slamming the door behind him there was no lock so he pushed his bed against the door before he began opening the window he heard the sound of the doorknob turning and the bed moving across the floor but he did not look back the window was stiff and he had to punch the frame to force it open he already had one foot on the windowsill when he felt a weight land on his back and a small arm snake around his neck he tried to pull himself forward and out but he was off balance and the boys full weight was hanging from him grady teetered on the windowsill his arms straining against the frame and then there were more hands on him stronger hands and his fingers lost their grip he fell back and landed awkwardly on the floor the boy rolling away from him so that he would not be trapped under the weight of gradys body the woman spread herself across gradys chest one knee on either side of his body pinning his arms to the ground and she leveled the gun at the center of his face stop moving she said and grady obeyed there was a sharp pain in his left forearm and he saw that the boy had injected him from an old metal syringe grady tried to speak but the woman placed a hand over his mouth no no talking not yet a great tiredness came over grady but he did not sleep and when the womans questions commenced he answered them every one davis tate had been forced to secure himself to the heavy radiator in the living room the intruder had already attached one cuff to the pipe before tates arrival so now only tates left hand remained free at least the radiator wasnt on which was something and the mild weather meant that the apartment wasnt too cold the fact that tate could joke about his situation even to himself suggested that either he was braver than he thought which seemed unlikely or he was going crazy from fear which was more probable the man from the bar sat in a chair beside tate flicking his butterfly knife open and closed each snick of the blade making tate wince at the further pain that it promised the cut on his neck had stopped bleeding but the sight of his shirt stained red made him queasy and the smell of nicotine at close quarters had become so strong that it felt as though his nose and tongue were burning and the intruder terrified him it wasnt just the knife in his hand although that was bad enough the man conveyed a sense of implacable malice a desire to inflict hurt that was beyond reason tate recalled an evening in a club in el paso at which hed been introduced by a mutual friend to some men who claimed to be fans of his show nondescript figures with sunburned skin and the glassy eyes of dead animals who were either on their way to or coming back from the conflict in afghanistan as the night wore on and more alcohol was consumed tate worked up enough courage to ask them what it was they did exactly and was informed that they specialized in the interrogation of prisoners they waterboarded and starved and froze and tormented but they made one thing clear to him there was a purpose an end to what they did they did not torture for the pleasure of it but to extract information and once the information was extracted the torture stopped most of the time were not like the other guys the bad guys said one who told tate that his name was evan we have a set goal which is the acquisition of information once were certain that this been achieved our work is done you want to hear whats really terrifying being tortured by someone who has no interest in what you know someone for whom torture is an end in itself so that no matter what you tell him or who you betray theres no hope that the pain will stop not unless he decides to let you die and he doesnt want to do that not because hes a sadist although thats probably part of it but out of professional pride like a juggler trying to keep the balls in the air for as long as he can its a test of skill the louder and longer you scream the greater the vindication of his abilities tate wondered if here in his own apartment he was now looking at just such an individual his suit was wrinkled and stained the collar of his shirt as yellowed as his fingers his hair slick with grease there was no military bearing to this man no sense of someone who had been trained to do harm but this man was also a zealot tate had met enough of them in his time to recognize one when he saw him in his eyes burned a fierce light the fire of righteousness whatever this man did or was capable of doing he would not view as immoral or an offense against god or humanity he would hurt or kill because he believed that he had the right to do so tates only hope lay in the mans use of a single word perhaps time perhaps to die or perhaps to live what do you want asked tate for what must have been the third or fourth time please just tell me what you want he felt and heard the sob catch in his throat he was getting tired of posing the question just as he had tired of seeking the mans name each time he asked a question the intruder just gave the blade a double flick in reply as if to say who i am doesnt matter and what i want is to cut this time though tate received an answer i want to know how much you got for your soul his teeth were yellow and his tongue was stained the dirty white of sour milk my soul snick went the blade snicksnick you do believe that you have a soul dont you you have faith after all you speak of it on your radio show you talk about god a lot and you speak of christians as though you know the inner workings of each and every one you seem very certain about what is right and what is wrong so what i want to know is how can a man who has sold his soul speak of his god without gagging on the words what did they offer you what did you get in return tate tried to calm himself still clinging to the precious perhaps what answer was this man seeking what answer would keep tate alive and suddenly the intruder was upon him even as tate tried to kick out and keep him at a distance the knife was back at his throat and this time the snick was followed by the drawing of more blood from behind his right ear dont calculate dont think just answer tate closed his eyes i got success i got syndication i got money and influence i was a nobody and they made me somebody who who made you this somebody i dont know their names not true snick another cut except this one was lower slicing through his earlobe tate shrieked i dont know i swear to you i dont know they just told me that the backers liked what i did thats what they call them the backers ive never met them and ive had no contact with them only with the people who represent them still he tried to keep back the names he was scared of this man scared near to death but he was more frightened of darina flores and the desolation he had experienced as she spoke of all that would follow if he crossed those who were so anxious for him to succeed but now it was the intruder who was whispering he held tates face in his hand as he spoke and breathed a fug of fumes and filth and rotting cells into his face i am the collector he said i send souls back to their creator your life and your soul wherever it may lie hang in the balance a feather will be enough to shift the scales against you and a lie is the weight of a feather do you understand yes said tate the manner in which this man spoke left no room for misunderstanding so tell me about barbara kelly tate knew then that there was no point in lying no point in holding anything back if the man knew about kelly then how much else did he know tate didnt want to risk another cut maybe a fatal one by being caught out in a lie and so he told the collector everything from his first meeting with kelly through the introduction of becky phipps and the destruction of the vocation and life of george keys right up to the meeting earlier that day concerning the fall in his ratings he sniveled and wheedled and engaged in the kind of shameless selfjustification that he believed himself to be duty bound to shoot down when his opponents tried to rely on it and as he spoke he felt as if he were engaged in a process of confession even though confession was for catholics and they were barely above muslims jews and atheists on the list of folk for whom he reserved a particular hatred he was listing his crimes taken individually they seemed inconsequential but when recited as a litany they seemed to assume an unstoppable momentum of guilt or was he merely reflecting the feelings of the man seated opposite him for although his interrogators expression never varied rather it seemed to grow gentler and more encouraging as tates lanced conscience spewed out its poison rewarding him for his honesty with something that might have been mistaken for compassion there was no escaping the knowledge that tates soul was still being weighed against a feather on the collectors scales and found wanting when he was done tate sat back against the wall and hung his head his earlobe ached and his mouth tasted of salt and sour things for a time there was only silence in the dim room even the sound of the traffic outside had faded and tate had a sense of the boundlessness of the universe of stars racing away into the vacuum colonizing the void and of himself as a fragment of fragile life a fading spark from a vital flame what are you going to do he finally asked when his own insignificance threatened to unman him a match flared and another cigarette was lit tate smelled the vileness of the smoke the odor that had first alerted him to the intruders presence except now the word intruder had become inappropriate somehow this man belonged here in this room in this apartment on this street in this city in this world in this great dark universe of dying light and distant spiraling galaxies while davis tate was merely a temporary fault in nature a stain upon the system like a mayfly born with one wing would you like a cigarette asked the collector no if youre concerned about ruining your health or becoming addicted i wouldnt worry tate tried not to think about what that might mean i asked you what youre planning to do with me said tate i heard you ive been thinking about the question barbara kelly is dead so her fate is already decided did you kill her no but i would have given the opportunity so who did kill her her own people why because she was turning against them she was sick and frightened and she feared for her soul so she set out to make recompense for her sins by betraying their secrets she believed that she might save herself but then there is becky phipps on the table beside the man lay tates cell phone with the cigarette clamped between his teeth the collector flicked through the list of contacts until he found the name that he wanted a forefinger pressed itself against the screen and the number was dialed tate heard it ringing the call was answered on the third ring and tate knew from the echo that the recipients phone was on speaker davis said becky phippss voice she didnt sound particularly pleased to be hearing from him tate thought bitch you think you have problems this isnt a good time can i call you back later or tomorrow the stranger indicated to tate that he should speak he swallowed he didnt know what he was supposed to say in the end he settled for honesty its not such a good time for me either becky somethings come up what now tate looked at the collector who nodded his assent theres a man here with me in my apartment i think he wants to talk to you the stranger took a long drag on his cigarette before leaning close to the phone hello ms phipps he said i dont think weve had the pleasure although im sure that we will in the near future phipps took a couple of seconds to reply when she did her tone had changed she was cautious and her voice trembled slightly it caused tate to wonder if she knew the identity of the caller already despite her next question who is this she said the man leaned yet closer to the phone so that his lips were almost touching it he frowned and his nostrils twitched is there someone there with you ms phipps i asked you a question said phipps and her voice became even less steady belying her attempt at bravado who are you a collector came the reply the collector a collector of what debts regrets souls youre stalling for time ms phipps you know who i am and what i am there was a pause and tate knew that the collector was right there was someone else with becky he could picture her looking to the other for guidance that was you in the bar wasnt it she said davis was right to be worried i thought he was just jittery but it seems that he was more sensitive than i gave him credit for tate didnt like his producers use of the past tense in association with his name he is remarkably sensitive in more ways than one said the collector he screamed very loudly when i sliced through his earlobe thankfully these old brownstones have thick walls will you scream when i come for you ms phipps it wont matter either way so dont be too concerned i always bring earplugs and i really do believe that there is someone with you thats my particular sensitivity who is it one of your backers perhaps put him on let him speak it is a he isnt it i can almost see the price tag on his suit be sure whoever you are that ill find you too and your associates ive learned a great deal about you already there was an intake of breath before phipps started shouting what did you tell him davis what did you tell him about us you keep your mouth shut you keep it shut or i swear i swear well put you the collector killed the connection that was all very amusing he said you warned her said tate she knows youre coming now why would you do that because in her fear shell draw out the others and then i can take them too and if they choose to remain hidden well shell give me their names when i find her but how will you do that wont she hide from you wont she be protected i find your concern for her very touching said the collector one would almost think that you liked her rather than merely being obligated to her you really should have examined that contract more closely you know it made clear your obligations to them while leaving them with none to you it is in the nature of their bargains to do so i dont read latin said tate glumly very remiss of you its the lingua franca of the law what kind of fool signs a contract written in a language that he cant read they were very persuasive they said it was a oneoff deal they told me that if i turned it down there were others who would accept there are always others who will accept they told me id have my own tv show that id get to publish books i wouldnt even have to write them just put my name to them and how did that work out the collector asked and he seemed almost sympathetic not so good admitted tate they said i had a face made for radio you know like rush limbaugh the collector patted him on the shoulder the small gesture of humanity increased tates hope that the word perhaps had become less a piece of driftwood to which he might cling than a life boat to keep him safe from the cold waters that currently lapped at his chin your friend becky has a bolthole in new jersey thats where shell run to and thats where ill find her shes not my friend shes my producer its an interesting distinction do you have any friends tate thought about the question not many he admitted i suppose that its difficult to keep them in your line of work why because im so busy no because youre so unpleasant tate conceded the point so said the collector what should i do with you now you could let me go said tate ive told you all that i know youll call the police no said tate i wont how can i be sure because i know that youll come back for me if i do the collector appeared impressed with his reasoning you may be smarter than i thought he said i get that a lot said tate theres something more that i can give you to convince you to let me go what would that be theyre going to abduct a girl said tate her name is penny moss theyll blame whatever happens to her on some raghead i know i heard you discussing it you were right at the other end of the bar i have very keen hearing oh and i placed a cheap transmitting device on top of your booth as i passed tate sighed will they hurt the girl there is no girl what it was a test to see how youd respond after what happened with barbara kelly theyre worried repentance is contagious theyll administer many such tests in the days and weeks to come i think they probably figured that they were safe with you though after all you never displayed any signs of being principled before you were hardly likely to start now the pressing question remains mr tate what is to be your fate youve been a bad man youre a corruptor a proselytizer for ignorance and intolerance you thrive on fear and finding easy enemies for the weak and bitter to hate you fan the flames but plead innocence when the ugliness of the consequences becomes apparent the world is a poorer more benighted place for your presence in it the collector stood from beneath his coat he removed a gun an old special its grips worn its metal dulled yet still handsomely lethal tate opened his mouth to shout to scream but no sound emerged he tried to worm his way into the corner covering his face with his arm as though it might shield him from what was to come youre panicking mr tate said the collector you havent let me finish hear me out tate tried to calm himself but his heart was beating and his ear throbbed with renewed vigor and he welcomed the pain of it because he could still feel it because he was still alive he peered over his forearm at the man who held his life in his grasp despite all of your manifest failings the collector continued i feel reluctant to pass final judgment upon you you are almost damned but there is room for doubt only a little a scintilla you do believe in god dont you mr tate what you talk about to your listeners hypocritical and untruthful though it may be has some roots in a blasted version of faith tate nodded sharply and consciously or unconsciously joined his hands as if in prayer yes yes i do i believe in the risen lord jesus i was born again in christ when i was twentysix hmmmm the collector made no effort to disguise his doubt ive listened to your show and i dont think your christ would recognize you for one of his own if he spent an hour in your company but lets leave it up to him as youre such a believer the collector ejected all six bullets from the gun into the palm of his right hand before carefully reloading three of the chambers ah jesus you got to be kidding said tate taking the lords name in vain said the collector are you sure thats how you want to start off your greatest test before god no said tate im sorry im sure the deity will put it down to the stressful nature of the situation please said tate not like this its wrong are the odds too generous suggested the collector too ungenerous he looked perturbed you drive a hard bargain but if you insist he removed one of the bullets leaving two rounds in their chambers and spun the cylinder before pointing the gun at tate if your god wills it he said i say your god because hes nobody that i recognize the collector pulled the trigger the clicking of the hammer on the empty chamber was so loud that tate was convinced for a moment he had heard the bullet that was to kill him his eyes were screwed so tightly closed that he had to concentrate just to force them open again when he did so the collector was looking with a puzzled expression at the gun in his hand strange he said tate closed his eyes again this time as a prelude to a prayer of gratitude thank you he said jesus lord thank you when he finished the gun was again pointing at his forehead no he whispered you said you promised it always pays to be certain said the collector as his finger tightened on the trigger sometimes i find that gods attention wanders this time davis tate heard no sound not even gods breath in the exhalation of the bullet instead of traveling straight to portland after arriving in boston i stayed at a cheap motel on route near saugus and ate a good steak dinner at frank giuffridas hilltop steakhouse when i was a boy my father would treat my mother and me to an early dinner at the hilltop when we were heading up to maine to see my grandfather each summer and i always associated it with the beginning of our vacations we would sit at the same table every time or as near as we could get to it there would be a view over route and my father would order a rib steak as big as his head with all the trimmings while my mother tuttutted good naturedly and fretted about his heart frank had died back in and an investment firm now owned the hilltop but it was still a place where regular folk could go for a decent steak dinner without breaking the bank i hadnt been back there in about thirty years not since my father took his own life there was too much of him associated with it but in recent times i had learned more about my father and the reasons for what he had done and i had reached an accommodation with the past it meant that places like the hilltop were no longer tinged with the same sadness and i was glad that it remained pretty much as i remembered it with its illuminated sixtyfoot saguaro cactus outside and its herd of fiberglass cows i slipped the hostess ten bucks to give me my familys old table to myself and ordered the ribeye in memory of my father the dinner salad was just a little smaller than before but since the original salad would have fed a small family it meant that there was less to throw away i drank a glass of wine and watched the cars go by and thought about epstein and liat and an airplane hidden by the woods and i thought about the collector because one matter had remained untouched upon between epstein and me although louis had raised it before i left with walter to catch my plane what louis suggested was that if the collector were in possession of a full or partial list of names he would almost certainly begin targeting those on it this begged the question if my name was on it would he then also choose to target me for that reason alone it was necessary to arrange a meeting in lynn with the lawyer eldritch to whom the collector was linked in ways that i did not fully understand i finished dinner skipped dessert for fear of busting my insides and headed back to my motel room i had just turned on the light when my cell phone rang it was walter cole davis tate the toxic figure on talk radio whose name appeared on the lists was dead according to walter tate had been shot in the head but some knife wounds had been inflicted on him before he died his wallet containing his credit cards and dollars in cash was still in his jacket pocket but his cell phone was missing and a tan line on his left wrist suggested that his killer might have taken his wristwatch the theft of the wristwatch which would later be revealed as a modestly expensive tudor puzzled the detectives investigating the killing why leave the money but take the watch i could have told them why and so could walter but we did not the man who killed tate had magpie eyes the collector had just added another trophy to his cabinet of curiosities early the next morning i drove to lynn if the firm of eldritch associates had been raking in big bucks in recent years it hadnt seen fit to pump them back into its offices it continued to occupy the top two floors of a bleak edifice too dull to qualify as an eyesore but still sufficiently ugly to make the neighboring businesses look as though they would have upped foundations and moved if they could and it wasnt as if they were housed in architectural gems either the unprepossessing exterior of tulleys bar a prime example of fortress design stood to the right of eldritchs building on its left a telecom store previously run by and for cambodians had been replaced by a telecom store run by and for pakistanis short of putting up a sign inviting the american wing of al qaeda in for coffee and cookies it couldnt have advertised itself more as a target for federal surveillance in the current mood of distrust between the us and pakistan otherwise this stretch of lynn was still the same accumulation of graygreen condos nail salons and ethnic restaurants that i remembered from previous visits the gold lettering on eldritchs upper windows announcing the presence of a lawyer inside was more flaked and faded than before a graphic representation of eldritchs own slow physical decline the first floor of the building remained unoccupied but its windows were now barred and the filthy old glass had been replaced with dark semireflecting panes i tapped on one with a finger as i passed it was strong and thick the streetlevel door no longer opened to the touch beside it a simple intercom panel was set into the wall there was no visible camera but i was willing to bet good money that one or more sat behind the dark glass of that firstfloor window as if to confirm my suspicions the door buzzed before i even had a chance to press the intercom button inside the building remained reassuringly musty every intake of breath bringing with it the smell of old carpets impacted dust cigarette smoke and slowly peeling wallpaper the paintwork was a sickly yellow and marked on the right of the narrow stairway by decades of traffic on the first landing was a door marked bathroom and looking down on it from the second floor was a frosted glass door with the firms name written in the same style of gold lettering that adorned the streetfacing windows it was almost a relief to open the door and discover that the wooden counter remained in place and behind it the big wooden desk and behind that the heavily kohled and otherwise cosmeticized presence of eldritchs secretary a woman who if she had a last name preferred not to share it with strangers and if she had a first name probably never allowed it to be used even with intimates assuming anyone was foolhardy or lonely enough to attempt some form of intimacy with her to begin with her hair was currently dyed a gothic black and rose from her head like a pile of coal slack she had a cigarette burning in the ashtray beside her smoking away in a pond of butts and all around her rose teetering piles of paper she added to the nearest ones as i entered yanking two sheets from her old green electric typewriter and carefully separating the carbon copy from the original before placing each on the top of its respective tower she then picked up the cigarette took a long drag on it and squinted at me through the smoke if the memo about the illegality of smoking in the workplace had reached her i guess shed burned it good to see you again i said is it well you know its always nice to see a friendly face is it she repeated maybe not i conceded yeah there was an uncomfortable silence but it was still less uncomfortable than actually trying to conduct a conversation she continued to puff on her cigarette and view me through the fug of the smoke she produced a lot of smoke so there was a limit to how much of me she could see through it i suspected that she liked it better that way im here to see mr eldritch i said just before i threatened to lose sight of her entirely you have an appointment no he doesnt see people without an appointment you ought to have called ahead i would have but nobody ever answers the phone were real busy you could have left a message you dont have an answering service you could have written you can write cant you i wasnt thinking that far ahead and its urgent it always is she sighed name charlie parker i said she knew my name after all shed let me in without the aid of the intercom to identify me you got some id youre kidding right i look like a kidder to you not really i handed over my license its the same picture as last time she said thats because im the same guy yeah she made it sound as though that represented a regrettable lack of developmental ambition on my part my license was handed back to me she picked up the receiver on her beige phone and dialed a number that man is here again she said even though it had been years since my presence had dampened her day she listened to the voice on the other end of the line and put the phone down mr eldritch says you can go up thank you wouldnt have been my choice she said and commenced feeding another double sheet of paper into her typewriter shaking her head and scattering cigarette ash across her desk wouldnt have been my choice at all i headed up to the third floor where an unmarked door stood closed i knocked and a cracked voice told me to come in thomas eldritch rose from behind his desk as i entered a pale wrinkled hand extended in greeting he was dressed as usual in a black jacket and pinstripe trousers with a matching vest the gold chain of a watch extended from a buttonhole on his vest to one of the pockets the bottom button of the vest remained undone eldritch adhered to tradition in his modes of attire as in so many other matters mr parker he said it is a pleasure as always i shook his hand expecting it to crumble to pieces in mine shaking hands with him was like grasping quail bones wrapped in rice paper his office was less tidy than before and some of those piles of documents from his secretarys lair below had begun to colonize it names and case numbers were handwritten on the front of every file in glorious copperplate the quality of the lettering consistent throughout even as some of the writing itself had faded over time you seem to accumulate a lot of paper for someone with such a limited client base i said eldritch looked around his office as if seeing it for the first time or perhaps he was just trying to view it as a stranger might a slow consistent trickle that has grown to form a lake of legalese he said it is the lawyers burden we throw away nothing and some of our cases drag on for many many years lifetimes it often seems to me he shook his head sadly clearly regarding the propensity of individuals to lead long lives as a deliberate attempt to complicate his existence i suppose a lot of these people are dead by now i said in an effort to provide some consolation eldritch minutely adjusted the neatly ordered stack of files on his desk flicking the little finger of his left hand along their spines the finger was missing a nail i had not noticed its absence before i wondered if it had simply fallen out a further manifestation of eldritchs disintegration oh yes very much so said eldritch very dead indeed and those that are not dead are dying they are the dead who have not been named you might say we are all walking in their ranks and in time each of us will have a closed file with our name written upon it there is great pleasure to be had in closing a file i find please take a seat the visitors chair in front of his desk had recently been cleared of paperwork leaving a clean rectangular patch in the center of the dust on the leather cushion it had obviously been some time since anyone had been offered a seat in eldritchs office so said eldritch what brings you here mr parker do you require me to prepare your will do you feel the imminence of your mortality he chuckled at his joke it was the sound of old coals being raked on a cold ashladen fire i didnt join in thank you i said but i have a lawyer yes ms price up in south freeport you must prove quite a handful for her after all you do get up to all sorts of mischief he wrinkled his nose and blew the last word at me as if it were a kiss in the right light and the right mood he might have resembled an indulgent avuncular figure except that it was all a pose throughout our exchange not once had an unsettling steeliness left his eyes and for all of his obvious ongoing decrepitude those eyes remained remarkably clear and bright and hostile mischief i echoed the same observation might equally be made about your own client i chose the singular carefully whatever impression eldritchs practice gave of even the slightest interest in conventional legalities i believed that it existed for only one true purpose as a front for the work of the man who occasionally went by the name of kushiel but was more commonly known as the collector the law firm of eldritch associates targeted putative victims for a serial killer it was engaged in an ongoing discourse with the damned im afraid i dont know what youre talking about mr parker said eldritch i do hope that youre not implying some knowledge of wrongdoing on our part do you want to search me for a wire i doubt that you would be so crude in your methods i suspect that it simply amuses you to make accusations you cant possibly prove about suspicions on which you lack the courage to act if you have questions to ask about the behavior of this client then you should put them to him yourself weve had words about it but infrequently i said hes a difficult man to find he tends to hide under rocks waiting to pounce on the unwary and the unarmed oh mr kushiel usually hides much deeper than that said eldritch and any pretense of goodwill vanished the office was very cold much cooler than the morning outside but i could find no sign of an airconditioner there wasnt even a window to be opened and yet as eldritch spoke his words found form in plumes of condensation and just as my use of the singular about his client had been carefully chosen so too was his use of his clients name at that particular point in our discussion i was aware of the derivation of that particular identity in demonology kushiel was hells jailer the first time i had approached eldritch his client had been waiting for me outside when i left if that was going to be the case again i wanted to know there was an entente between us but it was delicate and far from cordiale the existence of the list was likely to complicate that relationship further especially if the collector had begun to target those on it where is he now i asked abroad in the world came the reply there is work to be done is he a fan of talk radio somehow i doubt it did you hear that davis tate died i didnt know the man he was a minor cheese on rightwing radio someone shot him in the head everyone is a critic nowadays some more than others usually a bad review on the internet suffices i dont see how this concerns me i believe that you and by extension your client might have been in contact with a woman named barbara kelly she provided you with a document a list of names i have no idea what youre talking about i ignored him and continued your client may be tempted to act upon that information in fact i think he may already have started with davis tate you need to tell him to keep his distance from the people on the list i dont tell him anything replied eldritch acidly you should not presume to do so either he will do as he sees fit within obviously the limits of the law and what law would that be exactly id like to see where serial killing has been enshrined as a legal act youre baiting me mr parker said eldritch its uncouth your client is more than uncouth your client is insane if he is beginning to take action against the individuals on that list hell alert others on it and those who control them to the fact of its existence well lose them all just to satisfy your clients bloodlust eldritchs limbs stiffened in anger it brought out the excessive politeness that was his lawyers training i would contest your use of the word bloodlust he said enunciating each syllable slowly and clearly youre right i said it implies an emotional capacity to which he cant even aspire but we can have a semantic discussion about the best definition of his mania on another occasion for now all he has to know is that there are larger interests at stake here and other parties involved eldritchs hands gripped his desk as he leaned forward the scrawny tendons in his neck extending so that he looked like a turtle deprived of its shell do you think he cares about some old jew squatting in new york fingering his tassels as he prays for his lost son my client acts he is an agent of the divine there is no sin in his work for those whom he chooses to confront have forfeited their souls through their own depravity he is engaged in the great harvest and he will not cannot stop files must be closed mr parker files must be closed spittle flecked his lips and his usually bloodless features had bloomed with an unexpected rush of sanguinity he seemed to realize that he had overstepped his usual boundaries of decorum for the tension eased out of his body and he sank back into his chair releasing his grip upon his desk he took a clean white handkerchief from his pocket patted it against his mouth and looked with distaste at the marks on the material it was spotted with red he caught me staring at it so he folded it quickly and put it away forgive me he said that was uncalled for i will pass on your message although i cant promise that it will do any good he seeks and finds seeks and finds theres another risk involved in his actions i said which is he will force them to act against him but hes hard to pin down youre much easier to find that could almost be interpreted as a threat its a warning to borrow your expression thats a matter of semantics will there be anything else i do have one last question i asked go on he did not look at me but began writing on a yellow legal pad in that elegant copperplate already he had dismissed me in his mind i had forced him to shout i had seen the blood on the handkerchief he wanted me gone from his presence it concerns the list that you were sent list list a drop of blood fell from his lips and exploded upon the paper he continued writing so that blood and ink combined again i know of no such list i ignored him i was wondering if my name was on it the nib of the pen stopped moving and eldritch peered up at me like some old malicious imp worried mr parker interested mr eldritch eldritch pursed his lips let us speculate then since you seem so convinced of its existence and my knowledge of it if my name were on such a list i might well be worried for what could one have done to justify ones place upon it he wagged the bloodied nib of his pen at me i think that perhaps you will be meeting my client sooner than you anticipate im sure that the two of you will have a great deal to discuss if i were you i would begin preparing my defense now and perhaps he added as i rose to go you might like to think again about that will eldritchs secretary was standing at her door when i left her bosss office looking anxiously up the stairs alerted by the earlier shouting despite her concern a cigarette still dangled securely from her lips what did you do to him she asked i endangered his blood pressure a little although i was surprised he had enough blood in him to manage it hes an old man but not a nice one she waited for me to come down before she started up the stairs to check on her employer youll get whats coming to you she said and she practically hissed the threat youll vanish from the face of the earth and when they search your home for clues theyll find something is missing if they look hard enough a photograph in a frame or a pair of cufflinks inherited from your father it will be an item that had meaning for you a cherished heirloom a memory enshrined in a possession and it will never be found again because he will have added it to his collection and we will close and burn the file with your name written on it just as you too will burn you first i said your dress is smoldering one of her feet was on a higher step than the other and her dress had formed a neat basket for the cigarette ash that was burning a hole through the fabric she brushed at it with her hand but the damage was already done it was all relative as the dress had been horrible to begin with lets talk again soon i said you take care now she whispered some obscenity but by then i was already heading for the door the night before i had taken the precaution of removing my gun from the locked box under the spare tire in my car and i was now armed before i left eldritchs building i took off my jacket and used it to conceal the gun in my right hand i kept it there as i walked back to my car making a slow turn in the middle of the street to make sure that there was nobody at my back only when i was driving out of lynn did i begin to feel even remotely secure but it was a temporary compromised thing my meeting with the old lawyer had unnerved me but the certainty and venom with which his secretary had spoken had given me the confirmation that i was seeking the collector was in possession of the same list as epstein and my name was on it grady vetters lay unconscious on the floor of teddy gattles living room the boy had given him a second stronger dose of sedative after they had finished questioning him and he would remain out cold for many hours darina had closed the drapes and pulled the blinds and she and the boy had fed themselves from the contents of the refrigerator eventually the boy had drifted off to sleep curled up on the couch with his mouth open and one small fist curled against his chest one might almost have mistaken him for an innocent darina did not sleep not yet her face hurt but she made do with swallowing advil at regular intervals and watched television with the volume turned down low daylight came but she was not afraid of being discovered both vetters and his friend had confirmed that the house received few visitors during the day and vetters recent argument with his sister meant that even she would be unlikely to trouble her brother until he framed some apology for his actions darina now knew the story of the airplane in the woods or as much of it as harlan vetters had chosen to share with his son but she was certain that he had told his daughter more it was clear from what vetters had said that his father regarded him as untrustworthy a disappointment the old man had placed his faith in the sister marielle she had looked after him in his last illness and who knows what they had spoken of together over those final weeks and months darina had been tempted to confront marielle vetters immediately but she and the boy needed to rest the pain of her burns had debilitated her and anyway it would be easier for them to move around once darkness fell her ravaged face would attract attention in daylight and there were those in this town who might remember her from before when she was still beautiful careful not to wake the boy she walked to the bathroom and stared at herself in the mirror her wounds glistened beneath their layer of ointment and her damaged eye resembled a drop of milk in a pool of blood she had loved being beautiful because it was a reminder of her true nature but she would never be beautiful again not in this form she would be scarred forever even if she consented to grafts perhaps she would shed this skin just as the boy had done and wander for years before cocooning herself in another body there to await her emergence in time though in time the plane was important the list had to be secured grady vetters stirred and moaned from where he lay beside the cold fireplace they had only been forced to injure him a little the sodium thiopental had made him more malleable but he had still instinctively tried to protect his sister the boy had been forced to crush the tips of two of vetters fingers with a pair of pliers and after that he had told them everything what he could not tell them though was whether his sister had spoken to anyone else about the plane grady vetters had been foolish enough to share the story with teddy gattle and gattle believing that he was doing his friend a favor had made the call to darina apparently vetters had been reluctant to contact darina himself he had been smart enough to realize that it might draw unwanted attention to himself and his sister teddy gattle unfortunately had not been quite so smart which was why he was now dead marielle vetters according to both her brother and his late friend was smarter than both of them but grady vetters admitted to darina that his sister had recently raised the possibility of seeking some professional advice on their situation her brother had been less than supportive and his sister had not brought up the subject again but she was strong willed and grady vetters knew that she was more than capable of going behind his back if she believed it was the right thing to do if she had sought counsel that made finding the plane all the more urgent and there was also the matter of the passenger if what harlan vetters had told his children was true the passenger had survived the impact as otherwise his body would have been found handcuffed to his seat darina wondered if he had caused the crash by escaping from his cuffs while the plane was in flight he was certainly capable of it and strong enough to survive anything but the worst of impacts she believed that he was still alive she would have known if he was not would have sensed his pain as he was wrenched from the world but there had been no communication with him no contact she could not understand why that mystery too could be investigated once the plane was found tonight they would speak with marielle vetters and find out all that she knew they would bring her brother with them for darina had learned that the threat of harm to another was often more effective than the threat of harm to oneself particularly if the individuals in question were linked by bonds of love and blood grady vetters had made it clear to them that he loved his sister he had even begun painting a picture for her a picture that neither of them would see completed she went back to the living room glancing down at teddy gattles body as she passed it he was starting to smell she dragged him into the main bedroom and closed the door when she was done there was no point in making their surroundings any more unpleasant than they had to be while they recovered their strength she swallowed two more advil then took out her cell phone and dialed a number a machine picked up and she left a brief message detailing where she was and what she had discovered so far she followed it with a second call she didnt know these woods and help would be required in finding and securing the plane the man on the other end of the line didnt sound pleased to hear from her but people rarely did when their debts fell due when she was done she lit a cigarette and let the images on the television screen wash over her she waited until the boy woke up before she herself slept and her dreams were filled with visions of beauty lost and angels falling from the heavens becky phipps sat on the floor of the safe house in new jersey it was little more than a cabin and sparsely furnished although it had a land line she listened to darina flores leave her message and realized that darina had not been alerted to the latest threat she did not know that the collector had begun to hunt them down unfortunately there was little that becky could do to rectify that situation her jaw was broken and she had received stab wounds to her back and legs but she had fought hard and the collector was still bleeding profusely from his damaged scalp nevertheless she was dying and he was not worse she had told him most of what he wanted to know most but not all her only consolation was that just as he had moved against them so they would move against him the thought might have made her smile had she still been capable of using her mouth darina flores said the collector its good to put a voice to a name and eventually ill add her face i take it that she killed barbara kelly you dont have to speak just nod actually a flicker of your eyelids will do becky blinked once slowly there was a child with her wasnt there becky didnt blink this time the collector knelt before becky and showed the blade to her either becky didnt know about the child or even the threat of the blade was not enough to make her acknowledge its existence no matter he would discover the truth for himself eventually and kellys copy of the list does she have it again a blink becky was not reluctant to confirm this fact she wanted to point the collector toward darina because darina would kill him so what is on that plane is an older version older but still dangerous to you if it fell into the wrong hands blink my hands for example blink behind him becky saw movement at the window pale faces pressed against the glass a gust of wind blew the door open and shapes appeared on the porch they poured into the house like smoke these thin spectral figures hollow men she had thought them a myth even though she had knowledge of matters equally strange then again it was hard for the living to confirm the existence of entities that only the dying could see only one thing confuses me becky said the collector who was the passenger that darina mentioned who was on that plane someone like you one of the backers should i start trying names becky managed to shake her head slightly this like the child she would not give him never mind said the collector im sure that it will all become clear in time a look of sorrow crossed his face and the soulless hollow men crowded around him in expectation of another joining their ranks tears welled up in beckys eyes she tried to speak her tongue beating weakly inside her ruined mouth like the flutterings of a trapped moth hush hush becky said the collector theres no more to say with the tip of his blade he lifted the simple gold chain from around her neck it had been given to her by her mother and was her favorite item of jewelry she watched as it was dropped into a pocket of his overcoat for my collection he said just so that you wont be forgotten the blade came close to her again you have been found wanting said the collector for your sins i adjudge your life and your soul to be forfeit goodbye becky and slowly almost tenderly he cut her throat ray wray was eating breakfast at marcys diner on oak street in portland he was also reading a copy of the portland press herald that someone had kindly left on the next table minus the sports section which annoyed ray wray more than somewhat it meant that he was forced to make do with the main paper and the local section and in general ray wray couldnt give a damn what happened in portland just because he was a native of the state didnt mean he had to like its principal city or show any interest in its activities ray came from the county and county folk regarded portland with suspicion ray did like marcys diner though he liked the food and the fact that it was comfortable without being kitsch and played wblm the classic rock station he liked the fact that it opened early and closed early and only accepted cash this suited ray wray down to the ground as he had a credit history so bad that he sometimes wondered if he was personally responsible for the collapse of the economy ray wray owed more money than greece and whatever cash he had was usually in his pocket he got by but only just this was his first week back in maine since taking a city bullet down in new york eight months on rikers island for felonious assault arising out of a disagreement with a korean restaurateur who believed that ray should have complained about the quality of the food on his plate before hed eaten it all instead of after and disputed rays right to refuse payment for the meal there had been some shouting and a little pushing and somehow the little korean lost his balance and banged his head on the corner of a table and the next thing ray knew there were koreans all over him closely followed by cops and the judiciary of the state of new york the sentence didnt bother ray much he was flat broke anyway and had been facing the prospect of living on the streets but the food really had been terrible in that korean place and hed only eaten it because he was so damn hungry now here he was back in maine with the hunting season almost over and he hadnt picked up any guide work worth talking about hed been forced to stay in portland where an exgirlfriend had an apartment off congress not to mention a tolerant attitude to ray wray shed made it clear to him that her tolerance only extended so far though and didnt involve him sharing her bed or staying in her place beyond the end of november she worked as a nurse over at maine medical so she wasnt around much which suited him just fine there was a reason why she was his exgirlfriend and he remembered what it was after only a couple of days in her company he couldnt stand her was why his inability to secure guide work rankled he was no longer a registered guide but he knew those woods as well as anyone and he still had contacts in some of the lodges and hunting stores hed spent time in the warden service before his temper and his drinking combined to have him thrown out on his ass as that combination is wont to do to a man in any walk of life ray had learned his lesson he didnt drink so much anymore but it was hard to shake off his history in a state like maine where everyone knew everyone else and bad reputations spread like a virus it didnt matter that ray was a changed man his penchant for socking people who crossed him largely excepted or that he stuck to beer now not liquor coffee had replaced whiskey as his main vice so that he was rarely without a togo cup in his hand and lived off cheap refills at starbucks there was a starbucks at the corner of oak and congress and ray planned to head over there and fill up once he was done with breakfast hed take a seat while no one was looking stay there for a while then go to the counter and claim that this was his second coffee not his first nobody ever contradicted him say what you liked about starbucks but you couldnt fault their staff for their manners still ray didnt care for those little breakfast sandwiches they sold for the same price he could get a good meal at marcys which was why he was sitting there now flicking through his free copy of the portland press herald while chewing on eggsmeared toast and wondering just what a man had to do to get a decent break in this life he was about to toss the paper aside when an article on the front page below the fold caught his eye he had left the front page until last owing to the halfassed way the papers previous reader had reassembled it and because ray tended toward the view that whatever was in newspapers had already happened and therefore there wasnt much point in worrying about what they contained or getting all het up about the order in which you flicked through the pages except of course that sometimes you ended up reading the second half of articles before the first which could be confusing if you were dumb ray wray was a lot of things undisciplined an addictive personality borderline autistic in his capacity to absorb and recall information but dumb wasnt one of them he got into trouble because he was too clever not because he wasnt clever enough he was angry at the world because he had never managed to find his place in it so he lashed out whenever the opportunity arose and accepted the resulting bruises with equanimity he carefully balanced the newspaper against a ketchup bottle and read and reread the front page article his smile widening as he did so it was the first piece of good news hed received in a long time and he felt that it might presage an upturn in his fortunes one perry reed who was facing charges of possession of a class a drug with intent to supply possession of child pornography as well as being wanted for questioning in new york in connection with his possible involvement in at least two murders had been refused bail by a county superior court and would remain in custody until his trial began more to the point someone had burned perrys pieceofshit auto dealership to the ground along with one of perrys titty bars this was a cause for celebration ray wray raised his coffee cup in salute sometimes the world just upped and fucked over the right guy so this was how ray wray come to hate perry reed the car was a piece of shit ray knew it perry reed knew it even the fucking squirrels collecting nuts in the parkland behind the lot knew it the mitsubishi gallant looked like it had been used to transport troops in iraq it had so much dust in the engine and it smelled of dog food but it wasnt as if automobile salesmen were lining up to offer someone like ray wray a credit option hed been told that if he couldnt get perry reed to cut him a deal he might as well resign himself to being the white guy on the bus for the rest of his life so he convinced his buddy erik to drive him up to perry reeds place and see what could be negotiated erik had dropped him off at the entrance to the lot and headed on to montreal where he was cutting his own deal for some prime weed that ray planned to help him offload the downside was that if ray couldnt get perry reed to sell him a car hed have a long walk home he would also miss out on a sweet deal with erik since pretty much a prerequisite for distributing drugs was the ability to get them from point a to point b and ray couldnt see himself getting far on a bicycle with five pounds of cannabis in the basket securing a set of wheels was therefore a priority if he wasnt to live in penury for the foreseeable future perry reed came out personally to deal with ray which might have been flattering if reed hadnt been such a nasty fat stocking of shit brown eyes brown hair yellow shirt brown suit brown shoes brown cigar and a brown nose just as long as he thought that he might be able sell you something ray shook his hand and had to resist the urge to wipe it clean on his jeans he knew perry reeds reputation the man would fuck a keyhole if there wasnt already a key in it and it was common knowledge that he had only avoided trial way back on charges of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor because the statute of limitations had been exceeded hence his nickname of perry the pervert but even a pervert had his uses and in desperate times people learned to hold their noses when dealing with lowlifes like perry reed it turned out that perry reed had yet to meet a man who didnt meet his lessthanstrict customer criteria which could be summarized as having a down payment and a pulse although for a time it seemed that ray wray might be the man who made even perry the pervert think twice about cutting a deal ray had scraped together to put down but reed wanted up front and another per month for the next four years ray calculated the interest rate at somewhere around twenty percent which was mob vig but he needed that car so ray dug around for the emergency money that hed been holding back and put a further on the table and reed adjusted the monthly payment up to a pop over four years which made rays eyes water but the deal was struck and ray drove off the lot in a car that coughed and spluttered and stank but somehow kept moving ray figured that with his share of the proceeds from the sale of the weed he could more than cover his payments for the months to come with enough left over to reinvest with erik in the wholesale end of the business he had no intention of stiffing perry reed though reed might have looked like a turd squeezed out by a dying dog but he had a reputation as a man not to be crossed people who welched on deals with perry reed ended up with broken bones and worse as a goodwill gesture reed had thrown in free admission to the titty bar next to the lot which ray had heard that he owned as well and a free beer to help make the time pass more pleasurably generally speaking ray wasnt a man for titty bars the last time hed been in one which must have been a decade before hed found himself sharing bar space with his former geography teacher and ray had been depressed for a week after the club didnt exactly promise good times resembling as it did the kind of pillbox the germans had defended during the dday landings but a free beer was a free beer so ray pulled up at the side of bar presented his admission ticket to the bored brunette at the door and headed inside he tried to ignore the uric stink the damp carpets and what he was pretty sure was the odor of stale male seed but it wasnt easy ray wasnt a fussy guy but he thought the club might be as low as a man could sink without licking up spilled beer from cracks in a floor the reason for the clubs name became apparent to ray as soon as he looked up at the small mirrored stage being the combined age of the two women who were currently doing their best to make pole dancing as unerotic an activity as possible halfadozen men were scattered around the place trying not to catch one anothers eye or catch anything else given the standards of hygiene in the place ray took a seat at the bar and asked for a sam adams but the bartender told him his voucher was only good for a pbr or a miller high life ray settled for the pbr although not happily hed never much cared for drinking beer out of cans perry give you this the bartender asked holding the beer voucher between his fingertips like it might be infected yeah you buy a car from him mitsubishi gallant the ohtwo yeah jesus the bartender poured perry a bourbon from the well and put the can of pbr beside it you can have the liquor on me go ahead drown your sorrows perry did he knew hed been screwed but he didnt have much choice he watched the women gyrate and wondered how often the poles got cleaned he wouldnt have touched those poles without a hazmat suit the bartender came back to him you want i could arrange for you to spend some time with one of those ladies in a private booth no thanks said ray i already got a grandmother the bartender tried to look offended on their part but couldnt put his heart into it better not let them hear you say that theyll kick your ass they can barely lift their legs said ray it wasnt for the poles theyd fall over this time the bartender scowled you want another drink or what not unless its free said ray then get your ass out of here my pleasure said ray and tell your sisters to find another job it turned out that the mitsubishi ran pretty good better than ray had anticipated it got him home without any problems and he spent the weekend working on it clearing the worst of the crap out of the engine and getting the smell out of the upholstery he was all set to help erik move the weed when he learned that erik had been arrested by the mounties when he was five miles shy of the border and he and the weed were now likely to be staying in canada for the foreseeable future so ray picked up some bar work and moved some stolen goods and managed to keep up his payments to perry reed for four months always paying in person and in cash before he started to fall behind when the calls began coming in from reeds people he tried to ignore them but when they started getting insistent he decided that continuing to ignore them was inadvisable if he wanted to remain in the state of maine with his limbs intact he called the lot and asked to speak to reed and the big man duly came on the line and they discussed the matter like gentlemen reed said he would find a way to make the loan more affordable for ray although it might mean spreading out the payments over two or three more years reed told him that hed have new loan papers drawn up and ray could just come by and sign them so everything was above board figuring that he had nothing to lose ray drove up to the lot parked outside the main showroom and headed in to add his initials to whatever needed to be signed as he took a seat to wait for reed a guy in overalls told him that he had to move the car as they were expecting a new consignment of vehicles and ray had tossed him the keys without thinking that was the last ray saw of his car it had just been repossessed when he asked to see perry reed he was told that mr reed wasnt around when he started to get loud four mechanics dumped him on the sidewalk rays mistake was to believe that perry reed was in the used car business but he wasnt perry reed was in the finance business and the more defaults there were the better his business was he could simply sell the same car over again at the same extortionate rates to people who needed a car and couldnt convince anyone else to sell them one it was at that point that ray wray decided he was going to burn perry reeds lot to the ground along with his titty bar but then he got sidetracked by the promise of a job in new york that never materialized and he ate a bad korean meal and copped the city bullet and by the time he got around to taking care of perry reed someone else had done it for him which was good as it saved ray the trouble of planning and committing a major act of arson and bad because it denied ray the pleasure of planning and committing a major act of arson the diners door opened and rays buddy joe dahl strolled in ordered a coffee and joined ray at his table joe dahl was a big guy in his forties which was how he got away with wearing a yankees cap in maine you needed to be big to wear a yankees cap this far north without someone taking it from your head and maybe trying to take your head from your shoulders along with it dahl claimed that he wore the cap in memory of his late mother who came from staten island but ray knew that was bullshit dahl wore the cap because he was ornery and peculiar and because he lived for those times when someone tried to knock it from his head you see this shit asked ray yeah i saw it said joe id like to shake the hand of the guy that did it first piece of good news ive had all week i got some more said joe as his coffee arrived i found you a job yeah what is it guide work hunting joe looked away he seemed uneasy scared even kind of were going to look for something in the north woods something what kind of something i think its an airplane i made one small detour before i headed north to maine i drove into boston and found the headquarters of pryor investments in beacon hill it occupied a relatively modestlooking but still absurdly expensive brownstone not far from the charlesmgh tstation there was no sign of activity and i saw nobody pass in or out of the building while i was parked nearby so far epstein had been unable to find out anything of note about the company apart from one small detail the name of pryor investments was on documents relating to the formation of a c body called the american league for equality and freedom and one davis tate now deceased had been the principal benefactor of the funds channeled through the organization it was a small thread but a thread nonetheless still now wasnt the time to pull it and see what would unravel i drove away from beacon hill and it was only as i passed the pryor building that i saw the camera systems discreetly mounted in the shadows on the wall their watchful glass eyes taking in the details of the street and sidewalks surrounding it the meeting with eldritch had not been particularly satisfying but then meetings with lawyers rarely were i had no great desire to renew acquaintance with the man who sometimes called himself kushiel but was mostly referred to as the collector neither did i want him running loose indulging his taste for divine justice or his own interpretation of it by killing anyone who appeared on his copy of the list particularly if i was among them i did not trust the collector enough to imagine that if he found my behavior wanting he would not consider consigning me to his personal retinue of the damned we had been uneasy allies in the past but i had no illusions about him i believed that he like epstein had concerns about my nature and the collector tended to err on the side of caution in such matters he surgically excised polluted tissue but there was no reason to believe that the collector knew about the plane in the great north woods and it was important to secure it before any hint of its existence reached him better that epstein should have the list that harlan vetters had seen than have it fall into the hands of the collector for epstein was essentially a good man yet even about epstein i had doubts i didnt know enough about those who worked alongside him beyond the fact that the younger ones liked waving guns around to be certain of their capacity for selfrestraint epstein appeared to be a moderating influence but he kept much about himself hidden it seemed obvious to say it but knowing the identity of your enemies was the first step toward defeating them with their names in his possession epstein could begin the task of monitoring their activities and undermining them when necessary he would also learn if there were traitors among those whom he had previously trusted although the list would inevitably be incomplete dating as it did only to some period prior to the crash of the plane who knew how many others had been added to it since then nevertheless obtaining it would be a start but was there not the possibility that in some cases epstein and his people might choose to act as the collector had done and remove from play those on the list who were deemed most threatening those were my thoughts as i drove up to scarborough an alternative music station playing in the background on sirius radio some camper van beethoven a doubleplay of the minutemen which lasted about three hundred seconds in total including the djs intro and even a little dream syndicate but i felt compelled to run for cover when some bright spark requested diamanda galas and in a rush of blood to the head the dj obliged when i was in my early twenties and getting to know the kind of girls who would ask you back to their place for coffee and mean it although with the promise of more than coffee at a later date if you didnt turn out to be a freak i learned that a surefire way to understand a woman as with a man was to flick through her record collection if she didnt have one then you could largely give up on her right there because a woman who didnt listen to any music at all didnt have a soul or anything worthy of the name if she was loaded up on english alternative music like the smiths or the cure she was probably trying a little too hard to be miserable but it wasnt likely to be terminal if she was a fan of hair metal like kiss and poison and mötley crüe you were faced with the dilemma of staying with her for a while because she might put out or ditching her before you were forced to listen to any of her music but if she had diamanda galas on her racks maybe alongside nico lydia lunch and ute lemper for the quieter moments then it was time to make your excuses and leave before she dumped powdered sedatives in your coffee and you woke up chained in a basement with the girl in question standing over you holding a kitchen knife in one hand a creepy doll in the other and screaming the name of some guy youd never met but apparently resembled in psychic form so i ditched the alternative station switched to the cd player and listened instead to the only album ever released by winter hours which was more tuneful and less frightening and put me in a better mood as i drove home as i parked outside my house i saw that i had missed a call from epstein i returned it from my office phone the death of davis tate was on epsteins mind do you believe it was the work of this man the collector he asked when i heard that he was shot i thought it might have been your people the collector usually prefers to work with a blade what convinced you otherwise it seems that there were cuts on tates body hed lost part of an earlobe whoever killed him also took his watch but left his wallet untouched the collector likes to acquire souvenirs from his victims in that sense hes pretty much your common or garden serial killer its the added selfrighteousness that makes him special you spoke to the old lawyer i did i got the feeling that barbara kelly sent him the same version of the list that you received with your name on it so it seems his secretary was very certain that i was going to get whatever was coming to me are you concerned a little i like my throat the way it is and i dont need a smile cut in it but i think the collector has the same doubts that you had about me he wont act until hes certain and in the meantime he will continue working through the names on that list he will bring their protectors down upon himself i imagine thats what hes hoping epsteins voice grew muffled for a minute he had covered the receiver with his hand as he spoke to someone else nearby when he came back on the line he sounded excited i have a theory about that plane he said the date of the newspaper in the cockpit is close to the date when a canadian businessman named arthur wildon disappeared the name seemed familiar to me but i couldnt place him it was left to epstein to place it for me the wildon twins natasha and elizabeth eight years old were kidnapped in he told me a ransom was demanded and secretly paid a simple dropoff on a remote road the driver instructed not to stop or the girls would be killed the location of the twins was subsequently communicated by way of a note left by the shore of the quebec river its position marked with a rock painted black and white the note claimed that the girls were being kept at a cabin outside saintsophie but when the rescue team got to the cabin it was empty or appeared to be five minutes after they arrived arthur wildon received a telephone call the caller who was male gave him a single instruction dig and so they dug the cabin had a dirt floor the girls had been bound and gagged then buried alive together in a hole three feet deep the medical examiner estimated that they had been dead for days probably killed within hours of their abduction i held the phone away from my ear for a moment as though its proximity were somehow causing me pain i recalled closing a trapdoor on a young girl in an underground cell so that her cries would not alert the man who had put her there and i heard again the terror in her voice as she had begged me not to leave her in the dark she had been fortunate though because she had been found most of them were never found or not alive but the man involved in that case had been a serial abuser and killer of young women with no intention of ever releasing them kidnappers were different through louis i had once met a man named steven tolles who was a hostage negotiator employed by a leading private security firm tolles was a sign of life expert called in to consult on cases of which not even the fbi or the police ever had any awareness his primary concern was to ensure the safe return of the victim and he was very good at his job it was for others to catch the perpetrators although tolles in his debriefing of victims often drew from them crucial clues as to the identities of those involved stray smells and sounds could be as useful as momentary glimpses of houses woods and fields sometimes even more so from tolles i learned that the instances of murder in kidnapping cases were comparatively rare kidnapping was a crime of greed those who committed it wanted to pick up the ransom and vanish murder upped the ante and ensured that the victims relatives would involve law enforcement in the aftermath there was a very good reason why most instances of kidnapping never made the news it was because terms were negotiated and ransoms paid without anyone beyond the family and the private negotiators employed by them ever learning anything about what had occurred and that frequently included the police and the feds but if what epstein was telling me was true then the people responsible for abducting arthur wildons daughters and there must have been more than one kidnapper for two young girls would be difficult for one person to handle had deliberately set out to extort money when there was no hope of the victims ever being returned alive indeed it appeared that there had never been any intention to release them unharmed given that they were killed so soon after their abduction it was possible that something might have gone wrong of course one or both of the girls might have seen the faces of those involved or caught sight of something guaranteed to give away the identity of a captor in which case their kidnappers could have felt that they had no option but to kill them in order to protect themselves but to bury them alive that was an appalling death to visit on two children regardless of the ruthlessness of the kidnappers there was sadism involved here which suggested that the money was almost an afterthought or a secondary motivation and i wondered if arthur wildon or someone close to him was being punished for some unspecified offense through the dark suffocation of two little girls mr parker said epstein are you still there yes im here sorry i was distracted by my own thoughts is there anything that you feel compelled to share i was considering what the principal motive for the kidnapping might have been money isnt that what kidnapping is always about but why kill the girls to leave no witnesses or to torment wildon and his family epstein exhaled deeply then said i knew him wildon yes not well but we shared certain interests any that you feel compelled to share wildon believed in fallen angels just as i do and just as you do too i wasnt sure that was entirely true despite anything to the contrary i may have said to marielle vetters most people who talked about angels seemed to picture a fusion between tinkerbell and a crossing guard and i remained reluctant to put that name to the entities terrestrial or otherwise that i had encountered after all none of them had sprouted wings not yet but he also believed that they were infecting others continued epstein acquiring influence through threats promises blackmail for what purpose ah there wildon and i differed he talked of the end times of the last days a peculiar mix of millenarianism and apocalyptic christianity neither of which i found personally or professionally appealing and what do you believe rabbi i asked isnt it time that you shared that with me truly he laughed a hollow rattle i believe that somewhere on earth or below it an entity waits its been there for a long long time either by its own will or more likely by the will of another trapped perhaps even slumbering but waiting nonetheless the worst of these others these creatures formed in its image are seeking it they have always been seeking it always looking and while they search they prepare for its coming that is what i believe mr parker and i admit that it may well be proof of my madness does that satisfy you i didnt answer instead i asked are they close to finding it closer than ever before so many of them emerging in recent years so much hunting and killing they are like ants set in motion by the queens pheromones and you are involved mr parker you know this to be true you feel it i stared out of my window at the shapes of trees and the silver channels of the marshes the pale specter of myself floating against them did wildon own a plane no but a man named douglas ampell did ampell went missing around the same time that wildon disappeared ampell and wildon were acquainted and wildon used ampells aviation services on an occasional basis did ampell file a flight record in july none so if that was ampells plane and wildon was on it then where was he heading i think he was trying to reach me there had been some contact between us in the months before his disappearance he had followed up on hundreds of rumors and was convinced that there was a record in existence of those who had been corrupted he believed that he was close to finding it and it seems that he might have done so i think he was bringing that list with him when the plane went down and not just the list who was the passenger who was cuffed to a chair in that plane wildon was obsessed with finding those responsible for killing his daughters said epstein it destroyed his marriage and his business but he became convinced that he was drawing closer to them perhaps on that plane was the man who killed wildons daughters a man or something worse than a man you must find that plane mr parker find the plane darina flores learned of the deaths of becky phipps and davis tate shortly before she and the boy moved against marielle vetters darina had been concerned when she had not immediately heard back directly from phipps they had been searching for a definite clue to the location of the plane for so long yet hours went by with no contact darina always cautious in such matters was reluctant to disseminate what she had learned any wider than was necessary but preparations needed to be made while she debated what further action to take she received confirmation from joe dahl that he was ready to move when she was dahl had been hers for a long time she and her agents ensured that the inveterate gambler was permitted to fall deeper and deeper into debt until everything he owned was effectively theirs and then they let him keep it all his car his house what little of his business remained all of it they simply held onto the paper on his debt and waited it didnt take long dahl was an addict and he had not yet been cured of his addiction on the evening that he tried to use his car as security on a cash loan so he could hit scarborough downs darina paid him a visit and joe dahl was cured of his gambling vice forever darina had kept him in her pocket ever since ready to be used once they had solid information about the plane unlike the others she had not gone on random searches of the woods chasing wisps of information that dissipated like morning mist in the sunlight she considered such ventures unwise they risked drawing attention to the object of the search and she believed that it was better to wait until a solid lead emerged true the plane and its secrets represented a ticking device that could go off at the moment of discovery but while it remained lost its danger was potential not actual and even the list itself was meaningless unless it found its way into the right hands the mystery of the passenger and his fate troubled her more he shared her nature and he was lost grady vetters gagged with a scarf and bound with plastic ties woke just as daylight was fading he was bleary but his head began to clear when he took in the boy staring at him from the couch and the woman cleaning her gun at the kitchen table and he smelled teddy gattle even through the closed bedroom door darina could see vetters weighing his options she preferred to keep him alive for as long as possible but if he proved difficult she would be forced to do without him darina slipped the magazine into the little colt and approached grady he tried to squeeze himself further into the corner of the room and said something unintelligible through the gag darina didnt care to hear what it was so she left the scarf in place were going to pay a visit to marielle she said if you do as we tell you youll live if you dont you and your sister will die do you understand grady didnt respond immediately he was no fool she could tell that he didnt believe her it didnt matter this was all a game and he would play his part until an alternative offered itself the easiest way to ensure that he stayed alive and remained compliant was to make him want to stay alive by not doing anything foolish and so he would do as he was told until they reached marielles house if he died before they got there he could be of no help to his sister alive he could always hope but there was no hope not really darinas entire existence was predicated on that belief grady breathed in deeply against the scarf and his nose wrinkled as he again took in the smell of teddy gattle if its any consolation it wasnt an act of betrayal on his part said darina he thought that he was helping you if you wouldnt use your knowledge of the plane to make some money then he would do it on your behalf i think he loved you she smiled he must have since he died for you grady glared at her the muscles in his arms tensed as he tried to force the plastic ties apart his knees were drawn up to his chest and she could see him preparing to gather his strength to spring at her perhaps she had misjudged him she pointed the gun at his face said dont and his body relaxed darina kept him under the gun as the boy advanced the syringe once again in his hand not so much this time she warned just enough to keep him compliant she waited until gradys eyes grew heavy again before making two more calls the first was to marielle vetters house to ensure that she was home when a woman answered the phone darina hung up the second call she made more reluctantly not simply because she preferred becky phipps to be her primary point of contact but because the backers did not like to be drawn into such matters it was important to them that they should not be linked to acts of blood it was why they used companies offshore bank accounts proxies but phipps always called back within an hour always day or night and so darina dialed the number of the one that she thought of as the principal backer darina was not frightened of him she was frightened of very little to do with men and women although she found their capacity for selfdestruction disturbing but she was always careful around this backer he was so like herself and her kind that sometimes she wondered if he was really human at all but she could detect no trace of otherness about him nevertheless there was a difference to him and she had never been able to penetrate his veneer and discover what lay beneath it he answered the phone on the second ring the number was in the possession of only a handful of individuals and used only when the seriousness of the situation warranted it hello darina he said its been a long time but i know why youre calling thus it was that darina learned of how becky and davis had met their ends becky had sent out a warning before she fled but darinas call had gone to her home number on the assumption that she would still be recuperating a minor lapse on beckys part and understandable if she was running for her life the collector had never moved against them in this way before oh they knew that he suspected their existence but the backers had hidden themselves well and darina and the others were comfortable in the shadows darina understood then that barbara kelly had lied to her before she died she had admitted to reaching out to the lawyer eldritch and the old jew but she had assured darina that she had offered only the promise of material and not the material itself even when darina took out her left eye as punishment for what she had done to her own sight and threatened to leave her blind by cutting out the right as well still kelly denied that she had taken more than the first faltering footsteps toward repentance but the collector could not have targeted davis tate without the list on the other hand kelly would not have handed over the entire list to their enemies it was her only bargaining tool she would have tempted them with part of it certainly no more than a page or two a page to the jew epstein perhaps and a page to the collector and his handler just as the collector had never declared outright war upon them prevented from doing so by his own caution and their cleverness they too had kept their distance from him his was a minor crusade for the most part a picking off of the vicious and the damned although his victims had been growing in importance in recent years the possibility of a strike against him had been mooted but as with her ambivalence toward the principal backer the collector presented a problem what was he exactly what motivated him he seemed to have knowledge of matters known only to darina and her fallen brethren and to share their comfort with the darkness but he was an unknown quantity so far the advantages of removing him from the board had been outweighed by the risk of precipitating a violent reaction whether from the collector himself if he survived such an attack or from his allies and darina had heard rumors about a detective one who had crossed paths with those like her although he remained of little concern to her selfishness and viciousness were the curse of her breed so much so that many of them had forgotten their true purpose on this earth so lost were they to wrath and sorrow at all that they had sacrificed in their fall from grace even brightwell had been driven by his own urges his desire to unite the two halves of the being he worshiped and he was among the best and oldest of them when he had briefly blinked out of existence his spirit separating from its host she had experienced the pain of it so strongly that she had called out to him willing him to come to her she had felt his presence near to her straining to remain close and she had found a man that night and in this strangers act of insemination brightwell had been reborn inside her but a crucial element was missing aspects of his true nature had manifested themselves early almost as soon as he could walk but he seemed to have no memory of how his old form had been taken from him and with that came his silence he was traumatized she supposed but she could as yet find no way to break down the wall that kept him from truly becoming himself once more she watched the boy now as the backer spoke the backer sounded worried as well he might his final words left it to darina to take action against those who were moving against them the death of becky phipps had tipped the balance against the collector and his fate now lay in darinas hands but the plane was the priority the plane the list and the passenger and his fate she could not allow herself to be distracted not now she flipped through the names in her head for darina required no list she had disputed the need for its existence right from the start but human evil seemed to have a desire to record to order it was she guessed a function of mortality even the worst among them consciously or not wanted their deeds to be remembered something of that need to record had infected her kind so darina went to work and the order was given to wipe their enemies from the face of the earth and while darina conspired in his destruction the collector paid a visit to a church in connecticut the final service of the day had concluded and the last of the congregation had trailed out into the evening the collector looked kindly upon them they simply worshiped a different aspect of the same god when the last of them had gone he watched as the priest said goodbye to the sacristan at the back of the church and the two men separated the sacristan drove away while the priest walked through the church grounds and used a key to unlock a gate in the wall behind it was a garden and his home the priest saw the collector approach while the gate was still open hello he said can i help you he had a faint irish accent altered by his years in the united states a security light on the wall beside him illuminated his face he was a middleaged man with a full head of hair but no sign of gray instead the light caught unnatural tints father said the collector im sorry to disturb you but i wish to make a confession the priest looked at his watch i was about to go to dinner i take confession every morning after ten oclock mass if you were to come back then id be happy to listen its a matter of some urgency father said the collector i fear for a soul the curious formulation of the statement passed the priest by oh well i suppose that youd better come in he said he held the gate open and the collector entered the garden it was carefully arranged as a series of concentric circles shrubs and hedges alternating with cobbled paths and winter flowering plants adding color to it all between a pair of elegant box trees stood a long stone bench the priest sat at one end of it and indicated that the collector should sit at the other the priest took a stole from his pocket kissed the cross and placed the vestment around his neck he quickly whispered some prayers his eyes closed and then asked the collector how long it had been since his last confession a very long time replied the collector years decades the priest did not look happy to hear that perhaps he thought that the collector might feel compelled to unburden himself of a lifetime of sins and he would be forced to sit on the cold bench and listen until breakfast the priest made the decision to cut to the chase the collector suspected that this was not the orthodox approach but he did not object go on my son said the priest you said that you had a matter of some seriousness to discuss yes said the collector a killing that made the priests eyes open wider he started to look worried he didnt know the collector from adam and now here they were in the garden of the priests own home about to discuss the death of another human being youre talking about what an accidental death or something worse worse father much worse a murder it might be viewed that way i couldnt really say its a matter of perspective the priest had moved from being worried to actively concerned for his own safety he saw an out maybe you should come back tomorrow after all once youve had a chance to properly consider what it is that you wish to confess he said the collector looked puzzled done he said i havent done anything yet im going to do it i was wondering if i could have absolution in advance as it were im very busy i have a lot to fit into my days the priest stood either youre making fun of me or youre a troubled man he said whatever is the case i cant help you i want you to go now and think hard about yourself sit down priest said the collector if you dont go ill call the police the priest didnt even see the blade being drawn one moment the collectors hands were empty and the next there was a flash of light in his hands and the collector had risen the knife pressed hard against the soft flesh of the priests throat the priest heard the garden gate swing on its hinges his eyes moved to the right hoping to see someone enter someone who might help him but instead there were only deeper shadows moving they took the form of men in hats and dark clothing their long coats drifting behind them like smoke but that wasnt possible was it then the shapes became clearer and he could make out the pale features beneath the old fedoras the eyes and mouths nothing more than dark holes the skin around them wrinkled like old rotting fruit who are you said the priest as the shapes drew closer you betrayed her said the collector the priest was torn between listening to the collector and trying to believe what his eyes were seeing who i dont know what youre talking about barbara kelly they put you here to keep watch over her you befriended her and as she began to have doubts she shared with you what she planned to do becky phipps had told him as much the collector liked to think that he had encouraged her to make a full and frank confession no you dont understand oh but i do said the collector i understand perfectly and you did it for money you didnt even have an interesting motive you just wanted a nicer car better vacations more cash in your wallet what a dull way in which to damn yourself the priest was barely listening he was terrified by the figures that surrounded him drifting along the paths of his garden circling him but drawing no closer what are those things they were once men like you now they are hollow their souls are lost as yours will soon be but you will not join their ranks the faithless priest has no flock the priest raised his hands imploringly please let me explain ive been a good man a good shepherd i can still make recompense for what ive done the priests hands moved fast but not fast enough his nails reached for the the collectors eyes raking at them but the collector pushed the priest away and in the same movement flicked the blade at his throat a small wound opened and blood began to pour like wine from a tipped goblet the priest fell to his knees before his judge who reached down and removed the stole from the priests shoulders then folded it into one of his own pockets he lit a cigarette and removed a metal canister from inside his coat you have been found wanting priest said the collector your soul is forfeit he sprayed the lighter fluid over the head and upper body of the kneeling man and took one long drag on his cigarette time to burn he said he flicked the cigarette at the priest and turned his back as the man ignited iv for the angel of death spread his wings on the blast and breathed in the face of the foe as he passed the destruction of sennacherib lord byron the lawyer eldritch turned the key and opened the door to the basement the light came on automatically a piece of electrical engineering that never ceased to give him pleasure and not a little relief for the truth was that eldritch was afraid of the dark after all he knew what the dark concealed he carefully made his way down the stairs one hand on the wooden banister rail the other trailing along the cool wall he kept a close watch on his footsteps taking each step slowly and firmly eldritch was no longer a young man in fact he could barely remember a time when he was other than he was now childhood was a dream early adulthood a blur the memories of another man somehow adopted as his own fragments of love and loss sepiatinted as though soaked in tea and faded by sunlight he reached the final step and let out an involuntary sigh of satisfaction another series of obstacles negotiated without incident his fragile bones still intact five years earlier he had stumbled on the sidewalk and broken his hip the first serious injury or illness of his senior years the damage had necessitated a full replacement and now he was acutely conscious of his own vulnerability his confidence had been badly shaken but more than the pain and the inconvenience of the long period of convalescence he remembered the dread of the anesthetic his unwillingness to surrender himself to the void his struggle against the fluids that coursed through his body when the anesthetist inserted the needle darkness shadows and morethanshadows he recalled his relief when he awoke in the recovery ward and his gratitude that he had almost no memory of what had occurred while he slept not in relation to the operation itself of course that was a separate purely physical reality a surrender of the body to the ministrations of the surgeon no the phantom images that returned with consciousness were of another realm of existence entirely the surgeon had told him that he would not dream but this was a lie there were always dreams remembered or unremembered and eldritch dreamed more than most if what he experienced when the need for rest overcame him could truly be termed dreams it was also why he slept less than most preferring a lowlevel lassitude to the torments of night and so he had returned to this world with pain in his lower body dulled greatly by the medication but still terrible to him a nurse with skin of alabaster translucence asking him how he felt assuring him that he was fine and all had gone well and he had tried to smile even as frayed threads of memories caught upon the splinters of another realm hands that was what he remembered hands with hooked claws for nails tugging at him as the anesthetic wore off trying to pull him down to the place in which they lay and above them the hollow men soulless wraiths burning with rage at what had been done to them by eldritch and his client desperate to see him punished just as they were being punished later once it was clear that the operation had been a complete success and he was out of danger the surgeon had admitted to eldritch that there had been a problem when the final stitches were being put in place strange he had said most patients emerged easily from the anesthetic as its effects wore off but for almost two minutes it had seemed as if eldritch were moving deeper into sleep and they had feared that he was about to lapse into a coma then in a startling reversal his heart rate had increased to such a degree that they thought he might be about to go into cardiac arrest you gave us quite a scare said the surgeon patting eldritch on the shoulder and his touch had caused the old lawyer to tense with unease for the pressure on his skin reminded him uncomfortably of those clawed fingers and throughout his period of recovery both inside and outside the hospital the collector had kept watch over him for eldritchs vulnerability was also his own and their existences were mutually dependent eldritch would wake to find the collector sitting in the soft light of the bedside lamp his fingers twitching uneasily his body temporarily deprived of the nicotine that seemed perpetually to fuel it the lawyer was never entirely sure how the collector managed to be omnipresent during those early days for the hospital so very private and so very expensive still had certain rules about the appropriateness of visiting times but in eldritchs experience people tended to avoid confrontations with the collector he trailed unease just as he trailed the stink and smoke of his cigarettes that smell how prevalent it was how insidious and how grateful they all should have been for it for the foul nicotine taint masked a different odor even without the cigarettes the collector brought with him the smell of the charnel house sometimes eldritch himself almost feared him the collector was entirely without mercy entirely committed to his mission in this world eldritch was still human enough to have doubts the collector was not there was no humanity left in him eldritch wondered if there ever had been he suspected that the collector had simply come into the world that way and his true nature had become more obvious over time how strange thought eldritch that a man should fear one to whom he was so closely bound a client a source of income a protector a son eldritch had come down to the basement for two reasons the first was to check the fusebox there had been two brief interruptions to the power supply that afternoon and such occurrences were always a source of concern there was so much information here so much knowledge and although it was well secured there would always be concerns about potential vulnerabilities eldritch opened the box and checked it by the beam of a flashlight but as far as he could tell all appeared to be well tomorrow though he would contact bowden who took care of such things for him eldritch trusted bowden his movements on the basement floor had triggered the next set of overhead lights illuminating shelf upon shelf of files some were so old that he was reluctant even to touch them for fear that they would crumble to dust but the necessity of reaching for them rarely arose for the most part these were the closed cases judgement had been passed and they had been found wanting someone had once pointed out to him a distinction real or imagined between judgement and judgment although to the old man it was largely a matter of preference the former having more heft and substantiality in his view judgment the man had said his voice booming in the confines of the parquetfloored washington hotel room refers to human justice but judgement with an e refers to the divine and he had leaned back and smiled in satisfaction his teeth perfect and white against the flawless ebony beauty of his skin his hands clasped upon his small belly hands with so much hidden blood on them that eldritch was convinced it might well show up under a combination of luminol and ultraviolet light before him lay a document detailing allegations of rape torture and mass murder a product of years of investigation by a group of men who were themselves now dead killed by this mans agents and in the fallen leaders eyes eldritch could see a similar fate being planned for him really eldritch had replied that is fascinating although my understanding is that the king james bible favors judgment this is not true said the man with the unalloyed confidence of the truly ignorant i tell you this so you will understand i will not be judged by a human court but by the lord god and he will smile upon me for what i was forced to do to his enemies they were animals they were bad men and women added eldritch and children were they all bad how unfortunate for them the man bristled i told you i do recognize or accept these allegations my enemies continue to spread lies about me to vilify me but i am not guilty of the accusations made against me if i were the international court of justice in the hague would have taken action against me but it has not this tells the world that i have no case to answer that was not entirely true the international court of justice was in the process of assembling a dossier on this man but its progress was being hampered by the ongoing deaths of crucial witnesses both outside the nation in which he had conducted a genocidal guerilla war for over a decade and within it where there were those now in power who had utilized this man and his forces for their own ends and would have preferred it if the more embarrassing details of the past were forgotten in the rush to embrace something like democracy even in the us there were politicians who had embraced this butcher this rapist as an ally in the fight against islamic terrorists he was in every way an embarrassment and a disgrace to his allies to his enemies and to the entire human race so you see mr eldritch i do not understand why you have chosen to believe the lies of these men and to accept them as clients what is this this civil case i do not know what this means he held up like a dead fish the sheaf of papers that eldritch had brought with him with its accounts of butchery and violation and its names of the dead i agreed to meet you because you told my assistant you had information that might be of use to me in these ongoing attacks on my character that you might be able to help me in my struggle against the blackening of my name instead you side with these bad men these fantastists how can this be of help to me uh how he was growing angry now but eldritch was not concerned if you were to admit your failings and your crimes then you might yet save yourself said eldritch save myself from what from damnation said eldritch the man looked at him in astonishment then began to giggle are you a preacher are you a man of god the giggles turned to laughter i am a man of god look he reached into his shirt and pulled out an ornate gold cross see i am a christian that is why i fought gods enemies in my country that is why your government gave me money and guns that is why men from the cia advised me on tactics we were all engaged in gods work now old man go with god before you make me mad and take your ridiculous papers with you eldritch stood the window before him looked down on the busy street below there the collector waited his black form like a smudge upon the glass thank you for your time said eldritch im sorry that i couldnt be of more help to you he passed the collector on the way out of the hotel but they did not look at each other the collector disappeared into a crowd of conference delegates and later that night the man of god in his high room learned for himself that there was no practical distinction between judgment and judgement his file now closed was somewhere in this basement eldritch could have placed a hand on it in an instant but there was no need his memory was perfect and anyway he was unlikely to be required to recite chapter and verse of the circumstances of the fallen leaders death not in this life rarely did he trouble courtrooms these days and he sometimes missed the cut and thrust of legal argument the pleasure that lay in winning a difficult case and the lessons to be learned by losing one at the same time he no longer needed to be concerned by the distinction between law and justice like every lawyer he had seen too many cases fail because justice was in the end subservient to the requirements of the law now he and the collector were in their way restoring the natural order in the most extreme of cases those from which any reasonable doubt had been excluded to the satisfaction of all but the law itself but there were some case files in the basement that were not closed they were those that eldritch chose to regard as inconclusive or difficult and for the most part no action had been taken against the individuals named within them the files had simply increased in girth as more and more details were added each another ounce of evidence that might yet tip the scales against those concerned one of these files concerned the detective charlie parker and the men who worked alongside him their files connected to his both figuratively and literally by means of two lengths of black ribbon fed through holes in the top and bottom of each green folder eldritch had long counseled that the files should remain as they were as mere records not indicators of an intention to pursue a case ultimately he believed that parker was engaged in the same struggle as they were even if he might not have wanted to accept that it was so the detectives colleagues and the ones named angel and louis in particular were more problematical especially the latter but eldritch was convinced that present actions could make up for past sins even if he had not yet managed to inculcate a similar faith in the collector while they might have differed in this crucial aspect common sense nevertheless dictated that parker and his acolytes should be left alone insofar as was practical to damn one would require damning all or else the survivors would avenge themselves upon everyone involved and neither age nor sex would be an impediment to their wrath but the question of parker had become increasingly complex for his name had been on the list sent to them by barbara kelly though with no indication of a reason for its presence parkers visit had been troubling to eldritch parker knew of the existence of the list and he knew that his name was on it probably because the old jew had shown it to him parker suspected too that eldritch and the collector had a copy of a similar list and by coming to eldritchs office he had been sending a warning to them both keep your distance from me i will not be one of your victims only certain conclusions could be drawn from this either parker knew why his name was on the list and his inclusion was therefore justified in which case he was secretly in league with everything against which they were fighting and was worthy of damnation or he did not know why his name was on it which opened up two further possibilities his own nature was compromised and he was polluted although the pollution had not yet manifested itself fully or someone possibly barbara kelly or others known to her had deliberately added his name to the list in the hope that it would cause his allies to turn against him thereby ridding his enemies of an increasingly dangerous thorn in their side without risk to themselves but kelly was now dead killed it seemed by her own kind her medical records accessed by eldritch through his network of informants confirmed that her body had been riddled with cancer she was dying and her efforts at repentance appeared genuine if ultimately doomed in a sense it was apt that lymphoma should have been eating away at her for she herself had been responsible for a steady ceaseless corruption insidiously metastasizing life after life soul after soul one act of defiance born out of fear and desperation would not have been enough to save her whatever she might have hoped but then eldritch was not god and could not pretend to have any understanding of his works he examined each case on its own merits but simply from a lawyers viewpoint only the collector touched by something that might have been the divine and transformed into a channel between realms claimed to have an insight into a consciousness infinitely more complex than his own and if he was to be believed infinitely more merciless eldritch did not doubt for a moment the veracity of the collectors claims eldritch had seen too much and knew too much to try to fool himself into believing that some conventional reason one unconnected to the existence of a divinity and its opposite could be found for all that he had learned or witnessed and the collector had insights into the matter that were far deeper than eldritchs but now the collector had instructed him to make parkers file active even as he began killing the others on the list and for the first time eldritch found himself in serious conflict with his son son as he stood before parkers file his fingers hovering above it like the talons of an ancient predatory bird a weariness swept over eldritch it was easier to think of his son as another as kushiel as the collector eldritch had long ceased wondering if some part of him or his wife had been responsible for the creation of this murderous presence in their lives no whatever had colonized his sons spirit had come from outside themselves a second dwelled within him and the two were now indivisible indistinguishable from each other but parker was right his sons bloodlust was growing his desire to collect tokens of lives ended becoming ever greater and his actions with regard to the list represented their latest and most disturbing manifestation there was insufficient proof of guilt to act against most of these people some had probably been corrupted without even knowing it while others might simply have accepted money or a piece of information that gave them an advantage over others a small victory against the system which although wrong in itself was not enough to render them worthy of condemnation if a single sin was enough to invite damnation then the whole human race would roast yet great evils were frequently the product of the slow accumulation of such small sins and eldritch knew that when the time came for the people on the list to keep their side of the bargain they had made the nature of the harm they would be required to do would be great they were viruses incubating according to the collectors view they were cancer cells lying dormant should they not be eradicated or removed before they could begin to destroy healthy bodies his son thought so but to eldritch these were not viruses not cancers these were people flawed compromised individuals and thus no different from the great mass of humanity in doing this thought eldritch in killing without just cause we may well damn ourselves he removed parkers file heavy because of the weight of the others it carried with it heavy with the weight of their actions both right and wrong and slipped it under his arm the lights went off behind him as he left the basement and he ascended the stairs with more confidence than he had descended rarely did he take files home with him but this was an exceptional case he wanted to reexamine parkers file checking every detail for one that he might previously have overlooked one that would give him confirmation of the mans true aims he waited in the hall while his secretary locked the office doors above and watched as she lumbered down the stairs the omnipresent cigarette in her mouth since the death of his wife nearly three decades before she had been the sole constant presence in his life the collector flitting in and out of it as necessity required like a poisonous moth without this woman he would be lost he needed her and at his age need and love were merely the same suitor wearing different coats inside the front door was a locked alarm panel he put parkers file on a shelf opened the panel and checked the exterior camera on the small embedded screen there was no one nearby he nodded at the woman and she opened the door while he activated the alarm there was a tensecond delay once it began to beep which was sometimes barely sufficient for him to get out and lock the door but on this occasion he managed with a second or two to spare he winced as they crossed the street to his car your hip she said those basement stairs he said they kill me you should have let me go down what do you know about fuses more than you which was true even if he chose not to admit it well i needed he swore hed left parkers file on the shelf beside the alarm panel the file he finished he lifted his empty hands to her and she rolled her eyes ill go back she said you stay here thank you he said and leaned against the car she looked at him with concern are you sure that its nothing more serious im fine im fine just a little tired but she knew otherwise he had no secrets from her not about the collector not about parker not about anything he was worried she could tell lets go for dinner she said well talk about it the blue ox where else my treat then you dont pay me enough for it to be mine which was both true and untrue he paid her a lot but he could never pay her enough she waited until a car passed then walked back to the office her fingers fumbling in her huge purse for her keys eldritch looked around so empty the streets tonight barely a soul in sight except for themselves his skin prickled a man was approaching his hands buried deep in the folds of a parka jacket his head down eldritch gripped the key fob of his car the index finger of his left hand poised over the alarm button while his right drifted to the pocket of his overcoat that contained the small derringer he thought that the man might have glanced at him as he went by but if so it was the slightest shift of his eyes nothing more and his head barely moved then he was gone and he did not look back eldritch relaxed the collector had made him so wary that he occasionally tipped over into paranoia justifiable paranoia perhaps but paranoia nonetheless by now his secretary had opened the office door he heard the alarm beep for a time before going silent as she briefly deactivated it he could not see her in the gloom of the hallway there was movement to his right the man in the parka had stopped at the corner and was staring back at him eldritch thought that he might have shouted something but whatever he said was lost in the sound of the explosion that blew out the windows of eldritchs building deafening him even as it sent plumes of fire and smoke shooting through the gaps showering him with glass that ripped into his face and body the wave of heat lifting him up and throwing him to the ground nobody came to help him the man in the parka was already gone eldritch crawled to his knees he was temporarily deaf and he hurt all over for a moment he thought that he was hallucinating as a figure appeared in the doorway of the building silhouetted against smoke and fire slowly the woman walked out and even from this distance eldritch could see the dazed look on her face her hair was smoldering she put her hand to the top of her head and patted out the smoke she stumbled slightly on the curb but kept walking and she seemed to smile at him as she saw that he was safe and he found himself smiling back at her in relief then she turned round to take in the sight of the burning building and he saw that the back of her head was devoid of hair a deep terrible wound gleaming wetly in her exposed skull her spine showed red and white through her ruined back and he glimpsed the muscles exposed in her thighs and calves through the shreds of her dress she stayed upright just a moment longer before collapsing facedown upon the road her body unmoving by then eldritch was on his feet running and weeping but he could not reach her in time to say goodbye while the lawyer knelt and wept the rabbi epstein prepared to catch a flight to toronto epstein had managed to get in touch with eleanor wildon the widow of arthur wildon and she had agreed to meet with him at her apartment in toronto where she had moved following her husbands disappearance she had never remarried and had not sought to have her husband declared legally deceased this had led to speculation in certain quarters that she had some knowledge of where he might be some said he had fled to avoid his financial obligations others that he had committed suicide because of the depth of his money problems a situation exacerbated by his grief he had lost focus on his business interests following the deaths of his daughters driven instead to find the person or persons responsible and those to whom he had entrusted the care of his principal company and his investments had mismanaged both with the result that when he disappeared he was worth only a fraction of what he once had been and the canadian revenue service was about to hit him with a massive tax bill tonya wildon was due to leave for a short trip to europe the following evening her nephew was being married in london she told epstein and she was booked on air canadas pm flight to heathrow rather than wait until the following morning epstein decided to catch american airlines pm flight out of laguardia and spend the night at the hazelton hotel in toronto adiv and liat would see him safely on to the plane at toronto he would be met by another associate a former major in the canadian armed forces who now specialized in personal protection details while epstein rarely traveled without security he was more conscious than ever of his safety and that of the men and women who worked alongside him the existence of the list offered them a chance to strike at previously hidden enemies but the actions of the collector had endangered them all davis tate was dead and his producer becky phipps was reported to be missing which led epstein to believe that she was also being hunted by the collector or had already suffered at his hands it was possible that barbara kelly had died before revealing to her tormentors the names of those to whom she had sent the partial list even so those who had ordered her death might have suspected that epstein would be among the likeliest of recipients and possibly the lawyer too by starting to work through the list the collector would have confirmed those suspicions if the collector and the lawyer had received a communication from barbara kelly then their enemies would surmise that epstein almost certainly had received one as well eldritch and epstein men of similar name of similar age and with similar aims yet they had never met epstein had once suggested a meeting and had received in return a handwritten note from the lawyer politely declining his approach it had made epstein feel like a spurned suitor now the lawyers pet killer was running loose assuming eldritch ever had any real control over the man to begin with which epstein doubted perhaps it was as well that they had never sat across a table from each other for they were not really the same epstein did no mans bidding while the lawyer was the collectors creature adiv driving his own car collected liat and epstein from the latters home on park slope they were waiting to turn at the corner of th and carroll when a young man dressed in jeans and an overlong sweater and wearing worn sneakers threw a carton of milk at the car smearing the windshield his skin was sallow but unhealthy as though he were suffering from jaundice spying epsteins clothing and adivs yarmulka he then began kicking the side of the car while screaming fucking jews fucking jews youre leeches the whole countrys going to hell because of you epstein placed a hand on adivs shoulder to restrain him ignore him he said it doesnt matter and that might have been the end of it had not the young man struck the windshield a hard blow with something in his right hand it appeared to be a pool ball and it cracked the glass instantly furious adiv got out of the car slamming his door shut behind him a shoving match ensued with the sallowskinned man seemingly trying to get around adiv not away from him it ended when the sallowskinned man spat in adivs face and tried to run away leave him adiv ordered epstein but adivs blood was up this had been a bad week for him and he now had an outlet for his anger he started running but his prey was too fast for him and adivs legs still ached from the long walk through the jersey pine barrens he still managed to grab the strap of the running mans battered satchel which he was holding in his hand instead of wearing over his shoulder the bag came away so suddenly that adiv fell backwards landing painfully on his coccyx the young man paused and looked back as if debating whether it was worth trying to retrieve his satchel and possibly take a beating for his troubles then decided to sacrifice it jew bastard he shouted once more before disappearing into the night i have your bag asshole cried adiv you lose you prick he got to his feet and dusted himself off his butt ached he limped painfully back to the car liat had opened the passenger door on the far side and stood on the road watching him he could see the gun in her hand i got his bag said adiv raising the satchel liat shook her head no no she mouthed her eyes were wide she waved her arms drop it adiv drop it and run liat pulled epstein from the car and began dragging him to safety keeping her body between epstein and adiv and the satchel understanding dawned on adiv he looked down at the satchel it was made of soft brown leather and only one of the buckles on the front was tied adiv lifted the unsecured end of the bag and peered inside there was a package wrapped in aluminum foil like sandwiches and beside it a thermos flask i think its okay said adiv i think and then he was gone i was anxious to head north to speak with marielle vetters again once i had done that i could start figuring out how to get to the plane for now though my daughter sam and her mother rachel were in portland for an evening which was good unfortunately so was jeff rachels current squeeze which was bad how did i dislike jeff well let me count the ways i disliked jeff because he was so rightwing he made mussolini look like che guevara because his hair and his teeth were too perfect especially for a man who was old enough to have started losing most of the former and some of the latter because he called me big guy and fella whenever we met but couldnt seem to bring himself to use my actual name oh and because he was sleeping with my exgirlfriend and every exboyfriend secretly wants his former partner to get herself to a nunnery immediately after their separation there to rue the day she ever let such a treasure slip through her fingers and hold herself celibate forever after on the grounds that having had the best there really was no call to settle for an inferior product okay so mostly i didnt like jeff because of that last part but the other reasons were pretty important too i wanted to see sam more often and rachel and i were agreed that this was a good thing i had tried to hold my daughter at a distance for too long perhaps out of some not entirely misguided effort to keep her safe but i didnt really want things to be that way and she didnt either now we saw each other at least once or twice every month which was both better and worse than before better because i was spending time with her but worse because i missed her more when she wasnt there this night though was a bonus jeff was speaking at a dinner event at the holiday inn in portland and rachel had used the trip as an opportunity to let sam spend an extra night hanging out with me while she played the supportive partner to whatever selfserving bullshit jeff was spouting about the banking system according to the portland phoenix his speech was entitled the return to lighttouch regulation making america wealthy again the phoenixs columnist had been so stricken by apoplexy over this that the paper had given him an extra half page to vent his spleen and it still hadnt been enough he would probably have filled the entire edition if jeffs appearance in the city hadnt given him an opportunity to tackle the object of his rage in person it might almost have been worth attending the event just to hear what the phoenix reporter had to say to jeff if only it wouldnt have required listening to jeff too i took sam for pizza down at the flatbread pizza company on the portland waterfront where she got to create intricate crayon drawings on the paper tablecloth and then over to beals icecream parlor for a sundae to finish angel and louis joined us as we were finishing our meal at flatbread and the four of us walked up to beals together sam tended to be slightly in awe of angel and louis on the rare occasions she got to meet them she was comfortable with angel who made her laugh but she had also developed a certain shy fondness for louis she hadnt yet managed to convince him to hold her hand but he seemed to tolerate the way that she clutched the belt of his overcoat deep down i suspected that he even liked it so we presented quite the picture walking into beals and it was to the servers credit that she recovered herself so quickly when it came time to serve us i ordered onescoop sundaes for us all except for angel who wanted two scoops the fu louis began to say before he remembered where he was and the fact that there was a small child holding onto his belt and gazing up at him adoringly i mean he went on struggling to find a way of expressing his disapproval without the use of obscenities maybe one scoop might be uh sufficient for your uh needs you saying im fat said angel if you aint you can see fat from where youre at you may not be able to see your feet but you can see fat sam giggled youre fat she told angel fat fat thats rude sam i said uncle angel isnt fat hes just big boned go fu angel too realized where he was and with whom im not fat honey he told sam this is all muscle and your daddy and uncle louis are just jealous because they have to watch what they eat while you and i can order any sundae we want and we only get prettier sam looked dubious but wasnt about to argue with someone who said that she was getting prettier you still want the twoscoop asked the server yeah i still want the twoscoop said angel then added quietly as louis swept by him trailing sam but make it with sugarfree ice cream and hold the cherry the server went to work beals was quiet with only one other table occupied it was almost the end of beals season shortly it would close for the winter maybe i should have had something with sugar said angel the flavors are better and you have the fat to worry about anyway yeah thanks for reminding me im making sacrifices and i still feel guilty soon youll have no pleasures left at all i said yeah i remember pleasures said angel i think its been so long as you get older they say that certain physical needs grow less urgent who the fu sam tapped him on the thigh and handed him a napkin for when you mess up she said then trotted off to join louis at a table thank you honey said angel before returning to the subject in hand minus the swearing i mean who are you calling old older i corrected our sundaes came and we carried them over to where louis and sam were waiting like that makes it better said angel fat old you want to add anything else before i go throw myself in the sea dont do it said louis why because youd miss me no cause youd just float bob like a cork until hypothermia took you or you got eaten by sharks no said sam not eaten its okay sam angel assured her i wont get eaten am i right uncle louis sam looked to louis for confirmation of this thats right said louis he wont get eaten sharks mouth wouldnt be big enough to fit him in sam seemed content with this even if angel wasnt so she started work on her sundae and forgot about everything else im substituting ice cream for affection whispered angel glumly in deference to sims presence ill be watching the view next and considering male hrt itll never get that bad i said hrt watching the view what are you gay i used to be im a sexless being now thats good i didnt like thinking of you as a sexual being it was kind of gross what gay sex no just you and any form of sex angel thought about this i guess it kind of was he concluded behind us at the other occupied table a couple of loudmouths were discussing a mutual acquaintance in borderline obscene terms one of them was wearing a yankees cap even though his accent was down east in a town like portland a yankees cap invited harsh words at best but being a mainer and wearing one was an act of treachery that made benedict arnold and alger hiss seem harmless by comparison the men moved from borderline to outright obscenity they smelled of beer what they were doing in an icecream parlor i couldnt quite figure i leaned over hey guys could you keep it clean i got a kid here they ignored me and kept talking if anything the volume increased and they managed to squeeze in a few more swear words separating syllables where necessary to accommodate them guys i asked you nicely i said its after nine said the older of the two your kid should be at home its an icecream parlor said angel you ought to watch your fucking language was that helpful i said to him i dont think so sorry i returned my attention to the men nearby i wont ask you again i told them and what are you going to do if we dont asked the same man he was tall and broad and his features had an alcoholic blur to them his friend whose back had been to us turned around and his eyes widened slightly at the sight of louis he looked more sober than his friend and smarter too my daddy will shoot you said sam she made a little gun with her fingers pointed it at the man who had spoken and said bang i looked at her good grief and then ill shoot you too said louis he grinned and the temperature dropped bang louis added for effect he too had made a gun with his fingers he aimed it at the big mans groin bang he repeated at his chest bang closing one eye to focus at his head both men visibly blanched not a yankees fan explained angel go find a bar fellas i said and they left i like bullying people said angel when i grow up im going to do nothing else all day long bang said sam theyre dead angel louis and i exchanged glances angel shrugged she must get it from her mother sam was staying with me that night when she had finished brushing her teeth and her two rag dolls were tucked up to her satisfaction alongside her i sat on the edge of the bed and touched her cheek you warm enough yes you feel cold thats because its cold outside but im not cold im warm inside it sounded plausible look i think it might be best if you didnt tell your mom about what happened tonight about the pizza why no the pizzas fine i mean what happened after when we went for ice cream you mean about the two men yes what part the part about you saying that i would shoot them you cant talk like that to strangers honey you cant talk like that to anyone its not just rude itll get daddy into trouble with mommy absolutely with mommy but also maybe with the people you say it to they wont like it thats how fights start she considered this but you have a gun yes i try not to shoot people with it though then why do you have it because sometimes in my job i have to show it to people to make them behave themselves god i felt like a spokesman for the nra but you have shot people with your gun i heard mommy say this was new when did you hear that when she was talking to jeff about you sam were you listening when you shouldnt have been listening sam squirmed she knew that she had said too much she shook her head it was a accident an accident a spokesman for the society for better english too it seemed still it gave me time to think look thats true sam but i didnt like doing it and those people left me with no other choice id be happy if i never had to do it again and i hope that i dont okay okay she said were they bad people yes they were very bad people i watched her face carefully she was building up to something skirting the subject warily like a dog circling a snake uncertain of whether it were dead and harmless or alive and capable of striking was one of them the man who made jennifer and her mommy dead she always called them that jennifer and her mommy although she knew susans name she felt uncomfortable using it susan was an adult unfamiliar to her a grownup and grownups had names that began with mr or mrs aunt or uncle grandma or grandpa sam had chosen to define her as jennifers mommy because jennifer had been a little girl just like her but a little girl who had died the subject held a kind of awful fascination for her not simply because jennifer had been my child and by extension a halfsister to sam but because sam did not know of any other children who had died it seemed somehow impossible to her that a child could die that anyone she knew of could die but this one had sam understood a little of what had happened to my wife and my daughter she had picked up nuggets of information gleaned from other overheard conversations and hidden them away examining them in solitude trying to understand their meaning and their value and only recently had she revealed her conclusions to her mother and me she knew that something awful had happened to them that one man had been responsible and that man was now dead we had tried to deal with it as carefully yet as honestly as possible our concern was that she might fear for her own safety but she did not seem to make that particular connection her focus was entirely on jennifer and to a lesser extent her mommy she was she told us sad for them and sad for me i speaking of jennifer and susan with her was difficult for me at the best of times but this was new and dangerous territory i think he would have hurt me if i had not i said at last and he would have kept on hurting other people too he gave me no choice i swallowed the taste of the lie even if it was a lie of omission he gave me no choice but neither did i give him a choice i had wanted it that way so does that make it all right although sam was a precocious unusual child that was still a very adult question one that plumbed murky moral depths even her tone was adult this was not coming from sam there was the voice of another under her own is that one of your questions sam again a shake of the head it was what jeff asked mommy when they were talking about how you shot people and what did mommy say i asked despite myself and i was ashamed she said that you always tried to do the right thing i bet jeff didnt like that after that i had to go pee said sam good well no more listening to conversations that arent your business all right and no more talking about shooting people we clear yes i wont tell mommy shed just worry and you dont want to get daddy into trouble no she frowned can i tell her about uncle angel saying a bad word i thought about it sure why not i went downstairs where angel and louis had opened a bottle of red wine make yourselves at home angel waved a glass at me you want some no im good louis poured sipped tasted made a face shrugged resignedly and filled two glasses hey said angel sams not going to tell rachel i swore at those guys is she no i said youre in the clear he looked relieved thank christ i wouldnt want to get in trouble with rachel while they drank i called marielle vetters the phone rang four times then went to the machine i left a short message to tell her that id be heading up there to talk with her the next day and she should go over all that her father had told her in case shed forgotten to share with me anything that might be useful i asked her to give ernie scollay a nudge too on the offchance that he might recall something that his brother had said i kept the message deliberately vague just in case she had company or someone else like marielles brother happened to hear it after an hour of conversation i went to my room but not before looking in on the strange beautiful empathic child fast asleep in her bed and i felt that i had never loved her more or understood her less marielle heard the phone ring at the same time as her doorbell for a moment she was torn between the two but clearly the phone could wait while the doorbell could not you want me to see who it is asked ernie scollay he had come over earlier seemingly still troubled by the amount they had revealed down at the bar in portland but marielle knew that he was also lonely a shy man and one who did not care much for either of the local bars he had formed a bond with marielles father following his brothers suicide and when harlan vetters in turn had died he had transferred his affection for the father to marielle she did not mind apart from being kind if cautious company ernie was good at fixing anything from a stubborn hinge to a car engine and marielles old car needed more attention than most her brothers best friend teddy gattle had frequently offered to look after it for her at no charge but marielle knew better than to take him up on it ever since they were teenagers teddy had eyed her with a mixture of adoration and barely concealed lust according to her brother teddy had cried more than her own mother had on the day marielle got married and he had celebrated her divorce with a drunk that lasted three days no even if ernie scollay had not been around she would have paid money she could little afford to maintain her car would in fact have set the car on fire and walked to her two jobs rather than accept a favor from teddy gattle marielle stepped out of the kitchen and looked down the hall her brothers familiar rangy figure stood outside although she could not see him clearly because the exterior light wasnt working odd she thought i only changed that bulb last week there must be a fault with the wiring another job for ernie she supposed its okay its just grady she said hed probably come to apologize she figured about time too hed had enough of teddy gattles hospitality and realized what a jerk hed been for bringing that vacant space in female form into her house shed been tempted to burn the sheets once grady and whateverhername was had departed the skank ivy was that what grady had said holly what an idiot what a pair of idiots but she loved her brother for all his flaws and now they were all that was left of the family two failures he in art she in marriage both in life she didnt want to lose him again even when absent whether at college or trying to make it as an artist in new york and finally lost to his addictions for a time a part of him had always been with her they had been so close as children and although he was her little brother he had done his best to take care of her when her marriage finally ended he had trudged back to falls end to console her and they had spent a couple of days drinking and smoking and talking and she had felt better for it but then he had drifted away again and when he came back their father was already dying the machine picked up the call and she heard a voice that was kind of familiar but she wasnt quick enough to catch the callers name the doorbell rang for a second time coming she said im coming god grady you could have a little patience you know she opened the door and the light from the lamp in the hall caught his face he looked sorrowful and scared he also looked doped up he was swaying and having trouble staying focussed on her ah grady for crying out loud she said no no you jerk you stupid grady flew at her she reacted fast enough to step back one hand instinctively outstretched to ward him off but he was too big and heavy for her his weight carried them both to the floor and her head bounced hard on the boards jesus grady she cried trying to push him from her even as he struggled to find his own footing two people appeared in the doorway a woman and a child even in the soft lamplight marielle could tell that the womans face was damaged and the child a boy had a strange ugly swelling at his neck and bruising to his nose and eyes in the womans right hand was a gun who are you said marielle what do you want but as the woman advanced marielle knew who she was although she had never met her marielle had heard her described she was no longer beautiful not with her burned glistening skin but enough of her former looks remained for marielle to imagine her as she once had been drawing men to her buying drinks in return for stories of lost planes her left eye was a different color from her right most of the color had gone from it and it reminded marielle of a raw shellfish dotted with tabasco sauce ernie scollay appeared in the hall he took a single look at the woman and the boy then turned to run darina flores shot twice him in the back ernie fell on his face and tried to crawl to safety but the third shot stilled him forever darina and the boy stepped inside and closed the door behind them the boy locked it and pulled down the blind cutting them off from the world by now marielle had managed to get out from under grady she knelt before the intruders afraid to move blood began to spread from under ernie scollay flowing across the boards and dripping between the gaps into the darkness below grady lay against the wall and she could see him trying to overcome whatever drug was in his system im sorry he said i couldnt while darina and the boy watched unspeaking she went to her brother and held him and she hardly felt the needle as it entered her arm they did not inject her with as much of the drug as they had given to her brother they wanted her to be coherent but to present no risk to them they were a woman and a child in a room with two grown adults and darina had to ensure that there was no risk of either marielle or grady vetters fighting back once again they secured their captives hands behind them with plastic ties just to be certain darina poured the boy a glass of milk and gave him a freshly baked cookie from a tray beside the stove he sat at the dining table and nibbled the cookie eating around the edges his small teeth following the line of the frosting examining his efforts as he went just like a normal boy marielle lay supine on the couch with a cushion beneath her head she was watching all that was taking place seeking any possible advantage but there was none her eyes were just slightly heavy her responses dulled but she was still thinking clearly if slowly grady vetters sat in an armchair beside the tv his eyes barely open a string of spittle connecting his chest to his chin he glimpsed his own reflection in the mirror on the opposite wall and wiped his chin on his shirt the effort seemed to bring him more clarity he sat up a little straighter and tried to find a smile for his sister but she took no reassurance from it darina pulled up a chair beside marielle she held the gun loosely in her right hand and with her left brushed some stray strands of hair from marielles face are you comfortable she asked what did you inject me with her words were not remotely slurred darina wondered if they shouldnt have given her a bigger dose just something to help you relax i dont want you to be uncomfortable or too frightened behind darina marielle could see ernie scollays outstretched arm the rest of his body was hidden by the wall darina saw her looking at it and called to the boy move that would you its distracting the boy put down the cookie wiped the crumbs from his hands and went into the hallway through the alcove beside the kitchen there was a dragging sound as ernie scollays feet were lifted and his body began to move the boy was stronger than he looked and the arm disappeared better said darina he was just an old man said marielle you didnt have to kill him even old men can run said darina old men can talk old men can call the police so yes we did have to kill him but there doesnt have to be any more killing if you answer my questions and answer them honestly ill spare you and your brother thats a basement under the stairs isnt it yes thats where well leave you then ill put water and food in bowls and you can feed yourselves like dogs but youll be alive we wont be in town for long a day or two at most the more you share with me the easier our task will be and the sooner well be gone i give you my word marielle shook her head in dismissal weve seen you said marielle we know who you are we saw you kill ernie saw you shoot him in the back grady stirred in his chair again they killed teddy too he said she killed teddy marielle flinched poor sad pathetic teddy gattle he might have been irritating and besotted with her but he had been loyal to her brother and he had meant no harm to anyone he was the one who led us here said darina if it makes his loss any easier to bear it was teddy gattle who alerted us to the truth about your father and the plane marielle turned on her brother you told teddy teddy gattle couldnt hold a secret for longer than it took to draw another breath he was a human sieve im sorry was all grady could mumble again but my offer stands said darina i know you dont believe me but i have no interest in killing you once that plane is found and i get what i want well disappear and you can tell the police anything you like you can describe us down to the last hair and it wont matter well be long gone and we hide ourselves well i wont even look like myself any more she pointed a finger at her ruined face would you want to stay like this no marielle they wont find us youll live and so will we all you have to do is talk i know a lot already but i want to hear it all from you as well every word every detail that your father shared with you anything that might enable me to find that airplane and dont lie to me if you lie there will be consequences both for you and for your brother the boy returned to the room marielle saw that he had trailed a line of bloody footprints across the carpet he was carrying a backpack illustrated with figures from one of those japanese animation movies that everyone else seemed to like but for which she didnt much care all bigeyed children and mouths that didnt match the english dialog he unzipped the pack and drew from it a pair of pliers a heavy boxcutter and three pocket knives of varying lengths he laid the tools out neatly on the dining room table then pulled up a chair and sat his feet dangling a good six inches above the floor now marielle why dont you begin with the first time you heard your father mention that airplane marielle told the story then told it again midway between the two tellings darina injected her a second time and her mind grew foggier she had trouble keeping details straight in her head and at one point she must have said something wrong or contradicted herself because grady screamed and when she got him in focus she saw that the bottom of his face was bloody and she realized that the boy had sliced off the tip of gradys nose she started to cry but darina slapped her hard which made her stop she was careful after that to tell the truth because what did it matter it was only a plane her father was dead paul scollay was dead and his brother ernie too teddy gattle was gone only she and grady remained who else have you told asked darina nobody the old man said darina who was he what was he doing here paul scollays brother he knew already paul told him who else did you tell no one i dont believe you no one she repeated i told no one her mind was clearing not much but just enough she wanted to live she wanted grady to live but if they didnt if the woman was lying then she wanted revenge for her for her brother for ernie and teddy for everyone this woman and that terrible child had ever hurt the detective would find them he would find them and he would punish them nobody she repeated i swear it grady screamed again but she closed her eyes and her ears to it im sorry she thought but you shouldnt have told you just shouldnt have told deep darkness without and darkness within illuminated only by a lamp on the small table beneath the mirror grady was moaning softly the boy had sliced vertically through his lips with the boxcutter blade but they had stopped bleeding at least for as long as grady could keep from moving his mouth they were still alive though and darina flores had eventually stopped her questions they had ceased when marielle had come up with one detail one small halfremembered piece of information from her fathers final days a fort her father had mentioned passing a fort as they returned home with the money she hadnt told the detective about it because she hadnt trusted him enough not then now she wished that shed told him all as she watched darina use a laptop to check maps and histories in an effort to confirm the truth of what she had just heard marielle must have slept for a time she couldnt remember the main lights in the room being turned off or a blanket being laid over her to keep her warm she was having trouble breathing she tried to alter her position but it didnt help the boy was staring at her his pale washedout features repelled her his thinning hair and his swollen throat he looked like an old man shrunk to the size of a child shed dreamed of him she realized and the memory of it made her feel ashamed in the dream the boy had been trying to kiss her no it was not quite a kiss his mouth had fixed upon hers like a lamprey attaching itself to prey and he had begun sucking pulling the breath from her lungs drawing the life from her but he hadnt managed to do it because she was still here still breathing however poorly just a dream but as she thought that she felt the tenderness of her lips and there was a foul taste in her mouth as though she had eaten a piece of meat that was past its best the boy smiled at her and she began to retch drily get her some water said darina but she did not look up from the screen the boy went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of water she was reluctant to accept it hated having him anywhere near her but better some brief proximity to him than to reject the water and keep that taste in her mouth so she drank and the water dribbled down her chin and fell coldly upon her chest at last when she could drink no more she pulled her head back the boy removed the glass from her lips but remained standing over her watching marielles back ached she shifted on the couch so that she was sitting upright a blinking red light caught her eye hidden before by the table it was a red number blinking on the telephone answering machine she remembered the earlier call and the voice that had sounded so familiar it had been the detectives voice she turned her head away too quickly the boy frowned he looked over his shoulder more water said marielle please do as she asks said darina give her more water but the boy ignored them both he put the glass on the dining room table and approached the answering machine he put his head to one side like an animal faced with an unfamiliar object one pale finger reached out and hovered uncertainly above the play button please said marielle again darina glanced up from her screen what are you doing she said to the boy this work is important if she wants more water then give her more water just shut her up the boy stepped away from the machine he lowered his hand marielle sank back against the arm of the sofa she drew in an inadequate shuddering breath and closed her eyes there was a single beep from the other end of the room and a voice began to speak deep and male hi marielle this is charlie parker i just wanted to let you know the rest of the message was lost in a scream of rage and pain unlike any that marielle had heard before made more awful by the fact that it came from a child the boy screamed a second time his back arched his neck straining so far back that it seemed as though his spine must break or the swelling on his throat erupt in a shower of blood and pus darina rose to her feet the laptop falling to the floor and even over the screaming marielle could hear the voice of the detective telling her that he was coming up to talk with her that he just had one or two more questions to ask her and ernie there was a buzzing in the room even grady immersed in his own misery heard it his head moved trying to find the source of the sound the house grew colder as though someone had opened a door but the air that came through was not filled with the smell of trees and grass but with smoke an insect flew across marielles line of sight she shrank away from it instinctively but it came back buzzing a foot from her face even in the dim light she could see the wasps yellow and black striped body and the curve of its venomous abdomen she hated wasps especially those that lived this late into the year she drew up her knees to her chest and tried to use her feet to flip the blanket at it but now there was a second insect and a third the room began to fill with them and even in her fear she could not understand how there were no nests nearby and how could so many have survived still the boy screamed and suddenly grady was screaming too his voice joining with that of the boy and her brothers bisected lips burst with the effort and the sound of pain was added to his fright for gradys had been a cry of fear at first the mirror the wasps were pouring out of the mirror it had ceased to be a reflective surface or so it appeared to marielle and had instead been transformed into a framed hole in the wall the dying wasps once trapped behind it were now free but that was a supporting wall it was solid concrete not hollow and the mirror was just a mirror nothing could pass through it it was simply glass she felt a wasp land on her cheek and begin crawling toward her eye she shook her head and blew at it it buzzed away angrily then returned its stinger brushed her skin and she prepared for the pain but it did not come the wasp departed and the others went with it the little swarm returning to the mirror where they buzzed and roiled in a circular motion forming a cloud that took on the dimensions of a head with two dark waspless holes for eyes and another larger slit for a mouth a face of wasps that stared out at them from the mirror and its rage was the wasps rage and it vented its fury through them the wasp mouth moved forming words that marielle could not hear and the boys screams ceased darina clasped him to her the back of his head against her breasts and he shuddered in her embrace grady too stopped screaming the only sound in the room was the boys sobbing breaths and the buzzing from the mirror darina kissed the top of the boys head and laid her cheek on his pale scalp her eyes found marielle staring at her and marielle could see that darina was both smiling and crying he remembers said darina hes back now hes mine again my brightwell but you shouldnt have lied you shouldnt have told us lies the boy stepped away from her he wiped his eyes and walked to the mirror he stood before the face of wasps and he spoke to it in a language that marielle did not recognize and it spoke back to him he stayed that way until the buzzing stopped and one by one the wasps began to fall to the floor where they crawled sluggishly for a time before dying leaving only the boy staring at his own reflection grady vetters had curled in upon himself he was weeping and shaking and marielle knew that something had snapped inside him when she called his name he did not look at her and his eyes were those of a stranger he has so many forms said darina to marielle so many names she was pointing to the mirror he who waits behind the glass the upsidedown man the god of wasps the boy found a sheet of paper in his bag on one side was a drawing of a truck but the other side was blank he began to write on it with a crayon when he was done he handed the sheet of paper to darina and she read what was written there before folding the page and placing it in her pocket she then spoke one word parker the boy advanced on marielle and the sense of an old mind trapped in a younger body was stronger than ever his lamprey mouth opened and a pale tongue flicked at his lips darina laid a hand upon his shoulder and he stopped his face inches from marielles no she said the boy looked up at her questioningly he tried to say something but the words just came out as a pair of harsh croaks like the cawings of a young crow we promised said darina i promised the boy stepped away from her he went to the table and began packing his tools in his childs bag it was time to leave darina stood over marielle you lied to me she said you should have told me about the detective i could declare our bargain void and kill you for it marielle waited nothing she could say would make any difference now but perhaps because of your lie something special has been restored to us do you know what your detective once did no he killed the being that you see here she pointed at the boy he stilled his great spirit for a time i dont understand said marielle no but parker will when we confront him i promised that i would let you and your brother live and ill keep my word we always keep our word the boy went searching in his bag again and came out with his metal case of syringes he filled one from a small glass bottle of clear liquid that marielle had not seen before no more please said marielle this is different said darina but dont worry it wont hurt marielle watched as the boy injected grady for the last time her brother did not react to the needle or to the boys presence his gaze was directed inward but within seconds his eyes had closed and his chin fell upon his chest the boy refilled the syringe from the glass bottle when he was done the vessel was empty he dropped it in his bag and approached marielle its actrapid said darina injectable insulin marielle made her move her knees were still drawn up to her chest her feet flat on the couch she launched herself at darina but the woman was too fast and marielle caught her only a glancing blow before she landed hard on the floor and then the boy was on top of her the needle was biting and the world was filling with shadows youll sleep she heard darina say youll sleep for a very long time the massive dose flooded marielles system and her mind began to descend into coma eldritch woke in a hospital bed and thought i have dreamed this dream before a bed a small clean room the pinging of a machine nearby the sharp chemical odor of antiseptic and beneath it all that it was meant to hide and the clawed fingers pulled at him trying to keep him forever in the darkness he lifted his arm and felt a tug as the intravenous drip caught on the sheet he reached for it and a hand closed gently but firmly upon his arm no let me said the voice and he smelled that familiar scent of fire and nicotine and he knew that his son had come to him not the collector but his son for the collector was never so gentle his voice sounded slightly muffled eldritchs hearing had been damaged in the blast i dreamed said eldritch i dreamed that she was gone and then i dreamed that it was but a dream his face hurt he touched his fingers to it and explored the dressings on the worst of his wounds im sorry said his son i know what she meant to you eldritch looked to his left they had brought his possessions from the scene his wallet his keys his watch little things but the woman was gone what do you remember asked his son the power we lost power twice i think i went down to the basement but i could see nothing wrong and after that a man he passed me on the street and i was concerned but then he walked on and i let him go seconds before it happened i thought that he called to me i think he was trying to warn me of something but then there was an explosion and i did not see him again do you recall anything about him he was in his late forties or early fifties i think unshaven but not bearded perhaps six feet tall carrying some weight in which direction did he walk south south on the far side of the street yes did you tell the police this no i dont think i have spoken to anyone until now i held her in my arms but she was gone and i dont remember anything else the police will want to talk with you dont mention the man to them no the son took a cloth and wiped his fathers brow cooling it while avoiding the wounds how badly am i hurt asked eldritch cuts and bruises for the most part some concussion they want to keep you under observation for a few days though theyre concerned i have trouble hearing your voice my voice they dont sound right to me ill tell the doctors eldritch twisted on the bed there was a pain in his groin he looked beneath the sheet saw the catheter and groaned i know said his son it hurts ill tell them about that as well my mouth is dry his son took a plastic beaker of water from the bedside locker and held his fathers head while he drank the old mans skull felt fragile in his hand like an egg that could be broken with just a tensing of the fingers it was a miracle that he had survived minutes earlier and he would have been gone too ill come back later said the son do you need anything now it was his fathers hand that gripped his arm and his upper body rose from the bed so strong this old man parker came parker came and she died she was getting his file and then she died eldritch was tiring now and tears of grief squeezed themselves from the corners of his eyes he warned me warned you to back off he was afraid of the list he knew that his name was on it i had doubts so did you the woman phipps she told me something but his father was no longer listening the list he whispered the list i still have it said his son and in the soft dawn light filtering through the drapes he was altering in spirit and form and he was both son and other and i know where i can find the rest of it kill them said eldritch as he fell back on the bed kill them all he closed his eyes as his sons transformation was completed and it was the collector who left the room jeff and rachel came to pick up sam shortly after nine am she had been with angel and louis in the kitchen since before eight buttering toast and scrambling eggs and as a result i had to make her change her sweater before her mother saw her and blew a gasket jeff was driving a jaguar now from my office window angel and louis watched him pull up outside step from the car and take in the view of the scarborough marshes with the winter sun shining coldly upon them while rachel walked to the front door he acts like he owns them said angel or he made them himself said louis transference i said you know i dont like him so you dont like him either no i just dont like him said angel he got so much money whys he driving a jaguar asked louis jaguar depreciates faster than dollars from zimbabwe he drives it because he has so much money said angel how old is he old said louis very old said i ancient said angel its a wonder the man can stand without a stick the front door opened and rachel stepped into the hall and called hello were in here i said she came into the office and raised an eyebrow at the sight of the three of us standing there the welcoming committee just taking in the view said louis she saw where we were looking and at whom haha she said hes younger than i expected said angel really no hes real old rachel scowled at angel you keep saying things like that and you wont live to be his age i dont want to live to be his age said angel hes like methuselah in pastels who dresses like that anyway rachel to her credit seemed determined to fight jeffs corner hes playing golf later she said golf said louis it might have been possible to inject more contempt into four letters and one syllable but i couldnt see how yeah golf said rachel regular people play it its a sport golfs a sport he looked at angel angel shrugged maybe we didnt get the memo you guys are jerks you know that said rachel wheres my daughter i need to get her away from here before she contracts jerkdom too late said louis she got her fathers genes you guys are jerks you know i told him as i followed rachel the cool kids are being mean to us louis said to angel its homophobia said angel we ought to complain or write a show tune about it i left them to it hey called angel to my back does that mean we cant go to the prom in the hallway rachel was helping sam with her bag what happened to your nice new sweater asked rachel noting that sam was wearing the old one with holes that i kept in the house for her to use when we worked in the garden it got eggded said sam that figures said rachel did mean uncle louis and uncle angel throw them at you and call you names she glowered at me i didnt put them up to it i said they can be mean without my help uncle angel said a bad word said sam the one beginning with f there was a cry of shock from my office you promised she wouldnt tell that doesnt surprise me in the least said rachel she raised her voice and directed it to the office but im very disappointed in uncle angel sorry rachel checked that sam had both socks on that her underwear was the right way round and she had her toothbrush and her dolls okay say goodbye to your daddy and then go to the car she told sam sam hugged me and i held her tight bye daddy bye honey ill see you soon okay i love you i love you too she pulled away and i felt my heart break a little bye uncle angel who said a bad word she called bye said an embarrassed voice bye uncle louis who promised to shoot that man there was a long awkward pause before louis said bye and sam trotted out the door rachel gave me the hard eye what it was a misunderstanding i said he wouldnt really have shot him jesus she said can i ask why theyre here just a thing i said youre not going to tell me like i said and it was my turn to give her the hard eye its just a thing her temper was rising now angel and louiss ribbing of her sams sweater angels swearing and whatever the hell she thought louis had said all of it combined to work on her like heat on a pressure cooker then again she hadnt looked too happy when shed arrived an evening spent listening to jeff tell a crowd of wealthy folk that the banking collapse was all the fault of poor people for wanting a roof over their heads probably hadnt helped her cheeks were flushed she looked beautiful but telling her that wouldnt have helped the situation i hope you get shot in the fucking ass she said she opened the office door wide that goes for all of you then slammed the door shut behind her come out and say hi to jeff she ordered be polite and act like a normal guy i followed her outside sam was already sitting in the child seat in the back of the car she waved at me i waved back hey big guy said jeff he smiled whitely big guy what an asshole hey jeff i said we shook hands he did that thing he always did where he held on to my right hand for too long with his right hand while gripping my upper arm with his left hand and examined my face the way a surgeon will check out a patient who is seriously ill and doesnt appear to be getting any better and is thus an affront to his caregiver how you doing fella he asked fella it just got better and better rachel grinned maliciously it was revenge for earlier im good jeff and you fantastic he replied just fine speech went well last night it went down a storm there were people asking me to run for office wow somewhere in africa would be good i hear sudan needs ironing out or maybe somalia he looked puzzled and the smile faltered for a moment then recovered no here he said right of course there was a reporter who came along from the maine sunday telegram theyre going to report the details of my speech on the weekend thats great i said if they did the telegram wouldnt be getting my dollar seventyfive that sunday any other reporters there some guy from the phoenix but he was just hanging around to cause trouble asking awkward questions not accepting the party line ordinary people just dont understand deregulation said jeff they think it involves a state of lawlessness but it simply means allowing market forces to determine outcomes once government begins to interfere those outcomes start to become unpredictable and thats when the trouble starts even lighttouch regulation interferes with the natural running of the system we just want to make sure that it runs right so everyone can benefit so youre the good guys were the wealth generators youre certainly generating something jeff rachel intervened its time to go jeff i think youve been baited long enough she hugged me and kissed my cheek youll come see sam in a week or two yes thanks for letting her spend the night i appreciate it i didnt mean that part about you getting shot she said i know the other two maybe but not you she looked to the office window angel and louis were dimly visible through the blinds angel raised an arm as if thinking about waving then thought better of it jerks rachel said again as she got into the car but she was smiling as she said it jeff wasnt joining her though not yet instead he was looking to the road where a black cadillac cts coupe was slowing down before turning into my drive hey just in time he said in time for what i asked clearly someone wasnt being hit too hard by the recession but it was nobody i knew theres a man id like you to meet said jeff he drove up to hear my speech and he said he might take a look at some new development up on prouts neck while he was in town i told him id keep him company and he should look out for my car the cadillac pulled to a gentle halt behind jeffs car the man who climbed out looked a couple of years younger than jeff and glowed with good health and he couldnt have smelled more of money if he was printing off bills in the back of his car he had opted for a smart casual wardrobe tan pants a black rollneck sweater and a black mohair jacket he was balding but he hid it well by keeping his hair short and he wasnt carrying more than a couple of pounds of excess baggage around the waist he also had the decency to apologize for driving up to my home uninvited pointing out that the road took a sharp bend and he was concerned about causing an obstruction by leaving his car there i told him that it was okay even if i didnt think it was this guy made my skin prickle i hope im not intruding he said he waved at rachel and she waved back but she was careful not to look at me id like to introduce you to someone said jeff but he didnt make it clear to whom he was speaking until his next statement garrison pryor this is charlie parker pryor stretched out a hand and after only a slight hesitation i shook it garrison pryor as in pryor investments i said im surprised that youve heard of us he replied although he didnt sound surprised were not one of the big houses i get the wall street journal i lied really he said he raised an eyebrow know thy enemy perhaps excuse me it was an odd thing for him to have said its just that jeff has told me a little about you he continued from what i could gather you didnt strike me as a journal reader jeff thinks you may be a closet socialist compared to jeff most people are socialists pryor laughed displaying white teeth with slightly elongated canines and sharp incisors it was like being snarled at by a domesticated wolf how true ive been very interested to make your acquaintance for some time said pryor he maintained steady eye contact and his smile never wavered really i said id read a lot about you even before jeff entered your realm of acquaintance the men and women who youve hunted down well its just frightening that such people could have roamed free for so long its quite the service that youre doing for society from where i stood i could see rachel she still wasnt looking at me but she was biting her lower lip hard id seen that expression before it was as close as rachel got to a display of concern in public i didnt reply so pryor went on talking do you know what i find most interesting about you mr parker no i said i dont if im correct when a policeman uses his gun there are committees of inquiry and paperwork and sometimes even court cases but you a private operator seem to skate around such obstacles with ease how do you do that good luck i said and i only shoot the right people oh i think its more than that somebody must be looking out for you god perhaps although i was thinking along more terrestrial lines i try to keep the law on my side thats funny said pryor so do i and yet i dont believe were at all alike jeff who had been smiling at the start of our conversation wasnt smiling any longer he seemed to realize that this wasnt going the way he might have hoped whatever that was wed better be going garrison he said rachel and i have to get sam home so if youd like me to take a look at that development with you you know jeff i dont think that will be necessary maybe this part of the world isnt for me after all jeffs face fell faster than a busted elevator i guessed that hed been hoping to cut himself in on the deal by acting as a gobetween if pryor started throwing money around in maine if youre sure said jeff im very sure goodbye mr parker im sorry again for the intrusion but im happy to have made your acquaintance at last i look forward to reading more about you in the future likewise i said pryor said his goodbyes to jeff waved again to rachel but not to sam and reversed his car onto the road before heading west toward the interstate see you big guy said jeff to me as he prepared to get into his car i leaned in close to him jeff i said softly dont ever bring any of your friends onto my property again not without asking me first you understand he smiled thinly and nodded only sam waved at me again as they drove away angel and louis joined me on the driveway who was that asked angel his names garrison pryor i replied and i dont think hes one of the good guys within the hour i received two messages arising out of that encounter the first was a text from rachel it read only sorry the second was an email notifying me of a gift subscription to the wall street journal it came courtesy of pryor investments the late morning news bulletins detailed the death of a fiftyeightyearold woman in an explosion at a lawyers office in lynn massachusetts i knew nothing about it until then because my focus had been entirely on sam the woman who was not being named until relatives could be informed was said to be an employee of the business the principal thomas eldritch was described only as having suffered injuries in the blast and was being kept under observation as yet the police declined to speculate on the cause of the explosion as investigators remained at the scene but i knew the list i said to angel and louis once the collector killed tate they must have known that he had a copy either partial or full and because they couldnt get to him they tried to take out his lawyer said angel i thought about the chainsmoking woman who had guarded the stairs to eldritchs office and the look on her face when she believed that i had upset him in some way i couldnt say that i had liked her exactly but she had been loyal to the old man and she had not deserved to die the picture on the screen returned to a view of the exterior of eldritchs offices the explosion had started a fire that gutted the building and it had taken fire department units from adjoining towns to bring it under control the pakistani cell phone store was gone too one of its owners was interviewed on the street he was weeping an idiot reporter asked him if he thought the explosion might have been linked to islamic extremists the pakistani businessman stopped weeping for long enough to look shocked and hurt and enraged and then started crying even more i was saved the trouble of contacting epstein by his call to me he was at last in toronto after spending most of the previous night with the police telling them of the circumstances of adivs death i hadnt liked adiv much either it was turning into a bad week for people who had crossed me while i spoke to epstein louis slipped my delivery copy of the new york times in front of me adivs death had made the front page in what was being described as an assassination attempt on a prominent figure in the jewish community the picture of epstein had been taken a long time before perhaps a decade or more epstein had been doing his best to avoid the limelight ever since the death of his son the story mentioned that as well i made the continuation of the story inside since i was the one who had found his sons killers that didnt make me happy at all when i checked my cell phone there were forty missed calls and my message box was full i gave the phone to angel and let him start listening to and deleting the messages youre okay i asked epstein shaken but otherwise unharmed im sorry about adiv i know you are had he lived he might have grown to find that incident of the pine barrens amusing it would have taken some time indeed did you see hear the news about our lawyer friend in lynn i was informed of it this morning said epstein were assuming that the two attacks are linked its a big step up to the majors for coincidence if theyre not i replied no word on eldritchs client though i figure he was out of town when it happened i was always careful how i discussed the collector on the phone it was force of habit but then i was careful how i discussed the collector period and the reason revenge an attempt to discourage further investigation all of these things and more after all it was not my people who killed davis tate tates death and whatever else the client might have been up to let them know that some version of the list is already out there courtesy of the late barbara kelly if eldritch and his client had a copy then it was logical to surmise that you probably had a copy too maybe they hoped to catch eldritch and his client with the blast at lynn or maybe they just wanted to destroy his records at the very least it was a way of distracting the client for a time just as they hoped the attack on you whether it yielded casualties or not might be enough to i paused the word that was on the tip of my tongue was delay but why did it spring to mind mr parker said epstein are you there it was a delaying tactic a distraction i said but distracting us from what said epstein the plane i said somehow theyve found out about the plane and they know that were looking for it too how long before you can start the search tomorrow if were lucky and we can get a solid lead on its location i still havent spoken to marielle vetters again if she cant help us i have one other idea meanwhile what will the client do asked epstein i didnt have to think for long the client will hunt down those he believes were responsible for that explosion i said and the client will punish them the collector stood at the intersection smoking a cigarette and watching the police go about their business the gutted buildings were still smoldering and the street was awash with filthy black water like the aftermath of an oil slick the curious and the bored lounged behind the cordon and the news vans had congregated in the parking lot of tulleys bar where tulley himself was charging them threefigure sums for the pleasure although he was throwing in free coffee which if the reporters had any sense they were in turn throwing away behind the collector stood a pawn shop that extended over four floors the heaviest and largest items on the ground floor the rest arrayed over the next two floors in diminishing order of size the top floor the collector knew contained offices on the side of the building overlooking its back door and the parking lot beyond was a camera beside it was a second camera facing away from the door and toward the street the collector killed the cigarette and left the police to their business he entered the pawn shop where the two men seated behind the counter barely glanced at him before returning their attention to a tv screen that was showing the same crime scene that the collector had just witnessed had they walked a couple of feet they could have stood outside and watched it in person but they were ignorant lazy men and they preferred to glean their information from the tv where people who were betterlooking than they were could tell them things that they already knew the collector climbed the stairs to the top floor where there was a red metal door with a spyhole and the words private employees only stenciled on it in white paint there was no buzzer but the door opened as the collector approached and he was admitted a very old very fat woman and an even older man sat in a small outer office they were the sister and the brother if they had other names and they must have had once upon a time then nobody ever used them the name on the sign outside came from another business a drapery store that had closed in the s shortly after the sister and the brother had moved in and they had never left as she grew larger and larger the sister had risen higher and higher in the building in opposition to the items for sale a great balloon of a woman floating slowly upward until the roof finally arrested her progress arrayed around them on a pair of tables covered in green cloth were various items of jewelry a half dozen watches an assortment of coins and a sprinkling of gemstones the woman was morbidly obese the collector knew that she never left the building eating and sleeping in the living quarters separated from the office by a pair of red drapes when she needed medical attention the doctor came to her so far either her health had remained stable enough to require no serious treatment which seemed unlikely given the strain her system was under or some combination of the dozens of bottles of prescription and nonprescription medicines on the shelves above her head enabled her to keep functioning for the present her tiny head sat on massive folds of fat where her neck had once been and her arms appeared absurdly small for her body she was like a melting snowwoman she wore a pair of black hornrimmed glasses on a chain through them she watched the collector but said nothing and her face showed no feeling beyond that of a general weariness at a life lived too long and in too much pain the brother took the collector by the hand a curiously intimate gesture to which the collector did not object and walked him into a closet space barely big enough for the two of them here there was a giant safe built by the victor safe lock company of cincinnati ohio at the turn of the last century virtually an antique in itself the safe was open and inside were blocks of bills and gold coins and old jewelry boxes containing the stores most valuable pieces such an apparently casual attitude to security might not have been considered wise in this day and age and it was true that the pawn shop had been burgled once back in the burglars had beaten the sister badly although she presented no threat to them the attack more than any other factor had precipitated her massive gain in weight and her reluctance to explore an outside world capable of producing such individuals the collector had found those men they were never seen again actually this was not entirely true parts of them were seen again after that incident the business of the sister and the brother remained untroubled by crime or the fear of crime why then was there still a need for security cameras well for the same reason that a deserted building at the other end of the street unoccupied and apparently not for sale or lease had small discreet cameras hidden behind bulbs on its façade and the liquor store down the block operated two surveillance systems running in parallel because between them and the cameras in eldritchs now ruined building they offered a full panorama of the street just in case now on a small computer beside the safe the collector logged on to the digital recording system linked to the computer found the feeds for the two cameras on the pawn shops building and split the screen between them he used the mouse to move the cursor back to the minutes before the explosion and now here was the man his head down walking toward the camera looking over his shoulder turning raising his hand suddenly a flash and twin bursts of interference on the screen as the explosion shook the cameras when the pictures cleared the man was running his head no longer down and he vanished from one screen then the other the collector rewound and slowforwarded back and forth over and over until he had one image on the screen he enlarged it adjusted the area under examination and enlarged again the brother stood behind him taking it all in there said the brother there said the collector the mans features were revealed to him the collector leaned forward and touched the face on the screen with his fingertips i know you later that mornng angel louis and i traveled to falls end with two intentions the first was to find out if there was anything more that marielle vetters could tell us about the location of the plane anything that she might have remembered however irrelevant it might seem if she could not help us further then there was someone else i might ask although it would mean leaving falls end temporarily marielle had not returned my call from the previous night but i had not yet started to worry second we had to plan for the eventual expedition into the woods with that in mind id called jackie garner and asked him to head up to falls end as soon as possible because jackie knew the woods andy garner jackies old man had left his wife when jackie was just a kid there were irreconcilable differences between them she thought jackies old man was the biggest asshole who ever lived a serial screwer of women a deadbeat who had never met a steady job he liked and an oxygen thief and he disagreed but hed continued to be a part of his sons life until he died and his wife had continued to love him despite her better judgment andy garner had that rare gift of charm a charisma that enabled him to skate over the pain his failings caused others and inspired a degree of tolerance and even forgiveness in those whom he hurt jackies mother who knew his weaknesses better than anyone had sometimes been known to take him back into her bed after they had divorced it was she who had nursed him during his final illness and she remained his widow in all but name andy garner kept his head above water by working as a guide in the great north woods during hunting season he was a premium hire with regular sports who came back to him year after year they were wealthy businessmen and bankers and andy always ensured that they returned to their city lives content with their hunt and boasting of the animals they had killed in lean years where others struggled to find bear or trophy bucks for their clients andy garner would break records and his bonuses would increase he was a man who was only truly happy when he was in the forest a man profoundly in tune with nature but lost in cities and towns away from the woods he found solace in alcohol and women but during hunting season he was sober and celibate and happier than at any other time as soon as his son was old enough andy began taking him into the woods with him trying to pass on what he knew and develop the instincts for the forest that he was sure lay in the boy he was right to a degree jackie had his fathers understanding of and empathy with the natural world but he was softer than his father and cared little for hunting youll never make money from nature walks his father would tell him its hunting that will put bread on your table jackie garner found other ways to put bread on his table some legal and some illegal but he still returned to the woods whenever he could sometimes just to escape his mother who had always been a very demanding woman he had that in common with his buddies the fulcis it was probably part of the reason why the three of them got on so well together jackie didnt have a camp of his own in the woods but relied on the generosity of friends when that was not forthcoming he was happy to pitch a tent when i called him from my car and asked him to join us in falls end he jumped at the chance i did not tell him what we were looking for not yet that could wait hows your mom doing i asked we still had not yet had the chance to talk properly about her illness not so good i ought to have told you about her before but you know i think i was in denial about what exactly jackie i cant even pronounce it and ive heard it often enough in the last month creutzfeldtjakob disease does that sound right to you i told him that i didnt know id heard of the illness but i wasnt familiar with its symptoms or its prognosis unfortunately jackie now was shed been acting strange he explained well stranger than normal she was getting angry for no reason and then shed forget that shed been angry to start with i thought it might be alzheimers but the doctors came back to us a couple of weeks ago with a diagnosis of this creutzfeldtjakob thing how bad is it she has a year maybe a little longer the dementia is progressive and her vision is starting to suffer her legs and arms are spasming she has to go into a home and weve started looking at places look charlie theres money for this job right i need to get some cash together i have to make sure that shes cared for right epstein had agreed to cover all expenses id make sure that he paid well for jackies guide skills youll have no complaints jackie and its a short job two days at most once i get the information that we need well have to be ready to spend a night in the woods if we have to but im hoping it wont come to that then im good to go said jackie some time out in the woods will help me to clear my head i told him where to meet us and the call came to an end i felt a deep pity for jackie he might have been a little screwed up and with an excessive fondness for homemade munitions but he was unswervingly loyal to his friends while he had complained about his mother more than any man ive ever met he loved her too her illness and eventual death would hit him hard angel and louis were following me to falls end in their own car i informed them of my conversation with jackie when we stopped for coffee along the way both of them immediately told me to keep whatever epstein was paying for their time and expertise and pass it on to jackie i planned to do the same it was clear that something was wrong in falls end as soon as we reached the town there were patrol cars from the aroostook county sheriffs department parked on the street along with state police cruisers and the msps mobile crime scene unit parked on a side road to the east just at the edge of the forest i saw a concentration of vehicles among them one from the maine medical examiners office and standing beside it the medical examiner herself talking to a couple of detectives whom i recognized i knew that marielle vetters lived at the northern end of town and it was there that a second group of law enforcement vehicles had congregated because it was still hunting season the town was filled with strangers and their vehicles so we did not stand out but i was concerned about being seen by any lawman who might recognize me i still didnt know for sure that something had happened to marielle but i feared the worst damn i said and i spoke out of concern not only for marielle but also for myself my message was on her answering machine assuming that she hadnt erased it after listening to it being connected in any way with what might have happened to her wouldnt be productive i parked in the municipal lot and angel and louis pulled up alongside me angel went scouting for information while louis and i waited in my car angel returned half an hour later carrying coffees in a cardboard tray he got in the back of the car and passed them around before speaking marielle vetters is alive he said sos her brother but theyre both in comas its all anyone is talking about in the local diner which seems to be ground zero for gossip i just had to sit and listen two people are dead both shot one is a guy called teddy gattle marielles brother was staying with him and theres speculation that they may have got into an argument at gattles place and maybe grady vetters shot teddy there before heading over to his sisters house to commit the second killing he and his sister might have had some falling out over money and the house but the gradyvettersaskiller theory is coming from the cops at the moment not the locals most folk dont believe that grady vetters could have shot anyone but there are rumors that a gun was found beside him and if its the murder weapon well but charlie the other dead man is ernie scollay he was found shot in the back in marielle vetters house i said nothing i had liked ernie scollay from the moment id met him in his careful cautious way hed reminded me of my grandfather it was a setup it had to be marielle vetters might have been having difficulties with her brother but she had given no indication that she was worried about him becoming violent then again there were a lot of victims of domestic killings who had never seen it coming never suspected that someone of their own blood would turn against them if the potential for violence was that easy to spot there would be far fewer dead people was it too much of a stretch to imagine that on the same evening attacks were launched on two other people connected with the list the vetters family also linked to the list should become embroiled in a domestic dispute that left two people dead and two others apparently in a coma but if grady vetters was not in fact a killer how had he and his sister been found by those who had also sought to silence eldritch and epstein both marielle and ernie scollay had known the risks involved in telling anyone else of what they knew ernie hadnt even wanted me to be brought into their little circle that left grady vetters because he had been with his sister by their fathers bedside when the story of the airplane in the woods had been told i had to make a decision unless marielle had erased my message after listening to it it would only be a matter of time before the police came knocking on my door i could come forward immediately and tell them what i knew or try to avoid them for as long as possible the second option sounded best if i spoke to them id have to tell them about the plane and that would mean the fact of its existence becoming public i recalled epsteins refusal to share what he knew even with sac ross in the fbis new york office for fear that it might reach the wrong ears and ross was his tame federal agent a man whom we both trusted even if i didnt trust him quite as far as epstein for now telling the police anything about that plane was not an option i went for the worst case scenario grady vetters had not killed his friend teddy gattle or ernie scollay he and his sister had been found by those who were seeking the plane and gattle and scollay had been killed because they were in the way marielle and grady had probably been forced to share whatever they knew and then silenced the decision not to kill them was odd if someone was trying to frame grady vetters for murder having him shoot his sister and then himself would have left the police with a tidy murdersuicide instead according to gossip and who knew how true that might be there were two potential witnesses still alive but in comas on the other hand leaving them breathing but incapacitated would concentrate the focus of the investigation on the survivors and muddy the waters for a while if marielle or grady had revealed some new information about the location of the plane whoever was responsible for what had just occurred in falls end wouldnt need to distract the police for long just until the plane was found and the list secured what now said louis find us a couple of rooms at a motel and tell jackie garner where youre at ill be back here by evening and where are you going asked angel as they got out of my car i started the engine to ask an old friend why he lied to me ray wray wasnt happy he had arrived at joe dahls camp just southwest of masardis knowing only that there was a job waiting for him a job that would pay him a couple of grand for a couple of days work involving an airplane which meant that the work was probably illegal illegal work in that part of maine generally meant smuggling and the only thing really worth smuggling was drugs hence ray wray had decided that what he and joe dahl were looking for in the great north woods was a crashed plane full of drugs of course ray wray had no trouble with drug smuggling hed done enough of it in the past to know how to limit the risk of getting caught which was the main worry in that line of work getting caught caused all kinds of difficulty and not only with the law the individuals who paid folk to smuggle their drugs for them often took it amiss when the consignment didnt reach its intended destination paying your debt to society was one thing paying your debt to the bikers or the mexicans or a piece of shit like perry reed was another thing entirely so the fact of smuggling wasnt the issue for ray and neither was securing the plane and its cargo without getting caught what he did have trouble with was the fact that a woman and a boy were sleeping like vampires in joe dahls place the drapes drawn on the windows of the little cabin the woman curled up on the camp bed and the boy sleeping beside her on the floor ray could see that the womans face was badly disfigured when he peered around the thick sheet that separated the sleeping area from the rest of the room but hed been troubled more by the kid who had woken suddenly when ray appeared and shown ray the business end of a knife now ray was sitting on a roughhewn bench overlooking the oxbow with a cup of coffee in his hand joe dahl beside him and dahl was so jittery that he was giving ray a case of the jitters too this plane said ray yeah what about it when did it come down years ago how many years ago i dont know how come nobodys found it before now they didnt know where to look dahl pointed to the forest beyond with his own cup come on ray you could lose a jumbo jet in there you know that what were talking about is a small plane folk could have passed within feet of it and not have seen it if they werent already looking for it whats on it asked ray i dont know drugs i said i dont know ray jesus this wasnt right joe dahl was hard unlike ray hed done some killing ray wasnt the killing kind but he was good in the woods could hold up his end in a fight and he knew how to keep his mouth shut dahl on the other hand had knocked heads with some serious people in the past and was still standing but he was giving off bad vibes about this job and ray was increasingly inclined to put it down to the woman and her spooky kid so how do we know where its at asked ray there was no point in pursuing the subject of the planes contents any further with dahl not now maybe later once hed calmed down some she says its near the ruins of a fort and there aint but one fort in there said dahl suddenly ray understood why he was being paid so much money for heading out into the woods for a day or two it didnt really matter what was on that plane it wasnt even so much the difficulty in getting to it but he had heard the stories about that fort about wolfes folly it was situated in a part of the forest where hunters didnt go because game stayed away from it where there were no trails and the trees hunched like the forms of giants where the air smelled wrong and north and south east and west got all screwed up didnt matter how good your compass was or your own sense of direction it was a place where a man could get lost because something in there wanted you to get lost something that maybe looked like a little girl ray had never been out there and had never intended going even the stories about it tended to be kept among locals just to ensure that no idiot thrillseekers or hardened skeptics took it into their heads to start exploring to prove some point that only they could understand there was a time when hikers used to go missing and it was said that they might have strayed too close to wolfes folly but that didnt happen so much anymore not since care had been taken to excise it from the general discourse and ensure by unspoken agreement that whatever was out there was left undisturbed most of what ray knew about it hed learned from dahl and dahl didnt hold with ghost stories so if you heard it from joe dahls mouth you knew that it was true dahl said that nobody with an ounce of sense had been out near wolfes folly in years and ray believed him if the plane had come down near there it would explain a lot how much is she paying again asked ray two thousand up front to each of us and another thousand each when we find the plane thats good money ray i could sure use it amen to that thought ray hed only managed to get through last winter with cash from the home energy assistance program and now that state benefit had been halved because of the recession without money for heating oil a man could die out theres no place for a woman and a child said ray and that boy looks sick they ought to stay here leave the finding to us theyre coming ray theres no discussion about it i wouldnt worry about her and the boy theyre dahl sought the right word stronger than they look what happened to her face joe she got burned looks like burned bad she aint never going to see out of that eye again you an eye surgeon now dont need to be a surgeon to tell a dead eye from a live one yeah i guess who does that to a woman whoever it was i dont believe theyre around to ask no more said dahl like i told you dont misjudge that woman by her appearance cross her and shell leave you buried in a hole is the boy her son i dont know you want to ask her maybe pry into her other affairs while youre about it ray looked back at the cabin the drapes moved on one of the windows and a face appeared the boy was awake and watching them probably with that blade in his hand ray shuddered he shouldnt ought to be scared by a child but something of dahls own unease had communicated itself to him the kids watching us he said joe didnt turn around he looks out for the woman hes a creepy little fucker isnt he yeah and hes got real good hearing too ray shut up this woman shell put more work our way if it all goes right for her dahl said he paused as long as you dont mind getting your hands dirty ray didnt mind hed seen the guns a pair of ruger hawkeyes and two compact mm pistols so ray wray had never killed anyone that didnt mean he wouldnt if it came down to it hed come close once or twice and he thought that he could take the final step are we the only ones looking for this plane joe he asked no i dont believe we are i thought not said ray when do we start soon ray real soon v tread lightly she is near under the snow speak gently she can hear the daisies grow requiescat oscar wilde when i was a boy i thought everyone over thirty was old my parents were old my grandparents were real old and after that there were just people who were dead now my view of aging was more nuanced there were people in my immediate circle of acquaintances who were younger than i and people who were older in time there would be far more of the former than the latter until eventually i might look around and find that i was the oldest person in the room which would probably be a bad sign i recalled phineas arbogast as being almost ancient but he had probably not been more than sixty when i first met him and possibly even younger than that although he had lived a hard life and every year of it was written on his face phineas arbogast was a friend of my grandfather and boy could he talk there were people who crossed the street when they saw phineas coming or dived into stores to avoid him even if it meant buying an item that they didnt need just so they wouldnt get drawn into a conversation with him he was a lovely man but every incident in his day however minor could be transformed into an adventure on the scale of the odyssey even my grandfather a man of seemingly infinite tolerance had been known to pretend that he wasnt home when phineas dropped by unexpectedly my grandfather having been given some warning of his approach by the belchings of phineass old truck on one such occasion my grandfather had been forced to hide beneath his own bed as phineas went from window to window peering inside with his hands cupped against the glass convinced that my grandfather must be in there somewhere either sleeping or god forbid lying unconscious and requiring rescue which would have provided phineas with another tale to add to his everexpanding collection of stories more often than not though my grandfather would sit and listen to phineas in part he did so because buried somewhere in every one of phineass tales was a nugget of something useful a piece of information about a person my grandfather was a retired sheriffs deputy and he never quite set aside his policemans love of secrets or a little shard of history or forest lore but my grandfather also listened because he understood that phineas was lonely phineas had never married and it was said that he had long held a flame for a woman named abigail ann morrison who owned a bakery in rangeley that phineas was known to frequent when he went up to his cabin in the area she was a single woman of indeterminate age and he was a single man of indeterminate age and somehow they managed to circle each other for twenty years until abigail ann morrison was sideswiped by a car while delivering a box of cupcakes to a church social and so their dance was ended so phineas spun his stories and sometimes people listened and sometimes they did not i had forgotten most of those that i heard most but not all there was one in particular that had stayed with me the story of a missing dog and a lost girl in the great north woods the cronin rehabilitation and senior living center was situated a few miles north of houlton it wasnt much to look at from the outside a series of blankly modern buildings built in the seventies decorated in the eighties and allowed to remain in stasis ever since the paintwork and furnishings restored and repaired when required but never altered its lawns were well tended but there was little color cronins was nothing more or less than a neutral corner of gods waiting room whatever the subtleties of defining the aging process there was no doubt that phineas arbogast was now very old indeed he lay sleeping on an armchair in the room that he shared with another marginally younger man who was reading a newspaper in bed when i arrived his eyes magnified enormously by thick spectacles those owl eyes focused on me with alarm as i approached phineas youre not going to wake him are you he asked the only peace i get is when that man is asleep i apologized and said it was important that i spoke with phineas well on your head be it he said just permit me to get my gown on before you go rousing david copperfield over there i waited while he got out of bed put on his gown and slippers and prepared to find somewhere to read undisturbed i said that i was sorry for a second time and the old man replied i swear when that man dies god himself will move out of heaven and join the devil in hell to get a break from his yammering he paused at the door dont tell him i said that will you god knows im fond of the old coot and away he went i remembered phineas as a big man with a graybrown beard but the years had picked the meat from his bones just as the fall wind will denude a tree of its leaves before the coming of winter and phineass eternal winter could not be far off his mouth had collapsed in on itself with the loss of his teeth and his head was entirely bald although a little of his beard remained his skin was transparent so that i could count the veins and capillaries beneath it and i thought i could discern not just the shape of his skull but the skull itself according to the nursing assistant who had shown me to his room there was nothing wrong with phineas he had no major illnesses beyond an assortment of the various ailments that beset so many at the end of their lives and his mind was still clear he was simply dying because it was his time to die he was dying because he was old i pulled up a chair and tapped him lightly on the arm he woke suddenly squinted at me then found his spectacles on his lap and held them to the bridge of his nose without putting them on like a dowager duchess examining a suspect piece of china who are you he asked you look familiar my name is charlie parker you and my grandfather were friends his face unclouded and his smile shone his hand reached out and shook mine and his grip was still strong its good to see you boy he said youre looking well his left hand came out and joined the right like a man being saved from drowning you too phineas youre a damned liar give me a scythe and a hood and i could play death himself if i stumble by a mirror when im up to take a piss at night i think thats the grim old bastard come for me at last he took a brief coughing fit then and sipped from a can of soda that stood by his chair i was sorry to hear about your wife and your little girl he said when he had recovered i know you maybe dont like folk reminding you about it but it has to be said he took my hand in his again there was a final tightening and the hands withdrew i had a box of candy under my arm he looked at it bemusedly i got no teeth left he explained and candy plays hell with my dentures thats okay i told him i didnt bring you any candy i opened the box inside were five cohiba churchill cigars cigars had always been his vice i knew my grandfather would share one with him at christmas then complain about the smell for weeks after if you cant have cuban i figure the best dominicans will have to do i said phineas took one from the box held it beneath his nose and sniffed it i thought he might be about to cry god bless you he said you mind taking an old man for a walk i said that i didnt mind at all i helped him to put on an extra sweater and a muffler then his coat and gloves and a bright red woolen hat that made him look like a marooned buoy i found a wheelchair and together we set off for a stroll around those dull grounds he lit up once we were out of sight of the main building and happily talked and puffed his way to a small ornamental lake by the edge of a fir copse where i sat on a bench and listened to him some more when he eventually had to pause for breath i took the opportunity to steer the conversation in another direction a long time ago when i was a teenager you told my grandfather and me a story i said i told you both lots of stories your grandfather was still here hed say that i told too many for his liking he hid under his bed from me once you know that he thought i didnt see him but i did he chuckled the old fart i kept meaning to use it against him sometime but he upped and died before i could damn him he drew again on the cigar this one was different i said it was a ghost story about a little girl in the north woods phineas held the smoke in for so long i was convinced it was going to start coming out of his ears at last when hed had time to think he let it out and said i remember it of course you do i thought because a man doesnt forget a tale like that not if hes been a part of it a man doesnt forget hunting for his lost dog misty wasnt that her name in the depths of the forest and finding her all tangled up in briars with a little barefoot girl waiting nearby a girl who was both there and not there both very young and very very old a girl who claimed to be lost and lonely even as those briars started snaking around the mans shoes trying to hold him there so that the girl could have company so that she could draw him down to the dark place in which she dwelled no you dont forget a thing like that not ever there was a truth to the tale that phineas arbogast told to my grandfather and me but it wasnt the whole truth he had wanted to tell the story to share what he had seen but some details needed to be changed because one had to be careful about such matters you said that you saw the girl somewhere up near rangeley i said you said she was the reason why you stopped going up to your cabin there thats right said phineas thats what i said i didnt look at him as i spoke but i kept my voice soft and there was no accusation or blame to my tone this was not an interrogation but i needed to know the truth it was important if i was to find that plane do you think she roams this girl roams asked phineas what do you mean by that what im wondering is if all of the north woods is her territory or if she just sticks to one small area because my feeling is that shes linked to a place that maybe she has well a lair for want of a better word it could be where her body lies and thats where she returns to and she cant or wont stray too far from there i couldnt say for sure said phineas but i guess that sounds about right now i looked at him i touched his arm and he turned his face to me phineas why did you say that you were beyond rangeley when you saw her you werent anywhere near rangeley you were farther north past falls end you were deep in the county werent you phineas looked at his cigar youre spoiling my smoke he said im not trying to catch you out im not blaming you for altering the details of the story but its important that you tell me where you were as best you can when you saw that girl please how about a story for a story said phineas suppose you tell me why you need to know so i told him of an old man on his deathbed and a plane in the great north woods and i told him what linked harlan vetters search for a boy named barney shore to the discovery of that plane the ghost of a girl the plane lay in her territory wherever that might be and despite harlan vetters story about malfunctioning compasses and lost bearings i believe he did have some notion of where exactly that plane rested perhaps he had chosen not to share the location because he didnt trust his son not entirely or because he was dying and confused and couldnt keep all of the details straight in his head or maybe he did share that detail but only with his daughter and she had held it back from me for reasons of her own she didnt know me and it could be that she wanted to see what id do with the information shed already given me before she entrusted me with that final crucial element when i was finished telling my tale phineas nodded his approval thats a good story he said youd know i replied i would he said always have his cigar had gone out so engrossed had he been he lit it again taking his time with it what were you doing up there phineas poachin he replied once the cigar was going again to his satisfaction bear and maybe mournin some abigail ann morrison i said you got a memory almost as good as mine i suppose you need to given what you do now he told the story again and it was more or less as he had told it before but the location was changed to deep in the county and he had a landmark to offer through the woods behind that girl i thought i saw the ruins of a fort he said it was all overgrown more forest than fort but theres only one fort up in those woods wherever she hides wherever that plane lies its not far from wolfes folly it was growing colder but phineas did not want to return to his room not yet he still had half a cigar left your grandfather knew that i was lying about where i saw that girl said phineas i didnt want to tell him that id been poachin and he didnt want to be told and it was none of his business if i was crying for abigail ann but i wanted him to understand that id seen the girl he was the only person i could tell who wouldnt have laughed me away or turned his face from me even back then people in the county didnt care to hear the fort being brought up in conversation she still comes to me in my sleep that girl once youve seen something like that you dont forget it but you were also part of the reason for changing the location i didnt want to be putting fool ideas into your head we dont talk about that part of the woods not if we can help it and we dont go there if it hadnt been for that damned dog id never have gone there i had brought a copy of the maine gazetteer and with phineass help i marked the area in which wolfes folly lay it was less than a days hike from falls end who do you think she is i said not who said phineas but what i think shes a remnant a residue of anger and pain all bound up in the form of a child she might even have been a little girl once they say there was a child in that fort the daughter of the commanding officer her name was charity holcroft that girl is long gone whatevers left bears the same relation to her as smoke does to fire and i knew that what he said was true for i had seen anger take the form of a dead child and heard similar stories from sanctuary island at the far edge of casco bay and i thought that something of my own lost daughter still walked in the shadows although she was not composed entirely of wrath i used to wonder if she was evil and i came to the conclusion that she was not said phineas shed have done me harm but i dont think shed have meant it not really she may be angry and dangerous but shes lonely too you might as well call a winter storm evil or a falling tree both will kill you but they wont consciously set out to do it theyre forces of nature and that thing in the shape of a little girl is kind of a storm of emotion a little whirlwind of pain maybe theres something so terrible about the death of children so against the order of things that this residue if it sticks around naturally finds form in a child his cigar was almost done he stamped it out beneath his foot then tore apart the butt and scattered the tobacco on the breeze you can tell ive thought on this over the years he said all i can say for sure is thats her place and if youre going in there then you need to watch out for her now take me back to my room please i dont want a chill to get into my bones i wheeled him back to the center and we said our goodbyes his roommate was back in his bed still reading the same newspaper you brought him back he said i was hoping youda drowned him he sniffed the air someones been smoking he said he shook his newspaper at phineas you smell like cuba youre an ignorant old man said phineas i smell like the dominican republic he reached into a pocket of his coat and waved a fresh cohiba at his rival but if youre good and you let me nap in peace for an hour or two maybe ill let you wheel me out to the lake before supper and ill tell you a story shielded by looming pines wolfes folly hid itself from the setting sun less a fortress than the memory of one constructed by the forest its lineaments blurred by shrubs and ivy most of its buildings long collapsed in on themselves and only its log walls still standing intact its proper name was fort mordant after sir giles mordant an advisor to general wolfe who had first suggested its construction it had been intended as a supply depot and a place of refuge a link in a proposed chain of such small forts stretching from the colonies on the east coast of the british claims to the st lawrence river by the northwest of the french territories part of a new front from which to harry quebec unfortunately the changing fortunes of war had left fort mordant unsuited to its purpose and the signing of the treaty of paris in made the fort redundant by then wolfe himself was dead killed at the battle of the plains of abraham with his enemy montcalm and sir giles had been shipped home with a chest wound from which he never fully recovered dying at the age of thirtythree in it was decided that the fort was to be abandoned and its small garrison sent east by then the name wolfes folly had stuck while the blame for the fort more properly lay with mordant himself it was wolfes folly to have listened to him in the first place it was said by some that wolfe owed a substantial debt of money to mordant and was obliged to support his scheme others took the view that mordant was a fool and wolfe preferred to have him concentrating on his fort than interfering in more important matters of war whatever the reason for its construction it brought no luck to either man and had no impact on the outcome of the conflict the man entrusted with bringing word of the decision to close the fort and supervising its evacuation was a lieutenant buckingham who traveled northwest in april accompanied by a platoon of infantrymen they were still three days march from the fort when the first rumors began to reach them they encountered a quaker missionary named benjamin woolman a distant relative of james woolman of new jersey a leading figure in the burgeoning abolition movement benjamin woolman had taken it upon himself to preach christianity to the natives and he was known to act as a conduit between the tribes and the british forces woolman informed buckingham that the garrison at fort mordant had carried out a punitive expedition against a small abenaki village a week or so earlier killing more than twenty natives including it was said women and children when buckingham requested information about the reason for the slaughter woolman replied that he had no knowledge of why it was carried out such a small native group scarcely more than a single extended family could have posed little threat to the fort or its inhabitants and as far as woolman was aware there had been no particular tension between the soldiers and the natives the abenaki considered the forts construction to be an exercise in foolishness more importantly they tended to avoid the area of the forest in which it was located terming it majigek which woolman translated as wicked in fact that was one of the reasons why mordant had chosen that location for the forts construction one of his sole redeeming qualities was his interest in the traditions of the native population and he left behind him dozens of notebooks filled with jottings essays and sketches on the subject the french were dependent upon their native guides and if those guides were reluctant to enter certain areas of the woods then a fort situated in such a place would enjoy relative immunity from attack thus it was that there could be no logical reason why the abenaki should have been attacked by the british woolman also said that when he tried to seek further information about what had occurred he was denied entry to fort mordant by its commander captain holcroft and he was now concerned for the officers mental state he was also worried for the safety of holcrofts wife and daughter contrary to advice from all sources holcroft had insisted that his family join him when he took command of the fort woolman had been traveling east in the hope of communicating his worries to the appropriate authorities and thus he agreed to accompany lieutenant buckingham and his men back to fort mordant they could see the buzzards hovering while they were still some distance away when they reached the fort they found its gates open and everyone inside dead there were no signs of an indian attack rather it appeared that some dispute had arisen within the garrison and the soldiers had fallen to fighting among themselves their uniforms were no longer regulation attire but had been accessorized with pieces of bone both human and animal and their faces were painted to resemble ferocious masks most had died from gunshot wounds the rest at the point of a sword or a knife captain holcrofts wife was found in their quarters with her heart cut out of her husband and her daughter there was no sign a subsequent search of the surrounding forest revealed the remains of captain holcroft himself and here for the first time there was found some indication of an abenaki presence holcroft had been scalped and his body mutilated and hanged from a tree while buckinghams men buried the dead buckingham and woolman went in search of the abenaki buckingham was reluctant to meet them without his men to protect him for the abenaki had fought on the side of the french and the memory of their atrocities was still fresh in the minds of the british following the siege and subsequent massacre at fort william henry in the ranger commander major robert rogers had found six hundred mostly british scalps decorating the abenaki village of st francis and had destroyed it entirely in revenge relations with the abenaki remained uneasy woolman assured buckingham that with him as a gobetween and with no demonstration of hostile intent they would be safe buckingham grumbled that holcrofts violated remains gave him little comfort and he considered the murder of the officer for whatever reason an act of war by the natives after riding for three hours during which time buckingham believed they were always under the eyes and potentially the knives of the abenaki they were met by a heavily armed party of natives who quickly surrounded the two men the leader gave his name as tomah or thomas he wore a cross at his neck and had been baptized into the catholic faith by french missionaries accepting thomas as his baptismal name buckingham was not sure what troubled him more that he was surrounded by abenaki or surrounded by catholics nevertheless he and tomah sat down together and with woolman acting as translator the abenaki told them of what had transpired at the fort most of what was said did not pass into the official record buckinghams report on what came to be termed the incident at fort mordant stated only that a dispute of unknown origin arose there possibly fueled by alcohol which led to the deaths of the entire garrison including its commander captain holcroft and his wife the role played by the abenaki in holcrofts murder became clear only when woolmans private diary was discovered after his death but woolman also glossed over much of what was disclosed by tomah apparently by mutual agreement with buckingham neverthelesss the contents of woolmans diary went some way toward explaining why buckingham allowed the killing of a fellow officer by the abenaki to go both unreported and unpunished buckingham was a professional soldier and he understood that sometimes a lie was preferable to a truth that might tarnish the reputation of his beloved army woolmans diary revealed a few pertinent details the first was that holcroft had been discovered by the abenaki while apparently hunting his own daughter but despite the abenakis own efforts and a further search by buckingham and his men the girl was never found second the catholic abenaki told woolman they had set out to kill the inhabitants of the fort in reprisal for the earlier slaughter the small band of warriors who had been willing to overcome their fear of the territory were all catholic converts although they were additionally armed with totems of their tribe they arrived at the fort to find that the soldiers had done the job for them and had to be content with taking their revenge on holcroft alone whom tomah described by using the same word that woolman had used when buckingham first met him majigek finally according to woolman the abenaki claimed that before he died holcroft came to his senses and begged his tormentors for forgiveness for what he had done woolman admitted that he had trouble understanding tomahs description of holcrofts final words and was forced to clarify them in halting french to little avail holcroft it seemed had railed in english of which tomah knew little in french of which tomah knew slightly more and in some mishmash of passamaquoddy and abenaki that holcroft had picked up during his postings in the region for like mordant himself he was known to be a scholar of languages and a civilized man as woolman understood it holcroft claimed to have committed the slaughter of the abenaki on the orders of the tsesuna the raven god who pecked at his window he also termed him the apockoli the upsidedown god who spoke to him from behind his shaving mirror and who sometimes called to him from the depths of the forest his voice bubbling up from deep beneath the earth it was this same entity this demon who had infected his men with madness and turned them upon one another holcroft had used another word too in connection with him before the abenaki set to torturing him it was ktahkomikey a word that referred to wasps particularly a certain species that nested in the ground holcroft had died screaming of the god of wasps outside the cronin home i rested the gazetteer against the steering wheel while i tried to figure out the journey taken by harlan vetters and paul scollay on the day they found the plane marielle vetters had told me that her father believed he and his friend had tracked the deer for four hours or more traveling northwest or northnorthwest for the most part as best they could tell there was a logging road that ran north from falls end it was the one phineas had used on his illegal bearhunting trip and it seemed the most likely route for vetters and scollay to have taken as well it veered northeast after ten miles as though the road had been specifically designed to discourage anyone from venturing farther northwest where the road altered direction was probably the closest point to fort mordant from there wed move into the forest on foot i had considered the possibility of using atvs but they were cumbersome to transport and also noisy and we were not the only ones looking for that plane the sound of four atvs moving through the woods might well be enough to get us killed i was so lost in the map as though i were already deep in those woods that the ringing of my phone came as an unwelcome distraction and i didnt even glance at the number before i picked it up it was only when i had pressed the green button that i thought again of the message i had left on marielle vetters answering machine and the possibility that the police might have listened to it but by then it was too late thankfully it was only epstein on the other end he was calling from toronto i could hear traffic in the background and then epsteins words were overcome by the roar of a jet youll have to repeat that i said i couldnt hear you this time i heard him clearly i said i know who was the passenger on that plane wildons widow remembered epstein they had met once before she said at an event to raise funds for the collection of dna from holocaust survivors so that the separated members of families might be reunited and anonymous remains identified an initiative that eventually became part of the dna shoah project it was the first time that wildon and epstein had come face to face although each knew of the others work eleanor wildon recalled the two men shaking hands and that was the last she saw of her husband for the rest of the evening epstein too remembered that night but he had forgotten entirely that wildons wife had been present so pleased was he to meet a kindred spirit they were sitting in the drawing room of her apartment which took up the entire top floor of an expensive condominium in yorkville a pair of andrew wyeth paintings hung at either side of the marble fireplace beautiful tender studies of autumn leaves from his late period epstein wondered if as their lives came to a close all artists found themselves drawn to images of fall and winter two teacups sat on the table between them mrs wildon had brewed it herself she lived here alone she was not a particularly beautiful woman nor had she ever been her features were plain at first glance her face unremarkable had he not been distracted by her husband at their earlier meeting epstein would still barely have noted her presence if he had noted it at all even here in her own home she seemed to blend into the furniture the wallpaper the drapes the pattern on her dress echoed the textures and colors of the fabrics rendering a chameleon quality to her it was only later when he had already left her that epstein understood this was a woman who was hiding herself he thought very highly of you said mrs wildon he came back that evening more animated than id seen him in years i thought it was all foolishness his stories about angels his fascination with the end times it wasnt harmless because it was too odd for that but i tolerated it all men have their eccentricities dont they women too i suppose but mens are more ingrained its something to do with their boyishness i think they hold onto the enthusiasm of childhood she didnt sound as though she thought this was a good thing it got worse after he met you though she said i think you fueled his fire epstein drank his tea the accusation was clear but he did not look away or express sorrow if this woman wanted someone to blame for what had happened to her children perhaps her husband too then he would accept that role as long as she told him what she knew what was he looking for mrs wildon proof she said proof of the existence of life beyond this one proof that there was an evil beyond human greed and selfishness proof that he was right because he always wanted to be right about everything but there was a moral component to his work too was there not she laughed and as her laughter faded it left a sneer on her face epstein realized that he disliked eleanor wildon and he did not know why he suspected that she was a shallow woman and he allowed his eyes to take in his surroundings once more seeking evidence in the furniture and paintings and ornaments to confirm his opinion then he saw the small framed photograph of two young girls on a shelf of lladró porcelain and was ashamed of himself a moral component said mrs wildon the sneer held for a second or two before melting and when she spoke again she was walking in other rooms living another life and her voice came from somewhere far away yes i suppose there was he was making connections between killings and disappearances he spoke to retired policemen hired private investigators visited grieving relatives when good people died in unusual circumstances or vanished and were never seen again he would try to find out all that he could about them and about their lives most were just what they appeared to be accidents domestic situations that tipped over into violence or just the misfortune of meeting the wrong person at the wrong time and suffering for it but some she stopped and bit her lip go on mrs wildon please some he believed were being committed by one man who moved through the northern states both in this country and yours there were police investigators who thought so too but they could never make the connection and it was all what do you call it circumstantial anyway a face in the crowd a halfglimpsed figure on a video screen nothing more i saw the pictures sometimes there was another with him a horriblelooking man bald with a swelling just here she touched her hand to her throat and epstein started brightwell he said that ones name was brightwell and the other asked mrs wildon i dont know wildon had hinted at some of this in cryptic messages to epstein he was a man with a love for the gnomic and the hidden thats a pity she said as he was the one who killed my children she said it so matteroffactly that epstein was convinced for a second that he had misheard but he had not mrs wildon took a sip of tea and went on what interested my husband was that these men or people who looked very like them seemed to turn up their features no different in old photographs and reports of crimes from thirty forty even fifty years earlier there might have been a woman too he thought but she wasnt involved as much or was more careful than the others he wondered how that could be and he came up with an answer they were not men or women but something else something old and foul such nonsense im sure i used that word with him nonsense but it still frightened me i wanted him to stop but he was so singleminded about it so convinced that there was a truth to it and then they took my girls and they buried them alive in a hole in the ground and i knew that it wasnt nonsense there was no warning no threats against our family if my husband continued to stick his nose into their business there was only retribution she put her cup down and pushed the saucer away from her it was my husbands fault mr epstein those others whoever or whatever they might be killed my little girls but my husband drew them down on us and i hated him for it i hate him and i hate you for the encouragement that you gave him you all share the blame for leaving my daughters to suffocate in a pit of dirt there was that same neutral voice there was no anger to it she might just as easily have been discussing returning a flawed dress to a store or a movie that had disappointed after that she and her husband had drifted apart like wreckage from a sinking ship separated by shifting tides she shared his desire to find and punish those responsible for the deaths of their children but she did not want her husband in the same house with her in the same room or the same bed he left their home and went to live in one of the apartments that he owned and he lost interest in his business affairs and in his wife and she in him they were united only by memories and a kind of hatred then on the night of july he called me he said that he had found the man who had killed our little girls the man from the photographs he was living in a place outside sagueney in a trailer park surrounded by crows did he have a name he called himself mr malphas an interesting choice thought epstein malphas one of the great princes of hell a deceiver an artificer the lord of crows my husband told me that they had him theyd drugged him and there was proof of what he had done or was planning to do they there was a man who occasionally assisted my husband in his work douglas something douglas ampell he was a pilot ah said epstein so he had been right about the source of the plane and what proof did your husband find he was babbling he was in a hurry they had to get this man this malphas away before his friends discovered what was happening he said something about names a list of names thats all did he say what he planned to do with malphas no just that they were taking him to be questioned by someone else someone who would understand someone who would believe that was the last time we spoke but he warned me that if something happened to him or if i didnt hear from him again i was to stay quiet there was money in trusts in hidden accounts and i could sell the house his lawyers had all of the details i wasnt to look for him and i was to send all of the evidence he had collected to you and you alone epstein was puzzled but i received nothing from you thats because i burned it all every last scrap of paper she said it killed my daughters and it killed my fool of a husband i wanted no more part of it i did what he told me to do i stayed quiet and i lived now he was certain he was on his way to new york said epstein he was bringing malphas to me yes said mrs wildon this empty woman this shell of grief brittle as the lladró figures that stared down from her shelves and i didnt care my husband didnt understand he never understood understood what mrs wildon mrs wildon stood their meeting was over that it wouldnt bring them back she said that it wouldnt bring my little girls back to me youll have to excuse me now but i have a plane to catch id like you to get out of my home malphas i found that i had written the name on the open page of the gazetteer malphas was the passenger on the plane said epstein ampell went missing on the same day as wildon he owned a piper cheyenne aircraft which that week was based at a small private airfield just north of chicoutimi the plane has never been found and ampell never filed a flight plan they didnt want to draw attention to themselves or their cargo they didnt want anyone to suspect but wildon had to tell his wife he wanted her to know that hed succeeded in finding this man except she didnt care she blamed her husband for what had happened to their children malphas was just the instrument and malphas survived the crash mr parker thats why there were no bodies in the wreckage he removed them or perhaps they survived too and he killed them and disposed of their remains but he left the list and the money i said the money might not have been important to him but that list was if he survived and was strong enough to kill anyone else who had lived why did he leave the list where it could be found i dont know said epstein but its another reason to be careful in those woods you dont believe that hes still out there he had been discovered mr parker they hide themselves away these creatures especially when theyre under threat those woods are vast they can conceal an aircraft and so they can conceal a man if hes alive where else would he be wolfes folly was silent as night fell and the only movement came from the shifting of the shadows thrown by the trees upon it or so it appeared until one small shadow separated itself from the rest moving against the direction of the wind the crow circled cawing hoarsely then resumed its perch with its brethren the passenger had no memory of his original name and little understanding of his own nature the plane crash which he had caused by breaking the arms of his seat freeing him to attack the pilot and copilot had left him with significant injuries to the brain he had lost the capacity of speech and he was in constant pain he retained virtually nothing of his past beyond fragments scattered recollections of being hunted and an awareness of the necessity of hiding himself instincts that he had continued to follow ever since the crash and he remembered too that he was very good at killing and killing was his purpose the copilot did not survive the crash but the pilot did and the passenger had stared at his face and one of those shards of memory had glittered in the darkness this man had hunted him and therefore the pain in the passengers head was his fault the passenger had pushed his thumbs into the pilots eyes and kept pushing until the man ceased moving he stayed in the wreckage for a number of days feeding on the candy bars and potato chips that he found in the copilots bag and drinking bottled water the pain in his head was so terrible that he would black out for hours some of his ribs were broken and they hurt whenever he moved his right ankle would not support his weight at first but in time it healed although imperfectly so that he now walked with a slight limp the bodies in the plane began to stink he pulled them from the wreckage and dumped them in the woods but he could still smell them he used a broken panel from the plane as a spade and dug a shallow pit in which to bury them when the snacks from the plane ran out he salvaged what he could including the emergency kit and a gun that he found among the pilots possessions and started exploring the wilderness which was how he came upon the fort he built a temporary shelter for himself inside its walls and he tried to sleep even as the girl prowled the woods beyond he thought that he might have seen her on the first night after the crash although he could not be sure there was a face at the cockpit window and he might have heard a scratching upon the glass but he was unconscious more often than he was conscious and his waking hours were spent in a kind of delirium the presence of the girl was just another splinter in that cloud of memories as though his whole life had been part of an intricate painting on a glass wall and that wall had just exploded it was only later when he began to recover his strength that he recognized the reality of her existence he watched her at night as she circled the plane and he thought that he felt her anger and her desire his senses were troubled by it just as they had been bothered by the stench of the pilots rage was her spoor she grew bolder he woke on the third night to find her inside the plane standing so close to him that he could see the bloodless scrapes on her white skin she did not speak she merely stared at him for a single long minute trying to understand him even though he did not understand himself and then he blinked and she was gone that was when he decided to leave the plane he still could not walk far on his wounded ankle and when the fort had presented itself to him he had been grateful for it more so when he found that the girl would not cross its threshold there he grew stronger he hunted during the day while the girl hid herself away at first he wasted his shots on squirrel and hare until his hunters instincts led him to a young doe it took two shots to kill it and he fielddressed it with the knife from the emergency kit he ate what he could and cut the rest into strips to dry to keep pests away he covered them with fabric ripped from the seats of the plane and the deer skin helped to keep him warm as the winter drew in in the quiet of the fort the buried god began to call to him he heard its voice imperfectly but it was familiar to him it came to him the way music might come to one who had been struck deaf but retained enough of his hearing to discern muffled chords and rhythms the buried god wanted to be released but the passenger could not find him he had tried but the voice was coming from too far away and he could not understand its words sometimes though he would stare into the depths of the still dark pool near to which the plane had come to rest and he would wonder if the buried god might not be down there once he reached into it sinking his forearm up to the elbow straining his fingers in the hope that his hand might be grasped by whatever waited below the water was frighteningly cold so cold that it felt like a burning but he kept his arm submerged until he could stand it no longer when he withdrew it the water dripped slowly from his fingers like oil and he gazed in disappointment at his numb empty hand he began paying homage to the buried god he dug up the bodies in the forest and removed the heads along with some of the major bones from the arms and legs it was the beginning of the shrines creation the altar of worship to an entity he could not name but whom he understood to be his god he created impressions of false deities from his fractured memory carving them from wood with a knife and he mutilated them in the name of the other he was still weak too weak to explore farther or seek civilization he should have died that winter but he did not he even wondered if he could die the buried god told him that he could not when spring came the passenger began to explore his domain farther he found an old cabin its walls built from thick logs but its door long gone and its roof collapsed he began to restore it in march a man came into his territory a young hiker unarmed the passenger killed him with a spear that he had made and waited for others to come looking for him but no one did he scavenged all that was useful from the mans pack and a wallet with in cash although there was still a great deal of money in the plane along with a satchel of papers that made no sense to him two weeks later he made his first careful sortie back to civilization his damaged skull hidden beneath the dead hikers cap he bought food and salt and some tools and ammunition for his pistol all by pointing at the items that he wanted he looked at a rifle but he had no identification he settled instead for a used hunting bow and as many arrows as he could afford he could have found a way to lose himself once again in a city or a town but he was afraid that his appearance might draw attention he also knew that he was damaged and managing anything beyond the simplest of social tasks was beyond him he was happier in the woods he was safe there safe with the buried god and perhaps as he grew stronger he might find the buried god and free him he could not do that from a city and so he hid himself in the woods and prayed to the buried god and tried to limit all human contact he became adept at avoiding the men from the paper companies and the wardens the passenger killed another hiker the following year but only because the hiker came to the fort and found the shrine nearby such trespasses were rare because there was something about the fort that kept people away or else most knowledge of it had been lost similarly the cabin had lain undisturbed for decades before the passenger found it because the ground had been cleared to build it secondgrowth foliage had sprung up around it so the dwelling remained virtually invisible only once had he felt truly threatened he had gone to the plane to replenish his supplies of cash for he had to prepare for another winter he had entered the plane through the canvas hatch at the back noting once again how far the fuselage had sunk it might take years but eventually the plane would be lost entirely he pulled back a piece of rotting carpet and lifted the panel that it concealed in order to retrieve the money he was just about to reach into the bag when he was struck by a blinding flash of white pain as though a shard of metal had been forced through his right ear and into his brain they came on him with increasing frequency these attacks but this was the worst yet his body went into seizure and he spasmed so hard that he broke two teeth on his lower row the cabin of the plane began to close in on him and he experienced a terrible sense of falling and burning then the world went black and when he opened his eyes again he had somehow crawled from the plane and the girl was nearby circling him but drawing closer she was angry at the passenger for taking the hiker when she had wanted him for herself he had to get away from her but his sense of direction was distorted he reached for his gun but it was gone and he suspected that the girl had taken it she hated the gun its noise troubled her and she seemed to know that it was important to him that without it he would be more vulnerable he was forced to keep the girl at bay with stones until through sheer luck he managed to struggle back to his cabin for in his confused agonized state he was unable to find the fort there he barred the door against her and he listened from his pallet bed as she scratched at the wood trying to force her way inside when at last he was strong enough to leave he found that the door was scarred by the girls efforts and he dug one of her old twisted fingernails from the exposed white wood he returned to the plane and discovered the remains of a fire and he saw that the interior had been disturbed the money was gone although he had retained enough good sense to separate it into three piles keeping some of it at the cabin and some buried in plastic behind the fort but it was not the money that concerned him so much as the intrusion and the imminent risk of discovery he stripped the cabin and the fort of his possessions wrapped them in plastic and buried them he hid the shrine beneath a screen of leaves and twigs and moss that he had constructed for just such an eventuality then retreated many miles to the north where he had built himself a hide after a month he risked returning to his cabin and discovered to his surprise that the site was as it had been and nobody had come to find the plane he could not understand why but he was thankful in the wilderness he continued his solitary worship and his solitary search he subsumed his pleasure in killing because he knew that if indulged it would eventually draw people to him until that week when he had taken the two hikers and offered up the womans remains to the buried god that was why he had returned to the fort at least for a while the girl always grew angry when he killed and it would take days for her temper to subside just as with the hiker long before she was angry because she had wanted the couple for herself she wanted company by killing those who strayed into her territory the passenger deprived her of it and the uneasy truce that existed between them was threatened on those occasions the passenger would take refuge in his cabin or more often in the fort and from its safety he would watch the enraged girl stalking outside its walls casting her whispered threats to the wind then the girl would disappear and he would see no trace of her for weeks at those times the passenger believed that she might be sulking so the passenger left the girl to her fury he climbed into his sleeping bag in the fort and tried to sleep but sleep would not come the buried gods voice had grown louder recently desperate to communicate something to him but the passenger could not interpret the message and so the frustration of both grew the passenger wished that the buried god would be silent he wanted peace he wanted to reflect upon the man and the woman he had killed he had enjoyed taking their lives the womans in particular he had forgotten the pleasure that it brought he wanted to kill another and soon harlan vetters and paul scollay had headed out on their fateful hunting trip in the afternoon but it didnt seem like a good idea for us to follow suit the plane would be difficult enough to find in daylight and flashlights would mark our position and progress just as surely as the noise of atvs neither did it seem smart to leave at or before dawn as the likelihood of encountering hunters was greater i decided that we would leave shortly before ten am which would give us a clear five or six hours of good light before the sun began to set by which time we would with luck have found the plane obtained the list and be on our way back to falls end without incident with luck said louis without enthusiasm we never have luck said angel which is why we always need guns said louis we were staying at a motel five miles south of falls end next door was a diner that sold only seven types of bottled beer bud miller and coors bud light miller lite and coors light and heineken we were drinking heineken jackie garner was back in his room trying to explain to his mother why he was not joining her for their weekly movie night especially as she and lisa jackies girlfriend had rented fifty first dates for him because they knew how much he liked drew barrymore jackie who neither liked nor disliked drew barrymore and had no idea how this neutral position had been transformed into something close to an obsession had no satisfactory answer to give other than that a job was a job he had told me earlier that his mother had seemed more like her normal self these past few days which meant that she was just inordinately possessive of her only son but it was also the case that jackies mother who had previously regarded jackies girlfriend as a rival for her sons affections had softened her position over the past year having clearly noticed that the relationship between her son and lisa was not about to fall apart any time soon despite her best efforts mrs garner had decided it was better to have her as an ally than an enemy and lisa had come to the same conclusion the onset of mrs garners final illness now lent both a poignancy and convenience to this relationship the diner was full and a lot of the conversation revolved around events in falls end there appeared to be no change in the condition of marielle and grady vetters by contrast judging by the talk in the diner the focus of the investigation into the deaths of teddy gattle and ernie scollay had rapidly altered and grady vetters was no longer being treated as a suspect they got injected with somethin is what i heard a big bearded man had told me in the restroom just minutes earlier he was swaying as he stood at the urinal so he resorted to leaning his head against the wall to keep himself steady while he peed who did marielle and grady said the man somebody stuck a needle in em howd you hear this my brotherinlaw is a sheriffs deputy he belched hard no way grady injected himself so hes no killer i could have told them that anyone in town could have you here to hunt yeah need a guide got one thanks if he heard me he decided to ignore what i said he fumbled in his pocket with his right hand while continuing to aim with his left and produced a business card for wessels guide service everybody seemed to be a guide in these parts thats me he said greg wessel you can call anytime ill remember i didnt catch your name parker i wont shake your hand i appreciate that you hear anything about the men who were killed the folk on the news didnt seem to know any more than i do and i dont know anything at all ernie scollay and teddy gattle said wessel brotherinlaw says teddy had track marks on his arm too and teddy was a pothead potheads dont use needles old ernie just took two in the back what kind of fucking coward shoots an old man in the back huh i dont know i said you ask a lot of questions said wessel it was a comment and i heard no belligerence or suspicion in it you a reporter no i said im just here to hunt and you know this kind of thing makes a man concerned for his safety well you got guns dont you yes and you know how to use them kind of then you got nothing to worry about he finished peeing and waited his turn while i washed my hands dont forget he said wessels guide and taxidermy ill be sober before dawn guaranteed now back at the table the waitress brought three burgers for angel louis and me they were not big around them were scattered a dozen very thin very brown fries like the detritus of a destroyed birds nest angel poked at his burger it oozed a thin trickle of grease did we order sliders to share he asked the waitress returned to fill up our water you need anything else she asked more food would be a start said angel any food its burger night said the waitress her hair was very red so were her lips her cheeks and her uniform if it hadnt been november and the heartshaped tattoo on her right forearm had not read muffys bitch she might have seemed festive whats so special about burger night asked angel the waitress pointed to a handlettered sign behind the register it read burger night wenedsday burger and fries burger night she said wednesday its just that the burgers are kind of small said angel thats why theyre three bucks said the waitress right said angel you know you spelled wednesday wrong you know i didnt spell it at all right said angel again whos muffy exboyfriend he ask you to get that done no got it done myself after we broke up after you broke up to remind myself that i was once muffys bitch and not to let it happen again right said angel for the third time you got any more questions too many the waitress patted angel on the arm well you hold onto them i get you boys another round of beers the diners front door opened and jackie garner walked in sure i said and one extra for our friend whos just come in you think hell want to eat asked the waitress kitchens closing in five he can share ours said angel therell be leftovers jackie didnt want to eat and was happy just to sip a beer the kitchen closed and gradually the crowd began to thin out but nobody tried to hurry us along we clinked our bottles and toasted to luck but angel was right luck rarely seemed to come our way which was indeed why we had guns across the road from the motel and diner stood an abandoned gas stationcumgeneral store the pumps long since gone and the windows and front door of the store itself imperfectly boarded up the back door had disappeared entirely but the single piece of wood that had failed to deny access to it still remained although unsecured providing the illusion of closure scattered inside were empty beer cans and bottles a box of cheap wine that was still half full and the odd used rubber in one corner was a rats nest of blankets and towels damp and moldy from the rain that had poured through the hole in the roof above a consequence of a small fire that had also blackened the walls and left a smell of burning a firefly glow appeared in the darkness its illumination growing quickly until it was entirely consumed by flame the collector put the match to his cigarette and stepped closer to the window the lengths of wood used to block them were imperfectly nailed in place and he could clearly see through them the four men drinking in the diner the collector was torn he was not used to experiencing anger or the desire for vengeance those whom he hunted had not sinned against him and the pleasure that he took in removing them from the world was general not personal this was different someone close to him had been killed and another injured the most recent conversation with eldritchs physician had revealed that he was not recovering as quickly as might have been expected even for a man of his advanced years and his stay in hospital was likely to be extended the physician suggested that the effects of shock and grief were greater threats than his physical wounds but eldritch had rejected offers of counseling or the attentions of a psychologist and when the subject of a priest or pastor had been raised the patient had laughed for the first and only time since his admission kill them kill them all but they were dangerous and not only because they were armed they knew of the collector and understood the threat that he posed he had relearned a painful but valuable lesson from becky phipps about confronting someone who was anticipating an attack he preferred to prey on the unarmed and unwary he supposed that this might be regarded as cowardice in some quarters but he saw it simply in terms of practicality there was no reason to make his task any more difficult than it had to be and when required he was prepared to fight for his trophy just as he had done with phipps bu he also wanted the rest of the list and these men could lead him to it he didnt know where the flores woman was hiding and he could only hope that she had not already found the plane if she had located it and secured her prize he would have to hunt her down and that would be timeconsuming and difficult no ideally these four men would do his work for him and he would start killing after he watched them finish their drinks and leave the restaurant they walked to their rooms in two pairs parker and garner in front the others behind the collectors right hand slipped beneath his coat and found the hilt of a knife he rested his fingers on it but did not draw it from its sheath beside it was his gun fully loaded three rooms four men it was risky but not beyond his capabilities kill them all but the list the list the first sign that luck might not be going our way came when i woke up and went out to get coffee in the parking lot was a shiny white suv obviously a rental and leaning against it already drinking a coffee of her own was liat she was wearing a parka over beige canvas combat pants and a green sweater the ends of her pants were tucked into rubbersoled boots i guess you missed me i said one corner of her mouth curled up in very slight amusement you didnt want to come in she shook her head did epstein send you nod doesnt he trust us to bring him the list shrug the door to angel and louiss room opened and louis appeared he was already dressed for the woods but he still managed to make cargo pants look good whos this he asked she looks familiar this is liat liat said louis that liat the same well i only saw her from a distance and not from the same angles that you did she miss you i dont think so then why is she here to bring the list back to epstein shes coming with us you could try to stop her but youd probably have to shoot her louis considered the possibility then seemed to discount it you planning on inviting any more exgirlfriends along just asking no well long as its just her angel joined louis he was also dressed for the woods and still managed to make cargo pants look bad whos this he asked spare me i thought liat said louis that liat yep that liat at least we know she exists said angel all i saw was a shape in the distance you think he made her up asked louis it seemed more likely than him actually being with a woman liat who had been following the conversation with her eyes blushed nice i said sorry said angel he smiled at liat but you know its true another door opened and jackie garner emerged he squinted at liat whos this liat said angel jackie looked confused as well he might have done whos liat it was just after eight ray wray was drinking coffee eating a protein bar and after the events of the night before wishing he was back in jail he and joe had bedded down in bags on the floor of the cabin on the other side of the sheet from the boy and his mother but only joe had managed to get any real rest ray had drifted in and out of sleep and at some point in the night he had woken to see the boy standing at one of the windows touching his fingers to the glass his lips moving soundlessly his reflection hung like a moon against the night sky the true moon suspended above it like a second face ray had been afraid to move and kept his breathing regular so that the boy would not suspect he was being watched after perhaps fifteen minutes the boy prepared to return to his bed but he paused at the sheet that divided the room and looked back at ray ray closed his eyes he heard the padding of the boys feet as he crossed the room and then felt his breath on his skin he smelled it too it smelled bad the boys face was so close to his own that ray could feel the warmth of it he forced himself not to pull away and not to open his eyes even as he told himself that this was only a kid and ray should just tell him to get his ass back to bed where it belonged but he did not because the boy frightened him he frightened him more than his mother if thats what she was with her ruined face and that dead eye embedded in it like a bubble of fat on barely cooked meat ray willed him to go away hed been so careful but somehow the boy knew that he was awake just a kid thought ray just a kid so what if i was awake whats he going to do to me pull my hair tell his mom the answer came to him without hesitation something bad thats what hell do the feel of the boys breath shifted it was on his lips now as though he were leaning in for a kiss ray could taste him in his mouth he wanted to turn over so badly except he didnt want his back to the kid that would be worse than facing him the boy moved away ray heard the sound of his footsteps as he made his way back to his bed ray risked opening his eyes the boy was walking backwards his back to the sheet so that he could keep watching ray the boy grinned when he saw that rays eyes were open he had won and ray had lost he raised his left hand and wagged a finger at ray ray was tempted to get up and run from the cabin if there was a forfeit to this game he didnt want to find out what it was but the boy just pushed aside the sheet and ray heard him climb into the bed behind and then all was still ray looked at the window the moon was no longer visible that was when ray realized that there was no moon that night and he had not closed his eyes again until morning angel louis and i rode in jackies truck liat followed behind in her rental it was a private road but one routinely used by locals and hunters still jackie had secured all the necessary permits just in case so we were right with the paper company the warden service and probably god himself you didnt want to ride with your girlfriend asked angel from the back i think she was just using me right said angel he allowed a perfectly timed pause then said for what funny i replied although there was an uncomfortable truth behind angels joke we passed a couple of trucks and old cars parked by the side of the road hunters the ones who had set out before dawn and would return to town by early afternoon if theyd shot anything most hunters liked to stay close to a road and within five miles of falls end there were a lot of edges where deer came to feed there was no reason to go very far into the woods and so we were unlikely to encounter hunting parties where we were going at least not the kind that hunt buck the road was narrow and at one point we had to pull over to allow a company truck loaded with logs to pass us it was the only such vehicle we met along the way we reached the point where the road made a definite dogleg east and there we pulled over there was still frost on the ground and the air was noticeably colder than it had been down in falls end liat arrived a minute or two behind us just as jackie began unloading our supplies and louis was checking the rifles we had a each as well as handguns liat had no rifle but i didnt doubt that she had a gun she kept her distance from us watching the woods jackie garner seemed bemused by her presence shes deaf right he said yeah i said thats why you dont have to whisper oh yeah he thought about it but kept whispering hows a deaf woman going to get by in the woods shes deaf jackie not blind i know but we gotta be quiet dont we shes also a mute im no expert but people who cant speak tend to be quieter than the rest of us suppose she steps on a twig and makes a noise how will she know angel joined us what are you some kind of buddhist if a tree falls in the forest i can tell you now that she wont hear it jackie shook his head in frustration we were clearly missing the point shes coming with us jackie i told him live with it we didnt plan to be in the woods after dark but jackie had still insisted that we bring a groundsheet each we also had plenty of water coffee chocolate energy bars nuts and courtesy of jackie a bag of pasta even with the addition of liat we had enough to keep us going for a day or more there were also waterproof matches cups one lightweight saucepan a pair of compasses and a gps unit although jackie said that we might have trouble getting a signal where we were going we divided the equipment and supplies between us and set out there was no further discussion we all knew what we were looking for and what might be out there i hadnt shared what we suspected of malphass possible nature with jackie and so jackie had been skeptical that anyone who had survived the crash might still be out there i shared something of his point of view but i wasnt about to bet my life or anyone elses on it jackie led louis behind him then liat angel and i jackies concerns about liat were unfounded of all of us it was she who stepped the softest while angel and louis unused to the woods wore leather boots with thick treads liat jackie and i wore lighter boots with only slight ribbing the better to feel what lay beneath our feet treads could mean the difference between stepping on a branch and bending it or breaking it entirely for now we also wore orange vests and baseball caps with reflective strips we didnt want some overenthusiastic hunter to mistake us for deer or raise the suspicions of a warden if we encountered one thirty minutes in we heard gunshots to the south but otherwise we might have been entirely alone in the woods the going was relatively easy for the first couple of hours but then the terrain began to change there were more ridges to climb and i could feel the strain in the backs of my legs shortly after midday we startled an adolescent buck from a copse of alder his antlers little more than extended buds and later there was a flash of brown and white to our left as a doe moved quickly through the trees she spotted us seemed to pause in confusion and changed direction cutting away from us until we lost sight of her we noticed the trace of bigger bucks and there were places where the stink of deer urine was strong enough to make one gag but those were the only large animals we saw after three hours we stopped and made coffee despite the cold i was sweating under my jacket and i was grateful for the rest louis dropped beside me how you doing city boy i said yeah like you grizzly adams he replied how much farther two hours i reckon if we keep making this kind of progress damn he pointed at the sky there were clouds gathering doesnt look good no it doesnt jackie finished brewing the coffee and served it up he gave his cup to liat and drank his own by pouring it from the pot into a small thermos he separated himself from the rest of us and stood on a small ridge looking back in the direction from which we had come i followed him up there he didnt look happy you okay i asked rattled thats all he said by what were doing and where were going in and out jackie were not planning on settling there i guess he swished the coffee around in his mouth and spat and theres the doe we saw what about it something spooked it and it wasnt us i stared out at the forest this wasnt first growth and so the foliage was still thick could have been a hunter i said even a bobcat or a lynx like i said maybe im just rattled we could hold back see if anyone comes i said but theres rain on the way and whatever hope we have of finding that plane depends on good light and we dont want to be stuck out here for a night jackie shivered i hear that come dark i want to be in a bar with a drink in my hand and that fort far behind me we returned to the others liat approached me i couldnt have mistaken the questioning look on her face but she still mouthed the words just to be sure what is it jackie was concerned that something might have spooked the doe we saw earlier i answered loud enough for angel and louis to hear something or someone following behind us she extended her hand another question what do we do it could be nothing so we keep going if there is someone following well find out who it is soon enough jackie poured the rest of the coffee into his thermos packed away his little primus stove and we moved off but there was a palpable change in our mood i found myself checking behind me as we walked and jackie and i would pause on the higher ridges seeking movement on the lower ground but we saw no one and at last we came to the fort my first thought was that fort mordant was less the thing itself than the memory of it made manifest the forest had done its best to blur and disguise its lines as though to discourage closer examination its walls were covered in poison ivy like waterfalls of green tumbling over precipices and hemlock and common juniper had taken advantage of storm damage to mature trees by using them as nurseries cairns of stones perhaps remnants of the original clearance of the land for the forts construction had become shadowed by moss lending them the aspect of funeral markers somewhere nearby must have been the actual graves of the forts original occupants but i suspected they were long lost to the woods in that i was soon to be proved wrong mordant itself bore some resemblance to the only other such fortification id seen in the state the old fort western in augusta although on a smaller scale there were guard towers at each corner about two stories high with horizontal slit windows looking over the forest inside although their roofs had long since collapsed it was possible to see the remains of buildings on three of the four inside walls with only the wall containing the main gate left free one had clearly been a stable because the stalls were still visible but there was also plenty of room for the storage of supplies the building opposite seemed to consist of one long single room and had probably served as a barracks for the men on the wall facing the gate was a smaller building but here the division of rooms was obvious quarters for the commanding officer and his illfated family there said jackie he pointed into the smaller bushes and when i looked at them from his angle i could see the rough path through them deer no a man did that angel louis and liat moved into the fort their weapons ready jackie and i remained outside but jackies attention was torn between the fort and the way that we had just come youre making me nervous jackie i said the hell with you im making myself nervous would you rather be in there perhaps it was our knowledge of its history but there was a deeply unsettling ambience about the fort despite its decay there was a sense of occupancy about it that trail between the forest and the gate had been regularly used no i would not ill take my chances out here there was a whistle from inside the fort angel louis was above whistling at least if theres trouble you can lock the gate and hide inside said jackie there is no gate if theres trouble were all taking our chances out here angel appeared at the entrance you need to take a look at this he said ill stay with jackie louis and liat were in the commanding officers living quarters the ramparts on the rear wall overhung the interior creating a natural shelter that had been augmented by a tarpaulin fixed into the wood with nails and supported by two metal bars driven into the ground i smelled excrement and urine a layer of insulating material had been attached to the walls again held in place by sheets of plastic to provide further warmth on the ground was a sleeping bag along with a halffilled five gallon container of water a small gas camping stove and canned food beans and soups for the most part it might have been the temporary home of a downandout or the hardier kind of hiker were it not for its location deep in the maine wilderness and the decorations upon the walls they were family snaps but not of any single family here were a man and a woman and two young girls all blond and next to them a man and woman on their wedding day older and darker than the people in the preceding picture around them were photos and drawings culled from newspapers and pornographic magazines cut and collaged to make new and foul illustrations all antireligious in nature the heads of christ and the virgin mary and buddha and figures that i couldnt even identify asian and middle eastern in origin transposed onto naked bodies bared obscenely they were concentrated in one corner for the most part above a makeshift stone altar adorned with shattered statuary and old bones animal and human intermingled some of the bones looked very very old among them were a handful of tarnished military buttons if i were to guess i would have said that someone had dug up the remains of the soldiers who had died here malphas i said why would he stay out here asked louis assuming wildon and the pilot died in the crash he was free and clear he could just go back to doing whatever he was doing before wildon found him could be that he didnt want to i said you think he liked the outdoor life so much he decided to spend part of his time in a ruined fort making collages from pornography it didnt sound likely liat watched us both following the conversation on our lips part of the time i said what you said he spent part of his time at the fort this doesnt look like a permanent dwelling and those pictures on the wall were put there recently where does he spend the rest of his time and why would he hole up in this place anyway if hes made a permanent home somewhere else i looked to liat but she had turned her back on us now she beckoned us to join her as she examined something carved into the wood light against dark it was a detailed representation of a young girls head two or three times normal size her hair long and curling from her scalp like the bodies of snakes her eyes had been cut deeper and larger than the rest of her the ovals of them so big that i could have placed my fist in them had they not been filled with teeth the roots of them impaled in the white wood there were more teeth in her huge mouth except these ones were rootout giving them the appearance of fangs it was terrifying in aspect and effect if youre frightened of something where better to hide than a fort i said a fort with no gates said louis a fort with bad memories i replied a fort with blood in its walls and its dirt maybe a fort like that doesnt need gates he was frightened of a little girl louis sounded skeptical if what ive heard about her is true he had good cause to be but he stayed out here even though he was scared of her i guess that plane must be real important to him liat shook her head not the plane i said she mouthed the word no then what she made it clear that she didnt know in the fading light and the shadows of the old fort i almost missed the lie almost ray wray was running he wasnt sure how it had all gone so wrong so fast but he knew now that he and joe had been out of their depth right from the start they should have backed away the first time that the kid and the woman had come near them except joe owed them and they were calling in the debt and joe had given ray to understand that these werent the kind of people on whom one reneged he was just grateful to ray for tagging along even if ray wouldnt have been anywhere near those woods if he hadnt been so desperate for cash theyd made good progress from the start the kid might have been spookier than a haunted house on halloween but the little bastard could move and there had been no complaints from the woman about the pace that had been set either on her own behalf or the kids while joe had the map and a good sense of where they were going it often seemed to ray that it was the woman who was guiding them and not the other way around when joe paused to check his malfunctioning compass the woman would simply keep on walking the kid trotting behind her and when joe and ray caught up with them there was no need to alter direction ray figured they were less than a mile from the fort when the first arrow struck his first thought was indians which was absurd and unhelpful but there was no understanding the workings of the human mind even as he hit the ground and heard joe swear hed found himself giggling and it was only when he looked up and saw the arrow buried in the trunk of a white pine that he stopped laughing and began considering that he might die out here joe was a few feet to his left trying to find the source of the arrow hunter asked ray but he asked more in hope than expectation they were still wearing their orange bibs there had been some discussion about it but ray and joe had finally taken the view that with a woman and a kid in tow it was better to be safe it would have to be one dumbass bow hunter whod shoot an arrow at someone in orange no fuckin way said joe which was just what ray had thought the flores woman was using a thick oak for cover still searching the forest for the source of the arrow joe called back to her miss flores you got any idea who that might be something darted behind a windtipped hemlock the old tree resembling an animal more than vegetation its body seemingly poised to rise up on its roots and stride through the forest the moving figure revealed itself to be a big man his head misshapen the bow clearly visible in his hand ray didnt think he just fired there was an explosion of bark from the hemlock and then joe was firing too the man retreated fast limping some yet still nimble but ray was pretty certain that one or other of them had winged him ray had seen him stumble awkwardly on the third or fourth shot upper body maybe the right arm or shoulder it was only when he and joe stopped shooting that he realized the flores woman had been shouting against the fading echo of the shots and the ringing in his ears he heard the word no the hell do you mean no asked joe he had emptied his rifle and was reloading from a prone position lying on his back while ray provided cover for him i dont want him hurt said flores miss i signed up to get you to that airplane and get you safely out again said joe he finished reloading and scanned the trees i did not sign up to get myself killed the arrow seemed to materialize in joes left leg one second he was just lying there preparing to say something else to flores and the next the threeblade head had punched its way straight through his thigh and joes mouth was wide open in a scream as the blood began to spill the wound already hemorrhaging massively ray had never seen so much blood pump so quickly from a man he moved to help as joe rose up and a second arrow hit him low in the back and ray knew instantly that joe was going to die he coughed up a great spray of red as ray crawled to him and using his friends body as cover began shooting into the forest hoping to hit something anything joe just grunted as the third arrow struck his back this one must have pierced his heart because his body shook hard once beneath ray and then went still but that final arrow had given ray an opening hed seen the figure again just as the arrow was loosed and now he had a target he got the man in his sights and was about to pull the trigger when a hand yanked his head back and the shot went wild ray took a punch to the side of the head it wasnt much of a blow but a trailing finger caught his left eye the pain blinding him for a few seconds he lashed out and felt his fist connect with lips and teeth when he looked around the boy was lying on the ground his mouth red from a split lip ray turned the rifle on the child you move and ill put a bullet in you he said but it wasnt the boy who moved to his right ray saw darina flores rise to her feet and begin walking in the direction of the old yellow birch behind which ray had glimpsed their attacker she was calling out to him calling a name malphas she said malphas the boy crawled away from ray once he was safely distant he got to his feet and followed the woman blood spilling from his damaged gums he did not look back that was when ray made his decision he tore off his orange vest and started to run we were still in the fort when the first sounds of gunfire reached us they were coming from the west as best we could tell the compasses had ceased to function effectively shortly before we came within sight of the fort and they now offered differing and constantly changing views on where magnetic north might lie i explained to liat that we were hearing shots and we joined jackie outside the fort what do you think i asked louis hunters thats a lot of gunfire and at least some of it is coming from a handgun you want to wander into somebody elses gunfight not particularly i just wonder whos shooting and at what we waited the gunfire stopped i thought that i heard a bird calling but it was no birdsong familiar to me it was angel who recognized it for what it was thats a womans voice he said we looked at one another i shrugged we go in i said ray wray had no idea where he was running to or in what direction he couldnt see the sun and he was panicking he kept waiting for the fierce tearing pain of a threebladed arrow cutting a path through his flesh but it did not come he came to an uprooted deadfall oak and collapsed behind it to catch his breath and find his bearings he watched the forest it was very still he saw no sign of movement behind him no misshapen head taking aim no bow flexed and ready to send a shaft his way he still had his rifle and about thirty rounds of ammunition as well as his pistol he also had water and food but no compass he glanced at the surrounding trees and tried to judge the moss growth upon them forest lore dictated that it would be thicker on the north side but it all looked pretty much equal to him he might as well have tossed a coin once again he checked the way that he had come and saw nothing he wondered if the woman and the boy were dead yet what was the name that she had called malthus malphas that was it the flores woman had known the name of the man who killed joe sticking him with hunting arrows like a bad child torturing an insect with pins maybe joes death had been a big mistake in which case it was just one part of the larger error in agreeing to go into these woods in the first place at least ray still had the down payment that the woman had handed over for their services if there had been time hed have searched joes pockets for his share as well but what he had was better than nothing he took another look at the nearest tree decided that the moss looked thicker on the side facing the direction in which he had just come and prepared to head south he was just getting to his feet when he caught a pale flash of movement behind him instinctively he fired there was a little girl watching him from between two white pines one older and coarserbarked than the other he could see a hole in the center of her dress where the bullet had hit he waited for her to fall horrified at what he had done but she did not move she showed no sign of pain or injury and no blood spilled from the wound she should have been dead or dying she should have been lying on her back bleeding out her life as clouds scudded across her pupils she should not have been standing and staring at the man who had just put a bullet in her ray had heard the stories but hed always hoped that they were pure foolishness tall tales like the yarns of lake monsters and hybrid wolves now he knew better im lost said the girl she reached out a hand and ray saw the broken nails and the dirt upon the fingers her eyes were blackgray coals set against the ruined whiteness of her skin stay with me ray backed off he wanted to threaten her just as he had threatened the boy but his guns were no good to him here get away from me he said im lonely said the girl her mouth hung open and a black centipede crawled from between her lips and scuttled down the front of her dress dont leave me ray kept retreating the gun leveled uselessly on the girl his feet caught in twisted roots concealed beneath a layer of dead leaves and he had to glance down to find his footing when he looked up again the girl was gone he turned in a slow circle and saw her skipping through the shadows he thought that he heard her laughing let me be he shouted he fired a shot in her direction he didnt care if she fell or didnt fall he simply wanted to keep her at bay she was circling him like a wolf closing in on wounded yet still dangerous prey what was it joe had said this was her place if he could just get out of her territory then she might prey on the woman and the boy instead she seemed to pause for a moment and this time he took aim the bullet struck her head he saw something explode from her skull and her hair blew back as if caught by a gust of air his vision blurred and he realized that he was crying this wasnt meant to happen he wasnt supposed to be shooting at a little girl he wasnt supposed to be here at all im sorry he whispered i just want you to leave me be he fired again and the girl shook her head violently but still she circled drawing ever closer to him before she retreated abruptly into the trees he could still see her though she seemed to be tensing herself for a final attempt at him he decided that his best chance lay in emptying the gun into her in the hope that the ferocity of his response might finally send her back whence she came he watched her buck as the first of the bullets hit her and this time he felt only satisfaction a weight struck ray in the chest and he heard another shot although it did not come from him he fell back against the trunk of a tree and slowly slid down the bark leaving a sticky trail of blood as he went his rifle fell from his hands as he sank to a sitting position his hands splayed by his sides he looked down and saw the wound in his chest the redness of it spreading like a new dawn rays hands hung over the wound and he sighed like a man who has just spilled soup on himself his mouth felt dry and when he tried to swallow the muscles in his throat refused to respond properly he began to choke two men appeared before him one tall and black his face and head hairless but for a neatlytrimmed graying beard at his chin the other shorter and scruffier they seemed familiar he tried to recall where he had seen them before but he was too busy bleeding out to concentrate on faces behind them appeared three other people one of them a young woman the black man kicked away rays rifle ray stretched out a hand to him he did not know why except that he was dying and dying was like drowning and a drowning man will always reach out in the hope of finding something to save him from sinking the black man took rays hand and gripped it as the seconds of rays life melted away like snowflakes in the sun it was the girl ray realized she knew that she wouldnt get him so she let these others take him instead by firing at her he had fired on them and now they had killed him for it who is he said one of the others a big bearded man who looked out of place among these others yet more at home in the woods ray tried to speak he wanted to tell them my mother gave me my name the kids used to laugh at me in school because of it i never had any luck that wasnt bad and maybe my name was the start of it it wasnt supposed to happen like this i was looking for an airplane my name is we searched the dead mans body he had two thousand dollars in cash in his pockets along with some candy bars and a suppressor for the mm pistol he carried under his coat he bore no identification louis had killed him after he fired two shots in our direction one of which had missed liat by inches and seemed set to fire a third if louis hadnt shot him then i would have but i felt shame as i stared down at this unknown man dead at our hands in the depths of the maine wilderness all to secure a list of names from a plane that might already have been consumed by the forest you recognize him said angel im not sure i said there is something about him he was in the icecream parlor back in portland louis threatened to shoot him and his buddy i guess it was meant to be said louis i guess so said angel i doubt that he came out here alone said jackie could be he was the one we heard doing all that shooting earlier said angel still doesnt answer the question of who he was shooting at before he began taking potshots at us the trail left by the gunman was clear to follow he had broken branches and trampled shrubs as he made his way through the forest it was not the careful progress of a hunter whether of animals or men this man had been running from something you reckon were still heading northwest i said to jackie far as i can tell without a working compass but id lay good money on it that plane came down somewhere near here we have to keep looking jesus said jackie we could pass within feet of it and not even see it we didnt even spot this guy until he was almost on top of us we spread out i said form a line but stay in sight of one another i couldnt see what other choice we had we needed to cover as much ground as possible and we had to do it while there was still light the downside was that we would now present five targets in a row like ducks at a sideshow shooting range so we moved on looking ahead of us and to either side and i forgot jackies fear that we were ourselves being pursued the sun was setting when we found the shrine behind it almost lost to the forest was the plane there were crows in the trees dark and still like tumors on the branches and before us stood three figures one already dying darina had seen the mans head tilt as she called his name she had no fear of him they were alike in nature after all they had buried the wildon girls together neither hesitating as the children squirmed beneath the accumulating dirt and they both shared a memory of the fall the great banishment that had left their kind marooned on a world still forming the boy followed calmly behind her picking his way carefully across twisted roots and broken branches over and over she repeated the passengers name like a mantra calming him reassuring him even though she could not see him malphas malphas remember and all around her a murder of crows seemed to echo her call she crested a rise and before her was the plane it looked like a fallen tree except that there were no other such trees around it and its body was perhaps too regular too cylindrical by now it was more than halfsubmerged as though the forest floor had turned to quicksand beneath it beyond it a pool gleamed darkly but between the plane and where she stood was a crazed jumble of broken religious statuary of skulls and bones arranged in patterns that had no meaning for her all contained beneath a framework of mud and wood to protect it from the elements of malphas there was no sign they approached the construction and stood before it the boy reached out a hand to touch one of the skulls but she stopped him before he could do so there was a buzzing in her head and she felt a kind of awe the closest she had ever come in her long existence to the fervor of a religious zealot there was a power here a purpose she took the boys hand and together they tried to understand a shadow fell across them slowly they turned malphas the passenger was silhouetted against the setting sun his distorted head surrounded by a corona of fire the bow was tensed in his hands the arrow nocked and ready darina stared into his eyes and the enormity of her mistake became clear to her there was no recognition no shared nature she saw herself reflected only in the blank hostile gaze of a predator blood flowed from a wound in his side malphas she said know me he frowned at her and the arrow spoke to darinas heart she felt a burning in her chest as the deepening orange of the fading sun was obscured by the deeper red of her own dying she put her hands close to her chest and caressed the arrow holding it gently like an offering she tried to give form to her pain but no sound came as she collapsed to the ground and as she could no longer scream for herself the boy screamed for her over and over and over the man with his back to us was huge he wore greenandbrown camouflage clothing and he held a bow in his hand to his right a boy stopped screaming as we appeared and we watched as the woman beside him toppled to the ground with her hands clutched to the arrow in her breast the big man turned and i saw the terrible wound to his head as though a meat cleaver had been taken to the top of his skull leaving a crevasse along his scalp this then was malphas the survivor the killer of the wildon girls he was completely bald his ears coming to sharp points his face strangely elongated and very very pale despite his years in the woods he resembled a giant albino bat yet though his eyes were dark and alien and he was already reaching for an arrow from the quiver at his side it was the boy who gripped my attention the boy whom i feared more than the man it was brightwell in miniature brightwell in youth from his pale moist skin to the growing goiter on his neck that would in adulthood blight his appearance still further i saw his face contort with rage as he recognized me for how often does a man get to confront his own killer all that happened next occurred both slowly and quickly jackie angel and liat hesitated before firing fearful of hitting the boy not recognizing the danger that he posed louis was faster to respond shooting just as malphas nocked a new arrow to his bow and dropped to one knee to release it i heard a beating of wings around us and a murder of crows rose into the sky louiss shot struck the shrine but it was enough to distract malphas and his arrow appeared to go wild he was already rising preparing to seek cover when the boy struck from the folds of his jacket he produced a long knife and used it to slash at the back of malphas right thigh severing the hamstring malphas toppled and the boy buried the blade in his back malphas dropped the bow and tried to reach behind him for the hilt of the knife but the movement must have forced the blade still deeper into him the tip of it slowly insistently finding his heart his mouth opened wide in silent agony the life slowly left him and he joined the woman who stared lifelessly at him from her single undamaged eye his blood mingling with hers on the woodstrewn ground but he was not the only one to fall jackie called my name and i turned to see liat stretched in pain upon the ground an arrow buried in her left shoulder while we were distracted the boy ran disappearing behind the plane and slipping into the woods beyond jackie and louis helped liat to sit while angel examined the arrow its gone straight through he said we break it take it out and strap the wound up as best we can until we can get her to a hospital i saw the three sharp blades of the arrow protruding from her upper back the wound would be bad those arrows were designed to create massive trauma already liat was shivering in shock but she still managed to point at the plane with her right hand im going to the plane i said the sooner we have that damned list the sooner we can leave what about the kid asked angel that was no kid i said i looked to louis go after him i said take him alive louis nodded and ran with me as i headed for the plane that thing on his throat he said yes it looked like the same mark that brightwell had it is brightwell i said like i told you dont kill him louis set aside his rifle and took out his pistol i hate these fucking jobs he said jackie garner suddenly moved away from angel and liat and began scanning the forest to the south his rifle raised what now said louis angel called down to us he thinks he saw someone in the woods just get the list louis told me ill check it out then go after the child or whatever you say he is the plane had sunk so far that entering it required stepping down into the cockpit at least once id managed to cut away some of the sticky creepers that were coating the door which was still ajar even all these years after vetters and scollay had first forced it open it was dark inside the windows obscured by the vegetation and i heard something scamper away from me at the back of the plane and flee into the forest through an unseen hole i turned on my flashlight and went searching for the leather satchel that harlan vetters had described to his daughter it was still there the sheaf of typewritten pages safe inside its plastic covering scattered beside the bag were various clipboards soda cans and a pair of shoes i went to the back of the plane for there was light filtering in from somewhere the plane lay at a slight upward angle the nosecone facing toward the sky the rear submerged in the earth but what had appeared to be just another part of the upper fuselage was revealed on closer examination to be a canvas sheet fixed to the metal it had probably allowed malphas to enter and leave the plane easily if he chose to do so charlie it was louiss voice i think you need to come out here on my way i said now would be good another voice spoke one that i knew well and if you have a gun mr parker id advise you to throw it out ahead of you i want to see your hands raised as you emerge if you appear with a weapon there will be blood i did as i was ordered i emerged from the plane with my hands above my head the satchel on my left shoulder and prepared to confront the collector i took it all in as soon as i stepped from the airplane liat lying against a tree her left arm hanging uselessly by her side her face pale and angel and louis in the clearing below separated by about twenty feet their weapons raised and aiming at the rise above that stinking pool of black water there partly hidden by a tree trunk stood the collector the wind causing the tails of his coat to extend behind him like wings but hardly troubling the greased lines of his hair he appeared to have dressed no differently for an excursion into the wilderness than he would have for a walk in the park dark pants worn shoes a stained white shirt buttoned to the neck and a black suit jacket and coat jackie garner knelt before him there was a strange coil of metal around his neck and silver objects along its length glittered in the dying sunlight it was only as i drew nearer that their form became clearer the coil was threaded with razor blades and fish hooks any movement by jackie or the man behind him would tear his flesh jackies body blocked a clear shot at what little of the collector was exposed just one half of his face and his right arm the muzzle of a gun pressed against the top of jackies head while the collectors eyes moved from angel to louis and back again when i appeared his eyes fixed on me but even at this distance i could see that they were different in the past their bleakness and hostility had been leavened by a kind of dry amusement at the world and its ways and the manner in which it had forced him to assume the onerous duty of executioner it was a facet of his madness but it gave him a humanity that he would otherwise have lacked without it his eyes were windows into an empty unforgiving universe a vacuum in which all things were either dead or dying here was the reaper made incarnate an entity entirely without mercy let him go i said slowly i shifted the leather satchel from my shoulder and raised it for him to see isnt this what you came for isnt this what you want liat shook her head imploring me not to hand the list over to this man but he said only is it if it is then it is not all that i want he looked at the bodies of malphas and the woman with the burned face your work he said no their own malphas killed the woman and the boy with her killed malphas in reprisal boy he has a goiter here i pointed to my neck with my free hand brightwell said the collector so its true he has come back where is he he ran into the forest we were about to go after him when you appeared you should fear him after all you killed him once as grievances go that ones hard to beat the other two though you dont have to concern yourself about they wont be coming back maybe not ever why angels die only at the hands of angels all gone now no return no new forms poof i considered what he had just told me brightwell had once died at my hand but brightwell had come back if what the collector was saying was true but he was ahead of me he smiled and his voice was filled with mockery why did you believe that you might be a fallen angel a shard of the divine discarded for your disloyalty youre nothing youre just an anomaly a virus in the system soon youll be expunged and it will be as if you had never existed your life is being measured now in minutes not hours or days not months or years youre very close to dying here because i am very close to killing you i saw louis and angel tense their bodies preparing for the gunfire to come in response the collector jerked on the coil and jackie screamed in pain lines of blood began to flow down from his neck no i said lower your weapons do it angel and louis did as i said but their fingers stayed on their triggers and their eyes did not leave the collector and why am i to die because my name is on that list you received this time the collector actually laughed the list those names were nothing they were bait footsoldiers to be sacrificed they knew the kelly woman was faltering they knew she would betray them she had never been privy to their deepest secrets and all she had were the names of those she herself had corrupted brightwell may have added your name when your paths first crossed but others ensured that it ended up on barbara kellys list it was their hope that its presence on it would convince your own friends to turn against you that they would cast you out or kill you the real list the important list is in your hands its older and its the product of many hands that list has power how do you know all this i tortured it from a woman named becky phipps before i put her to death she went hard by the end she was confessing in droplets who wanted my name to be put on that list the phipps woman died before i could get that information from her but she spoke of backers all wealthy and influential men and women but one of them more important than the rest it was simple human psychology they knew kelly was turning and they planted your name in her head they told her it was significant information that their enemies would place particular value on it and she used it just as they knew she would theyve been watching you for a long time and they were as curious about you as i was but pragmatism eventually outweighed any interest in your deeper nature now like me it seems that theyd prefer a world without you in it so this is my deal and there will be no bargaining you give yourself to me and the woman lives so too do your belligerent friends down there one life for many consider yourself a martyr to your cause otherwise ill hunt you all down and i wont rest until you and everyone you love is dead he tightened the noose around jackies neck once again twisting it as he did so and jackie screamed briefly before the constriction reduced it to a pained gurgle you havent answered my question i said why you and why now the collector ground the muzzle of his gun into jackies skull no its my turn for questions now and i have only one why did you send him why did you do it i had no idea what he was talking about and i told him the collector pressed his knee into jackies back contorting his body this one said the collector why did you send him after my after eldritch to destroy his records to kill him to kill me why i want to know tell me and then i understood the explosion i had nothing to do with it i dont believe you i did not do it on my life it is on your life it is on all your lives i looked at jackie he was trying to talk let him speak i said the collector eased the pressure on the noose and it hung from jackies flesh by its hooks i didnt know said jackie so softly that we could barely hear him i swear i didnt know oh jackie i said jackie what have you done they told me there would be nobody in the building they told me that nobody would get hurt he spoke in a monotone he was not pleading he was confessing who jackie who told you it was a phone call they knew about my mother they knew that she was sick and i didnt have the money to help her so i got a call offering me a job and i was given a down payment in cash a lot of cash with the promise of more to come all i had to do was cause an explosion i didnt ask any questions i just took the money and did the job but i wanted to be sure that there was going to be nobody in the building when it happened so i didnt set a timer i used a cell phone to detonate it instead i made the call when i saw that the old man and the woman had left the office but then the woman went back im sorry im so sorry nobody spoke for a moment there was nothing to say it seems that i misjudged you mr parker said the collector although i must admit that im disappointed i thought that id finally found an excuse to be rid of you dont hurt him i said at last there must be a way out of this what will you do asked the collector will you take his place will you hand him over to the law youre a hypocrite mr parker youve done bad things youve used the ends to justify the means there have even been times when ive considered you for my collection have you felt the urge to unburden yourself to the police to tell them of bodies in swamps of dead men in bus station restrooms i do not trust you i do not trust any of you ill trade you i said my friend for the list the list i have enough names in my head to last me a hundred lifetimes if i killed one every hour it would still be no more than an echo of the greater reckoning to come your crusade is not mine what i want is vengeance what i want is blood and i will have it but take your friend then i release him see he lifted the end of the noose and let it fall from his hand staying low and still using jackie as a shield he began to retreat into the forest his blackness becoming a part of the greater dark until only his voice remained i warned you mr parker i told you that all those who stood by you would die it has already begun it continues now there was the sound of a shot and jackie garners chest spat a cloud of blood angel and louis both began to move but a second shot came then a third both exploding inches from my feet stop said the collector stop or the girl is next liat was closer to him than any of us but she couldnt hear anything that he was saying she was afraid to move afraid of what might happen if she did so we stood and we watched jackie garner die i can kill her now came the shout from the forest i have her in my sights now walk toward me mr parker and throw the satchel up no tricks no short throws i get the list and you all live i held the satchel high by its strap and threw it hard but not in the direction of the forest instead i launched it into the dark pool it seemed to rest on the black viscous water for too long before disappearing soundlessly into its depths i saw liats eyes widen and she stretched out her good hand as though somehow hoping to draw the bag back to her by sheer force of will i stood and waited for the final shot to come but there was only that voice fainter now as the collector moved deeper into the forest i heard a noise above my head and saw a single raven separate itself from the crows and fly north that was a mistake it said you know mr parker i dont think that you and i are going to be friends any more the boy did not know where he was going he was angry and griefstricken the woman who had been mother and more to him was lost and he had seen again the face of the man who had briefly sent him into the void into the pain of nonbeing he wanted to kill him but he wasnt strong enough yet he had not even properly regained the power of speech the words were in his head but he could not form them with his lips or force his tongue to speak them so he ran through the woods and he wept for the woman and he plotted his revenge there was a buzzing in his head the voice of the god of wasps the reflected man but so lost was the boy in his rage and hurt that he was not able to understand it as a warning until he was already aware of being followed there was a presence among the trees shadowing him as he unwittingly ran further north at first he feared that it might be parker or one of those who stood by him come to finish him off he stopped at a copse of low cypress and crouched low behind them watching and listening he glimpsed movement a flicker of black on green like burnt paper blown by the wind he tried to recall if any of those at the plane had been dressed in black and decided that they had not nevertheless there was danger here the voice told him so his right hand searched the ground beside him and found a rock the size of his fist he clutched it tightly he would have only one chance to use it and he would have to make it count if he could hit his pursuer in the head then the impact would give him time to pounce he could use the same rock to beat him or her to death more movement closer this time the figure was small only a little taller than himself the boy was puzzled could it be an animal of some kind even a dark wolf were there wolves in these woods he did not know the thought of being attacked by a carnivorous animal frightened him more than the threat posed by any human being he feared unreasoning hunger the sensation of teeth tearing at his flesh of claws ripping his skin he feared being consumed the girl appeared from behind a tree barely ten feet from where he lay how she had moved so quickly without being seen he did not know but he reacted instantly firing the rock and watching with satisfaction as it struck the girl above her right eye causing her to stumble but not lose her footing he prepared to move on her but the buzzing in his head rose to a crescendo and he saw that no blood came from the wound in the girls head he could discern clearly where the rock had impacted by the abrasion on her skin but other than the initial shock of the blow she appeared untroubled by hurt she did not even seem angry she simply stared at the boy then raised her right hand and silently beckoned him to her with a crook of a filthy index finger its nail long gone that unreasoning hunger that the boy had feared to find in an animal was now manifested in another more terrible form this was not really a child no more than he himself was one this was loneliness and fear hatred and hurt all bound up in the skin of a little girl cut her open the boy thought and biting bugs and poisonous snakes would tumble from her innards she was neither good nor evil and was therefore beyond the remit of the boy and those like him beyond even the god of wasps himself she was pure want he backed away from her and she made no move to follow him she simply kept crooking her finger as though certain that if she persisted he would eventually surrender to her but he had no intention of succumbing the boy in all of his incarnations had encountered many threats and understood the nature of most entities he saw in this one a tethered beast she was a dog on a chain free to roam within certain boundaries but ultimately constrained if he could move beyond the limits of her domain he would be safe he turned and ran heedless once more of the direction caring only that he put as much distance between the girl and himself as he could it was growing dark quickly and he wanted to be well beyond her reach before night fell she moved again staying with him a fleeting blur between the trees he gasped for breath he was not healthy had never been healthy and although he was capable of summoning massive strength when required he could do so only in short bursts lengthy pursuits either as hunted or hunter were anathema to him there was a pain in his side and the goiter at his neck throbbed angrily he could not keep up this pace for much longer he paused to catch his breath leaning against a tree and saw the luminous shape of the girl continue north then pause she looked around and he threw himself to the ground was it possible that she had trouble seeing in the dark he watched her slowly retrace her steps her head slowly twisting left and right seeking any sign of movement she was gradually making her way toward where he lay if he moved again she would be on him if he stayed where he was she would discover him he was trapped the tree behind him was massive and old some of its roots as thick as the boys body its great spreading branches now entirely bare as twisted as arthritic limbs at the base of its trunk was a vaguely triangular hole perhaps the lair of a weasel or other small mammal widened over time by the actions of nature beside it lay a broken branch about three feet in length it was as thick as his wrist and sharp at one end the boy gently scuttled backwards until his feet were in the hole it would be a tight squeeze but he could make it once inside he could hide from the girl and if she found him he could keep her at bay with the stick the blow from the rock might not have stopped her entirely but she had clearly felt the force of it the stick might be enough to torment her and make her keep her distance all the boy knew was that he could run no longer and here he must make his stand back back he went until the edges of the hole were biting into his sides there was a moment when he felt sure that he was stuck incapable of going forward or back but he wriggled his flabby body and the hole seemed to suck him in once inside he stayed quiet and still he could see nothing except the patch of forest beyond and even that was growing dimmer as the darkness drew in but he caught sight of the girls form as she passed into view she was crouching as she walked her upper body slightly extended her fingers curled like claws he thought that he heard her sniffing at the air and her head turned so that she seemed to be looking straight at him he held tightly to the stick ready to thrust the point at her if she came he would aim for one of her eyes he decided he wondered if the stick was strong enough to impale her on the ground he had a vision of her struggling against it like a dying moth it made him smile but she did not approach him and instead moved on he realized that he had been holding his breath and let it out in a gasp of relief the sound of the god of wasps subsided a little for which the boy was grateful after a few minutes he shifted position trying to make himself more comfortable he used the stick to test the limits of the hole and found that it was bigger than he had anticipated he could not have stood up inside it but there was room for him to stretch out his legs if he curled up a little he might even be able to sleep but he would not sleep not with the girl outside roaming searching to pass the time and keep himself amused he sorted through his memories the great rush of them that had returned to him when he heard again the voice of the man who had tried to destroy him the hated detective his time would come once the boy had found more of his own kind and grown big and strong again he would take the detective this man whose nature even the boy did not understand and in a deep dark place he would discover the truth about him first though he would kill the detectives woman and his child just as his first woman and child had been taken from him in blade and blood but this time the detective would be forced to watch as it happened there was a circularity about it that appealed to the boy the woods grew black and he heard the scurrying of night creatures twice the darkness before him was lit by the passing luminescence of the girl and he heard her calling to him coaxing him into revealing himself she promised to show him the way out of the forest swore that she would guide him to safety if only he would play with her for a little while he did not answer and he did not move he stayed where he was and prayed to the god of wasps to sacrifice a little of the night so that dawn might come more quickly he did not remember sleep coming there was no instance where his eyes briefly closed only for him to realize what was happening and jolt himself awake there was only wakefulness and then sleep when he opened his eyes again he was slumped against the inside of the tree it was still dark outside but the texture of the night had changed and the woods were silent something had caused him to wake though he was aware of a disturbance a sound from close by he also desperately needed to pee and he was very very cold the boy listened yes there it was again a scuffling a digging an animal maybe some mammal hunting for buried prey it was coming from nearby but he could not pinpoint the precise source the noise echoed inside the tree further distorting his perception with it came the warning buzz in his head as the god of wasps called to him in a voice that he still could not yet fully comprehend it was coming from his right he decided now he could hear the scratching of claws against the tree trunk he leaned over his ear close to the wood his face barely six inches from the ground what are you he thought what are you a small hand exploded from the dirt between his legs and gripped his face he felt fingers on his skin digging deep into his flesh one found his open mouth and he bit down hard upon it severing it entirely but the grip did not weaken a jagged nail dug into his right eye and a fierce intimate pain insinuated itself into his skull the presence in the dirt rose up still further now not just a forearm but a head and a torso the girls sickly light infected the gloom as she ascended her right hand forcing itself deeper and deeper into the boys face her left pushing against the ground for leverage he struggled hard tearing at her dead flesh with one hand while the other scrabbled in the dirt until he found the stick he raised it as high as he could before stabbing down and felt it enter the girls body she spasmed and he struck again but he was sinking now and he sensed collapse all around him the girl was no longer forcing herself up instead she was dragging him down deep into that lonely place in which she herself had been interred with its ceiling of roots and its walls of dirt where the beetles and the millipedes scuttled over her bones the stick caught in the dirt and snapped the earth rose to the boys chest then his neck and finally his chin he opened his mouth but the earth silenced his final scream and the girl had her playmate at last i do not know if all that i have shared with you is true some of it i experienced and some of it was told to me some of it i may have dreamed i picked up fragments from grady vetters once he had recovered consciousness together we visited his sister at the hospital she was still deep in her coma the comatose state into which she had been plunged by the needle had not been alleviated by the coma cocktail of drugs with which she had been treated in the end she had not been as strong as her brother not physically combined with restrictions on her breathing caused by the position in which she had been left on the couch the injection had left her with hypoxic brain damage marielle slept and it seemed that she would never wake again we left jackie garners body in the plane to protect it from animals later the wardens retrieved it and he was brought back to his mother and his girlfriend for burial the bodies of the woman named darina flores and the man known as malphas were taken to augusta for examination what happened to them after that i do not know liat managed to walk out of the forest with each of us taking turns supporting her by the end she was barely conscious she refused to look at me or even to recognize my presence beside her while i was helping her she had been sent to ensure the lists safe retrieval and she had failed in the darkness we came upon the road that we had taken into the wilderness louis and angel stayed with liat while i went to get the truck only when i started driving did i notice that jackies totem the necklace of bear claws that hung from his rear view mirror was gone and i wondered when the collector had added it to his trove before he killed jackie or after i took liat to the local medical center and explained that she had fallen on an arrow stranger things had happened it seemed for the doctor on duty barely blinked an eye and arrangements were made to transfer her immediately to bangor i explained that she could neither speak nor hear but could read lips i then called epstein and told him most of what had occurred when he asked if the list was safe i answered yes but nothing more after all it was in its way shortly before dawn i drove my own car back up that timber company road and returned to the forest this time i was prepared i was still two miles from the wreckage of the plane when i picked up the beacons signal on my cell phone twenty feet from the plane at the base of a white pine i found the list i had not thrown it far from the airplane just far enough some small animal had already nibbled at the plastic but the package remained more or less intact the little beacon i had placed inside it blinking redly of the boy who was brightwell there was no sign but days later while the search of the area continued and the police began gathering and identifying the remains of those killed by malphas one of the boys shoes was discovered near the hollow tree trunk of a massive oak and it was thought that he might have been taken by a bear i told the investigators most of what i knew at that point about the airplane for i was nothing if not adept at hiding truths gordon walsh was among the police who questioned me although the north of the state no longer fell into his remit he had been sent to observe he said but i did not ask by whom i told them that marielle vetters had hired me to find the plane for she believed that her fathers silence about its existence might have caused unnecessary pain for the families of those who had been aboard when it crashed and who still waited for some knowledge of the fate of their loved ones i left out only the existence of the list and something of my knowledge of the collector although i gave a detailed description of him to the police and fed them the link to the lawyer eldritch after all i owed nothing to either of them now i told the police too about jackies final sin the one that had led to his death one cannot libel the dead and lying to protect jackies reputation or to spare the feelings of those who loved him would have caused more problems than telling the truth slowly a narrative began to emerge that was if not entirely satisfactory then plausible the collector had come seeking revenge for the fatal explosion and the woman and the boy were searching for the plane for unknown reasons of their own possibly connected to the man named malphas but perhaps also in the belief that some money remained hidden in the plane meanwhile the process of identifying the remains of malphass victims began two men subsequently identified as joe dahl and ray wray were added to his list of victims and i said nothing to contradict that assumption with so much else to occupy their time the forces of law and order seemed content to let any holes in my story remain unexplained and in a corner gordon walsh watched and he listened it was walsh who first asked for more information about liat once her connection to what had happened was discovered i told him that she was eventfully an expert on aviation history a claim she duly confirmed when it was eventually put to her as walsh wasnt about to try to interrogate a deaf and dumb woman about a subject on which he knew nothing he let that one slide before he left falls end though he made it clear to me that assuming i lived long enough he expected to hear at some future date a more detailed version of events than the one he had just been offered by the time the investigators reached the private medical center where the lawyer eldritch was being treated they found that he had been released from the care of his physicians into the custody of a man who claimed to be his son and no trace of him could be found subsequently it appeared that the ruined building that had once housed his office was actually owned by an elderly couple who ran a pawnbroking operation nearby and their agreement with their missing tenant had rested on a handshake and nothing more the damaged building was torn down within weeks and the insurance money when it came was swallowed by their pockets one month after all this had occurred epstein came to visit me liat was with him as well as one of those seemingly interchangeable young menat arms upon whom he relied for his safety epstein and i walked for a time on ferry beach liat and her companion watching us from a distance why did you destroy the list epstein finally asked what would you have done with it i replied watched investigated killed he shrugged perhaps before or after those people named upon it could act he shrugged again sometimes preventive actions are necessary thats why i destroyed it i said in the right hands it could have proved most useful in the right hands i echoed from what i hear liat was at risk of death because of what you did the collector threatened her life unless the list was given to him he wasnt going to kill her you seem very sure of that he has a code its a twisted blasted thing but its a code nonetheless he wouldnt have killed her because of something that i did he would only have killed her for something that she herself had done i didnt believe that she was guilty of something that would have brought the collector down upon her i will try to explain that distinction to her i fear that if you were to attempt to do so she might try to shoot you we reached the end of the beach and turned back the sun had begun to set as we turned to the north the wind breathing winter on our faces what do you think malphas was doing out there said epstein liat spoke of an altar a kind of shrine malphas had a dent in his head big enough to hold a book i said he was braindamaged you think even he knew for sure what he was doing he certainly had a purpose liat said that the altar faced north a northfacing altar in a northern state how far north can one go do you think before there is nothing left nothing to worship only snow and ice we walked on in silence until we were back at the parking lot this is north said epstein as his young man started the car liat standing by an open rear door their departure now imminent this place planes crash here and are slowly sucked into the ground killers come here and meet their end dark angels spread their wings above its ground and are brought down by their enemies and you you are here i used to believe that it was you to whom they were drawn in this place but now i think that i may have been wrong there is something else here it called to malphas and it tried to hide that plane it calls to them all even if theyre unaware of its voice that is what liat believes and now that is what i believe we shook hands it is a shame about that list said epstein and while his right hand clasped mine tightly he rested his left hand upon both and his eyes searched my face for any hint that what he suspected might well be true whatever was in the bag at the bottom of that dark pond it was not the list you know i sent some of my people into the interior to search for it but to no avail it seems that body of water is very deep lets just hope that the list rests in a safe place i can think we can be sure of that i replied they left me then i faced the north as though from where i stood i might see far far beyond deep into the darkness of the great north woods the woods and whatever lay buried deep beneath them buried and waiting
