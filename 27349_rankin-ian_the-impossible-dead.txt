the impossible dead ian rankin one hes not here the desk sergeant said so where is he out on a call fox stared hard at the man knowing it wouldnt do any good the sergeant was one of those oldtimers who reckoned theyd seen it all and faced most of it down fox glanced at the next name on his list haldane sick leave michaelson out on the call with di scholes tony kaye was standing just behind foxs left shoulder an instant before the words were out of his mouth fox knew what his colleague was going to say this is taking the piss fox turned to give kaye a look news would now travel through the station job done the complaints had come to town found no one home and had let their annoyance show the desk sergeant shifted his weight from one foot to the other trying not to seem too satisfied at this turn of events fox took a moment to study his surroundings the notices pinned to the walls were the usual stuff it was a modern police station meaning it could just as easily have been the reception area of a doctors surgery or dss office as long as you disregarded the sign warning that the alert status had been lifted from low to moderate nothing to do with fox and his men thered been reports of a blast in woodland outside lockerbie kids probably and a good long way from kirkcaldy nevertheless every police station in the country would have been notified the button on the counter had a hand written sign next to it saying press for attention which was what fox had done three or four minutes ago there was a twoway mirror behind the counter and the desk sergeant had almost certainly been watching the three arrivals inspector malcolm fox sergeant tony kaye and constable joe naysmith the station had been told they were coming interviews had been arranged with di scholes and dss haldane and michaelson think this is the first time weve had this stunt pulled on us kaye was asking the desk sergeant maybe well start the interviews with you instead fox flipped to the second sheet of paper in his folder how about your boss superintendent pitkethly shes not in yet kaye made a show of checking his watch meeting at hq the desk sergeant explained joe naysmith standing to foxs right seemed more interested in the leaflets on the counter fox liked that it spoke of easy confidence the confidence that these officers would be interviewed that delaying tactics were nothing new to the complaints the complaints the term was already outdated even though fox and his team couldnt help using it at least among themselves complaints and conduct had been their official title until recently now they were supposed to be professional ethics and standards next year theyd be something else again the name standards and values had been mooted to nobodys liking they were the complaints the cops who investigated other cops which was why those other cops were never happy to see them and seldom entirely cooperative hq means glenrothes fox checked with the desk sergeant thats right how long to drive there twenty minutes provided you dont get lost the phone on the desk behind the sergeant started to ring you can always wait he said turning to lift the receiver keeping his back to fox as he started a muffled conversation joe naysmith was holding a pamphlet about home security he plonked himself on one of the chairs by the window and started reading fox and kaye shared a look what do you reckon kaye asked at last whole towns out there waiting to be explored kirkcaldy a coastal town in fife kaye had driven them there in his car forty minutes from edinburgh most of them spent in the outside lane as they had crossed the forth road bridge theyd discussed the long queue of traffic on the opposite carriageway heading into the capital at the start of another working day coming over here stealing our jobs kaye had joked sounding his horn and giving a wave naysmith seemed to be the one with the local knowledge linoleum hed said used to be what kirkcaldy was famous for and adam smith who did he play for kaye had asked he was an economist what about gordon brown fox had added kirkcaldy naysmith had confirmed nodding slowly now standing in the police stations reception area fox weighed up his options they could sit and wait growing restless or he could phone his boss in edinburgh with a complaint of his own his boss would then call fife hq and eventually something would happen the equivalent of a wee boy running to his daddy when the big kids done something or fox looked at kaye again kaye smiled and batted naysmiths leaflet with the back of his hand break out the pith helmets young joe he said were heading into the wild they parked the car on the seafront and stood for a few moments staring out across the firth of forth towards edinburgh looks sunny over there kaye complained buttoning his coat bet you wish youd worn more than a donkey jacket joe naysmith had become inured to comments about his latest designer buy but he did turn the collar up there was a fierce wind blowing in from the north sea the water was choppy and puddles along the promenade offered evidence that the tide was prone to break over the sea wall the gulls overhead looked to be working hard at staying airborne there was something odd about the design of this waterfront almost no use had been made of it buildings tended to face away from the view and towards the town centre fox had noted this elsewhere in scotland from fort william to dundee the planners seemed to deny the existence of any shoreline hed never understood it but doubted kaye and naysmith would be able to help joe naysmiths suggestion had been a beach walk but tony kaye was already heading for one of the wynds leading uphill towards kirkcaldys shops and cafes leaving naysmith to dig out eightyfive pence in change for the parking the narrow main street had roadworks on it kaye crossed to the other side and kept climbing wheres he going naysmith complained tony has a nose fox explained not just any old cafe will do kaye had stopped at a doorway made sure they could see him then headed inside the pancake place was light and spacious and not too busy they took a corner table and tried to look like regulars fox often wondered if it was true that cops the world over tended to act the same he liked corner tables where he could see everything that was happening or might be about to happen naysmith hadnt quite learned that lesson yet and seemed happy enough to sit with his back to the door fox had squeezed in next to kaye eyes scanning the room finding only women intent on their conversations past being interested in the three new arrivals they studied their menus in silence placed an order and waited a few minutes for the waitress to return with a tray goodlooking scone naysmith commented getting to work with his knife and the pat of lowfat spread fox had brought the folder with him dont want you getting too comfortable he said emptying its contents on to the table while the teas cooling you can be refreshing your memories is it worth the risk tony kaye asked what risk a smear of butter on the cover sheet wont look exactly professional when were doing the interviews im feeling reckless today fox countered ill take a chance with a sigh from kaye the three men started reading paul carter was the reason theyd come to fife carter held the rank of detective constable and had been a cop for fifteen years he was thirtyeight years old and came from a family of cops both his father and an uncle had served in fife constabulary the uncle alan carter had actually made the original complaint against his nephew it involved a drug addict sexual favours and turning a blind eye two other women then came forward to say that paul carter had arrested them for drunken behaviour but offered to drop any charges if they would be accommodating does anybody actually ever say accommodating kaye muttered halfway down a page courtroom and newspapers naysmith replied brushing crumbs from his own copy of the case notes malcolm fox had some of those newspaper reports in front of him there were photos of paul carter leaving court at the end of a days testimony puddingbowl haircut face pitted by acne giving the photographer a hard stare it was four days since the guilty verdict had been delivered along with the sheriffs comment that detective constable carters own colleagues seemed either wilfully stupid or wilfully complicit meaning theyd known for years carter was a bad cop but theyd protected him lied for him maybe even attempted to falsify witness statements and put pressure on witnesses not to come forward all of which had brought the complaints to town fife constabulary needed to know and in order to reassure the public and more importantly the media that the investigation would be rigorous they had asked a neighbouring force to run the inquiry fox had been given a copy of fife constabularys suspension policy and suspension process considerations along with the chief constables written report outlining why the three officers under investigation were still at work this being in the best interests of the force fox took a sip of tea and skimmed another page of notes almost every sentence had been underlined or highlighted the margins were filled with his own scribbled queries concerns and exclamation marks he knew most of it by heart could stand up and recite it to the cafes customers maybe they were gossiping about it anyway in a town this size sides would have been taken opinions rigidly formed carter was a slimeball a sleazebag a predator or hed been stitched up by a lowlife junkie and a couple of cheap dates where was the harm in anything hed done and what had he done anyway not much except bring his police force into disrepute reminds me a bit of colin balfour tony kaye said remember him fox nodded edinburgh cop who liked to visit the cells if women were being held overnight the prosecution against him had faltered but an internal inquiry had seen him kicked off the force anyway interesting that the uncles the one who spoke up naysmith commented drawing them back to the current case but only after he retired from the force fox added even so must have stirred up the family a bit could be some history there kaye offered bad blood could be naysmith agreed kaye slapped a hand down on the pile of papers in front of him so where does any of this get us how many days are we going to be shuttling backwards and forwards as many as it takes might only be a week or two kaye rolled his eyes just so fife constabulary can say theyve got one bad apple and not a whole cider factory do they make cider in factories naysmith asked where do you think they make it fox didnt bother joining in he was wondering again about the main player paul carter there was no use trying to interview the man even though he was available hed been found guilty held in custody but had yet to receive a sentence the sheriff was deliberating fox reckoned carter would go to jail couple of years and maybe a listing on the sex offenders register he was almost certainly talking to his lawyers about an appeal yes hed talk to his legal team but not to the complaints the man had nothing to gain by grassing up his mates at the station the ones whod stood by him fox couldnt offer him any kind of deal the most they could hope for was that he would let something slip if he talked at all which he wouldnt fox doubted anyone would talk or rather theyd talk but say nothing worth hearing theyd had plenty of warning this day was coming scholes haldane michaelson the sheriff had singled them out for their conflicting or confused testimony their muddying of the water their memory lapses their immediate boss in cid detective chief inspector laird had escaped criticism as had a detective constable called forrester forresters the one we should be talking to kaye said suddenly breaking off from his argument with naysmith why because her first names cheryl my years of experience tell me that makes her a woman and and if one of her colleagues was a sex pest surely shed have had an inkling surrounded by blokes circling the wagons when the rumours start flying shes got to know something kaye rose to his feet whos for a refill let me check first fox took out his phone and found the number for the station maybe scholes is back from his wee jaunt he punched in the number and waited while kaye flicked the back of naysmiths head with a finger and offered his services as a barber hello it was a womans voice di scholes please whos calling fox looked around the cafe im from the pancake place he was in earlier and we think he left something hold on ill put you through thank you fox ended the call and started gathering up all the paperwork nicely played tony kaye said then to naysmith back into your donkey jacket joe lets get that jackhammer started detective inspector ray scholes ran a hand through his short black hair he was seated in the stations only interview room fox had offered him any location he liked as long as it had a table and four chairs and a socket joe naysmith had added the socket was for the electrical adaptor naysmith had set up the video camera and was now just about finished with the audio recorder there were two microphones one pointed at scholes and one centred between fox and tony kaye kaye had his arms folded a scowl on his face hed already told scholes how much theyd enjoyed his little ruse i dont call official police business a ruse scholes had shot back at him on the other hand this almost certainly qualifies as a waste of time only almost malcolm fox had responded busying himself with the paperwork all set naysmith was now telling them happy to start fox asked scholes scholes was nodding when his phone sounded he answered it by identifying himself as ray scholes public enemy number one sounded like his girlfriend on the other end asking him to pick up something for dinner but she knew about the complaints yeah theyre here scholes drawled eyes on fox fox drew a finger across his throat but scholes was in no hurry when he eventually ended the call fox asked if the phone could be switched off scholes shook his head never know when something importants going to crop up how long before it rings again fox asked will it be her every time or have you split the task between your friends fox looked towards tony kaye what is it usually five minutes or ten ten kaye stated definitively fox turned his attention back to ray scholes i doubt theres anything you can do that hasnt been tried a hundred times so why not just switch the phone off scholes managed a bit of a smile as he complied fox thanking him with a nod was dc carter a good cop in your opinion fox then asked still is we both know hes not coming back how come you hate cops so much fox stared at the man across the desk scholes was in his midthirties but looked younger a freckled face and milkyblue eyes an odd image flashed up in foxs memory a big bag of marbles hed owned as a boy his favourite had been a paleblue one its flaws only visible when you peered at it turning it slowly between your fingers thats an original question tony kaye was answering scholes i doubt were asked that more than a few dozen times a month i just dont know why youd want to punish everyone whos ever worked with paul not everyone fox corrected him just the names mentioned by the sheriff scholes snorted call that a sheriff ask anyone on the force colin cardonalds just the man to stick the knife in number of cases where hes tried everything possible to swing it the defendants way theres always one kaye conceded was there any history between sheriff cardonald and dc carter fox asked a bit and between the judge and yourself fox waited but no answer came are you saying that sheriff cardonald singled out certain names because of a grudge no comment a complaint was made about paul carter almost a year back wasnt it his own uncle said carter had admitted taking advantage of a woman the claim was investigated fox made show of looking for the relevant page in his notes nothing ever came of it scholes stated not straight away not until teresa collins decided shed had enough fox paused did you know carters uncle he was a cop thats a yes then why do you think he said what he said scholes shrugged yet another grudge and the three women the original complainant plus the two who came forward later more grudges lot of grudges piling up against your friend the good cop paul carter fox leaned back in his chair feigning interest in some of the pages of text the newspaper cuttings were in full view on the desk kaye and naysmith knew that silence was useful sometimes and that when fox leaned back like that it wasnt because hed run out of questions naysmith checked the equipment kaye studied his wristwatch is that the starters finished then scholes asked eventually are we moving on to the meat and veg meat and veg where you try taking me down with paul where you make out i lied in court tried putting the fear on the witnesses teresa collins states that you were in the car with carter when he pulled up beside her and told her hed be coming to her house later that day for sex i wasnt when she made her complaint you phoned her and tried to get her to withdraw it no her mobile phone had your number in it date time and duration of call as i said in court it was a mistake how long did the call last eighteen seconds right soon as i realised i hung up why did you have her number it was on a bit of paper on one of the desks in the office you got curious so you called the mystery number thats it tony kaye was shaking his head slowly making evident his disbelief so you deny telling her to fox glanced at his notes again back the fuck off yes did you spend time with carter when the two of you were off duty few beers now and then and clubs away days to edinburgh and glasgow its no secret thats right it all came out in court scholes snorted cops stick together and like a drink now and then hold the front page carter was a dc youre a di so so hed never been promoted lowest rank in cid and hed been a cop as long as you not everybody wants promotion not everybody merits it fox stated which was it with paul carter scholes was opening his mouth to answer when the interview room door opened there was a uniformed woman there sorry to interrupt she said not looking sorry at all thought id better say hello she saw that naysmith was switching off the recorders reaching the desk she introduced herself as superintendent isabel pitkethly fox stood up with a certain reluctance and offered his hand for her to shake inspector malcolm fox he stated everything all right pitkethly looked around the room got everything you need were fine she was almost a foot shorter than fox but much the same age early forties collarlength brown hair blue eyes glinting behind her spectacles she wore a regulation white blouse with epaulettes at the shoulders dark skirt falling to just above her knees ray behaving himself she gave a nervous laugh and fox could see that the past few weeks had left their mark on her she probably saw herself as captain of a tight ship and now the structure had been damaged from within we were only just getting started tony kaye said not bothering to disguise the complaint funny i thought we were on to cheese and biscuits scholes countered di scholes does actually have to be at another meeting in five minutes pitkethly said procurator fiscal has a case to prepare scholes wasted no time getting to his feet gentlemen its been a pleasure how soon can we have him back fox asked pitkethly midafternoon probably unless the fiscal has other ideas scholes had switched his phone back on and was checking for messages couple of missed calls scholes looked at fox and smiled how did you guess pitkethly seemed to be wondering the same thing can i have a word in my office inspector fox i was about to suggest it fox answered a minute later kaye and naysmith were alone together in the interview room do i pack it all up naysmith asked his hand resting on the tripod better had cant trust scholes and his crew not to come in here and wipe their cocks over everything sit down pitkethly instructed from behind her desk fox stayed standing the desk was empty there was another at a right angle to it and this second desk boasted a computer and busylooking intray the window had a view on to the car park outside there were no knickknacks on the sill no photos of loved ones the walls were bare except for a no smoking sign and a yearplanner been here long fox asked few months and before that he could see she was annoyed somehow he was the one getting to ask the questions but politeness demanded an answer glenrothes hq wouldnt it be quicker just to look at my file fox raised both hands by way of apology and when she nodded towards the chair he decided not to refuse a second time im sorry i wasnt here this morning she began i was hoping the two of us might have had this discussion before your work began it sounded like a prepared speech because that was what it was pitkethly probably had friends at hq in glenrothes and had gone there for a bit of advice on dealing with the complaints fox could have written the script for her most cases someone up the chain of command would invite him to their office and tell him the same thing this is a good crew here weve got work to do its in nobodys interest that officers are kept back from their duties naturally no one wants a whitewash but all the same so if any concerns could be brought to me in the first instance colour had risen to pitkethlys cheeks fox wondered how elated shed been when promotion had come when shed been offered her own station to run and now this shed been told what to say but hadnt had time for a rehearsal her voice drifted off and she started to clear her throat almost bringing on a fit of coughing fox liked her all the better for this apparent awkwardness he realised shed maybe called in no favours but had been summoned to glenrothes heres what you have to get through to him superintendent can i get you a drink he asked some water but she waved the offer away he leaned forward a little in his chair for what its worth he said well try to be discreet and quick that doesnt mean well be cutting corners i promise you well be thorough and we cant give you any tipoffs our report goes to your chief constable its up to him what he does with it she had managed to compose herself she was nodding her eyes focused on his were not in the business of making waves he went on this too was a speech hed made many times in rooms much like this we just want the truth we want to know procedures were followed and no one thinks theyre somehow above the law if you can help us get that message across to your officers that would be great if theres a room we could use as a base so much the better it needs to be lockable and ill need all the keys im hoping well be out of your hair in a week he decided not to add or two a week she echoed he couldnt decide if this was coming as good or bad news to her i was told this morning that ds haldanes on sick leave flu she confirmed flu palsy or plague we need him for interview she nodded again ill make sure he knows a bit of local knowledge might be useful too just where we can get a decent lunch or sandwich but nowhere your officers would go ill have a think she was getting to her feet signalling the end of the meeting fox stayed in his seat did you ever have an inkling about dc carter it took her a few moments to decide whether she was going to answer at the end of which she shook her head none of the women working here he pressed what gossip in the toilets warnings of wandering hands nothing she stated never any doubts none she said firmly crossing to the door and holding it open for him fox took his time gave her a little smile as he passed her kaye and naysmith were waiting for him at the end of the corridor well kaye asked much as expected michaelson might be around want him next fox shook his head lets go back into town grab a bite drive around a bit just to get a feel for the place kaye guessed just to get a feel for the place fox confirmed kirkcaldy boasted a railway station a football club a museum and art gallery and a college named after adam smith there were streets of solid prosperouslooking victorian villas some of which had been turned into offices and businesses further out were housing schemes some of them so recent there were still plots waiting to be sold a couple of parks at least two high schools and some s highrises the dialect was not impenetrable and shoppers stopped to talk to each other outside the bakeries and newsagents im nodding off here tony kaye commented at one point he was in his own cars passenger seat joe naysmith driving and fox in the back lunch had comprised filled rolls and packets of crisps fox had called their boss in edinburgh to make an initial report the call had lasted no more than three minutes so kaye asked turning in his seat to make eye contact with fox i like it fox answered staring at the passing scene shall i tell you what i see foxy i see people who should be at work this time of day scroungers and the walking wounded coffindodgers jakeys and asbos joe naysmith had started humming the tune to what a wonderful world every car weve passed kaye went on undeterred the drivers either a drug dealer or hes hotwired it the pavements need hosing down and so do half the kids it tells you all you need to know about a place when the biggest shop seems to be called rejects he paused for effect and youre telling me you like it youre seeing what you want to see tony and then letting your imagination run riot kaye turned to naysmith and as for you you werent even born when that song came out so you can shut it my mum had the record well the cassette anyway or maybe the cd kaye was looking at fox again can we please go back and ask our questions get whatever answers they want to dump on us and then vamoose the hell out of here when did cds start appearing naysmith asked kaye punched him on the shoulder whats that for cruelty to my gearbox have you ever even driven a car before okay fox said you win joe take us back to the station left or right at the next junction enoughs enough tony kaye said making to open the glove box im plugging in the satnav detective sergeant gary michaelson had grown up in greenock but lived in fife since the age of eighteen hed attended adam smith college then done his police training at tulliallan he was three years younger than ray scholes married and had two daughters schools here good fox had asked him not bad michaelson was happy to talk about fife and greenock and family but when the subject turned to detective constable paul carter he offered as little as scholes before him if i didnt know better fox commented at one point id say youd been put through your paces how do you mean coached in what not to say coached by di scholes maybe not true michaelson had insisted it was also untrue that he had altered or deleted notes he had taken during an interview conducted both at the home of teresa collins and in the very same interview room where they were now seated fox recited part of teresa collinss testimony you can charge me with anything you like paul just dont think youre putting your hands on me again she didnt say that no verdict suggests otherwise not much i can do about that but there was a bit of personal history between carter and ms collins you cant have been unaware of it she says there was a history neighbours saw him coming and going half of them known to us by the way youre saying theyre liars what do you think doesnt really matter what i think how about the missing page from your notebook spilled coffee on it pages underneath seem fine not much i can do about that so you keep saying throughout the interview fox knew better than to make eye contact with tony kaye kayes infrequent contributions to the questioning showed his growing irritation they were getting nowhere and would almost certainly continue to get nowhere scholes michaelson and the allegedly fluridden haldane had not only had plenty of time to choreograph their answers theyd also already premiered the routine in the courtroom teresa collins was lying the other two complainants were chancers the judge had helped the prosecution at every available turn thing is fox said slowly and quietly making sure he had michaelsons attention when your own forces professional standards team looked into the allegations they reckoned there might be something to them and dont forget it wasnt ms collins who started the whole process he let that sink in for a moment michaelsons focus remained fixed to a portion of the wall over foxs left shoulder he was wiry and prematurely bald and his nose had been broken at some point in his life plus there was an inchlong scar running across his chin fox wondered if hed done any amateur boxing it was another police officer he continued paul carters uncle are you calling him a liar too hes not a cop hes an excop what difference does it make michaelson offered a shrug and folded his arms battery change naysmith broke in switching off the camera michaelson stretched his back fox heard the clicking of vertebrae tony kaye was on his feet shaking each leg as if trying to get the circulation going much longer michaelson asked thats up to you fox told him well we all still get paid at the end of the day eh not in a rush to get back to your desk doesnt really matter does it you tidy up one crime another two or three are just around the corner fox saw that joe naysmith was going through the pockets of the equipment bag naysmith knew he was being watched looked up and had the good sense to look contrite the spares still charging he said where tony kaye asked the office naysmith paused in edinburgh meaning were done gary michaelsons eyes were on malcolm fox so it would seem fox answered grudgingly for now what a complete and utter waste of a day said tony kaye not for the first time they had retraced their route back to edinburgh still mainly in the outside lane this time the bulk of the traffic was heading into fife the bottleneck on the edinburgh side of the forth road bridge their destination was police hq on fettes avenue chief inspector bob mcewan was still in the office he pointed to the battery charger next to the kettle and mugs wondered about that he said wonder no more fox replied the room wasnt large because counter corruption comprised a small team most complaints officers worked in a larger office along the corridor where professional ethics and standards handled the meatandpotatoes workload this year mcewan seemed to be spending most of his time in meetings to do with restructuring the whole department basically writing myself out of a job as he had put it himself not that you should worry your pretty little heads kaye had thrown his coat over the back of his chair and was seated at his desk while naysmith busied himself switching the batteries in the charger two interviews conducted fox told mcewan both somewhat curtailed i take it there was a bit of resistance fox gave a twitch of his mouth tony thinks were talking to the wrong people anyway im beginning to agree with him nobodys expecting miracles malcolm the deputy chief constable phoned me earlier it takes as long as it takes any longer than a week and i might run a hose from my car exhaust kaye muttered it takes as long as it takes mcewan repeated for his benefit eventually they settled down to review the recordings halfway through mcewan checked his watch and said that he had to be elsewhere then kaye received a text urgent appointment with the wife and a bottle of wine he explained patting foxs shoulder let me know how it turns out eh for the next five minutes fox could sense naysmith fidgeting it was gone five anyway so he told his young colleague to bugger off you sure fox gestured towards the door and soon he was alone in the office thinking that maybe he should have praised naysmith for his work behind the camera both picture and sound were sharp there was a notepad on foxs lap but it was blank apart from spirals stars and other assorted doodles he thought back to something scholes had said about the complaints wanting to drag everyone else down with paul carter carter was history what reason was there to suppose scholes and the others would keep breaking the rules of course theyd look out for each other stick up for each other but maybe a lesson had been learned fox knew he could put the investigation into cruise control could ask the questions log the responses and come to no great conclusions that might be the outcome anyway so what was the point of busting a gut this he felt was the subtext of the whole day the thing tony kaye had been bursting to say the three officers had been named and shamed in court now they were the subject of an internal inquiry did all that not comprise punishment enough in the pancake place kaye had mentioned colin balfour the complaints had put together just about enough of a case to see him drummed out of the force but theyd stopped short of implicating two or three other officers who had attempted a coverup those officers were still working never a hint of trouble no complaints as the saying went fox used the remote to switch off the recording all it proved was that they were doing what was expected of them he very much doubted the bosses at fife constabulary hq required further bad news they just wanted to be able to say that the judges comments had not been ignored scholes haldane and michaelson needed only to go on denying everything and that meant tony kaye was right it was the other cid officers they should be talking to if they wanted to be thorough and what about carters uncle shouldnt they also get his side of the story fox was intrigued about the mans motive his evidence in court had been brief but effective the way he told it his nephew had paid him a visit one afternoon after a few drinks hed been garrulous talking about the ways in which policing had changed since his uncles day not so many corners could be cut and there were fewer fringe benefits but theres one perk i get that maybe you and my dad never did fox was reminded that he hadnt spoken to his own father in a couple of days his sister and he took it in turns to visit she was probably at the care home right now the staff liked you to avoid mealtimes and by midevening a lot of the clients as staff insisted on calling them were being readied for bed he walked over to the windows and stared out at the darkening city was edinburgh ten times the size of kirkcaldy bigger surely back at his desk he switched on his computer and sat down to do a search just under an hour later he was in his car and heading for his home in oxgangs there was a supermarket almost on his doorstep and he stopped long enough to grab a microwave curry and a bottle of appletiser plus the evening paper the story on the front page concerned a drug dealer who had just been found guilty and sent to jail fox knew the detective who had led the inquiry hed been the subject of a complaints investigation two years back now he was smiling for the cameras job done how come you hate cops so much the question scholes had asked time was cid could cut corners and be sure of getting away with it foxs task was to stop them doing that not for ever and a day in a year or two he would be back in cid himself rubbing shoulders with those he had scrutinised trying to put drug dealers behind bars without bending the rules fearful of the complaints and coming to despise them he had begun to wonder if he could do that work with officers who knew his past work what everyone regarded as proper cases he stuffed the newspaper into the bottom of his basket covered by his other purchases the bungalow was in darkness hed thought of buying one of those timers that brought a light on at dusk but knew this was no real deterrent to housebreakers he had little enough worth stealing tv and computer after which theyd be looking around in vain a couple of homes near him had been broken into in the past month hed even had a police constable on his doorstep asking if hed seen or heard anything fox hadnt bothered identifying himself as a fellow officer hed just shaken his head and the constable had nodded and headed elsewhere going through the motions six minutes the curry took fox found a news channel on the tv and turned the sound up the world seemed to be filled with war famine and natural disasters an earthquake here a tornado there a climatechange expert was being interviewed he was warning that viewers needed to get used to these phenomena to floods and droughts and heatwaves the interviewer managed somehow to hand back to the studio with a smile maybe once he was off air he would start running around pulling out clumps of his hair and screaming but fox doubted it he pressed the interactive button on the remote and scanned the scottish headlines there was nothing new on the explosion outside lockerbie the alert status at fettes had been moderate same as at kirkcaldy lockerbie as if that benighted spot hadnt seen enough in its history fox flipped to a sports channel and watched the darts as he ate the remainder of his meal he was just finishing when his phone started ringing it was his sister jude whats up he asked her they took it in turns to call it was his turn not hers ive just been to see dad he heard her sniff back a tear is he okay he keeps forgetting things i know one of the carers told me he didnt make it to the toilet in time this morning theyve put him in a pad fox closed his eyes and sometimes he forgets my name or what year it is he has good days too jude how would you know just because you pick up the bills doesnt mean you can walk away whos walking away i never see you there you know thats not true i visit when i can not nearly enough we cant all lead lives of leisure jude you think im not looking for a job fox squeezed his eyes shut again walked into that one malc thats not what i meant its exactly what you meant lets not get into this eh there was silence on the line for a few moments jude sighed and began speaking again i took him a box of photographs today thought maybe the pair of us could go through them but they just seemed to upset him he kept saying theyre all dead how can everyone be dead ill go see him jude dont worry about it maybe the thing to do is phone ahead and if the staff dont think its worth a visit that day thats not what im saying her voice rose again you think i mind visiting him hes our dad i know that i was just he paused then asked the question he felt was expected of him do you want me to come over its not me you need to go see youre right so youll do it of course even though youre busy soon as im off the phone fox assured her and youll get back to me tell me what you think im sure hes fine jude you want him to be that way hes not on your conscience im putting the phone down now jude im putting the phone down and heading out to see dad the staff of lauder lodge however had other ideas it was past nine when fox got there he could hear a tv blaring in the lounge lots of people coming and going looked like a shift changeover your fathers in bed fox was told hell be asleep then i wont wake him i just want to see him for a minute we try not to disturb clients once theyre in bed didnt he used to stay up for the ten oclock news that was then is he on any new medication anything i dont know about the woman took a moment to weigh up whether an accusation was being made then gave a resigned sigh just a minute you say fox nodded and she nodded back anything for a quiet life mitch foxs room was in a new annexe to the side of the original victorian property fox walked past a room that had until a couple of months back been home to mrs sanderson mrs sanderson and foxs father had become firm friends during their time in lauder lodge fox had helped mitch attend her funeral no more than a dozen people in the crematorium chapel no one had come from her family because no family had been traced there was a new name next to the door of her old room d nesbitt fox got the feeling that if he peeled away that sticker thered be another underneath bearing mrs sandersons name and maybe another beneath that he didnt bother knocking on his fathers door just turned the handle and crept in the curtains were closed and the light was off but there was a good amount of illumination from the street lamp outside fox could make out his fathers form under the duvet he had almost reached the bedside chair when a dry voice asked what time it was twenty past fox told his father twenty past what nine so what brings you here then mitch fox turned on the lamp and started to sit up his son moved forward to help him has something happened jude was a bit worried fox saw that the shoebox full of old family photos was on the chair he lifted it and sat down resting it on his knees his fathers hair wispy almost like a babys had a yellowish tinge his face was thinner than ever the skin resembling parchment but the eyes seemed clear and untroubled we both know your sister likes her little dramas whats she been telling you just that your memorys not what it was whose is mitch nodded towards the shoebox because i couldnt tell her the exact spot where some photo was taken fiftyodd years ago fox opened the lid of the box and lifted out a handful of snaps some had writing on the back names dates places but there were question marks too lots of question marks and something that looked like a tear stain fox rubbed a finger across it then turned the photo over his mother dandled a child on either knee she was seated on the edge of a rockery this one only goes back thirty years fox said holding the photo up for his father to see mitch peered at it blackpool maybe he said you and jude and mum mitch fox nodded slowly any water there he asked fox looked but there was no jug on the bedside cabinet get me some will you fox went into the adjoining bathroom the jug was there along with a plastic tumbler he reckoned the staff didnt want mitchell fox guzzling water at night not if it meant trouble in the morning the pack of incontinence pads sat in full view next to the sink fox filled jug and tumbler both and took them through good lad his father said a few drops dribbled from his chin as he drank but he needed no help placing the drained tumbler next to him by the bed youll tell jude not to worry sure fox sat down again and youll manage to do it without falling out ill try my best takes two to make an argument you sure about that i think jude could have a pretty good go in an empty room maybe so but you dont always help is this you and me arguing now fox watched his father give a tired smile want me to go so you can get back to sleep i dont sleep i just lie here waiting fox knew what the answer to his next question would be so he didnt ask it instead he told his father that hed just spent a fruitless day over in fife you used to love it there mitch told him where fife when was i ever in fife my cousin chris we used to visit him where did he live burntisland the beach the outdoor pool the links how old was i chris died young take a look he should be in there somewhere fox realised that his father meant the shoebox so they lifted out the contents on to the bed some of the photos were loose others in packets along with their negatives a mixture of colour and blackandwhite including some wedding photos fox ignored the ones of him and elaine their marriage hadnt lasted long there were blurry snaps of holidays christmases birthdays works outings until eventually mitch was handing a particular shot to him thats chris there hes got jude on his shoulders big tall strapping chap would this be burntisland then fox studied the photograph judes gaptoothed mouth was wide open hard to tell if it was laughter or terror at being so high off the ground chris was grinning for the camera fox tried to remember him but failed might be his back garden mitch fox was saying how did he die motorbike daft laddie look at them all mitch waved a hand across the strewn photographs dead and buried and mostly forgotten some of us are still here though fox said and thats the way i like it mitch patted the back of his sons hand did i really love it in fife there was a park up near st andrews we went there one day it had a train we all sat on there might be a photo if we look hard enough lots of beaches too and a market in kirkcaldy once a year kirkcaldy thats where ive just been how come i dont remember it you won a goldfish there once poor thing was dead inside a day mitch fixed his son with a look youll put judes mind at rest fox nodded and his father patted his hand again before lying back against the pillows fox sat with him for another hour and a half looking at photographs he switched the lamp off just before he left two this is a joke right its whats on offer the desk sergeant said he looked every bit as pleased with this mornings outcome as he had done the day before when informing them that none of their interviewees were available the door locks and the keys yours if you want it its a storeroom joe naysmith stated switching on the light fortywatt bulb tony kaye said we might as well bring torches someone had placed three ricketylooking chairs in the centre of the small room leaving no space for a desk of any kind the shelves were filled with boxes old cases identified by a code number and year plus broken and superannuated office equipment any chance of a word with superintendent pitkethly fox asked the sergeant shes in glenrothes now theres a surprise the sergeant was dangling the key from his finger its somewhere to park the gear if nothing else naysmith reasoned fox gave a loud exhalation through his nostrils and snatched the key from the sergeant while naysmith brought the equipment bag in from the car fox and kaye stayed in the corridor eyeing the interior of the storeroom the corridor was suddenly busy with uniforms and civilian staff all passing through and stifling smirks no way im parking myself in there kaye said with a slow shake of the head id look like the bloody janitor joes right though its somewhere to store the gear between interviews any way we can speed the process malcolm how do you mean you and me we could take an interview each be done in half the time the only people we need on tape are scholes haldane and michaelson the others are just chats arent they fox nodded but theres only one interview room not everyone were talking to is based at the station fox stared at kaye you really do want this over and done with basic time management kaye said with a glint in his eye better value for the hardpressed taxpayer so how do we split it fox folded his arms got any favourites i fancy a word with the uncle kaye considered this then nodded slowly take my car ill try cheryl forrester fair enough what do we do with joe they turned to watch as joe naysmith pushed open the door at the end of the corridor the heavy black bag slung over one shoulder we toss a coin kaye said holding out a fiftypence piece loser keeps him a few minutes later malcolm fox was heading out to kayes ford mondeo minus naysmith he adjusted the drivers seat and reached into the glove box for the satnav plugging it in and fixing it to the dashboard alan carters postcode was in the file and he found it after a bit of hunting the satnav did a quick search before pointing him in the right direction he soon found himself on the coast road heading south towards a place called kinghorn signposts told him the next town after this was burntisland he thought again of his fathers cousin chris maybe the motorbike had crashed on this very stretch it was the kind of drive he reckoned bikers would relish winding gently and with the sea to one side steep hillside to the other was that a seals head bobbing in the water he slowed the car a little the driver behind flashed his lights then overtook with a blast of his horn yeah yeah fox muttered glancing at the satnav his destination was close by he passed a caravan site and signalled to take the next road on the right it was a steep track rutted and throwing up clouds of dust behind him he knew he darent ding kayes pride and joy so ended up in first gear doing five miles an hour the climb continued according to the satnav he was nowhere had passed his destination fox stopped the car and got out he had a fine view down towards the shoreline rows of caravans to his left and a hotel to his right he looked at the address he had for alan carter gallowhill cottage the road was about to disappear into woodland something caught foxs eye a wisp of smoke from above the treeline he got back behind the steering wheel and eased the gear lever forward the cottage sat near the top of the rise just as the track came to an end at a gate leading to fields a few sheep were scattered around noiseless crows glided between the trees the wind was biting though the sun had broken from behind a bank of cloud smoke continued to drift up from the cottages chimney there was an olivegreen land rover parked off to one side next to a large neat pile of split logs the door of the cottage rattled open the man who filled the doorway was almost a parody of the big jolly policeman alan carters face was ruddy cheeks and nose crisscrossed with thin red veins his eyes sparkled and his pale yellow cardigan was stretched to the limit of its buttons the check shirt beneath was open at the collar allowing copious grey chest hair to breathe though almost completely bald he retained bushy sideburns which almost met at one of his chins i knew id be getting a visit carter bellowed one pudgy hand resting on the door frame shouldve made an appointment though i seem to be busier these days than ever fox was standing in front of him now and the two men shook hands youre not in the craft then carter asked no time was most coppers you met were masons in you come then lad the hallway was short and narrow most of the space taken up with bookshelves coat rack and a selection of wellington boots the living room was small and sweltering courtesy of a fire piled high with logs need to keep it warm for jimmy nicholl carter said who the dog an ancientlooking border collie with rheumy eyes blinked in foxs direction from its basket near the fireplace whos he named for the raith manager not now of course but jimmy took us into europe carter broke off and gave fox a look not a football fan either used to be my names fox by the way inspector fox rubbersole brigade that what they still call you that or the complaints and doubtless worse things too behind your back or to our faces will it be a mug of tea or something stronger carter nodded towards a bottle of whisky on a shelf teall do the job bit early in the day for the cratur maybe carter agreed i wont be a minute he headed for the kitchen fox could hear him pouring water into a kettle his voice boomed down the hallway when i read cardonalds summingup i knew thered have to be an inquiry youre not local though a local mightve known the name jimmy nicholl on top of which your cars from edinburgh carter was back in the room now looking pleased with himself the registration fox guessed the dealers sticker in the back window carter corrected him take a seat laddie he gestured to one of the two armchairs milk and sugar just milk are you still in security mr carter is this you showing me youve done your research carter smiled the companys still mine what exactly does the company do doormen for bars and clubs security guards protection for visiting dignitaries do a lot of dignitaries pass through kirkcaldy they did when gordon brown was pm and they still like to play golf at st andrews carter left the room to fetch their drinks and fox crossed to the window there was a dining table there piled high with paperwork and magazines the paperwork had been stuffed into folders a map of fife lay open locations circled in black ink the magazines seemed to date back to the s and when fox lifted one of them he saw that there was a newspaper beneath it the date on the newspaper was monday april youll have me pegged as a hoarder carter said carrying a tray into the room he placed it on a corner of the table and poured out tea for the both of them half a dozen shortbread fingers had been emptied on to a patterned plate and a bachelor fox guessed your research has let you down my wife ran off with somebody two decades back and the same number of years younger than me at the time making her a cradlesnatcher carter wagged a finger im sixtytwo jessica was forty and the wee shitebag twentyone nobody else since christ man is this a complaints interview or a dating service shes dead anyway god rest her had a kid with the shitebag but none with yourself carter gave a twitch of the mouth does that rankle why should it maybe my son or daughter would have turned out as bad as my nephew carter gestured towards the chairs and the two men sat down with their drinks there was a slight stinging sensation in foxs eyes which he tried blinking away its the woodsmoke carter explained you cant see it but its there he reached down and fed jimmy nicholl half a shortbread finger his teeth are just about up to it come to think of it mine arent much better youve been retired fifteen years ive been out of the force that long your brother was a cop same time as you a year shy of retirement when his heart gave out was that around the time your nephew joined the police alan carter nodded maybe it was why he joined up he never seemed to have a gift for it whats the word im looking for vocation aye thats what paul never had you werent keen on him following the family tradition alan carter was silent for a moment then he leaned forward as best he could resting the mug on one knee paul was never a good son he ran his mother ragged until the cancer took her after that it was his dads turn at the funeral all he seemed interested in was how much the house was worth and how much effort it was going to take to get the place emptied the two of you werent exactly friendly then yet he came to see you i think hed been partying all night it was just past noon how he got the car up here without smashing it carter stared into the fire he wanted to do a bit of bragging but he was maudlin too you know the way drink can sometimes take us one of the reasons i dont do it fox took a swig of tea it was dark and strong coating his tongue and the back of his throat he came here to show off said he was a better cop than any of us he owned kirkcaldy and i neednt go thinking i did even if i could hide behind an army of bouncers i get the feeling this is verbatim got to have a good memory whenever i was called to give evidence i always knew it by heart one way to impress a jury so eventually he told you about teresa collins aye carter nodded to himself still watching the fire spit and crackle hers was the only name but he said thered been others i thought the force had seen the back of his kind maybe youre not old enough to remember the way it was full of racists and sexists fox paused and masons carter gave a quiet chuckle it still goes on fox continued maybe not nearly as widespread as it was but all the same your line of work i suppose you see it more than most fox answered with a shrug and placed his empty mug on the floor declining the offer of a refill the day he came here did he mention the others scholes haldane michaelson only in passing nothing about them bending the rules no and you hadnt heard rumours to that effect id say youve got your work cut out there mmm fox sounded as if he were in complete agreement the force is going to want to move on id think so fox shifted in his chair hearing it creak beneath him can i ask you something else about your nephew fire away well its one thing to disapprove of what he said he did but quite another to take it further carter pursed his lips i didnt do anything about it not straight away but lying in bed at night id be thinking of tommy pauls dad a good man a really good man and pauls mum too such a lovely woman i was wondering what theyd be thinking then there was teresa collins i didnt know her but i didnt like the way hed talked about her so i had a quiet word and this quiet word was with superintendent hendryson hes not there any more retired i seem to think its a woman called pitkethly nowadays carter nodded it was hendryson who really started the ball rolling nothing happened though did it teresa collins wouldnt talk not at first without her there was nothing for the fife complaints to investigate any idea why she changed her mind maybe she was tossing and turning same as me youve no friends left on the force mr carter all retired superintendent hendryson he was after my time more or less so you went to hendryson he brought in the local complaints team they didnt get very far but then these other two women came forward and thats when teresa collins decided shed cooperate thats about the size of it fox sat for a few moments longer alan carter seemed in no rush to see him go but he had nothing keeping him there nothing but the warmth of the fire and companionable silence a long way from edinburgh isnt it inspector carter said quietly these are the backlands where things tend to get fixed on the quiet you regret whats happened to your nephew all that media exposure i doubt anythings happened to him carter tapped the side of his head not in here hes in jail though thats tough on the family im the family all thats left of it carter paused are your folks still with us my dad is fox conceded sisters and brothers just the one sister close are you fox chose not to answer luckier than most if you are sometimes you have to draw a line between yourself and the ones youre supposed to love carter ran a finger horizontally through the air it might sting for a while but that doesnt mean you shouldnt do it fox sat for a further moment or two then rose to his feet his host copying him the man was almost wedged into the chair but fox doubted hed accept any offer of help macaroni cheese thats my downfall eh jimmy the dogs ears pricked up at mention of its name fox had paused next to the dining table if i was to describe you fox began id say you were orderly coats on the rack boots laid out in a row biscuits need to go on a plate not served straight from the packet and that makes me wonder about this he waved his hand across the table its not just hoarding is it theres some sort of pattern to it a bit of historical research nineteen eightyfive there or thereabouts late april maybe go on then tell me what happened in april fox tried to think in the end he gave up dennis taylor beat steve davis at the snooker alan carter said leading the way to the door detective constable cheryl forrester liked to ask questions questions like how long have you been in the complaints is there a selection process how many of you work there is it for life or some kind of fixed term why is it youre detective grade but not called detectives whats been your most shocking case whats the nightlife like in edinburgh its only a train ride away you know joe naysmith told her oh ive been there plenty times then you probably know the nightlife better than we do tony kaye said but i mean the places locals go dc forrester were not really here to pass along tourist tips i like the voodoo rooms naysmith interrupted he saw the look on his colleagues face and swallowed back a further comment the problem was forresters enthusiasm was almost infectious the description bubbly might have been coined for her she had curly brown hair tanned skin and a rounded face with freckles and large brown eyes she had been in the force for six years the last two in cid right at the start shed told them she was too busy for a boyfriend im sure plenty have tried kaye had stated intending to bring paul carters name into play but she had steered the conversation in another direction by asking naysmith if the complaints worked ninetofive to which hed responded by telling her about their surveillance van and how an operation could last anything up to a year a year of your life better be a result at the end of it and so it went until kaye finally rapped his knuckles against the table they were in the interview room again but without the recording equipment forrester sensing she was somehow worthy of censure set her mouth tight and clasped her hands together in front of her as you know tony kaye began certain allegations have been levelled at several of your colleagues would you care to tell us what you think of them the allegations or the colleagues why not both forrester puffed out her cheeks i was shocked when i heard i think everyone was id worked with dc carter for almost eighteen months and hed never well never struck me as being like that youve been out on calls with him yes in the car with him yes and hes never said anything never asked you to wait while he popped into a house or a flat not like that no police stations are terrible places for gossip i cant say ive ever heard anything she stared at kaye with her wide innocentseeming eyes your colleagues in cid scholes haldane michaelson what about them when the carter investigation started they mustve talked about it i suppose so did anything strike you maybe they went into a huddle she gave a look of concentration then shook her head slowly but with certainty did you ever feel left out maybe they headed off to the pub together we have nights at the pub yes you must have discussed the case yes but not how to tamper with evidence the time michaelson spilled coffee on his notebook did you see that no and you never saw teresa collins never heard carter on the phone to her no how come you werent called as a witness at the trial sounds to me like you could have done carter a power of good i dont really know i mean all i could have said is what ive just told you carter never came on to you there was silence in the room forrester looked down at her hands and then up again never she stated and thats the truth not just something youve been told to say its the truth bring me a bible and ill swear on it if we cant find a bible naysmith interrupted would a cocktail list suffice cheryl forrester laughed showing perfect pearly teeth at the end of the interview naysmith said hed walk her back to cid its not like shes going to get mugged kaye chided his colleague but naysmith ignored him kaye decided to wander outside for some air in the car park a hovering gull just missed him splattering an mgs windscreen instead there was no sign of the mondeo and no sign of fox kaye took out his mobile and checked for messages he had three one of them from malcolm back inside the station he kept his finger on the bell until the desk sergeant arrived with the same welcoming black look as ever ill take dci laird if hes around kaye said im not sure he is okay never mind kaye headed for the corridor and climbed the stairs to the next floor cid comprised several offices here cheryl forrester was in one of them while naysmith stood in the doorway arms folded one foot crossed over the other talking to her kaye gave him a dig in the back as he passed then pushed open the door to the large openplan office further on scholes and michaelson looked up from their desks scholes was on the phone michaelson navigating his computer screen with a mouse another man slightly older than the other two stood in the centre of the room he had dispensed with his suit jacket and his shirtsleeves were rolled up he had waxy olive skin hair that was grey at the temples and bags under his eyes he was reading from a sheaf of papers detective chief inspector laird kaye held out his hand laird had yet to make eye contact he added a couple of words to the margin of one sheet then pocketed his pen youre fox he drawled sergeant kaye kaye corrected him withdrawing his hand wheres fox probably off getting a second opinion on haldanes flu well now laird deigned to meet kayes eyes at last youre a cheeky little bastard arent you depends on the situation sir kaye sensed that he was standing in front of a man who believed in the troops under his command and would defend them to the bitter end forrester hadnt been helpful because there was nothing for her to be helpful with but laird was another matter entirely he would give them nothing because that was all they deserved it was there in his tone his manner his way of standing feet planted widely apart kaye had encountered the type plenty of times they could be dismantled but it took time and effort weeks of time unceasing effort foxs message had been ask laird why pitkethly was brought in it was a reasonable question and kaye knew why it was best not to ask pitkethly herself quite simply she probably wouldnt know she hadnt known the station at all until she was shipped there laird had served under the previous regime he was an old hand if there was a story worth telling laird might be the one to tell it but a few seconds spent in the mans company told kaye this wasnt going to happen my boss he said had something he wanted me to ask you spit it out then but kaye just shook his head i dont think i will then he turned and walked away halfway down the corridor he grabbed naysmith by the back of his collar and took him with him the mondeos parking space had been taken by an idling astra in fact the only bay left was the one marked superintendent so that was where fox ended up as he made for the station entrance he gave the astras driver a look the face was familiar about bloody time tony kaye said emerging from the station with naysmith in tow got your text but i didnt reckon i was going to get any joy from laird dc forrester was nice and helpful though naysmith added kaye shooting him a look helpful he mimicked she gave us the square root of heehaw then turning to fox tell me youve been having it worse than us got lost a few times maybe found the uncle but hes doolally foxy you listening foxs attention was still focused on the astra thats paul carter he said what fox started walking towards the car it reversed out of its bay and began to exit the car park fox jogged after it for a few paces then stopped kaye caught him up the two men watching as the car shot away modified exhaust roaring you sure fox gave him a cold stare okay kaye conceded youre sure fox took out his phone and called the procurator fiscals office he was passed between extensions and offices until he found someone with the answers he needed paul carter had been released on bail at am pending the sheriffs decision on sentencing cells are jampacked fox was told sheriff cardonald reckoned he was one of the safer bets restricted movements hes not allowed within range of the three women who posted the bail it wasnt a huge amount and this was the sheriffs idea colin cardonald i suppose so the judge who doesnt like cops steady on but fox had ended the call hes out he confirmed for kaye and naysmiths benefit want to bring him in for a chat naysmith asked fox shook his head hell was he doing here kaye added catching up with his pals fox guessed turning to look at the stations firstfloor windows ray scholes stood in one of them a mug in his hand he toasted fox with it before turning away doesnt change anything tony kaye stated no fox agreed and you still havent told us how you got on with the uncle good guy fox paused i liked him not half as much as joe here likes dc forrester kaye looked around the car park wheres my mondeo i had to take pitkethlys spot best move it then eh kaye held out his hand for the key better still fox said lets jump in and grab a spot of lunch my shout kaye stared at him whats the catch foxs mouth twitched a wee cruise around town first with an eye to spotting a silver astra kaye guessed fox handed him the key after a fruitless halfhour they ended up back at the pancake place since fox was paying kaye ordered soup and the fish mornay pancake the same table as before was available so theyd taken it where does carter live joe naysmith asked dunnikier estate fox told him we drove through it yesterday we drove through a lot of estates yesterday semis pebbledash and satellite dishes youre not narrowing it down we could go there kaye suggested see how he likes having us parked outside for an hour or two to what end fox asked getting his back up could we maybe set up the surveillance van bug his phone and computer naysmith looked interested wed need permission from hq fox stated and they wont give it why not naysmith asked with a frown because were here for scholes haldane and michaelson carters outwith our remit well what about bugging their phones naysmith suggested fox looked at him surveillance is a whole new game joe i doubt anyone at hq thinks them big enough fish to merit it plus were not from here it would have to be a fife operation local complaints naysmith considered this for a moment then went back to eating his scotch broth foxs phone started ringing and he answered it was superintendent isabel pitkethly paul carters no longer in custody she told him i know seems the sheriff has a little bit of faith in him yes if he decides to appeal the allegations against my officers may well be challenged in court not my concern superintendent what do you mean im not working for the courts or the prosecution your bosses in glenrothes tell me what to do and so far theyve not said anything about dropping the inquiry fox paused have you spoken with carter of course not he was outside the station an hour ago i didnt know that scholes knew maybe you should ask why he kept it to himself im not long back from hq you seem to spend a lot of time there updating them in person she ignored this so youve not finished here yet not nearly ill see you later then and inspector yes superintendent dont ever park that car in my space again the afternoon comprised a wasted session in the interview room with dci peter laird there was nothing unusual about superintendent hendrysons retirement it had been his time that was all and a visit to the home of the sickly ds haldane they found haldane sprawled on the sofa in his living room a duvet swamping him and a visiting mother doling out tea cold remedies and seasoned advice cant this wait till hes better she had chided the three intruders it had eventually been agreed that haldane would make himself available at the station in a day or two so that a proper interview could take place what now kaye asked afterwards as they climbed into the car dunnikier estate fox said kaye gave a little smile as if hed known this answer might be coming their destination was on the other side of town and traffic was slow schools coming out naysmith commented watching uniformed pupils tramping along the pavement youre a regular hercule poirot kaye muttered eventually they turned in to carters street that house there fox stated the one with the silver astra in the drive kaye commented hercule poirot and sherlock holmes whose is the other car naysmith asked fox supplied the answer belongs to ray scholes you sure if thats him coming out of the house and so it was a brief hug between the two men scholes and carter and then carter disappearing inside closing the door scholes clocked the mondeo but didnt seem surprised or bothered by it he unlocked his black vw golf and got in fox watching from the rear window of the mondeo do we pay our respects kaye asked as they slowed for a junction no what then back to edinburgh now youre talking and to while away the time well have a little quiz fox leaned forward so his face was between the two front seats what can either of you remember about specifically late april kayes way of insisting that they have a drink at minters before going their separate ways was to drive directly to the pub and park outside it my treat he said ordering a pint for himself a half for naysmith and a big tom for fox from experience the barman knew naysmiths half was a joke and began pouring two pints of caledonian they took their drinks to a table and kaye asked fox how long it had been since hed allowed himself a proper drink ive stopped counting aye right kaye wiped a line of foam from his top lip you know joe naysmith commented surveillance isnt a bad idea hey kaye warned him with a wagging finger were off duty here im just saying its how wed normally build a case i thought id already explained fox began naysmith nodded but correct me if im wrong were going to get nowhere otherwise say we asked bob mcewan for permission set everything up without letting anyone in fife know then when we get something if we get something fox corrected him okay if we get something and its a big if kaye added yes but what wed then do is present it to fife hq as a fait accompli the boys losing me with all these big words kaye complained to fox what makes you think mcewan would agree to it in the first place fox asked naysmith wed ask him nicely kaye snorted oh aye hes a sucker for a kind word like i said fox told naysmith itd have to be a fife call so wheres the harm in asking them you must know somebody on the complaints over there fox hesitated for a moment before nodding i doubt were in their good books though were working what should be their patch but you do know somebody naysmith persisted yes fox conceded turning to look at kaye kaye shrugged cant see it working why not surveillance operation needs the okay from upstairs havent we been saying all along that glenrothes doesnt necessarily want us finding anything but if they deny their own complaints department naysmith argued that looks bad too kayes eyes were still on malcolm fox what do you say foxy its a protocol minefield first step might not blow us up though home phones and mobiles naysmith added just to hear what carters saying to his pals in cid ill have a think about it fox eventually said kaye slapped a hand down on naysmiths knee that means hes going to do it well played joseph and its your round by the way once home fox microwaved another readymeal and ate it at the table the tv stayed off he was lost in thought after hed cleaned up he called his sister and apologised for not getting back to her sooner dont tell me youve been busy it happens to be true fox squeezed the skin at the bridge of his nose but you did go see dad last night as promised he was back to himself by the time i got there oh we took a look through some of those photographs they didnt upset him not so much no maybe its me then is that what youre getting at you think im overreacting no jude im sure youre not and i saw the pack of pads in the bathroom if he starts wetting himself theyre going to kick him out i doubt that theyll want him home with one of us listen jude it cant be me malcolm how am i supposed to cope theyre not going to get rid of him why because you keep coughing up for his bed and board thats fine as long as hes not a bother to them would it put your mind at rest if we went to see them you do it they hate me no they dont they treat me like dirt you dont see it because youre the one waving the chequebook thats all right though isnt it youll be the one getting the lions share of his will its you he likes the one hes always talking about when im there never me i just fetch and carry like one of the fucking staff listen to yourself jude but instead it was fox who listened listened to his sister as her complaints lengthened and intensified he pictured the photograph of her as a small girl atop chriss shoulders bursting with carefree energy now distilled to this sometimes you have to draw a line fox watched himself lower the telephone receiver back on to its charger as the connection was made the line went dead he drew in his bottom lip staring at the machine wondering if it would ring jude enraged on the other end but it didnt so he made himself some tea considering whether there was anything he could have said to her to make things better offered to visit his father more often arranged for the three of them to go to lunch some weekend its you he likes i just fetch and carry with a sigh he went over to his computer and switched it on wondering what his search engine could tell him about while the stinging memory of the phone call began to melt away three youre not a ghost then flesh and blood last time i looked fox was starting to reach out a hand but saw she was holding both of hers towards him he made to grasp them then realised it was the prelude to a hug awkwardly he hugged her back has it been three years or four she asked three years or four since their onenight stand at of all things a standards of conduct conference at tulliallan police college not quite four you look just the same he took a step back the better to judge the truth of this her name was evelyn mills much the same age as fox but wearing the years lightly shed been married at the time of their fling and by the ring on her left hand she still was they were standing on the seafront in kirkcaldy there had been a heavy shower earlier but it had blown over thick gobbets of cloud glided overhead there were a couple of cargo ships on the horizon fox took it in while waiting to see if she had any comment to make about his own appearance still in the complaints then she asked instead he stuffed his hands into his pockets and gave a shrug and you too mmm she seemed to be studying him intently then she linked arms with him and they started walking in silence good result for you fox offered eventually paul carter i mean wasnt really us though was it it was down to the witnesses even then different day different courtroom it could have swung the other way all the same he persisted all the same were so good at what we do you have to be hauled here from the bustling metropolis armslength evelyn this way no one can accuse you of looking out for your own you think wed do that it wouldnt be me pointing the finger he paused if its any consolation im not looking for consolation malcolm with her free hand she gave his forearm a squeeze and he knew she was offering herself as ally rather than foe carter is walking the streets fox said did you know that she nodded they were making towards the dock at the esplanades northern end there was a solitary fishing boat moored there but no sign of life apart from some fiercelooking gulls were thinking it might be nice to hear what he says to scholes and the others oh home and mobile phones of four detectives three carters appeal if he starts one would have a field day if we eavesdropped on him im not sure we can stretch to it malcolm manpower or resources she exhaled noisily both if im being honest basically youre looking at fifes complaints department im it i mean i can always requisition a few bodies in an emergency is that what you did when alan carter made the original complaint she nodded pushing some hair back from her face scholes is the one carters close to if i was going to look at anybody it would be him we saw him leaving carters house yesterday you mean the surveillance is up and running fox shook his head again we were just passing her eyes narrowed passing through the dunnikier estate in a manner of speaking she scrutinised his face then gave a short laugh god the things we do she said he wasnt sure if she meant their job or was thinking back to that night in tulliallan best he felt not to risk asking you know id need to go to my boss she said after a moments thought and hed have to go to his boss fox nodded and im allowed to tell them its your idea he nodded again all this just to prove whether or not some colleagues stuck up for one of their own perjuring themselves in the process fox reminded her she ran her finger down the bridge of her nose a nose fox suddenly remembered kissing shed had a lot to drink at the bar that night hed been the sober one the one who should have seen her only as far as her bedroom door but shed had a kettle in her room and sachets of instant coffee and a narrow single bed what do you think he asked her now i think its freezing out here whatever your answer is thanks for meeting with me this time she patted his arm and they turned to walk back to her car having reached it in silence she asked him where he had parked he nodded in the vague direction of the town centre she unlocked her car and got in it was an alfa romeo with a darkblue interior fox closed the door for her and watched her start the ignition the window slid downwards and she peered up at him i was at fettes a few months back running an errand i considered knocking on your door you should have she released the brake gave him a wave and was gone fox stayed where he was until he couldnt see the car any more then crossed the street and headed for the cafe in the mercat shopping centre kaye and naysmith were waiting there drinking coffee and reading their chosen newspapers guardian for naysmith daily record for kaye dont order anything kaye warned fox not a patch on the other place closer to the car though fox reminded him kayes eyes were fixed on him awaiting his report its a maybe he obliged squeezing into the booth kayes nostrils flared and he leaned over to sniff foxs coat chanel number unless im losing my touch your contacts not a bloke then now whos hercule poirot joe naysmith muttered not bothering to look up from his reading not the interview room teresa collins had been insistent in fact nowhere near that stinking place which was why fox had suggested her home it was the upper storey of a maisonette in gallatown gary michaelson had hinted it might not be the towns most salubrious area actually it looked all right to fox there were plenty worse in edinburgh terraced and semidetached houses many of them split pebbledashed walls and plenty of satellite dishes young mothers some pregnant again pushed their baby buggies while talking into their phones a few teenage lads in baseball caps scowled as the mondeo drew to a halt kerbside and made intuitive grunting noises as the three men stepped out fox pressed the bell marked collins its open a voice yelled fox turned the handle and started climbing the steep flight of stairs someone on the ground floor was hosting a party eminem naysmith stated just sounds like noise to me tony kaye muttered teresa collins was seated in an armchair in her uncluttered living room dangling one leg over the side and with a lit cigarette in her mouth she wore black lycra leggings and a purple tshirt with the words porn star picked out in diamante no need to spruce yourself up on our account kaye told her examining a d poster of beyonce above the fireplace the music from downstairs was causing the windowpanes to vibrate i forgot to ask collins said should i maybe have called my lawyer youre the victim here fox reminded her introducing himself kaye and naysmith there was one other armchair but it was piled high with laundry when it came to underwear teresa collins seemed to favour the thong victim is right she said taking another drag on the cigarette there was a flatscreen tv and freeview box in one corner of the room on an otherwise empty bookcase sat the dock and speakers for an mp player the beige carpet had collected an impressive number of ash burns everybody needs good neighbours eh kaye announced thumping the floor with the heel of his shoe theyre all right the foot hanging over the arm of the chair was keeping time while collinss other knee pumped furiously few uppers to counteract the methadone fox guessed you wont find anything thats not prescribed she snapped back were not looking for anything as i said on the phone its carters colleagues were checking so you say itd be nice if you believed me she looked like she was having trouble focusing on him go ahead then she said at last ask me the same bloody questions di carter used to come here aye some of your neighbours saw him they said so didnt they wasnt very discreet of him what about his colleagues they never came in scholes did one time but that was early days when they were wanting me to be a grass scholes was never here when carter was after one of these favours she shook her head mightve waited in the car she was looking agitated when you lot got wise it was scholes who phoned me tried to warn me off i know it cant be easy going back over this i thought it was done with is this what happens now hes going down so you lot keep persecuting me till i go off my head or do myself in fox didnt answer for a moment you know there are charities that can help numbers you can phone rape crisis all that lot she shook her head determinedly i just want left alone she exhaled a plume of smoke and brushed flecks of ash from her tshirt now hes inside thats all im asking what if hes not inside as soon as the words were out of naysmiths mouth he knew hed made a mistake the combined glower from fox and kaye intimated as much you mean hes out the pale eyes in the paler face had widened you should have been told fox said quietly hes collins got to her feet and padded over to the window staring down on to the street hes been warned not to come within half a mile of you fox tried to reassure her if he does hes back inside pronto well thats just dandy she said voice heavy with sarcasm carters bound to stick to that isnt he lawabiding prick like him she spun away from the window what if i say its all a lie i made it up to get him into bother then youll be the one under lock and key fox cautioned her he placed his business card on the arm of the chair my numbers there any sign of him call me youre here to threaten me teresa collins stated pointing a trembling finger three of you thats intimidation enough plus your story about him being out this is me being told isnt it scholes and haldane and michaelson and now you three i can assure you were ill go to the papers thats what ill do ill scream blue murder will you calm down teresa fox had his hands held up in a show of surrender he took a step forwards but she had spun round again and pulled the window open help she screamed somebody help me fox saw that kaye was looking at him waiting for a decision ill call you fox told collins raising his voice in the hope she might hear later when youve had a chance to he signalled to kaye and naysmith that they were leaving the neighbours upstairs were looking down at them from the landing shes hysterical fox explained starting his descent nobody from the groundfloor party had heard or if they had they couldnt be bothered to do anything about it but the kids were outside on the pavement facing fox and his colleagues as they emerged fox had his warrant card out for them to see back off he told them youseve raped her one voice said accusingly shes just upset aye and who did that eh youse did for christs sake tony kaye burst out look at my car the contents of a waste bin had been tipped over the bonnet and windscreen fastfood cartons cigarette butts crushed beer cans and what looked like the remains of a dead pigeon car wash down the road only three quid one of the gang suggested five if you tell them youre a pig another added there was laughter for which fox was grateful the situation was being defused and teresa collins had stopped yelling and closed her window tony kaye however looked furious he lunged at the youths fox hauling him back by his arm easy tony easy lets just get out of here eh but these wee wankers in the car fox commanded kaye waited another couple of beats before complying using the wipers to brush aside some of the debris and reversing hard to dislodge more from the bonnet swear to god im coming back here with a bat he muttered as the gang jogged along by the side of the car giving it the occasional kick or slap he revved the engine and shot away in first doing a uturn that got rid of almost all the remaining rubbish forget it kaye joe naysmith said its gallatown think youre funny eh tony kaye leaned over and gave him a hard punch to the side of his head laugh now ya wee shitebag that was quick malcolm fox said into his phone evelyn mills was on the other end of the line the eavesdropping operation had been given the green light my boss decided we didnt need to refer it upwards she explained why not my guess is he reckons it might have been knocked back i like the sound of your boss he reminds me a bit of you actually then im flattered how long till youre operational need a telephone engineer to help us with the landline us ive got help two youngsters from cid mobile phone will take longer first things well have access to are numbers called and calls received she broke off you know all this already true he heard her give a short sigh itll be end of play today for the landline some time tomorrow for everything else unlikely scholes would bother emailing carter so i was going to skip the keystroke surveillance fine by me and thanks again evelyn its what neglected friends are for right right just one thing though scholes isnt an idiot might explain why he went to carters house it keeps their conversation private could be all we end up with are texts to arrange more meetings i know she gave another sigh of course you do i keep forgetting how much alike we are maybe thats why we hit it off that time are you sure you want to say any more this may not be as secure a line as wed like she was chuckling as fox wrapped up the call sounds like a result kaye commented all three of them were crammed into the storeroom door slightly ajar joe naysmith keeping watch for spies and dawdlers everything should be up and running by tomorrow home phone could even be tonight thats efficient care to share the secret of your success no just her name then plus naysmith added turning towards his colleagues whatever it was you thought she shouldnt be saying over a nonsecure line he jumped as someone thumped on the door pushing it open superintendent pitkethly stood there face like thunder would i be right in thinking the three of you just paid teresa collins a visit fox rose to his feet shes made a complaint he guessed in a manner of speaking they found your name on a business card on her chair when they went in with the stretcher she saw immediately the effect her words had had and kept quiet for a moment the better to savour the discomfort on the three faces a passerby saw her at her window smearing blood on it from her wrists he called the paramedics all three men were standing now eyes on pitkethly kaye was the first to speak is she shes in hospital wounds dont look too bad question is what drove her to it from the look of you id say ive got my answer she was hysterical naysmith blurted out we left her to it having calmed her down first obviously pitkethly said twisting the knife i mean this is a woman whos had a traumatic experience fragile enough to begin with and with a history of drug use im assuming you didnt just walk away we dont answer to you fox stated regaining a little of his composure you might have to though well make our report and will there be conferring beforehand this question came from dci peter laird who had just arrived at pitkethlys shoulder fox sensed that there were other spectators in the corridor he pushed past pitkethly and saw that he was right laird wasnt bothering to suppress his pleasure at this turn of events i mean laird went on folding his arms youll want to make sure youve got your stories straight shes going to be all right though joe naysmith was asking pitkethly bit late to be showing concern she answered him fox got right into her face enough he said then to kaye and naysmith were out of here going so soon laird was waving with the fingers of one hand as they stalked down the corridor ill need those statements pitkethly called after them as fox pushed open the door to the outside world he saw scholes hurrying in from the car park looks like i missed the fun he said with a grin fox ignored him but kaye gave him a shouldercharge that almost felled him scholes didnt react his laughter followed them to the mondeo where to kaye asked home fox stated they didnt say anything for the first few miles it was naysmith who broke the silence poor woman kaye just nodded reckon we should have stayed kaye looked to fox but saw he wasnt going to answer he was staring out of the passengerside window forehead almost touching it i cant see that we did anything wrong kaye announced trying for more certainty than he felt we were the ones making her frantic so we left but it was me wasnt it telling her carter was out wasnt our job to keep the facts from her joe you sound fox interrupted as if youve already got your report offpat it was her way of crying out for help kaye persisted weve all seen them i havent naysmith corrected him you know the type though if shed really wanted to top herself she wouldnt have stood at the window like that showing all and sundry what shed done what if nobodyd been passing though then shed have phoned herself an ambulance like i say it happens i cant help thinking then dont think kaye snapped at naysmith lets just get back to civilisation and write up what happened he looked towards fox again come on malcolm back me up here she could have snapped any time just our bad luck it happened when it did we could have tried calming her down in case youve forgotten she was screaming fit to burst two more minutes in there and every nutjob in the neighbourhood would have had us cornered kaye kneaded the steering wheel with both hands i cant see that we did anything wrong he repeated fox saw that they were on the m again and had already passed inverkeithing i need you to do me a favour he said quietly what theres a layby just before the bridge pull in and let me out you going to be sick fox shook his head what then just pull over kaye signalled to move into the inside lane saw the signpost for the layby and signalled again it was an area for large loads to stop preparatory to being escorted to the other side of the estuary fox got out of the car and felt the fastmoving stream of traffic attempting to suck him on to the carriageway there was a pavement though and it led to a walkway that crossed the road bridge youre kidding kaye called out to him i need some air thats all what the hell are we supposed to do wait for me on the other side as near to the old tollbooths as you can get want me to come with you naysmith asked but fox shook his head and slammed shut the door turning his collar up he had walked thirty or forty yards before a break in the traffic allowed the mondeo to pass him with a single toot of its horn fox waved at it and kept walking he had never crossed the forth road bridge like this before he knew people did it all the time joggers and tourists the noise from the carriageway was punishing and the drop to the firth of forth seemed vertiginous but fox kept going drawing in lungfuls of fumy air there was a dogwalker coming from the opposite direction she wore a scarf tied tightly over her hair and offered him a nod and a smile neither of which he returned with any degree of success to his left he could see the rail bridge much of it under wraps for maintenance there were islands down there too and over to the right the port of rosyth the wind was ripping at his ears but he felt it was as much as he deserved kaye was right of course a cry for help rather than a serious effort but all the same theyd dropped a bomb on her with the news of paul carter then simply walked away no call to social services or whoever else might willingly check on her a neighbour a relative in the area no theyd cared more for their own skins and that bloody mondeo fox hadnt encountered too much violence or tragedy during his years on the force a few drunken fights to break up when hed been in uniform a couple of bad murder cases in cid part of the appeal of the complaints had been its focus on rules broken rather than bones on cops who crossed the line but were not violent men did that make him a coward he didnt think so less of a copper again no but it was in his nature to avoid confrontation or ensure it didnt well up in the first place which was why he felt he had failed with teresa collins every moment of his time with her could have been played differently and with a better outcome fox rubbed his hands down either side of his face as he walked his pace was quickening the wind growing more biting still as he reached the halfway point he was in the middle of the firth of forth now steel cables holding him aloft he was depending on them to do their job and not suddenly snap without knowing why he was doing it he broke into a run jogging at first but then speeding up when had he last run anywhere he couldnt remember the sprint lasted only a few tens of metres and he was breathing hard by the end of it two proper joggers gave him a lengthy examination as they passed im all right he told them with a wave of his hand maybe he believed it too he took out his phone and snapped the view just so he wouldnt forget south queensferry was below him now with its blustery yachts and boat trips out to inchcolm abbey he started looking for the mondeo ahead of him but couldnt see it had they had enough and left him to it he doublechecked the few parked vehicles then heard a horn behind him and turned to see kaye pulling in having just crossed the bridge fox opened the passengerside door how did you manage that he asked joe here got worried you might be going to jump kaye explained so we went round the roundabout crossed back over into fife did the same at the other end and here we are nice to know you care it was joe remember id have left you to it fox smiled got in and fastened his seat belt thanks anyway he said nice walk naysmith asked from the back seat cleared my head a bit and kaye asked and im fine we could have sworn we saw you jogging fox gave tony kaye a hard stare do i look the type kaye smiled with half his mouth wouldnt have said so then i wasnt jogging was i thats your version of events inspector kaye glanced at joe naysmith in the rearview mirror well always have ours but in the meantime can i assume were headed back to base unless you want to visit a carwash first fox watched kaye shake his head okay then lets see if the news gets to bob mcewan before we do well now mcewan said as they walked into the office he was leaning with the small of his back against foxs desk hands in his pockets youve heard then deputy chief constable of fife constabulary the very man who asked for our help in the first place but hes pleased with the rest of our progress kaye commented not the place for wisecracks sergeant kaye mcewan snapped back suppose one of you tells me what in gods name happened we went to interview her at her home fox began she learned carter was no longer in custody and threw a wobbly we decided our presence wasnt helping kaye added discretion being the better part of valour and all that what state was she in when you left she was a bit shaky naysmith decided to answer a bit shaky mcewan echoed not the screaming abdabs neighbours claim to have heard she did do some shouting fox conceded about police intimidation she misread the situation sir sounds to me like she wasnt the only one mcewan pinched the bridge of his nose screwing his eyes shut he spoke without opening them this gives them a bit of ammo you know that does the deputy want us replaced i think hes weighing it up she wouldnt agree to be interviewed at the station bob fox explained calmly we had to go to her mcewan opened his eyes again blinking as if to regain some focus you told her carter was out that was my fault naysmith admitted mcewan gave a little nod of acknowledgement well he said best get your side of the story down on paper and well see what glenrothes thinks anything else i should know fox and kaye exchanged a look no sir fox stated news of the surveillance operation on scholes could wait one little bombshell at a time was probably enough for the boss later fox went to the canteen for coffee and remembered when he got there that hed not had anything since breakfast eggandcress sandwiches were all that remained of the lunch offerings so he added one to his tray along with a kit kat and a golden delicious when his phone rang he thought about not answering but checked the display and recognised the caller hiya evelyn he said ouch mills said youve heard then not much else being talked about here local press seem to be on to it too you know how that lot will twist it they can try did she seem suicidal no more than any of us fox wiped melted chocolate from his fingers on to a napkin are you still going to be able to help will you still be around for me to help hopefully in that case well see what does that mean it means my boss might get cold feet buy him some socks there was silence on the line until she asked him how he was feeling im okay you dont exactly sound it ill be all right he looked down at his tray only one bite was missing from the sandwich but the kit kat was history the coffee had an oily sheen to it and he didnt feel like starting on the apple all you can do is tell them the truth mills was saying give your side of the story he could have told her that was the problem right there every story had a number of sides your version might differ from everyone elses back in collinss flat had they been pragmatic cowardly or callous others would decide the truth of it and that might not be the truth at all malcolm im still here do you want someone to talk to we could meet for a drink i dont drink since when she sounded genuinely surprised long before i met you i must have forgotten she paused we could still meet though another time eh fox thanked her and ended the call then started rolling the apple across the table from left hand to right and back again nobody suggested a trip to minters after work but as they left the office naysmith did something out of the ordinary reached out his hand for fox and kaye to shake only afterwards did fox see it as a reinforcement of the notion that they comprised a team he drove his volvo out of the car park and headed for home hed almost reached oxgangs when he found himself turning towards the ring road instead it was rushhour busy but he wasnt in a hurry not now that he had made up his mind he followed the signs for the forth road bridge they had passed the victoria hospital on one of their drives around kirkcaldy it resembled a building site because it was one a shiny new edifice near to completion standing next to the old original complex fox showed his id at reception and gave them teresa collinss name he was told which ward to go to and pointed in the direction of the lifts he eventually found himself at a nurses station no visitors came the reply when he asked for teresa so he showed his id again i dont want to disturb her if shes awake he explained the nurse stared at him wondering perhaps what use teresa would be to him asleep but eventually she said she would check he thanked her and watched her go behind him a row of half a dozen hard plastic chairs sat next to the wards swing doors a young man had been sitting there busy texting with his thumb he was on his feet now crossing to the dispenser on the wall opposite and treating himself to some of the antibacterial hand foam cant be too careful he said rubbing his palms together true fox agreed police the young man guessed and you are you look like police and i pride myself on knowing most of the cid faces around here edinburgh is it professional standards heard you were in town he was doing something with his phones screen when he held it out in front of him fox realised it doubled as a recording device the sandyhaired young man in the black anorak was a reporter if you dont mind me asking were you at teresa collinss flat earlier today fox stood his ground saying nothing ive got descriptions of three plainclothes police officers the journalist looked him up and down youre a dead ringer for one of them inspector malcolm fox as hard as he tried something in foxs expression must have changed the journalist gave a lopsided smile it was on a card left on the armchair he offered by way of explanation how about a name for you fox asked in an undertone im brian jamieson local paper sometimes can i ask you what happened in the flat no but you were there he waited a few moments for an answer and now youre here fox turned and walked in the direction the nurse had taken she appeared around a corner drowsy from the sedative she informed him fox checked that jamieson wasnt in earshot but kept his voice just audible in any case shes all right though a few stitches well just keep her the one night psychological services will assess her in the morning after which fox knew shed either be sent home or transferred elsewhere if you wait twenty minutes the nurse added she may well drift off fox glanced in jamiesons direction you know hes a reporter she followed his look then nodded whats he been asking you ive not told him anything cant security kick him off the ward she turned her attention back to fox hes not being a nuisance has he asked to speak to her hes been told its not going to happen so why is he still here the nurses tone grew cooler why dont you ask him now if youll excuse me she brushed past him and returned to her desk where a phone was ringing fox stood there a further thirty seconds or so jamieson was back in his chair busy texting he looked up as fox approached what are you expecting to get from her fox asked thats the very question i was about to put to you inspector not another one the nurse was complaining into the receiver when she saw that they were watching her she turned away cupping a hand over the handset jamieson had been about to push his phones mic in foxs direction again but he lowered his arm instead then he turned and started to leave fox stayed where he was the nurse was ending the call shaking her head slowly whats up fox asked a mans just tried to do away with himself she answered might not pull through hopefully not a normal night fox offered she puffed out her cheeks and exhaled two a year would be more like it she noticed jamiesons absence has he gone i think you did that she rolled her eyes hell be down at a and e if i know brian sounds like you do know him used to go out with a friend of mine who does he work for all sorts what is it he calls himself a stringer thats it her phone was ringing again she made an exasperated sound and picked the receiver up fox considered his options gave a little bow in her direction and headed for the lifts downstairs he got a plastic bottle of irnbru from the vending machine no sugar tomorrow he promised himself heading outside the sky overhead was black fox knew there was nothing for him to do now but drive home he wondered if the budget for the investigation might stretch to a local hotel room hed spotted a place behind the railway station not far from the park and the football ground it would save the commute next morning but then what would he do with himself the rest of tonight italian restaurant maybe a pub there were some ambulances parked up outside the hospital entrance a couple of greenuniformed paramedics were shooing brian jamieson away the reporter held up his hands in surrender and turned away pressing his phone to his ear all i know is he tried blowing his brains out cant have been much of a shot because he was still alive on the way here not so sure now though jamieson saw that he was about to pass malcolm fox hang on a sec he said into the phone it seemed he was about to share the news but fox stopped him i heard he said hellish thing jamieson was shaking his head his eyes were wide and unblinking brain racing many guns in kirkcaldy fox asked might have been a farmer they keep guns dont they he saw that fox was looking at him it was outside town he explained somewhere off the burntisland road fox tried to stop himself looking interested got a name for the victim jamieson shook his head and glanced back towards the paramedics ill get one though he offered fox the same selfconfident smile as before just you watch me fox did watch him watched him make for the doors to the hospital the phone to his ear again only when he had disappeared inside did fox walk quickly towards his own car the police cordon was at the junction of the main road and the track to alan carters cottage fox felt acid gathering somewhere between his stomach and his throat he cursed under his breath pulled in to the side of the road and got out the parked patrol car had its roof lights on strobing the night with a cold electric blue the solitary uniform was trying to tie crimescene tape between the posts either side of the track the wind had whipped one end of the roll from his grasp and he was fighting to control it fox already had his warrant card out inspector fox he told the uniform then before you do that i need to get past he returned to his car and watched the uniform move the patrol car forward leaving space for foxs volvo to squeeze through fox offered a wave and started the slow climb uphill there were lights on in the cottage and just the one car outside carters own land rover as fox closed the door of the volvo he heard a voice call out what the hell are you doing here ray scholes was standing in the doorway hands in pockets is it alan carter fox asked what if it is i was out here yesterday regular bloody jonah then arent you what happened fox was standing directly in front of scholes peering past him into the hallway had a good go at topping himself why would he do that if i lived out here i might do the same scholes sniffed the air looked at fox again and relented turning and heading indoors fox himself hesitated dont we need he looked down at scholess feet not a crime scene is it scholes answered walking into the living room cordons just to stop weirdos drifting up here for a gawp thing im wondering is what are we going to do about the dog fox had reached the doorway of the living room the fire had been reduced to a few embers to the left of it jimmy nicholl lay panting in his basket eyes open just a fraction fox crouched down and stroked the old dogs head and back no note scholes commented popping a strip of chewing gum into his mouth not that i can see anyway he waved a hand across the dining table hard to tell with all this mess mess papers strewn everywhere removed from their folders crumpled some torn into strips others swept to the floor those left on the table were spotted with blood a darker pool where carter had been seated on his chair gun fox said quietly his mouth dry scholes nodded towards the table it was halfhidden beneath a magazine looked to foxs untrained eye like an oldstyle revolver how was he when you spoke to him scholes asked he seemed fine until you came calling eh fox ignored this who found him pal of his makes the regular walk from kinghorn they neck a few glasses of whisky and off he toddles only today he comes waltzing in and finds this poor old bastard fox wanted to sit down but couldnt he didnt know why it just felt wrong scholess phone rang he listened for a moment gave a grunt then ended the call died in the ambulance he said the two men fell silent the only sound was the dogs laboured breathing the pair of you talked about paul scholes asked eventually fox ignored the question wheres this pal now michaelsons running him home scholes checked his watch wish hed hurry up theres a beer waiting for me in the pub you knew alan carter doesnt it bother you scholes continued chewing the gum as he met foxs eyes it bothers me he said what is it you want to see wailing and gnashing of teeth should i be waving my fist at the skies he was a cop he paused then he wasnt and now hes dead good luck to him wherever he is he was also paul carters uncle that he was and the first complainant maybe thats why he did it an overwhelming sense of guilt we can play the amateur psychology game all night if you like except heres my lift fox heard it too engine noise as a car approached the cottage what are you going to do he asked just shut the place up i wasnt planning on bunking down weve had a look and seen whats to be seen uniforms can take it from here and next of kin scholes shrugged might even be paul have you told him scholes nodded hell be here how did he sound when you told him there was silence in the room as scholes stared at fox why dont you just piss off back to edinburgh because if i were you i wouldnt be here when paul arrives but youre not staying i thought he was your mate scholes cocked his head having obviously just thought of something hang on a sec what are you doing here in the first place thats none of your business is that right scholes raised an eyebrow ill make sure to put that in the report he paused underlined in bold gary michaelson was standing on the threshold of the room glaring at fox thought there was a bad smell he said then to scholes whatre you doing letting him tramp all over a crime scene a what carters pal says hed never have done himself in says theyd talked about it what theyd do if they ever got cancer or something carter told the guy hed cling on for dear life something changed his mind scholes speculated and theres another thing pal says hedve known if carter owned a gun something else they talked about shooting the seagulls for the noise they made michaelson looked towards the basket what are we doing about the dog you want it scholes asked do we even know its name jimmy nicholl fox said hes called jimmy nicholl the dogs ears pricked up jimmy nicholl scholes echoed folding his arms owner mightve done the decent thing and taken you with him eh jimmy then to michaelson we ready for the off fox was torn between staying and going but scholes was not going to give him the choice out out out he said the dog fox remonstrated you want it no but leave it to the professionals then they emerged to blue flashing lights another patrol car with an unmarked van behind it its all yours scholes called to the driver at the front but there was manoeuvring to be done too many vehicles in a tight space someone had the idea of unlocking the gate to the neighbouring field a bit of reversing a threepoint turn and they were on their way scholes and michaelson had made sure foxs volvo was in front as they approached the main road the same constable as before undid the cordon to let them through there was a white scooter parked next to his car brian jamieson sat astride it one foot on the tarmac for the sake of balance he was on his phone again pausing as he recognised the driver of the volvo fox kept his eyes on the road ahead scholes and michaelson tailing him for the first couple of miles just to make sure four a right little jonah fox gave tony kaye a look thats what scholes said too it was the following morning and they were back in kirkcaldy theyd ruled out ever using the storeroom again so had commandeered the interview room well be needing it all day fox had informed the desk sergeant the man had put up no resistance just nodded and gone back to his paperwork fox had wondered about that no gloating over teresa collins no hed said out loud once seated in the interview room the mans in mourning no joe naysmith had echoed arriving with a spare chair from the storeroom never mind fox had said kaye had been out to a cafe and fetched them cardboard beakers of coffee fox had phoned him the previous night to tell him about alan carter coincidence kaye had asked getting right to the heart of it got to be coincidence naysmith said now prising the top from his cup and adding a couple of thimblesized cartons of milk i dont know fox countered scholes said something last night about guilt maybe he got wind that his nephew was out and might be lodging an appeal so he went and stuck a pistol to his head kaye said his tone one of disbelief revolver fox corrected him must be more to it than that malcolm or less naysmith added you didnt tape your interview with him did you kaye was asking fox wasnt as formal as an interview but the answers no reckon it might take some heat off with this to occupy them maybe teresa collins will stop being the headline maybe nobodys spoken to you fox shook his head far as i know were still on the case such as it is fox allowed the point with a shrug of his shoulders so what are we doing today naysmith asked good question kaye scratched his head foxy there are two more victims we could talk to fox wasnt managing to sound enthusiastic the drunken lassies kaye sounded keener thats a point what about the surveillance naysmith added might be up and running fox conceded or we just sit in here all day scratching our arses kaye offered ive a pack of cards in the mondeo somewhere there are heaps of questions still to ask di scholes naysmith reminded them wed hardly started when he got called away thats true fox finished his coffee trying to locate any flavour at all in the final mouthful and dci laird needs another going at kaye added even if he gives us heehaw i hate to mention it naysmith added but were not really finished with teresa collins either leave her for now fox cautioned scholes then kaye was making to rise to his feet want me to fetch him ill do it tony you finish your drink but as he headed for the stairs fox saw the unmistakable shape of ray scholes walking in the other direction he was with a stooped elderly man his hand resting lightly across the mans shoulders they were headed for reception scholes didnt see the visitor out though just pointed him in the right direction before turning to head back to his office he saw fox and slowed his pace jutting his chin out i keep thinking youre going to bring me bad luck he said maybe i am we need you in the interview room scholes shook his head not now might be a bit of movement on alan carter what sort of movement fox couldnt help asking never you mind having said which scholes headed for the staircase fox watched him then turned and made for reception the visitor had yet to leave he was talking with the desk sergeant they were shaking hands when he did push open the front door fox followed where you going the desk sergeant barked but fox ignored him the elderly man was standing at the bottom of the steps looking bewildered needing a lift back to kinghorn fox asked him i can do it if you like the man peered at him shortsighted but lacking glasses what hair he had left was jet black fox reckoned it was dyed his eyes were small and deepset his mouth drawn in on itself as though hed forgotten to put his teeth in im fine walking he said having studied fox do i know you my names fox sorry i dont know yours teddy fraser youre the one who found mr carter fraser nodded solemnly fox noticed that he wore a thin black tie with his threadbare shirt mourning again a bad bad thing he muttered to himself youve just been seeing di scholes aye i only met mr carter the one time but i liked him he was hard to dislike did you walk here this morning mr fraser i like walking its not that far busy road though there are a few short cuts must have been a shock finding mr carter a shock fraser gave a short cold laugh you might say that what i mean is i didnt really know him but he seemed fine in himself fraser nodded again there was nothing wrong with him the dis saying theyre checking his health in case the doctor had given him bad news but hed have told me wouldnt he no secrets between us youd known one another a long time we were at school together two years between us but we were in the team fox didnt like to say that fraser looked a lot older if he were the elder by two years then hed be no more than sixtyfour football he asked instead fife champions two years in a row fraser sounded so proud fox wondered if anything since had given the man the same satisfaction where did mr carter play right up front a real poacher twentynine goals one season that was a school record if the minister doesnt mention it at the funeral ill be on my feet reminding everyone fox smiled at this what did di scholes want ach he was just asking about the gun and stuff how was alan positioned when i found him had i moved anything and had you i picked up the phone and dialled but mr carter wasnt dead was he as good as you tried rousing him he was breathing not conscious though but a gun alan never owned a gun and the door unlocked he shook his head vigorously kept it locked even if he knew i was expected if he heard me hed be at the door waiting but otherwise i had to knock and jimmy nicholl would start barking the door wasnt locked no barking when i knocked thought they must be out on a walk even though the dog could only manage a few yards at a time without its back legs giving way so i was expecting the door to be locked he seemed to remember something in fact it wasnt even closed properly thats right when i knocked it opened a wee bit i suppose fox said playing devils advocate if hed planned to do what he did he might leave the door open so he could be found fraser considered this notion but then dismissed it with a snort you know im looking after jimmy nicholl its the least i could do alan doted on that hound and youre telling me he wouldnt have taken jimmy to a vets before doing away with himself he screwed up his face can i ask you something else mr fraser im teddy son everybody calls me teddy i was just wondering what he was working on all those papers on his table ancient history nineteen eightyfives not that ancient to some people it is ill prove it to you right here fraser paused readying himself to gauge foxs reaction he clasped his hands together then mentioned a name youve got me fox conceded after a moment whos francis vernal youd do better finding out for yourself why was mr carter so interested in him im not sure he was not at first i dont follow alan was a copper back then thats why he got the job someone was paying him to look back at was this some case hed worked on fraser dug a bony finger into foxs chest stabbing out a beat to his next words better finding out for yourself having said which he gave a little bow turned and started walking away at a brisker pace than fox had foreseen it actually hurt where the little man had poked him he rubbed the spot with the heel of his hand back inside the desk sergeant was lying in wait come here you he said from the other side of the desk fox walked up to him youve not been pestering teddy i hope he gave as good as he got i take it you know him donkeys years and you knew alan carter too served with him the desk sergeant puffed out his chest one of the old school i got the same feeling the one time we met im sorry the muscles in the sergeants face twitched i dont even know your name fox apologised further robinson alec robinson fox held out his hand and after the briefest of hesitations robinson took it pleased to meet you fox said causing the man to smile sorry if i seemed to give you such a hard time the sergeant responded you know what its like ive had worse trust me fox paused but can i ask you this did you see much of alan carter in his later years not really maybe at the football or a reunion he liked to keep busy though eh built that company of his from scratch robinson sounded impressed so fox nodded his agreement the day i saw him he was still busy he informed the sergeant oh all that work he was doing on francis vernal robinsons face stiffened care to shed some light im not the one to talk to robinson eventually confided then who is these days robinson pondered his answer probably no one back in the interview room fox pointed at joe naysmith i need you to do something for me got a laptop with you no well there must be a spare computer somewhere around here what is it you need an internet search my phone can do that can it print though when naysmith shook his head fox told him that only a computer would do what am i searching for francis vernal you mean the lawyer tony kaye said fox turned towards him died in a car smash back in the eighties go on kaye gave a shrug i was only a kid he paused come to think of it didnt he shoot himself before or after he crashed the car kaye shrugged again and fox turned his attention back to naysmith who took the hint and started to leave whats this about kaye asked as the door closed behind naysmith something alan carter was working on and whats that got to do with us maybe nothing maybe nothing i thought you were bringing us back ray scholes joe got the camera ready and everything fox noticed the tripod for the first time the audio recorder was on the table flanked by microphones he says hes busy whoopee for him lets all take a holiday until he deigns to grace us with his presence the two women fox said why dont you go talk to them you trying to get rid of me i thought you were keen i suppose it beats sitting here watching the cogs whir inside that head of yours well then but first you need to tell me whats going on nothings going on a guy died i liked him his front room was like a shrine to someone called francis vernal and you want to know why and i want to know why fox paused eyes boring into those of his colleague and friend good enough for you anything for a quiet life kaye was rising from his chair easing his arms back into the sleeves of his suit jacket do i take junior with me if you need him isnt he busy on a little job for you it can wait and while were out there on the mean streets youll be doing what exactly checking on the surveillance telling mcewan about the suicide trying to pin ray scholes down i wont be slacking okay kaye nodded slowly but well miss you you know that hell we might even send you a postcard it wasnt foxs fault that evelyn mills wasnt answering her phone the same was true of bob mcewan while ray scholes had gone awol fox found himself back in the police stations reception area staring at one of the notices on the wall it was an advert for a local cab company five minutes later he was in the passenger seat of a dented white hyundai the driver was keen to learn more about the suicide but fox offered him nothing the cordon had been removed and there was no activity outside the cottage itself the driver asked if he wanted him to wait good idea the man turned off the engine he looked to be readying to get out of the car but fox stopped him nothing to see he stated so the driver switched the radio on modern dance music soundtracking fox as he made for the front door it was locked he made a circuit around the house but there was no back door he peered in through the livingroom window there were flecks of blood on the insides of a couple of the panes foxs fingers brushed a small plant pot balanced on the outside ledge he lifted it and saw a key lying there either a spare or left by the police he unlocked the door and went inside jimmy nicholls basket was no longer in the living room fox wondered if he should have asked teddy fraser how the dog was doing didnt pets often pass away soon after their owners the room smelled of woodsmoke the remains of a charred log sat in the grate a fine layer of ash coating the top of the mantelpiece fox started leafing through the paperwork on the table sure enough the news clippings related to the life and death of francis vernal one lengthy story was headlined the inner turmoil of the activist patriot it looked to fox as though the media at the time had soon switched their focus from eulogies to something meatier the dead mans private life there was a blurry photo of his attractive wife and mention of vernals heavydrinking lifestyle and string of affairs the same photo of the lawyer had been picked up by several newspapers he was addressing a scottish national party rally it was outside a factory earmarked for closure vernal was in full flow one hand bunched into a fist mouth open wide teeth bared fox glanced through the window to check that the cabdriver was still in his car he was whistling and had opened a newspaper francis vernal had died on the evening of sunday april the same day dennis taylor played steve davis in the world snooker final his car had been spotted by a van driver it had left the road near anstruther a volvo must have been travelling at speed vernal was in the drivers seat dead his body was taken to the victoria hospital at which time the bullet hole in the side of his head was identified as such a heavy drinker and smoker he had also been prone to bouts of depression his beloved nationalists seemed to have stalled in the polls and vernals dream of a socialist scots republic looked destined to remain unrealised in his lifetime fox sifted through the newsprint some passages had been underlined alan carters handwritten notes were almost indecipherable there were screeds of them no sign of a computer or laptop meaning nothing had been typed fox was wondering who had given him the job and why suddenly a photo caught his eye another rally but taken longer ago vernal in his early twenties by the look of it a bit more hair on his head and slimmer around the chest and stomach but still with mouth wide open and fist clenched there was another young man standing next to him and fox was stunned to find he recognised him it was chris his fathers cousin chris looking just the same as in the photo where he was carrying jude on his shoulders fox lifted this picture from the table and stared at it it had been clipped from the fife free press there was no date and only a few lines of explanation an snp picnic on the links at burntisland the noted edinburgh lawyer francis vernal gives the speech of the afternoon with chris fox standing at his side laughing and leading the applause fox paced the room a couple of times the photo still in his hand then he folded it into his pocket looking around him as if fearing someone might have noticed there was a telephone on a chest of drawers behind the door and he crossed over to it an address book sat next to it it was open and had been turned over fox lifted it and saw that it was open at the page for surnames beginning with c paul carters name was there home and mobile numbers listed fox flipped through the book not sure what he thought he would find a few business cards fell out and he stooped to pick them up one was for an indian restaurant another for a garage but the third belonged to a man called charles mangold he was senior partner in a firm of solicitors called mangold bain with an address in edinburghs new town fox jotted the details into his notebook then tapped his pen against the telephone receiver and stared at the c page again three names there one with a thick line through it probably meaning the person was no longer part of alan carters life or had passed away leaving two names one of them paul carters fox lifted the receiver and dialled the computerised voice informed him that the last number to call the phone had been paul carters mobile the call had taken place the previous evening barely an hour before alan carter had been found he put down the receiver and started opening the various drawers in the chest below it neat and tidy alan carter had kept his bank statements and utility bills filed away the phone bills were itemised there was no sign that alan had called his nephew at any point in the past six months no because they werent close hadnt alan said as much himself but paul soon after his release from custody had felt the need to phone his uncle fox wondered why he looked around the room again where had the mess come from had something made alan carter angry so that he swept papers from the table on to the floor or had someone else done it fox flinched at the sound of tapping on the window it was the cabdriver fox gave him a nod to let him know he was just coming the man lingered taking in the scene fox replaced the address book made sure he was leaving the room as he had found it the one borrowed photograph aside and went outside his driver was apologising no skin off my nose but the meters up to thirty quid its fine fox told him he locked the front door of the cottage and slid the key under the flowerpot back to where we started the driver asked back to where we started fox agreed getting into the passenger seat calls to and from ray scholess home phone were now being logged and recorded the news came in a text message from evelyn mills the network provider for his mobile phone had also been contacted and they would soon have access to information about calls made and received but no access to the actual calls themselves not without taking their request further and throwing money and manpower at it fox had managed a word with bob mcewan letting him know that alan carter was dead mcewan had sounded distracted he was between budget meetings and had thanked fox for his input a word presumably picked up at the earlier meeting fox had told kaye hed try to track down ray scholes but he now had another destination the office of superintendent isabel pitkethly what is it now she asked removing her glasses and rubbing at her eyes its a bit awkward fox said she was immediately interested repositioning her glasses the better to study him when she gestured for him to sit he did as he was told brushing his hands across the knees of his trousers well she prompted elbows on the desk palms pressed together paul carters uncle is supposed to have committed suicide im aware of that it happened soon after he got a call from his nephew she considered this for a moment what of it they werent the best of friends fox pressed on itd be good to know why paul made that call she leaned back in her chair why what difference does it make maybe none he conceded and how do you know about this call anyway i dialled from the deceaseds home and what in hell took you there inspector fox didnt really have an answer to that so he stayed silent this is way past your remit pitkethly said quietly there was a rap on the door and ds michaelson stuck his head into the room he had his mouth open to say something but stopped when he saw pitkethly had company ill come back he offered what is it gary michaelson seemed to be weighing up his options but he was too excited not to spit it out the thing is alan carter cant be dead maam pitkethly looked at him what he cant be dead why not it was fox rather than pitkethly who asked the question because the gun he used doesnt exist it hasnt done for twentyodd years youre not making any sense michaelson produced a sheet of paper fox couldnt tell if it was a fax or the printout of an email the detective approached pitkethlys desk and handed it over she took her time reading it through then she looked at fox well finish our little chat later she was rising to her feet michaelson accompanied her out of the room fox following for the first few steps until she stopped him not your remit was all she said before continuing in the direction of the cid suite michaelson looked over his shoulder giving fox a huge cold smile of satisfaction fox pursed his lips and watched them go then he had an idea it took alec robinson a while to answer the desk buzzer fox could guess why have you heard robinson said some of it fox hedged im surprised how quick it all happened robinson nodded his agreement not that many guns in fife he explained the register was put on computer last year cant think why they backdated it but they did fox still wasnt sure he understood twentyodd years he prompted like i say we dont take many firearms off the street no but when you do fox was still feeling his way broken up and melted down that used to be the way once or twice a year when there were enough to make it worthwhile it was foxs turn to nod and this guns on record as having been disposed of robinson stared at him i thought you knew only some of it fox folded his arms so how come it suddenly turns up in alan carters cottage could he have swiped it robinson shrugged not sure he was ever on the detail guns werent kept here anyway glenrothes i think fox exhaled noisily its a mystery he said thats what it is robinson agreed then eyes on fox dont tell me therell be another inquiry now thats all we bloody well need very nice girls tony kaye said very joe naysmith agreed they were back in the interview room the three of them seated around the table with beakers of tea hairdressers though billies a senior stylist and bekkahs not quite got there yet lucky it was quiet in the salon we were able to grab twenty minutes in the privacy of the tanning booth dont worry though it wasnt switched on bekkah looked like shed spent some time in there naysmith added good figure on her too if thats not being sexist fox could see his two colleagues had enjoyed themselves shed like to give modelling a try naysmith informed him cut to the chase fox muttered well naysmith began but kaye took over the story night out started with the whole team from the salon few casualties along the way chinese meal then pubs and a club its past midnight and they reckon on walking home bekkahs caught short and nips down a side street car pulls up its paul carter identifies himself and says hes taking them in public indecency or some such billie asks if he cant just drop them home instead he says maybe he can but itd mean spending a bit of time on the cars back seat makes a grab for her crotch she pushes him away so then he asks bekkah if she wants to spend the night in the cells same bargain they tell him where he can go and he heads back to his car and calls it in patrol car turns up and theyre put in a cell to sober up which is when carter suddenly reappears and repeats the offer any and all charges dropped if theyll scratch his back no dice billie told him her boyfriend was a bouncer naysmith got the chance to say as if that would cut any ice with carter fox rubbed his chin carters uncle ran a security company he commented so fox shrugged just wondering we can always visit the girls again and ask kaye glanced at naysmith who didnt look entirely opposed to the idea anyway thats about it in the morning they were released without charge no sign of carter but they didnt make a complaint not until they read about teresa collins kaye paused how is she by the way any news ive not checked been some developments here he filled them in naysmith seemed the more interested of the two asking questions and getting fox to repeat bits the better to understand them kaye looked glum throughout what fox eventually asked him i hate to side with pitkethly but shes got a point what has any of this to do with us paul carter comes riding back into town and a day later his uncle has topped himself you dont think theres anything to that whether there is or there isnt were here to investigate three officers none of whom happens to be paul carter we report our findings and then we get to go home so the gun joe naysmith was saying to himself was meant to be destroyed but obviously wasnt they must keep records of these things kaye stretched out his arms in mocksupplication this is not our case he said laying equal stress on each of the words it just isnt it might connect to our case fox told him little bit of digging you never know did alan carter work on the disposal team naysmith asked im sure cid are looking into that kaye said because thats the sort of thing cid do we on the other hand are the complaints the door opened fox was about to remonstrate but saw that it was superintendent pitkethly i need a word she said pointing in foxs direction then to kaye and naysmith either of you two see or speak to alan carter before he died nor after he died kaye said with a shake of his head she gave him a hard look then its just you she told fox my office unless youd rather do it here fox told her he preferred her office she turned away and he got up to follow she was already seated behind her desk when he arrived she told him to close the door and when he made to sit down she ordered him to stay on his feet she had a pen in her hand which she studied as she spoke you may just have been the last person who saw alan carter alive inspector that means cid would like to ask a few questions hardly feasible when im running an inquiry into three of them which is why im asking instead she paused always supposing youve given me a clean bill of health he didnt answer causing her to look up at him she narrowed her eyes and returned her attention to the pen why did you visit him he made the original complaint about paul carter that hardly connects him to scholes haldane and michaelson oh and by the way haldanes feeling a lot worse since your little home visit so thanks for that again fox chose not to comment so what did you talk about with alan carter how did he seem i liked him he wasnt evasive was a welcoming host troubled in any way i wouldnt have said so fox paused theres something else isnt there someone in forensics seems to have been watching csi she was the one who traced the revolver and and shes got a few concerns about the prints the prints on the gun dont get too excited just a couple of anomalies fox thought back to the scene ray scholes already there stuff strewn on the floor the revolver halfhidden below a magazine he remembered alan carter moving around the room making tea handing him a mug carter was righthanded he stated what why was the gun lying to the left of him his head was slumped against the table and the gun was to the left not the right she stared at him not one of the anomalies he guessed no pitkethly conceded writing a note to herself what then alan carters prints are on the gun no one elses theres a good thumbprint slapbang in the middle of the grip fox made show of holding a revolver his thumb was high up on the grip he tried bringing it lower down but it felt awkward and a partial fingerprint halfway along the barrel pitkethly added tossing the pen on to the desk and folding her arms no prints anywhere else youre sure he didnt seem worried about anything fox shook his head but then he probably didnt know at that point that his nephew had been released from custody lets not get carried away malcolm the use of his first name came as a jolt to him she needed him she needed him on her side you have to bring paul carter in he said quietly i cant do that no not to his own police station not to be interviewed by his own friends i can ask the questions fox offered she shook her head youre the complaints this is this is something else when he looked at her she met his eyes theres no proof alan carter didnt pull the trigger she said quietly but all the same anomalies she repeated carter ran a security company he might have made enemies on top of which he was doing some research into an old case oh he was surrounded by the paperwork when he died didnt scholes tell you he said the place was a bit of a tip tidy enough when i visited but afterwards looked like someone had been through it scholes and michaelson were first on the scene michaelson gave teddy fraser a lift home leaving scholes alone in the cottage pitkethly closed her eyes rubbing at her eyebrows with thumb and forefinger fox sat down across the desk from her honeymoons over he told her youve got some big decisions to make first one should probably be to phone hq if you know anyone there talk to them first she nodded opening her eyes again then she took a couple of deep breaths and picked up the receiver thatll be all inspector she said her voice firm but there was a momentary smile of thanks as he got up to leave in the car back to edinburgh naysmith asked fox if he still wanted information on francis vernal i can do it at home tonight he offered thanks fox replied and in case you were thinking that kirkcaldys boring he took a folded printout from his pocket and handed it over heres what i already discovered about the place it was a newspaper report about a yugoslav secretservice agent sent to kirkcaldy in to assassinate a croatian dissident the story was back in the news because the assassination had failed the gunman had been jailed and he now claimed he had information about the murder of swedish prime minister olaf palme fox read the piece aloud for tony kayes benefit unbelievable was kayes only comment before turning the hifi on alex harvey again naysmith complained the sensational alex harvey kaye corrected him drumming his fingers against the steering wheel part and parcel of your musical education young joseph terrorists and bampots eh naysmith offered eyes fixed on malcolm fox we never seem to be rid of them we never do fox agreed reading the article a second time they decided to have one drink at minters it was midafternoon and the place was dead fox went outside and called the offices of mangold bain im afraid mr mangolds appointments diary is full he was told my names fox im an inspector with lothian and borders police if that doesnt clear me some space today tell him it concerns alan carter he was asked to hold the line the womans lilting voice was replaced for a full minute by vivaldis four seasons six oclock she offered mr mangold wonders if the new club might be acceptable he has another meeting there at six thirty itll have to do then wont it fox said secretly pleased the new club was one of those edinburgh institutions hed heard about but never been able to visit he knew it was somewhere on princes street and filled with lawyers and bankers escaping their womenfolk back in the bar kaye and naysmith were waiting to hear if they needed to go back to the office or could call it a day fox checked his watch not quite four he nodded to let them know they were off the hook that calls for another drink kaye said draining his glass and its your shout joseph naysmith rose from the table and asked fox if he wanted another big tom fox shook his head somewhere else to go he said glancing at the tv above the bar the local newsreader was telling viewers that there was no further information on the explosion in the woods outside lockerbie some sick sods idea of a practical joke kaye muttered unless you think the yugoslavs are back joe half an hour later fox was at lauder lodge when he opened the door to his fathers room he saw that mitch had a visitor there was a halfbottle of bells open on the mantelpiece hiya dad fox said his father looked sprightly he was dressed and his eyes sparkled malcolm mitch said with a nod towards the visitor you remember sandy malcolm shook sandy camerons hand the three of them had attended hearts games together when malcolm had been a boy his father always keen to remind him that sandy had almost become a professional back in the day years later the two men had played indoor bowls for a team in the local league decent measure fox noted watching cameron switch his tumbler to his left hand so he could shake with the right whisky shandy cameron explained angling his head towards a bottle of barrs lemonade on the floor next to the chair dont know how you can bear to dilute it mitch fox said draining his own glass maybe you should learn dad malcolm chided him he dragged another chair over and joined them how are you mr cameron cant complain son sandy was just reminiscing about the ice rink mitch confided fox reckoned theyd be stories he had heard half a dozen times or more a hell of a skater you were sandy could have turned pro i did love it cameron smiled to himself and the football but fox knew he had ended up a draughtsman married to myra two kids a contented life what brings you here mitch was asking his son thought you were doing something in fife fox dug in his pocket and produced the photograph came across this he said handing it over his father made show of focusing holding the cutting as far from him as his arm would allow then he fished in his cardigan pocket for his reading glasses thats francis vernal he stated but whos next to him is it chris his fathers voice rose a little in surprise its chris isnt it looks like fox agreed mitch had handed the photo across to his old friend francis vernal cameron confirmed and who did you say the other fellow was cousin of mine mitch explained chris his name was died young in a bike crash how come he knew vernal fox asked chris was a shop steward at the dockyard and an snp man that too i saw vernal speak once cameron added at a miners institute somewhere lasswade maybe firebrand is the word that springs to mind i dont really remember him fox admitted i was in my teens when he died there were rumours at the time cameron went on his wife bloody tittletattle mitch said dismissively selling papers is all its good for he looked at his son where did you find this theres an excop in fife he was interested in vernal why im not sure fox thought for a moment what year did chris die it was his fathers turn to think seventyfive seventysix late on in seventyfive i think crematorium in kirkcaldy then a meal at a hotel near the station mitch had retrieved the photo and was staring at it smashing lad our chris he never married foxs father shook his head always told me he liked life free and easy that way he could just jump on his bike and go exploring whereabouts did the crash happen why are you so interested all of a sudden fox gave a shrug is this you trying some real detective work for a change mitch turned towards cameron malcolm heres only got another year or two till hes back in cid oh aye the complaints isnt for life then i think malcolm would like it better if it was whats that supposed to mean fox couldnt keep the irritation out of his voice you were never happy there his father told him says who youll be a bit rusty then cameron chipped in when you have to go back to the detective work what i do now is detective work its not the same though is it his father continued its exactly the same his father just shook his head slowly silence descended on the room for a moment firebrand cameron eventually repeated he seemed to be thinking back to francis vernals speech the hairs went up on your arms if hed been asking you to advance on the enemy lines youd have done it armed or not i saw him on the james connolly march one year mitch added not something i usually paid attention to but a pal wanted to go to the rally leith links i think it was francis vernal got up to speak and youre right sandy he had the gift not saying i agreed with him but i listened people used to compare him to jimmy reid cameron mused i thought he was better there was none of the comrades stuff it seemed a lost cause back then though didnt it fox added relieved that he was no longer the focus of attention nationalism i mean they were strange times mitch said a lot of anger things getting blown up he had poured himself another whisky the bottle pretty well empty now i was always labour but i remember your mum getting on her high horse about the snp they used to recruit outside folk concerts same thing at the picture house when braveheart was playing cameron added malcolm was never political though mitch fox said maybe worried about sticking his head above the parapet or at least above his homework books fox was staring at his fathers whisky dash of water with that he asked dash of water be damned the new club was hard to find the edifice fox had always assumed it to be turned out to belong to the royal overseas league instead a woman in reception pointed him back along princes street the evening was turning blustery a set of tramlines had been laid but there was now yet another delay as the contractors bickered with the council about payment workers were queuing at bus stops keen to get home it didnt help foxs cause that few of the shops on princes street had numbers it was that he was after but he missed it again and had to retrace his steps eventually next to a cash machine he saw an anonymous varnished wooden door there was a small window above it and he could just about make out the name etched there he rang the bell and was eventually admitted he had been expecting small stuffy georgianstyle rooms but the interior was vast and modern a uniformed porter told him he was expected and led him up a further flight of stairs a few elderly gentlemen wandered around or could be glimpsed poring over newspapers in armchairs fox had thought his destination would be some lounge or bar but in fact it was a wellappointed meeting room charles mangold was seated at a large circular table a carafe of water in front of him thank you eddie he said to the porter who bowed and left them to it mangold had risen and was shaking foxs hand charles mangold he said introducing himself inspector fox is it it is mind if i see some proof fox pulled out his warrant card cant be too careful these days im afraid mangold handed back the wallet and gestured for him to take a seat i forgot to ask eddie to fetch us some drinks waters fine sir mangold poured them a glass apiece while fox studied him portly early sixties bald and bespectacled he wore a dark threepiece suit palelemon shirt with gold cufflinks and a tie of maroon and blue striped diagonals his confident air was edging towards smugness or maybe entitlement was the word been here before he asked first time most other clubs have closed their doors but somehow this place soldiers on he took a sip of water im sorry i cant offer you very much time inspector as my secretary may have said you have another meeting at half past yes mangold said glancing at his watch did you know alan carter was dead mr mangold the lawyer froze for a second dead put a gun to his head yesterday evening good god mangold stared at one of the woodpanelled walls how did you know him he was doing some work for me on francis vernal yes had you known mr carter long i barely knew him at all mangold seemed to be considering what to say next fox bided his time sipping from the glass there was a profile of him in the scotsman a while back focusing on his various business interests it mentioned that he was an expoliceman and that hed played a small role in the original investigation the francis vernal investigation you mean mangold nodded not that there was much of one suicide was the story everyone stuck to there wasnt even an fai meaning a fatal accident inquiry bit odd fox commented yes mangold agreed you reckon there was a coverup of some kind the truths what ive been after inspector twentyfive years on why the wait mangold bowed his head a little as if to acknowledge the acuity of the question imogen isnt well he said vernals widow six months or a year from now i doubt shell be with us and i know the papers will dredge it up again the stories that she drove him to it yes you dont think she did of course not did you work alongside mr vernal for a long time friend of his or friend of his wife mangold stared hard at fox im not sure i can let that insinuation pass then dont look im sorry alan carters dead but what precisely does it have to do with me youll be wanting to take charge of all his research material might have to get used to a few blood spatters mind fox looked to be readying himself to rise from his chair and leave francis vernal was murdered mangold blurted out and no ones done anything about it if i didnt know better id say officers at the time went beyond wilful negligence meaning meaning they were involved by the time they found out hed been shot his car had been removed from the scene the scene itself trampled over obliterating any evidence took them a full day to find the gun did you know that it was lying on the ground twenty yards from where the car had stopped mangold was talking rapidly as if needing to put the words out there francis didnt own a gun by the way papers from his briefcase strewn around nearby cars back window smashed but not the windscreen things missing what things cigarettes for one he smoked forty a day and a fiftypound note he always carried the fee from his first case mangold ran a hand across his head then he looked up at fox youre not what i expected not at all in what way i thought i was going to be warned off but youre too young to have been part of it and your warrant card says professional standards that means police corruption yes it means complaints against the force mangold nodded slowly francis vernal should be a story inspector so many holes in the original investigation was carter making any progress a little mangold thought for a moment not much he conceded a lot of the players are no longer with us i doubt he would have taken the job if gavin willis were still alive gavin willis being alans mentor he was a di at the time francis died and he led the inquiry only ten years or so older than alan but alan definitely looked up to him mangold leaned forward a little as if readying himself to share a confidence did alan tell you about the cottage no it belonged to gavin willis when he died alan bought it thats how close the two men were in which case fox said carter was hardly going to blacken williss name im not so sure people like to get to the bottom of things inspector dont you find so what will you do now that youve lost your researcher find another one mangold stated staring intently at fox there was a tap on the door and the porter eddie announced that the first of mangolds guests had arrived downstairs mangold got to his feet and walked around the table shaking foxs hand and thanking him for coming just a pity the circumstances couldnt have been different fox gave the slightest of nods and allowed eddie to show him back down the staircase just inside the front door a new arrival was handing his overcoat to a porter while discussing the weather he glanced towards fox as if to check whether he warranted some greeting in the end the curtest of nods was all fox got will you be in your usual spot sheriff cardonald the porter was asking ill bring you your drink usual spot cardonald agreed fox paused to watch him head for the stairs sheriff colin cardonald the man whose decision had put paul carter back on the streets he hadnt felt like another takeaway or microwave meal so had treated himself to a restaurant in morningside an italian place with plenty of fresh fish on the menu the evening paper kept him occupied for about ten minutes after which he tried not to look as if he was interested in the other diners really he was thinking trying not to but thinking all the same about ray scholes and paul carter about paul carter and his uncle about alan carter and charles mangold charles mangold and francis vernal vernal and chris fox chris and mitch mitch and fox himself bringing him right back to scholes and carter again no wonder his head was spinning there was a dance going on in there an eightsome reel with too many couples and not enough floor space when his waiter came over looking concerned and asking if everything was okay fox realised hed hardly touched his main course its fine he said scooping up another forkful of monkfish you were never happy there youll be a bit rusty then should he have offered a stronger argument defended himself against the charge two old men with a couple of drinks under their belts what was the point he thought back to his time on the force prior to the complaints he had been diligent and scrupulous never a shirker he had put in the hours been commended for his errorfree paperwork and ability to lead a team no egos and no heroes he hadnt been unhappy he had learned much and kept out of trouble if a problem arose he either dealt with it or ensured it was moved elsewhere ideally suited to complaints and conduct his reviews eventually started concluding but was that altogether a good thing or was it cids way of telling him he didnt fit in there too scrupulous too willing to sidestep problems when he caught his waiters eye he told him he was finished not as hungry as i thought he offered by way of apology back at the house he switched on the tv and found multiple channels of dross the news was focusing on a royal engagement and not much else fox lasted ten minutes then went in search of his computer he knew he could wait until morning joe naysmith would stick to his word but all the same he typed francis vernals name into the search engine and clicked on the first of links half an hour later a text came in from tony kaye copycat blast peebles this time bloody kids fox couldnt think how to reply so turned his attention back to the computer screen instead copycat bloody kids as usual tony kaye was seeing what he wanted to see fox wasnt so sure five there was a layby near the spot where francis vernals car had left the road a small cairn had been erected with a plaque on it commemorating a patriot someone had even left a bouquet of flowers the flowers were shrivelled could be they dated back to the anniversary of the crash mangolds work maybe on behalf of himself and vernals widow fox had brought his own car over to fife this morning leaving the m and skirting glenrothes heading for what was known as the east neuk little fishing villages popular with landscape painters and caravanners lundin links and elie st monans and pittenweem then anstruther pronounced ainster by locals francis vernal had died on a stretch of the b north of anstruther he didnt play golf but had a weekend place on the outskirts of st andrews nobody was sure why he hadnt stuck to the a a quicker route the only theory was a picturesque detour once you headed away from the coast it was all farmland and forestry no way to tell which particular tree his car had collided with another theory mud left on the roadway by tractors had caused the car to skid fine fox could accept that but something had happened afterwards not everyone who smashed their car then felt compelled to reach for a handgun had vernals lifestyle caught up with him stress a rocky marriage too much drink the drink makes him swerve off the road maybe he wants to end it all but hes still alive afterwards so he reaches into the glove box for the revolver a revolver same sort of gun used by alan carter by him or on him fox ran his fingers over the memorial kids down the years had scratched their names into it a couple of soupedup cars had flown past him a few miles back stereos blaring maybe driven by cambo or ali desi or pug straightening up he breathed deeply not a bad spot peaceful the drone of distant farm machinery the halfhearted cawing of a few crows he could smell freshly turned earth a trudge around the vicinity provided no further clues no one had left a bouquet resting against any of the trees none of the news reports had been able to provide a photo of the car in situ and even the few monochrome pictures of the site were speculative apparently mangold was right the volvo had been removed and taken to a local junkyard before any forensics could be done the early newspaper reports didnt even mention suicide it was a tragic accident robbing the country of a bright political talent the obituaries had been plentiful but sticking to the same anodyne script a book had been published a few years later and half a chapter had been dedicated to the mystery death of political activist francis vernal the book had been a short compendium of unsolved scottish crimes but it produced no new evidence instead its author had posed questions the same questions fox had been asking himself throughout his online reading of the previous evening hed printed out quite a lot of it finishing one ink cartridge and replacing it with a spare back at his car he lifted the heavy folder from the passenger seat and considered opening it but then his phone buzzed meaning he had a text message it was from tony kaye summats up fox called kayes number but he wasnt answering he turned the ignition key did a threepoint turn and headed back towards kirkcaldy the copshop car park was full so he parked on the street outside single yellow line so he had to hope he wouldnt get a ticket the sign next to the front desk stated that the alert status had been raised from moderate to substantial the storeroom was unlocked and empty so he made for the interview room opening the door he saw paul carter slumped in a chair on the other side of the table sat isabel pitkethly out pitkethly ordered fox muttered an apology and closed the door again kaye and naysmith were coming along the corridor towards him might have warned me fox growled i just did kaye responded sure enough fox had another text message ir a nono thanks fox said stuffing the phone back into his pocket so whats going on you should see cid naysmith interrupted theyre going mental it would be nice if someone told me why some spotty little reporter tony kaye obliged theres a petrol station on kinghorn road and he went there to fill up his puttputt and naysmith butted in again he asks the attendant if he saw anything the night alan carter died turns out the guy did paul carter kaye added he saw paul carter looking agitated stopped his car at the pumps got out but didnt do anything about filling it pacing up and down looking at his phone punching the buttons but not seeming to get an answer we already know paul carter phoned his uncle fox felt it necessary to state but he was heading for the cottage naysmith stressed so half an hour ago it was a clear case of suicide and now the nephews a murder suspect foxs stare moved from kaye to naysmith and back again hes going to go to jail kaye argued in no small part because of his uncle if nothing else naysmith added it probably means he went to the cottage whatever they talked about it ended with a gunshot and a corpse they heard footsteps two men and a woman had come through the swing doors led by sergeant alec robinson robinson was stonyfaced the new arrivals took the measure of fox kaye and naysmith then knocked on the interviewroom door and went in robinson avoided eye contact with fox as he headed back to his desk glenrothes kaye speculated aye fox said a minute later the same three officers were leading paul carter out he saw fox and his colleagues and came to a stop im being stitched up here he snarled i never did nothing the two male officers gripped him by either forearm and led him away hands off me the woman offered a glance back in foxs direction as she followed them know her kaye asked his mouth close to foxs left ear names evelyn mills fox admitted shes complaints same as us and she wears chanel pitkethly was standing in the doorway of the interview room the look she gave fox told him it had been her decision to bring glenrothes in he nodded to let her know hed have done the same what does he say he asked got a call from his uncles number caller hung up another call same thing happened she folded her arms wondered what was going on decided to go ask him in person but got halfway and changed his mind maybe thats what happened then maybe you dont sound convinced she glowered at him and decided against answering fox kaye and naysmith watched her stride down the corridor away from them home sweet home kaye said making to enter the interview room fox saw that naysmith was lifting a heavylooking shoulder bag from the floor at his feet that stuff you wanted the young man explained took me half the night a ream of paper and a change of printer cartridges he made to hand the contents of the bag to fox youll never guess how many hits there were on francis vernals name he looked stunned when fox got it exactly right it was over an hour before mills had the chance to call fox he hesitated a moment before answering your girlfriend kaye guessed yes inspector mills fox said into the phone letting her know he had company im not sure what this means for the surveillance she told him me neither if we catch carter talking to scholes and owning up to something might be inadmissible fox concurred ive got the procurator fiscals office working on the pros and cons but knowing them itll take a while she paused might be safer just to pull the plug on the other hand fox reasoned the tap is on scholess phone not carters and scholes isnt the one cid have in their sights it was foxs turn to pause hows it looking for carter his superintendent tells us you were the one who came up with the lefthandrighthand thing on the revolver thats true its all circumstantial of course of course he agreed but it might add up to something foul play yes a murder inquiry quite possibly based here fox looked around the small room its the nearest station wed have to send in our own team naturally naturally cid and the complaints working together if thats what the bosses decree scholes michaelson haldane sidelined sounds as if its going to be pretty hectic around here you plan to stay put until told otherwise malcolm you realise youre a witness well need to ask you about alan carter no problem scholes is already stirring things oh says you were on the scene pretty fast not half as fast as him and michaelson difference is theyd been called to the cottage im happy to answer any questions inspector mills see you soon then she said ending the call fox relayed everything to kaye and naysmith then told them he was stepping outside for a breath of air across the other side of the car park brian jamieson was standing next to his scooter there was a woman alongside him with some sort of recorder slung over one shoulder and headphones clamped to her ears she was holding a microphone in front of jamieson local radio was interviewing local stringer fox walked over jamieson had already spotted him and was telling the woman who he was the microphone swung towards him i need a word fox told jamieson inspector the young woman said can i just ask you for a comment on the arrest of paul carter fox shook his head and then angled it into the car park knowing jamieson would follow that way he would look important and fox got the feeling hed want to look important in front of his colleaguecumcompetitor we saw him being lifted jamieson was saying as he caught up with fox is that him off to glenrothes what made you go into the petrol station pit stop after you left the scene i was there the best part of two hours needed a caffeine hit the attendant knew paul carter jamieson shook his head it was the car he described rather than the man so you cant be sure it actually was carter jamieson stared at him the forecourts covered by cctv i had to wait for the garage owner to okay me seeing the playback thats why i didnt come forward sooner no doubt about it inspector its paul carter caught on camera and he drives off afterwards yes still heading towards the cottage is he saying its coincidence hes saying he did a uturn jamieson was thoughtful camera only covers the pumps he had moved ahead of fox so he was facing him funny isnt it what paul carter so close by his uncles place the night the uncle decides to do away with himself and who are the first two officers on the scene paul carters best buddies fox kept his face a blank what made you think to ask the attendant if hed seen anything suspicious jamieson gave a twitch of the mouth maybe a hunch hunches have got me where i am today youre a regular quasimodo fox agreed heading for the police stations back door waiting for him on the other side stood ray scholes hands in pockets feet apart you know who he is scholes cautioned fox agreed that he did are you giving him anything no best keep it like that fox made to move past but found his way blocked i need to show you something scholes said it was the screen of his phone fox took it from his hand and peered at the message it was from paul carter get fox for me five minutes the phone started vibrating fox looked at scholes thatll be for you scholes told him i dont want it scholes said nothing and wouldnt take the phone back when fox offered it to him the call ended the two men staring at one another it rang again immediately point made scholes said you can answer it now hello said fox its carter i know listen ive pulled a few stunts in my time i admit that but not this never this what do you want me to do about it fucks sake fox im a cop arent i you were and someones trying to frame me so so somebodys got to be on my side there was anger in the voice but fear too tell that to teresa collins foxs eyes were boring into scholess you want me to own up paul carter was saying every time i crossed the line or even thought about it why did alan carter die how should i know you didnt go to see him foxs voice hardened if you try lying to me i cant help you i swear i didnt did you send anyone else he was still looking at scholes who stiffened and bunched his fists no any idea why he phoned you im telling you i dont know anything so what am i supposed to do ray cant exactly go snooping can he wouldnt look good fox conceded but he tells me you talked to my uncle the sound that came from carters throat was somewhere between a sigh and a wail maybe you can do something anything why should i i dont know carter admitted i really dont know wherever carter was fox could hear new noises muffled voices he was no longer free to talk the phone went dead and fox checked the screen before handing it back to scholes well scholes asked fox seemed to be weighing up his options then he shook his head squeezed past scholes and headed for the interview room but scholes wasnt giving up alan carter had enemies he said some he made on the force others afterwards the shafiqs they own a string of shops and businesses had a runin with some of carters boys bad blood there fox stopped and held up a hand you cant just go throwing names around bombs going off in lockerbie and peebles we could play the antiterrorism card keep them in custody till they talk scholes saw the look on foxs face oh aye he said with a sneer i forgot its racist to lock up anyone with a funny name fox shook his head and moved off again this time scholes didnt bother following he called after him instead when he texted me wanting to speak to you i sent a message straight back told him he was wasting his time a real cops what he needs and thats not you fox thats nothing like you his voice dropped just a fraction a real cops what he needs he repeated as fox shoved open the swing doors anyone else we should be talking to tony kaye asked the three of them were perched on the sea wall eating fish and chips from the wrappings across the water a ray of sun picked out berwick law far to the right they could make out arthurs seat and the edinburgh skyline tankers and cargo vessels sat at rest in the estuary it was lunchtime and the gulls were flapping around looking interested haldane might be worth another shot fox suggested really kaye asked what do you think i think a murder inquiry might be about to happen and wed be better off elsewhere last thing fife constabulary is going to need is us running around trying not to barge into their murder team true fox admitted yet i cant help noticing were still here kaye tossed a morsel of batter into the air watching a gull swoop and snatch it its friends readying to gang up against it so tell me what else we could add to the sum of our knowledge theres the surveillance fox offered but thats not our operation scholes haldane and michaelson weve hardly scratched the surface with them youre clutching at straws malcolm this time a salted chip spun into the sky dropping to the ground and being pounced on by four of the gulls all right i give in fox turned towards naysmith joe tell the man why we cant go home just yet francis vernal naysmith said on cue it had been evident to fox from first thing naysmith had been reading the same online articles rumours and suppositions as fox and he was hooked taken for granted at the time that it was suicide media hardly touched it no rolling news or internet back then but vernal had told friends he thought he was being watched that his office and house had been broken into nothing taken just stuff put back in the wrong place so who was watching him kaye asked spooks i suppose and why would they be interested in him i hadnt realised how wild things were in the mideighties naysmith said licking vinegar from his fingers you had cnd demos star wars summits star wars not the film it was a missile defence thing reagan and gorbachev cruise missiles were on their way to britain the clyde was being picketed because of polaris friends of the earth were protesting about acid rain animal rights hilda murrell naysmith paused you remember her right lets pretend i dont kaye said pensioner but also an activist tam dalyell naysmith broke off the mp kaye stated im not completely glaikit well he had a theory shed been killed by mi theyd been paying a private eye to keep tabs on her im not hearing anything about francis vernal kaye was scrunching the greasy wrappings into a ball early eighties was also a hotbed of nationalism fox informed him isnt that right joe naysmith nodded snp werent doing well in the polls and that led some nationalists to look towards ireland for inspiration they reckoned a few explosions might focus londons attention explosions letter bombs were sent to mrs thatcher and the queen plus woolwich arsenal the ministry of defence and glasgow city chambers that last one on a day princess di was visiting all these splinter groups seed of the gael snla scottish national liberation army fox explained for kayes benefit scottish citizen army dark harvest commando that last one they took a wee trip to gruinard naysmith paused again enlighten me kaye muttered its an island off the west coast infected with anthrax in world war two germans kaye speculated naysmith shook his head we did it ourselves planned to drop anthrax over germany but wanted to test it first after which gruinard was uninhabitable fox added they took it off the maps to stop people finding it but the dark harvest commando went there and lifted some of the soil then started sending it to various government agencies francis vernal was involved kaye speculated few years after he died one reporter filed a piece he said vernal had been paymaster for the dark harvest commando did he have proof information was harder to come by back then remember that book spycatcher these days it would be on the net no way a government could stop people reading it naysmith looked up at fox and fox nodded to let him know hed done well naysmith smiled and pushed a hand through his hair i really got into it he said sounding almost embarrassed at his own enthusiasm even found some clips of a tv show edge of darkness i remember that kaye broke in big american cia guy with a golf bag full of guns it was about the nuclear industry naysmith elucidated catches the paranoia of the time he shrugged seems to me anyway how much did you find about dark harvest commando fox asked him virtually nothing same here for one thing almost nobody ended up in court for another it just seemed to fade away fox nodded slowly polaris and acid rain kaye mused seems like ancient history he slid from the sea wall and held the ball of rubbish above a bin see what im doing here he tossed it in thats what we should be doing with all of this he brushed his hands together you really think so fox asked i know so were not cid malcolm none of this adds up to anything we should be part of im not so sure kaye rolled his eyes did alan carter kill himself fox asked quietly maybe kaye stated after a moment if he was murdered his nephews looking good for it pauls adamant it wasnt him and nor is he a sleazebag who tries coercing women into giving him blow jobs oh hes a sleazebag all right doesnt mean we should let them hang him out to dry let who hang him out to dry thats what i want us to find out kaye had moved towards fox until their faces were a couple of inches apart were the complaints malcolm were not mission impossible i know that loved that show when i was a kid naysmith commented both men turned to look at him then kaye smiled a wan smile and shook his head all right then he said knowing he was beaten what do we do you keep the investigation going second interviews with the main players that gives us our reason for being here while you go snooping just for a day or two a day or two scouts honour fox said pressing two fingers together and holding them up the cordon had been moved further up the track it comprised the usual length of crimescene ribbon guarded by a boredlooking uniform fox and naysmith showed their id cid must have arrived fox explained to naysmith as the uniform lifted the tape so their car could pass under it the gate to the field was open the field itself emptied of livestock and now useful as a temporary car park two unmarked cars one patrol car and two white vans a suited shavenheaded veteran was talking into his phone beside one of the unmarked cars his eyes were on the new arrivals as they parked and got out fox offered him a nod and started walking towards the cottage he could see figures moving around inside at least two of them were scene of crime dressed in regulation hooded white overalls hands and feet covered so they wouldnt contaminate the locus bit late for that fox muttered thinking of the number of people who had traipsed in and out since the body had been found hey you the man with the phone was approaching from the field he had a loping gait which caused him to slip on some mud and nearly lose his footing from the look on his face fox surmised this wasnt the first time it had happened its treacherous fox commented the man ignored him using his phone as a pointer who are you my names fox fox reached for his warrant card again inspector lothian and borders so what brings you here how about some id first cant be too careful the man gave him a hard stare but eventually relented his name was brendan young he was a detective sergeant glenrothes fox guessed dunfermline you in charge dis inside not now he isnt the man who stepped from the cottage was six foot three and as broad as a rugby player jetblack hair combed straight forward and small piercing eyes im di cash theyre lothian and borders young informed him bit lost gentlemen cash asked i was out here a few days ago fox began to explain interviewing alan carter about his nephew youre the complaints fox sensed a hardening of tone doubtless youngs face was hardening too normal enough reactions we are he concurred then i was right first time you are a bit fucking lost cash smiled at young and young smiled back this is a suspicious death not murder yet then fox interrupted but cash wasnt going to give him the satisfaction of an answer why dont you just go back to stripsearching your own kind to see if theyve pocketed any paper clips from the stationery cupboard fox managed a twitch of the mouth thanks for the advice but im here for fingerprints cash stared at him fingerprints mine fox explained then patiently as if to a child i was in the living room and hallway might have left prints if i give them to scene of crime they can be verified and eliminated up to us to decide that cash stated of course fox accepted cashs eyes stayed on him for a moment then moved to young go fetch someone young headed into the house fox saw that the door jamb was splintered a crowbar had been used to open it he walked over to the window ledge lifted the flowerpot and showed cash the key kirkcaldy cid didnt tell you he guessed they didnt well you know what its like this is their patch dont expect any favours i might say the same thing fox gave another twitch of the mouth nearing a smile this time youll give us a statement about the deceased cash asked whenever youre ready for it how often did you meet him just the once what did you think good guy fox nodded wouldnt want to get on the wrong side of him though oh seems to me he didnt suffer fools or family gladly plus he ran a security firm fox slipped his hands into his pockets i was here again afterwards he went on not long after the body was discovered the papers on the table had been disturbed strewn about the place anything taken couldnt say he paused you know what carter was working on i get the feeling youre about to tell me lawyer called francis vernal died in suspicious circumstances gunshot reckoned suicide at the time about thirty miles from here francis vernal that was back in the eighties fox shrugged one of the overalled figures was emerging from the cottage she removed her hood and overshoes which one of you she asked me malcolm fox replied he followed her to one of the vans she climbed into the back and found everything she needed the portable scanner however refused to work flat battery fox guessed she had to resort to the backup of ink and paper the result was signed by both of them after which she handed fox a wetwipe for his fingers this was followed by a dna swab of the inside of his cheek and the plucking of a couple of hairs from his head i cant afford many fox complained need to get the root she explained after everything was sealed into pouches she locked the van sorry about that she said heading back to the cottage when was the last time you had your prints taken naysmith asked been a while fox saw cash watching them from the living room the di gave a little wave as if granting them permission to leave naysmith however had started walking in the direction of the land rover bit of quality he said peering in through the driversside window mind you dont leave any prints fox warned him naysmith took a step back and looked around question for you he said why leave your car out here when youve got a garage fox looked in the direction he was pointing a track led up the slope behind the cottage ending at a ramshackle building afraid it might collapse fox guessed but all the same he started trudging uphill naysmith a couple of steps behind him the garage was padlocked the lock looked old the doors comprised vertical slats of wood weathered and warped by the elements theres a window here naysmith said by the time fox reached him he had wiped at it with a handkerchief without helping them gain much impression of what was inside tarpaulin i think they walked around the garage even gave it a kick in a couple of spots but there was no easy way in give me a sec fox said walking back down the slope again there was no one in the hallway of the cottage so he moved briskly past the livingroom door and found the small kitchen keys hung from a row of hooks to the left of the sink he ran an eye along them and chose the likeliest candidates as he was turning to leave he saw cash emerge from the living room what are you doing there looking for you fox slipped the keys into the inside pocket of his jacket removing a business card at the same time so you can reach me to arrange that interview he explained handing it to cash cash looked at it then back at fox i know youre all excited he said in an undertone not normally getting to play with the big boys and all that but i need you to bugger off now understood fox said managing his best to look and sound humbled in the presence of a murder squad detective cash escorted him to the front door and looked to left and right wheres that workexperience kid of yours call of nature fox explained nodding in the direction of the trees he walked towards his car opened it and got in cash was at the window again watching but after a couple of moments he turned away and fox got out of the car heading back to the garage the second key unlocked the padlock and they were in naysmith had been right a tarpaulin was draped over what looked like another vehicle there was dust everywhere a workbench boasted rusty tools homemade shelves had buckled under the weight of old paint cans there was an electric lawnmower for the patches of grass to the front and rear of the cottage along with the rolledup extension cable it was the newest thing visible naysmith had lifted a corner of the tarp not exactly roadworthy he commented more what youd call a writeoff fox went to the other end of the vehicle and lifted another corner the car was a maroon volvo it seemed fine until he lifted the cover further there was no glass in the rear window give me a hand he said together they pulled back the tarpaulin the front of the car was wrecked its engine exposed grille and bonnet missing tell me it isnt naysmith said in a voice just above a whisper but fox was in no doubt at all vernals car the one that had been taken to the scrapyard fox tried the passengerside door but it was jammed shut from the force of impact the cars interior didnt look as though it had been touched in quarter of a century there were bits of broken glass on the back seat but not much else naysmith couldnt get the drivers door to open either how come its here he asked quietly no idea fox said but then he remembered cottage used to be owned by a cop called gavin willis he ran the original inquiry so he could have kept the car for himself still doesnt explain why no it doesnt fox paused reckon you can get in through that window he meant the gaping rear windscreen naysmith removed his expensive jacket handed it to fox for safekeeping then hauled himself up squeezing through the gap what now he asked from the back seat is there anything that might interest us naysmith felt beneath the front seats then stretched between them and opened the glove box he found the paperwork for the car and handed it to fox who stuffed it into his pocket half a set of spare bulbs and a few sweetwrappers naysmith reported but thats about it fox could hear voices down at the cottage theyd be wondering why his car was still there while he wasnt out you come then he said he helped pull naysmith through the opening they were standing side by side naysmith slipping his jacket back on when the garage door shuddered open cash and young were standing there what do you think youre doing francis vernals car fox stated cash stared at the volvo then at fox again how do you know make model colour fox explained and damage naysmith added pointing to the engine casing i want the pair of you out of here cash growled pointing a finger of his own just leaving fox told him cash and young stayed with them until theyd reached their own car then watched as they did a threepoint turn and drove slowly back down the hill cash following on foot just so he could be sure they paused while the cordon was lifted and waved to the uniform as they trundled towards the main road what now joe naysmith asked this is where you get to show off your detective skills joe fox told him kirkcaldy library find a phone book for and make a note of every scrapyard in the area if we track down where the car went weve half a chance of finding out why it left there again naysmith nodded might not mean anything of course every chance fox agreed but at least well give it a shot eh having dropped naysmith outside the library fox headed for the police station rain had started gusting against the windscreen he turned on the wipers the drops were huge sounding like sparks from a fire he thought back to that day in alan carters cottage the two of them seated either side of the fireplace mugs of tea and an old dog for company what could have been cosier or more domestic yet carter was a man who had built up a security company from nothing that spoke to fox of an inner toughness maybe even ruthlessness then there was the evidence of his old friend teddy fraser the cottage door kept locked at all times why what had the jovial old chap to fear maybe nothing maybe it was the sharp businessman who had to keep his wits about him to the extent of having a gun nearby if the gun was his to begin with teddy fraser thought otherwise there was no sign of jamieson or the woman reporter outside the car park fox spotted tony kayes mondeo pitkethlys space was free again but she had warned him against taking it looked like the volvo was going to have to sit on the street again and risk a ticket francis vernal too had driven a volvo a safe steady choice so the adverts would have you believe kaye had teased fox often enough about that the roadway either side of the crash site boasted a few curves and bends but nothing serious fox thought of the speeding cars that had passed him near the memorial were there petrolheads back then nothing else for the local youths to do of a rural evening could someone have driven vernal off the road having parked and looked around for traffic wardens in the vicinity fox got out and locked the car he felt something in the pocket of his coat the logbook from vernals volvo its edges were brown with age warped by damp some of the pages were stuck together at the back were sections to be filled out after each regular service the lawyer had owned the car from new by the look of things three years hed been driving it prior to the crash eight and a half thousand miles on the clock at the time of its last trip to the garage the service centres stamp was from a dealership on seafield road in edinburgh long since relocated there were some loose folded sheets in a clear plastic pocket attached to the inside back cover of the book dealing with work done to the car and parts replaced fox unlocked the driversside door tossed the logbook on to the passenger seat and headed towards the station he was halfway across the car park when his phone rang it was bob mcewan sir fox said by way of introduction malcolm mcewans tone caused fox to slow his pace what have i done this time ive had fife on the phone the deputy chief he wants to pull us out he wants to pull you out fox stopped walking kaye and naysmith can keep doing their interviews and prepare their report but bob cid called his office apparently furious with you because i told them their job because you went barging into a potential crime scene because instead of leaving when told you found somewhere else to stick your nose in i went there to assist mcewan was silent for a moment would you swear to that in court malcolm fox didnt answer and would you have joe naysmith back you up all right fox relented its a fair point you know better than anyone we have to stick to the rules yes sir and thats why youre coming home is that an order or a request bob its an order do i get to kiss the children goodbye first theyre not children malcolm theyll do fine without you fox was staring at the stations back door ill let them know whats happened mcewan was saying youll be back here in an hour yes fox switched his gaze to the sky above the shower had passed but another was on its way yes he told bob mcewan i will yes when fox walked into the complaints office there was a note waiting for him from bob mcewan another bloody meeting keep your nose clean fox noticed a couple of supermarket carrier bags sitting on the floor next to his desk they were heavy he lifted a box file from one and opened it a photograph of francis vernal in full oratorical flow stared up at him below it lay a sequence of stapled sheets some halfcovered in scribbled postit notes the second box file seemed to comprise more of the same there was no covering letter fox phoned down to reception and quizzed the officer there gentleman dropped them in he was told give me a description there was a thoughtful pause just a gentleman and he gave my name he gave your name fox ended the call and made another to mangold bain the secretary put him through to charles mangold im just heading out mangold warned him i got your little present good its everything alan carter passed on to me before his death im not sure what you think i can do with it take a look at it maybe then give me your reaction thats as much as i can hope for now i really need to be on my way fox ended the call and stared at the two large boxes not here bob mcewan would have too many questions he crossed to his bosss desk and left a note of his own knocked off early at home if you need me phone the house if youre sceptical then he drove to oxgangs and placed the two boxes on the table in his living room as he came back through from the kitchen with a glass of appletiser he realised how similar the two scenes might eventually be alan carters table piled high with paperwork and now his with a tightening of the mouth he got down to business alan carter had on the face of it done a lot of work he had sourced copies of the scotsman for the whole of april and may really to prove only that almost no attention had been paid to the lawyers death fox found himself lost in these newspapers there was an advert for a computer shop he remembered visiting the advert was for an icl personal computer with a price tag of almost four thousand pounds this at a time when a brandnew renault with radiocassette thrown in could be had for six in the situations vacant column one company was seeking security guards at seventyfive quid a week a flat in viewforth was on sale at offers over news stories flew at him bombs in northern ireland a cnd demo at loch long soviet missiles freeze snubbed by washington there were protesters at a proposed cruise missile base in cambridgeshire companies were being advised to protect sensitive electronic information from the effects of a nuclear detonation the princess of wales on a visit to scotland yard was shown the oven and bath used by serial killer dennis nilsen alex ferguson was the boss of aberdeen fc and they topped the league throughout april petrol was going up five pence to just over two pounds a gallon and princess michael of kent professed herself shocked to find out that her father had been in the ss fox found himself reaching for his mug of tea without remembering getting up to make it animalrights protests and acidrain protests and teachers warned by their employers against wearing cnd badges in the classroom neil kinnock was leader of the labour party and prime minister margaret thatcher was on a middle east tour a poll showed support for the snp stubbornly fixed at fifteen per cent of the scottish population a flooded colliery was to be closed and there were fears the trustee savings bank might move its hq south of the border joe naysmith had mentioned hilda murrell and though she had died the previous year she made it into the newspaper too the mp tam dalyell was insisting she had been killed by british intelligence and home secretary leon brittan was to be quizzed on the matter fox was surprised by how little of this he remembered he would have been in his highers year at boroughmuir confident that a university or college place awaited him jude had been more interested in politics than him shed gone out canvassing for the labour party one time fox meanwhile had turned his bedroom into a sanctum where he could concentrate on his sinclair spectrum computer losing patience as yet another game failed to load because he couldnt find the sweet spot on his cassetteplayers volume knob hearts games with his dad on a saturday but only if he could prove all his homework was done he was fine with schoolwork but never watched the news or read a paper just ad and the sports pages francis vernal had died on the evening of sunday april that night a large chunk of the population fox included had been glued to their tv sets as dennis taylor faced steve davis in the final of the world snooker championship taylor eight frames down at one stage had staged the fightback of his career when he potted the final black of the final frame to take the match it was the first time hed been ahead in the entire contest for the few days afterwards his face was all over the papers vernals death rated not a mention until his obituary appeared including on one line a misprint of his name as vernel couldnt happen today fox mused out loud no internet back then as naysmith had said rumours could be contained even news could be contained few enough woodwards and bernsteins in the scottish media at the best of times fox could imagine a newspaper editor baulking at reporting details of a suicide there was the family to consider and maybe youd liked the guy respected him what good did it do tarnishing his name by letting strangers know how hed died a patriot opening the second box fox felt his eyebrows raise a little photocopies of the original police notes on the case along with autopsy details and pictures someone had been into the vaults to retrieve this lot which alan carter had then copied and sent to his employer had money changed hands or did carter still have friends on the force where did fife constabulary store its old casework in edinburgh they used a warehouse on an industrial estate he checked his watch it would take him a few hours to go through everything he knew he should take a break the sound of a message arriving on his phone was timely tony kaye and joe naysmith were having a drink at minters poets day remember fox smiled to himself piss off early tomorrows saturday it was all the invitation he needed i have to tell you kaye said as fox approached the table youre in danger of becoming a local hero in kirkcaldy hows that fox asked settling into his seat they dont like the murder squad muscling in and so far youre the only one whos managed to put those particular noses out of joint is it a murder yet kaye shook his head as he took a sip of beer suspicious death he confirmed joe naysmith returned from the bar with foxs spiced tomato juice thanks joe fox said how did you get on at the library eight scrapyards in fife six of them still going did you manage to call all six yes get lucky not exactly one guy i spoke with reckons the job wouldve gone to barrons wrecking can i assume thats one of the two firms no longer in business naysmith nodded the scrapyards now a housing estate and mr barron thats the good news when he sold up he got one of the newbuilds as part of the deal he lives on the estate its not really an estate six executive homes hes still there ive not managed to speak to him yet but i will good lad fox realised kaye was giving him a look not too far removed from pity wild goose chase kaye duly commented how about you tony anything to report kaye considered his response while he swilled another mouthful of beer then he smacked his lips and said not much fox waited for more and kaye obliged incident rooms been set up in the main cid office meaning scholes and michaelson have been shunted out haldanes still off sick kaye nodded dci laird has decided that cid should take up residence in the interview room leaving joe and me homeless have you talked to pitkethly about it she wasnt exactly sympathetic kaye paused there is one thing what fox asked the surveillance kaye replied with you kicked into touch shouldnt you hook me up with coco chanel joe and me need to know what shes hearing from those phone taps ill check with her fox said kaye nodded slowly and what about you foxy got enough to keep you busy ill manage i dont doubt it kaye had finished his drink and was rising to fetch another fox shook his head and naysmith said hed just have a half to top up his own pint once kaye had gone to the bar naysmith leaned over towards fox do you need me for anything just keep doing what youre doing naysmith nodded i was thinking about the gun he added whose gun the one used to kill francis vernal what about it where did it come from ive been wondering that myself how outrageous would it be if fox finished the sentence for naysmith it turned out to be the same gun fox considered this pretty outrageous he decided any way to find out maybe want me to fox shook his head youre doing fine as it is the cars the other thing the words were tumbling from joe naysmith fox had seldom known him so excited maybe the youngster was more suited to cid than complaints i mean it was never given a forensic check was it and the technology these days is way ahead of what they had back then if we got it to a lab who knows what they could find up to and including your prints on the interior fox reminded him which would give you a few awkward questions to answer this reminded naysmith of something the stuff i got from the glove box fox shrugged service history naysmith looked disappointed then perked up am i right though about forensics fox nodded slowly lets see if theres a case first though eh the internet has his widow as a prime candidate nicelooking woman bit younger than him came from a rich family naysmith paused still alive for now worth talking to maybe fox wasnt sure charles mangold would like that but all the same kaye was returning with the drinks naysmith moved back to his original position look at the pair of you kaye chided them like kids plotting something and not wanting the grownups to know he placed the fresh glasses on the table what do you reckon should we make a night of it it being friday im heading back fox demurred me too naysmith added kaye sighed shook his head more in sorrow than in anger and lifted the pint to his mouth pair of sodding kids he muttered to himself off you go then and remember to do your homework we will naysmith said with a smile one last thing though kaye added with a wag of his finger dont bother to wait up for daddy once home fox sent a text to evelyn mills and sat down at the table again there was some unopened mail on the windowsill he hadnt opened it because it comprised a bank statement and a creditcard bill and neither would be good news fees at the care home had risen twice in the past year fox didnt begrudge them well maybe just a bit more than once hed considered asking jude if she couldnt look after their dad it wasnt as if she had a job he could pay her make it worth her while and hed still be better off he wasnt sure why he kept chickening out plenty of hints for her to take or she could always make the offer herself instead she just nagged at him and said shed be happy to pay her share if she ever had the money you could always take him in so could you malcolm he said to himself pay a home help to do a lunchtime meal and a bit of cleaning it would be manageable just about manageable not really though no fox couldnt imagine it he was too set in his ways liked things just so it wouldnt work it was almost a relief when his phone rang he answered it was mills why a text rather than calling me yourself she immediately asked are you cheap or what i just thought he paused for a second doesnt it look suspicious me phoning you of an evening she snorted i get calls all the time freddies used to it freddie her husband presumably a mysterious text on the other hand i should have thought of that anyway im here now so what can i do for you wondered how the surveillance is going nothing to report she paused who do i report to anyway youve heard then di cash can be like that you know him by reputation tell me hes on your radar she gave a little laugh hes never crossed the line malcolm not yet at any rate pity fox rubbed a hand across his forehead to answer your question i suppose tony kaye is your contact now let me give you his number he did so then asked if it was okay to give kaye her name and number sure she said hows the alan carter inquiry shaping up slow going kirkcaldy hasnt exactly thrown a welcome party evelyn i need to ask you another favour you want me to put in a word see if theyll let you back not that no but im interested in the gun oh so im wondering if i can talk to someone about it and you want me to arrange it you dont ask much do you malcolm im sorry a name and maybe a contact number thats all and what do i get in return she sounded almost coquettish fox stared at the paperwork in front of him what do you mean just my little joke she laughed again you neednt sound so scared its not that evelyn what then nothing did you really have that bad a time at tulliallan i had a great time at tulliallan mmm i wish i could remember more of it she paused as if waiting for him to say something when he didnt she said she would text him if she got anywhere with the gun thanks again can you tell me why youre so interested in it though not really no he paused it might be nothing need to let that brain of yours ease off i can hear it working from here take the weekend off inspector let your hair down youre probably right he managed a smile good night evelyn sweet dreams malcolm do you still snore his mouth was hanging open wondering how to answer but she had already ended the call six its not the same gun i promise you that her name was fiona mcfadzean and she was as millss text had put it fifes ballistics person she was based at the constabulary hq in glenrothes it had taken fox a while to find the place too many roundabouts and a shortage of signposts mcfadzean didnt work in the main building fox had been directed to a squat brick structure behind the petrol pumps a uniformed officer was filling the tank of his squad car aye thats fionas lair he assured fox mcfadzean had to come and unlock the door for him she wasnt wearing a white coat and seemed quite happy in her windowless space against one wall stood an array of building materials from brick to wood pockmarked with bullet holes a glassfronted cubicle contained a whitepainted wall speckled pink mcfadzean had explained to fox that they used it to confirm blood spray from a gunshot and what exactly is it that you shoot fox asked anything from watermelons to pigs heads my uncles a butcher which is handy she was a young vibrant woman and she took him on a quick tour of her domain an assistant sat at a computer she introduced him as paul and he waved a greeting without looking up from the screen much gun crime in fife fox asked not really we were set up as a kind of experiment carpets always about to be pulled from under us budgets getting squeezed et cetera mcfadzean had no desk as such she seemed content to perch on a stool at a narrow counter which ran the length of one wall there was a coffee pot and she poured for both of them while fox tried to make himself comfortable on the spare stool before deciding to stand instead thanks again for seeing me he said she nodded her head once and lifted the mug to her lips cupping it in both hands how can you be so sure about the guns fox then asked the coffee was too bitter but he took another sip anyway so as not to give offence serial numbers for a start she said paul had some free time last year so he computerised all the old records she showed fox the printout this is the gun francis vernal used fourinch barrel rather than sixinch samecalibre bullet but six chambers rather than five a second printed sheet was passed to fox the revolver used to kill mr carter fox studied the details different gun he agreed it says here the gun from the vernal shooting was destroyed she nodded happens to all the weapons we confiscate she handed him a third sheet it was a detailed list of weapons from fife and tayside constabularies sent to be melted down there werent many the revolver found on alan carters table should have been destroyed in october the one found near vernals car had suffered the same fate a year later have you got a history for both guns fox asked we can do only so much mcfadzean apologised blowing across the surface of her coffee be in a file somewhere paul called out probably at the national ballistics lab in glasgow buried deep in the archives so you dont know where they came from in the first place mcfadzean shook her head the revolver found in alan carters cottage how do you think it got there somewhere between the lockup and the furnace it took a walk fox nodded his agreement has that happened before guidelines are pretty strict lots of checks and balances not a regular occurrence then fox studied the sheets again someone pocketed it he guessed seems likely i mean it could have been dropped or mislaid she saw the look on his face okay thats not so likely she admitted do we know who was on the detail whose job it was to dispose of the weapons over the page she said motioning for him to flip to the final sheet ah he said because there was a name there he recognised detective inspector gavin willis yes mcfadzean prompted fox tapped a finger against the paper di willis he explained alan carter worked under him bought his house when willis died might explain it paul said swivelling round in his chair to face them gun was in the house carter found it and kept it making it more likely that he took his own life mcfadzean added or at least that the revolver was lying around for someone else to use fox argued wasnt it you who noticed the fingerprints werent right she nodded first thing we do she explained is check any firearm for trace evidence after that we match the gun to the bullet just to be sure and then we search for provenance it hadnt been fired in a while paul continued hadnt been looked after rust mcfadzean explained and a lack of oil unused bullets in the other chambers paul added they had to be a couple of decades old from the fibres we found it had probably been stored in a piece of cloth just plain white cotton so they should be searching the cottage for that cloth fox said they have done at our request nothing so far paul interrupted nothing so far mcfadzean confirmed fox blew air from his cheeks what do you make of it im not really sure she confided pauls theory is that the gun had been taken to the cottage used to kill the victim and then his prints pressed to it in a halfbaked attempt to make it look like suicide she paused but fox prompted but youve just given us reason to believe the gun may have been in the cottage all along alan carter might have had cause to be fearful fox stated maybe he kept the revolver close by that doesnt work paul said rising from his chair and pouring himself more coffee victim was seated at the table from the spray pattern we know thats where he was when he was shot if someones taken your gun from you and is pointing it at you youre not likely to stay seated with your back to them fox agreed he thought for a moment what if someone has the gun pointed at you and tells you to sit down they want something from you something thats already on the table paul considered this and nodded slowly you find it for them and they then shoot you or you refuse and they shoot you anyway mcfadzean added the room was silent for a moment so fox asked was the revolver there all along or did someone bring it with them i know cid are looking at the victims nephew mcfadzean commented he would have known the cottage and might have known where the revolver was kept the two men werent exactly close fox argued if there was a gun on the premises carter kept it secret even from his oldest and closest friend and what about the missing cloth killer took it with him paul suggested if there was a killer mcfadzean cautioned if there was a killer her assistant agreed then he turned towards fox one other thing fionas quite right when she says not many guns go astray these days id say none at all but back then fox prompted a few of the guns that turned up in police custody began life with the army back in the seventies a lot of stuff explosives included went awol from barracks up and down the land most of it destined for the troubles northern ireland the paramilitaries needed weapons they were being stolen to order whats your point paul shrugged that revolver could have been destined for belfast ulster wasnt the only place with terrorists fox informed him we had our fair share on the mainland too he was thinking of the scottish national liberation army and letter bombs in downing street the dark harvest commando with their anthrax spores and their possible paymaster francis vernal youve got a point paul said he went to a filing cabinet pulled open a drawer and started searching mcfadzean gave fox an indulgent smile he nodded his agreement paul was good at his job a minute later hed found the relevant file and was handing a photograph to fox it showed a desk in a police station laid out for the medias attention was an array of firearms the dozen or so rifles were tagged the pistols revolvers and ammunition were in sealed evidence bags fox read the label on the back scottish republican socialist league trial he nodded at paul another splinter group to add to the list he commented some of these would have come from the army from breakins at barracks fox looked at him inside jobs all it takes is a few sympathisers a blind eye turned a key handed over im seeing shotgun cartridges but no shotguns fox said handing the photograph to mcfadzean par for the course she explained no ones saying these groups had high iqs not even the leadership we caught them didnt we she brandished the photo as proof while paul placed the photograph back in its file fox rubbed at his jaw with the palm of his hand can i ask you something else fire away if youll pardon the expression he gave her a smile do you have a theory about these explosions mcfadzean gestured towards pauls computer pauls been doing a bit of work on that plastic containers filled with bits of metal screws washers stuff you can find in any diy store detonation sent the whole lot flying a distance of thirty metres probably not kids then not unless theyve been reading the anarchist cookbook paul said theyve not perfected it yet though mcfadzean added folding her arms but theyre getting better her colleague cautioned mcfadzean nodded her agreement looking pensive theyre getting better she said and once theyre satisfied fox asked then it wont be trees theyll be targeting mcfadzean said fox thought long and hard about a detour to kirkcaldy maybe a snack at the pancake place with kaye and naysmith but weighed up the risks and decided against it instead he drove back to edinburgh stopping for petrol and a burger he had called ahead but charles mangold was busy until two at half past one fox was parked outside the new town headquarters of mangold bain the offices were on the ground floor of a steepsloping georgian terrace looking directly on to queen street gardens the receptionist smiled and asked him to take a seat there was a copy of the financial times on the coffee table along with the latest property guides and a golfing magazine when a taxi drew up outside fox got to his feet and watched mangold get out his face was reddened by alcohol as he came inside he spotted fox immediately and offered his hand good weekend inspector i did a lot of reading anything interesting actually a bit of a pageturner mangold seemed satisfied by this answer coffee please marianne good and strong he barked to the receptionist fox shook his head to let her know he wouldnt be needing any mangold was already leading the way through the door to the right of reception they entered what would have been the hallway of a private house at one time there was an unused fireplace and a grand staircase leading up another door at the foot of the stairs took them into what fox guessed would have been a sitting room fireplace with antique mirror above it intricate cornicing and ceiling rose mangold switched on some lights marianne said it was urgent he began resting his hand against an electric radiator then stooping to turn it on should warm the place up he said rubbing his hands together good lunch fox inquired new club was it ondine mangold corrected him the other night you were waiting for guests yes did colin cardonald happen to be one of them mangold shook his head though i did spot him in the club that evening dozing in his chair with the crossword halffinished he checked his watch did marianne say she told me i could only have fifteen minutes fox followed mangolds lead and seated himself at the polished oval table but that only holds if im working for you which im not im a police officer and this is a police matter which means i take as long as i need there was a knock and the coffee arrived along with a bottle of water and two glasses the receptionist asked mangold if he wanted her to pour yes please marianne they waited until shed gone closing the door behind her mangold was gulping at the coffee eyes closed cant drink like i used to he explained and i do have a very full afternoon then ill get to the point two points actually fire away i want to talk to imogen vernal impossible mangold said with a flutter of one hand next point please if i dont see her ill drop off those two box files at the front desk and thats the last youll hear from me mangold stared hard at fox pushing out his bottom lip what is it you need from her he asked what is it you think youre protecting her from ive already told you shes very sick i dont want her to be made to feel even less comfortable mangold paused second point he commanded reaching into his pocket for a voluminous handkerchief not until weve dealt with the first it has been dealt with mangold stated wiping around the sides of his mouth i want her take on things fox decided to explain i want to hear her talk about her husband i can tell you about francis you werent married to him though i knew him as well as imogen did fox didnt bother responding to this instead he moved to item two all these groups of the time the srsl snla dark harvest commando i forget the gaelic one siol nan gaidtheal thats it seed of the gael how close was vernal to them i only know what ive read imogen cant help you there none of those rumours ever reached her but you heard them of course and believed them i asked francis a few times he would just dismiss the suggestion with one of his looks whats your feeling though mangold took a sip of coffee while he considered the question was he an active paramilitary no i doubt that but there are ways in which he could have helped legal advice possibly what else money had to be raised and then kept safe frank would have known what to do with it fox nodded he was their banker i have absolutely no proof would he have kept the money on him mangold offered a shrug how much are we talking about thousands mangold speculated there were a few bank robberies early in the decade a couple of securityvan holdups claimed by the snla those were the stories at the time all the years you worked with him dodgy visitors lockeddoor meetings odd phone calls no more than any other lawyer mangold replied with a lopsided smile he stared into the bottom of his cup i really do need to stop drinking at lunchtime ill feel bloody awful later on he glanced up at fox are we finished here inspector not quite did you ever hear names names members of these various groups mi would know more about that than me but theyre not here right now mangold conceded the point and furrowed his brow in thought no no names he said at last any of vernals friends seem a bit out of place we met all sorts inspector youd visit a couple of pubs and end up in the company of vagabonds and cutthroats never knew if you were going to wake up with a tattoo or an infection or not wake up at all fox managed the smile he felt was expected of him how about your own politics mr mangold unionist now but back then broadly the same funny you were such good friends with a dyedinthetweed nationalist fox paused or is that where mrs vernal comes in id rather she didnt come into it at all mangold said quietly but she must fox insisted dropping his own voice a little mangold looked suddenly tired and defeated he held up his hands in surrender then slapped them down against the table ill see what i can do he paused staring down at his cup again more coffee i think thank you for your time fox started to get up but just remember you came to me yes mangold said with almost a trace of regret oh one other thing mangold had risen and was facing fox did alan carter ever mention the car to you mangold seemed confused what car francis vernals volvo no i dont think so why do you ask no reason really fox said with a shrug but inside he was thinking what else did he keep from you and why mangold stayed in the room fox insisting that he could see himself out he stopped at the receptionists desk she looked up from her work and smiled marianne isnt it fox enquired she added a nod to her smile something ive always meant to ask charles and somehow keep forgetting yes the firms name mangold bain is there still a bain it was vernal mangold she explained ah yes until poor francis died he tried his best to sound like one of mangolds oldest clients youre too young to have known him of course of course she agreed looking slightly put out that he could mistake her for someone of that vintage so mr bain he prompted theres never been a mr bain its a maiden name mr vernals widow imogen fox guessed shes a partner of some sort not that no mr mangold meant it as a well a kind of memorial i suppose wouldnt it have been more of a memorial if hed just kept the name vernal on the stationery fox asked marianne seemed never to have considered this thanks for your help fox told her bowing his head slightly and taking his leave fox sat at his desk in the complaints office staring at the blank screen of his computer bob mcewan was taking a phone call as ever it seemed to concern the upcoming reorganisation the complaints would be swallowed up by standards and values they would go in the words of mcewan from micro to macro just dont ask me what that means fox had sent texts to both tony kaye and joe naysmith and was waiting to hear back from them he had thought about visiting the central library digging into its newspaper archive he had cuttings from the scotsman but not from the herald or any other scottish paper of the time he doubted he would find anything the media had soon lost whatever interest it had had in the story when the office door opened fox saw that the chief constable was leading a visitor inside the chiefs name was jim byars he was in full uniform peaked cap included which meant he was on his way to a meeting or else was out to impress someone the visitor was a man in his late forties with a tanned face square jaw and greying hair he wore a threepiece suit and what looked like a silk tie a handkerchief was visible in his breast pocket ah malcolm the chief constable said then for the guests benefit this is professional standards psu the rubber heels the visitor said with a slight smile his accent was english the hand he held out for fox to shake bore no rings fox had glanced in mcewans direction he could see that his boss was torn it would be polite to end the call and greet the visitor but he wanted byars to know that he was earning his keep he gave the chief a wave then motioned that he would wrap up the call byars gesture let him know this wasnt necessary just giving dci jackson the tour the chief explained to fox then to jackson malcolm fox is an inspector detective rank but we dont use the term hows your workload jackson asked fox manageable fox replied wishing he had turned on his computer his desk looked bare half an inch of paperwork in the intray was jackson something to do with the coming reorganisation was he seeking posts that could be cut he had that look to him a brisk hardnosed beancounter working in fife arent you the chief asked frowning as he realised how stupid the question sounded not today sir rest of my team are fox swallowed there was no reason to suppose the chief constable would know hed been kicked into touch even if he did know it wasnt the sort of thing you wanted to advertise to a visitor what brings you here fox asked jackson instead byars got in first with the answer dci jackson is based at special branch antiterrorism didnt know we had much of that in edinburgh fox felt obliged to state jackson gave the same brief smile the blast in the forest outside peebles he offered and lockerbie before that fox nodded to let him know hed heard were thinking they may have been a trial run inspector why peebles anywhere would have done jackson paused remember glasgow airport the perpetrators lived quietly in the suburbs and as peebles is part of lothian and borders byars explained were assisting dci jackson and his team not quite a beancounter then jackson was looking around the office as if filing every detail of it away bob mcewan was trying desperately to wind up his conversation whats happening in fife the englishman asked not much fox said cid officer byars told jackson in court for overstepping the line weve been asked to check whether his colleagues covered up for him jackson looked at fox and fox knew what he was thinking im with you chum never give away more than you have to mcewan had ended the call and was coming towards them byars made the fresh round of introductions and explanations interesting mcewan said folding his arms never goes away does it how do you mean jackson asked him domestic terrorism malcolms latest case has an angle really jackson sounded suddenly interested it had to be naysmith had to be joe naysmith whod let it slip to mcewan fox made show of shrugging it off a very slight connection he mooted but jackson was not to be deflected as in he prompted someone malcolm interviewed mcewan obliged he was doing some research into a lawyer who got himself involved with scottish separatists quarter of a century back fox stressed the chief constable looked at jackson not quite the same as your peebleshire bombers not quite jackson admitted his next question was aimed at fox what happened to the lawyer died in a car crash fox stated unlike the researcher mcewan added he put a revolver to his head dearie me jackson said then he gave fox that same unnerving smile again when naysmith called foxs mobile an hour or so later fox was alone in the office mcewan having left for yet another meeting elsewhere in the building before naysmith could say anything fox thanked him for telling mcewan all about alan carter and francis vernal he just asked me what i was up to naysmith responded well thanks anyway now weve got special branch interested fox went on to explain the circumstances could be a bonus naysmith argued cant you ask him if theres anything in the files on vernal whether he really was being spied on you think hed tell me even if he knew this was twentyodd years ago reckon the spooks have instant access maybe not naysmith conceded but how else are we going to find out if they were keeping tabs on him we arent fox said eventually there was silence on the line for a moment want to hear what ive got naysmith asked what have you got barrons wrecking you spoke to him hes a good age now but what a memory when i said as much he joked that it was because so much of his business was kept off the books told me i could grass him up to the taxman if i liked but you got round to asking about the car eventually he remembered it well towtruck brought it in but it was there hardly any time at all before someone came asking for it to be taken elsewhere gavin willis fox guessed the very same naysmith confirmed they got it as far as the cottage but it took four of them to push it up the slope into the garage did he tell them why he wanted it i dont think anybody asked he paid barron in cash and that was that and no one came to the scrapyard asking for it willis slipped mr barron an extra twenty and told him to say it had gone into the crusher and barron never bothered asking why the way he put it was when a cop tells you to do something you do it im not sure thats so true these days fox thought for a moment willis worked the firearms detail he informed naysmith could have pocketed the revolver that was used on alan carter why though im still not sure did barron remember anything else about the car he didnt swipe anything from it nothing hes admitting to then thats that fox said pacing the empty office what do you want me to do next malcolm gavin willis i wouldnt mind knowing how and when he died maybe hes got some family left i can check naysmith sounded as if he was writing himself a note to that effect have you seen tony fox asked told me he was taking billie and bekkah out for coffee the hairdressers fox stopped by the window he had a view towards the car park with fettes college behind it the pupils seemed to be heading home a line of parental cars waiting to collect most of them whats his thinking hormonal naysmith guessed fox saw dci jackson being escorted to his car by the chief constable jackson had his own driver nice executive saloon too he got into the back byars closing the door for him as the car pulled away a window slid down jackson was staring up towards the complaints office there was no way he could see fox standing there but fox backed away all the same though he wasnt exactly sure why francis vernals widow lived in a detached victorian mansion house in the grange district of the city the narrow streets were devoid of traffic and pedestrians almost no homes were visible they remained hidden like their owners and those owners wealth behind high stone walls and solid wooden gates charles mangold had been adamant that fox could only visit if mangold accompanied him fox had been just as adamant that this was a nonstarter nevertheless mangold was waiting in an idling black taxi as fox approached the driveway as fox got out of the car to announce his arrival at the intercom mangold emerged from the back of the cab i have to insist the lawyer was saying insist all you like what if imogen wants me there she can tell me that to my face but you stay this side of the gates until she does mangold looked furious but said nothing he spluttered his way back to the taxi slamming the door after him fox told the intercom he had an appointment the gates swung back on themselves with a motorised hum and he returned to his car it was a long winding driveway with thick shrubbery to either side fox emerged into a gravelled parking area in front of the twostorey gabled house it was dusk birds roosting in the wellestablished trees he locked his car from habit only the front door to the house was open a woman in her thirties standing there she introduced herself as eileen carpenter i look after mrs vernal her nurse you mean and other things besides the hall smelled musty but had been dusted carpenter asked him if he wanted some tea please he answered following her into the drawing room it boasted a huge bay window imogen vernals chair had been placed so that it faced the garden to the side of the property youll forgive me if i dont get up she said fox introduced himself and shook her hand her ashblonde hair was thin and wispy and there were lesions on her cheeks and forehead her skin was almost transparent the veins showing fox reckoned she couldnt weigh more than seven and a half stone but her eyes though tired were lively enough the pupils dilated by recent medication there was a diningroom chair to one side of her and fox seated himself a book was open on the floor a hardback copy of a charles dickens novel fox presumed one of eileen carpenters tasks was to read to her employer quite a house fox said yes did you live here with your husband my parents bought it for us a wedding gift great parents rich parents she corrected him with a smile there were framed photographs of her husband on the mantelpiece one looked familiar the orator in full flow fist clenched as he addressed his audience i wish id heard him speak fox said truthfully i think i have some recordings she paused and raised a finger no she corrected herself i donated them to the national library along with his books and papers people have done their phds on him you know when he died an american senator wrote an obituary for the washington post she nodded at the memory he was quite a character fox agreed in public her eyes narrowed a little charles told me about you inspector such a pity about the other man the one who passed away she paused is charles outside the gates yes hes very protective was he one of your lovers she took her time answering as if wondering how to respond you make me sound like a jezebel her voice was becoming more noticeably scottish its just that he seems to have a great deal of affection for you he does she agreed and there were always the rumours that your marriage had been stormy stormy she considered the word not a bad description how did the two of you meet manning the barricades not literally almost a sitin at the university i think we were protesting against vietnam she seemed to be thinking back although it could have been apartheid or rhodesia he was already a lawyer i was a student we hit it off despite the age gap my parents didnt approve at first she conceded was mr vernal a nationalist back then he was a communist in his youth then it was the labour party nationalism came later you shared his politics she studied him im not sure what it is you want from me inspector i just felt we should meet she was still mulling this over when eileen carpenter arrived with a tray the teapot was small and there was just the one bonechina cup and saucer it was looseleaf tea accompanied by a silver strainer fox thanked her she asked her employer if anything else was needed were fine i think imogen vernal replied you might want to let charles know then for foxs benefit hell be waiting for her to send him a message a little colour was rising to carpenters cheeks as she left the room shes not a spy exactly imogen vernal told fox but charles will keep fussing fox poured tea for himself you know why he hired alan carter he asked to clear up my husbands murder youre sure in your own mind that it was murder pretty sure did you say as much at the time i dont recall the newspapers mentioning it to be quite honest with you i was a little bit afraid fox accepted this but all you have are suspicions no actual evidence no more than youll have gleaned she conceded placing her hands on her lap and suicide not an option francis was too much of a coward its something ive been thinking about recently i told them i was coming off the chemo and everything else it was too too much theres morphine for the pain but you can still feel it just beyond the cotton wool suicide had to be considered but that particular course of action takes a certain bravery im not brave and neither was francis he wasnt ill was he strong as an ox despite the cigarettes yes had there been a fallingout no more so than usual that stormy relationship again stormy rather than rocky has anyone used the word firebrand in connection with him she watched as fox nodded his reply id be disappointed had they not that was francis you see in his life his work his politics he didnt care if you were for him or against him so long as you had fire in your belly theres a cairn near where he died charles had it placed there and the yearly bouquet from me fox leaned forward a little who do you think killed him mrs vernal i dont know the period leading up to his death had he been worried about anything no he thought he was being watched that pleased him it meant he was getting to them who the establishment i suppose and how was he getting to them his speeches his power to change peoples minds the polls suggest he wasnt changing too many minds she dismissed this with a toss of her head everyone he met he had an effect on them she paused and watched fox bring out the photograph of her husband with chris fox do you know this man he asked her no his names chris fox he died in a motorbike crash a few years before your husband it happened near burntisland she considered this not so far from where they killed francis you think theres a connection not really he shares your surname he was my fathers cousin she looked at him did he know francis well ive no idea fox studied the picture again before returning it to his pocket he took another sip of tea ive heard breakins mentioned yes here and at the office two in as many weeks reported to the police she nodded no one was ever caught was much taken money and jewellery none of your husbands papers no did francis ever discuss breaking the law himself how do you mean she seemed to be focusing on the view from the window even though it was now dark and the garden was invisible he was said to be close to certain groups he never spoke about it but its not exactly news to you he knew a lot of people inspector i dare say one or two wanted to take the struggle that bit further than the law of the time would allow and he would have supported that view perhaps do any names come to mind she shook her head youre thinking she said that political friends sometimes turn into foes but if francis had enemies real enemies i mean he kept them to himself but you know he supported paramilitary groups mr mangold seems to think youd no inkling charles doesnt know everything fox took another sip of tea and placed the cup and saucer back on the tray the room was silent for the best part of a minute he got the feeling that when she was left alone this was how she sat calm and still and waiting for death staring at her reflection in the window the rest of the world lost somewhere beyond he was reminded of his father i dont sleep i just lie here eventually he cleared his throat what do you think he was doing on that particular road he asked politically you mean he smiled at the error no the road between anstruther and st andrews it was the weekend she said her voice fading a little he often spent weekends in fife on his own not with me he knew from her tone what she meant other women he suggested she gave the slightest of nods many ive no idea he used the weekend house i suppose so she looked down at her lap and brushed something from it something fox couldnt see and anstruther he prompted waiting her out eventually she gave a sigh and took a deep breath thats where she lived she fixed him with a stare i was quite a catch when francis met me but maybe you know what its like a little he offered since she had waited for his response she was a student too alice watts that was the name he told you she shook her head letters from her hidden in his office desk it was months before i came across them there was so much to be gone through she lived in anstruther imogen vernal was staring at the window again she was studying politics and philosophy at st andrews he gave a talk to the students and she met him afterwards i suppose youd call her a groupie her voice dropped almost to a whisper ive not told anyone about her charles mangold she shook her head so alan carter wouldnt have known either i suppose charles might have known she said he was franciss friend after all men sometimes talk to one another dont they when theyre out drinking fox conceded that they did the temperature in the room had dropped a few degrees the thick floorlength curtains should be closed and the gas fire turned on i want to thank you for seeing me and for being so open fox said maybe we can talk again but vernals widow wasnt finished with him i went looking for her you know i felt i needed to see her not talk to her just see her i had her address from the letters but when i went there shed packed up and left the university told me shed quit her course she paused so i suppose its just possible she may have loved him do you still have those letters mrs vernal she nodded i wondered whether you would ask she reached down the side of her chair and produced them still in their envelopes they bore neither addresses nor stamps handdelivered then fox turned them over in his hands without opening them you were prepared he stated why am i the first person youve told she smiled at him you insisted on coming here alone she explained you stood up to charles that speaks to me of a certain something a quality you know some of the rumours of the time he felt able to ask the papers hinted that youd had a string of lovers and maybe one of them had you dont believe that she stated francis was the only man i loved and i still do goodbye inspector thank you for coming she broke off and thought of something else you asked me earlier who killed him in a sense i think we all did but if i were to place a wager id say the odds favoured your own kind meaning the police police secret service youll know better than i do but take heed inspector the man charles employed ended up dead youd best be careful why do you think mangold hired him in the first place i thought id already answered that why do you think he did to solve the mystery while youre both still alive to hear it she considered this then shook her head slowly perhaps what other reason charles wants me to think less of francis so ill think more of him he wants to prove that your husband consorted with bombers as well as women she gave a thin smile leading to my deathbed conversion i recant and clasp charles to my bosom metaphorically speaking or otherwise that sounds unlikely to me please dont misunderstand charles has been a good friend loving and loyal but not as reciprocal as he would like no and adding your maiden name to his law firm part of the wooing she agreed should i feel flattered do you think fox had no answer to that as he left the vast and underfurnished drawing room he could see her reflection in the window just as she could see his fox lay in bed that night thinking of imogen vernal she had given up on the chemo but hadnt given up on life she still loved her husband she was loved in turn by charles mangold he wondered whether the widow was rich an inheritance from her parents money left by her husband or whether mangold was paying for eileen carpenter and everything else he thought of his own father fighting hard against dementia regular visits from son and daughter trips to the seafront at portobello ice cream on his chin until a handkerchief could be produced the letters from alice watts to francis vernal were more like essays lengthy discursive political there were moments of emotion too but no purple prose no drawings of hearts pierced by arrows and no rows of kisses at the end fox couldnt tell if vernal had ever written her letters of his own it was obvious he was a regular visitor to anstruther but the letters were not dated judging by the few contemporary events she mentioned they had to be from and his phone was charging on the bedside cabinet when it rang he had to unplug it before answering it was evelyn mills calling him at eleven pm evelyn did i wake you whats up there was silence on the line for a moment funny isnt it she eventually answered her voice slightly nasal you coming into my life again coming into my life right now i mean fox realised she had been drinking things are a bit shaky at home no not really she seemed to recall the lateness of the hour i should have waited till morning its fine freddies a lovely man you know im sure he is if you met him the two of you would hit it off everybody likes freddie thats good there was more silence on the line ive forgotten why i was calling you she admitted maybe just for a chat no hang on i remember now paul carters been talking to scholes oh he seems scared and not sure who to trust he as good as asked scholes if hed had something to do with the uncles death what did scholes say told him he was off his head they seemed to be talking freely nothing to suggest they think there might be a tap have you told this to kaye and naysmith not yet should i be giving them the recording theyre the ones on the ground he paused any news from the alan carter inquiry the wheels are turning how close are they to charging the nephew nobody knows if were even calling it a murder the death is being treated as suspicious fox said quoting the exact words the media would have been given advice is being taken from the procurator fiscal mills commented everything all right at your end feet up relaxing lucky you lucky me fox echoed i should go any time you want a chat evelyn thanks malcolm she paused again as you know from bitter experience a few glasses of wine and my defences begin to crumble i blame myself for what i was the sober one that night its not like you took advantage of me but all the same she started to sing a slurred snatch of edith piaf then broke into a tired laugh maybe a glass or two of water before bed fox advised thats what freddie always says the sigh she gave translated into a crackling on the line good night evelyn nightnight malcolm he plugged the phone back into its charger and lay down again head against the pillow eyes closed the bedside lamp was on but he liked it that way when he got up in the morning he would switch it off before opening the curtains he placed his hands behind his head and opened his eyes to stare at the ceiling he would drift off to sleep eventually he always did but first he had some more thinking to do seven the morning was blustery fox parked on the esplanade and got into the back seat of the car next to his coffee joe naysmith said handing him a takeaway fox thanked him and removed the lid the liquid was tepid but drinkable keeping our seats warm for us at fettes tony kaye asked little visit yesterday from special branch fox informed him theyve got their eye on those explosions kids with fireworks kaye said id bet the house on it suits the spooks to act as though its serious keeps punters worried and them in their cushy little jobs since when did kids put together nail bombs fox countered you saying weve got to start watching out for a tartan jihad kaye rolled his eyes as if we didnt have enough on our plates maybe the dark harvest commando are back naysmith added aye you and malcolm should paddle out to anthrax island see if theyre digging it up again kaye shook his head slowly but in the meantime fox prompted got a call from your pal mills this morning kaye obliged i was hardly out of the shower shes a keen one isnt she what did she say a little present would be waiting for us in reception and naysmith held up a memory stick he then reached down and produced his laptop from the floor between his feet the three men finished their drinks as they listened to the telephone recording it had been logged at eight ten the previous evening and the quality was variable thats me just home paul carter complained ten hours of questions harsh ray scholes offered harsh is right someones knifing me in the gonads here i know any ideas you remember the shafiqs ive been wondering if one of the sons maybe held a grudge that was last year well ive offered it to cash anyway naysmith turned in his seat i did a quick check the shafiqs own a range of businesses all across fife fox nodded and continued listening your uncle had a few headcases on his books scholes was saying tosh garioch mel stuart i know them carter said then youll know theyve both done time shortfuse merchants pumped up from bodybuilding and illegal supplements uncle alan had them working as doormen thats right and youre thinking they mightve had a grievance not really scholes eventually admitted cid seem to think the only one around here with a motive is yours truly im doing my best mate look ray carter responded i can appreciate you mightve thought you were doing me a favour let me stop you right there paul no way i had anything to do with this so lets get that clear in our minds what about gary or mark meaning michaelson and haldane youre grasping at the wrong straws sounds to me like you think i did it nothings for certain yet the crime scene might look a bit wonky but its suicide until proven otherwise i didnt kill him ray thats what im saying maybe nobody did there was the sound of a door opening and a womans voice ive got to go paul scholes said sounding relieved rather than apologetic stay strong eh can i come over not tonight mate im sorry about everything youll beat this paul youre mr nonstick remember nonstick paul carter echoed sounding tired and not nearly convinced naysmith closed the laptop end of he stated carter said he was sorry kaye stated presumably for all the shite hes put scholes through including perjuring himself bit of detail would have been nice naysmith argued what do you think malcolm hes pretty adamant he didnt top his uncle aye kaye retorted like he was adamant in court he didnt do anything to those women speaking of which fox prompted i spoke to billie and bekkah again kaye obliged interesting that scholes mentioned those two knuckledraggers tosh garioch happens to be billies current squeeze kaye turned in his seat so he was facing fox it was when you mentioned that alan carters company employed doormen you thought youd see if the two connected fox nodded slowly and they do coincidence eh kaye said with a twitch of the mouth alan carter doesnt get on with his nephew makes a complaint about him nothing much comes of it until teresa collins changes her mind and billie and bekkah come forward and billies boyfriend naysmith added happens to work for the uncle so whats your thinking bit more digging required kaye answered but im just beginning to see a glimmer of light paul carter was set up by his uncle if so naysmith argued even more reason to hold that grudge which puts him back in the frame for the murder if it was murder it was naysmiths turn to twist in his seat so he could make eye contact with fox what if alan carter wanted to get his nephew in even deeper shit hes already decided to do away with himself he phones paul so itll be on record as the last call he made knowing paul will then have some awkward questions to answer been watching midsomer murders joe kaye asked with a snort its a scenario fox conceded having finished his coffee he pushed the plastic lid into the crushed cup have you got anything for me about gavin willis not yet you could try asking alec robinson whos he the desk sergeant he looks at me like ive just nicked all his pens naysmith complained other person who might help is superintendent hendryson he ran the show before pitkethly was brought in steady on foxy kaye said the ladll start thinking hes a proper grownup detective how about you tony enjoying being your own boss i like it fine but youre starting to think maybe the case against paul carter was flawed maybe dont be so sure i had carter on the phone on friday just after they lifted him he admitted that hed pulled a few stunts down the years his exact words fox confirmed as much with a nod why did he phone you naysmith asked hes not sure who he can trust kaye seemed to ponder this i was going to try talking to teresa collins again he confided neutral territory maybe a cafe or a pub you know shes out of hospital the shrink gave her the allclear all i know is shes back home youll be sure to go easy on her i can do the empathy thing kaye stated a nation rejoices malcolm fox said the geography of st andrews defeated fox on paper it looked fine a road led you into the town after which there were a couple of main shopping streets parallel to one another but he had an hour to explore the place on foot and kept finding new angles golf course yes there was a golf course naturally enough two beaches one at either end of it but there was also a ruined castle a tower and tucked between venerable college buildings he caught glimpses of new architecture glass and steel and a harbour st andrews had a harbour too not far from its sea pool there were no bathers brave enough today cliffs with signs warning the unwary and regular jetfighters screaming across the sky reminding him that there was an raf base not too far away plenty of students seemed perfectly at ease running around this maze without getting lost elderly residents shared relaxed pavement gossip smiling tourists sought cream teas tartan travel rugs and whisky miniatures shaped like golf balls but having parked his car on what he thought was the main drag it took fox several goes to find it again by which time he was flustered and annoyed with himself two main streets how hard could it be he was kicking his heels because having eventually found the right person at the university they had then informed him that it might take an hour or two to come up with anything the assistant in the registry and admissions office had made it sound like fox only had himself to blame she had jotted down what details he had alice wattspolitics and phil date of birth hed shaken his head home address another shake termtime she stayed in anstruther year of entry im not sure sorry so there he was exploring the town and finding himself intrigued by the way its disparate elements somehow didnt drive everyone slightly mad he compared it to edinburgh students tourists and residents all finding space and creating the place in their own image he had passed up an elegant glass box of a restaurant on the seafront for a tunamelt panini in the cafe attached to the byre theatre he had jotted down some notes based on his morning conversation with kaye and naysmith he had forgotten to take a contact number from the assistant so couldnt check whether enough time had elapsed buying a newspaper for company he headed back to her office but she was nowhere to be seen a young man was there instead he wore a sleeveless jumper and a bow tie and asked fox to take a seat while fox skimmed the independent he was aware of the man studying him surreptitiously no doubt he had been warned that fox was a police officer whenever fox tried meeting his stare he would go back to his computer screen his fingers busy with keyboard and mouse sorry the female assistant said entering briskly by the same door as fox she returned to her own side of the desk removing her coat and hanging it on a peg then patting her hair back into place took quite a bit of digging she had been carrying a large brown envelope as fox approached the counter she pulled a few a sheets from it this is what we have she said alice watts had been born in glasgow in march making her twenty at the time of vernals death she had enrolled at st andrews in september there were two passportsized matriculation photos of her one from and the other from she had changed dramatically inside a year mousy and deferentiallooking in the first touslehaired and determined in the second in her first year she had stayed in a hall of residence by second year she was renting the anstruther address bit of a hike fox commented as he read but anstruthers lovely the female assistant argued her home address was a street with a glasgow postcode there was a phone number too fox flicked to another sheet and saw that it listed her exam passes along with progress reports from relevant members of staff he would have called these reports glowing to begin with but then tutors had started to notice that alice was spending more time on demos than essays she was increasingly active in student politics to the detriment of her studies fox turned the sheets over but they were printed on one side only nothing after second year he commented she left kicked out the assistant shook her head and pointed to the relevant text alice had stopped attending st andrews altogether letters had been sent to her anstruther address and eventually to her family home she had responded to none of them fox checked the relevant dates as the widow had said after francis vernals death alice had wanted nothing more to do with her university never heard from again the assistant said then leaning towards fox and dropping her voice has she been murdered fox stared at her and shook his head what then her eyes had widened eager for details her male colleague had stopped typing and was paying close attention fox kept his counsel holding up the sheets im taking these with me he informed the assistant all right the originals need to stay here she said failing to hide her disappointment in him ill have to make you copies of them will that take long a couple of minutes fox nodded his satisfaction with this then noticed that she was holding out her hand palm upwards its thirty pence per sheet she informed him unless you have a student card the anstruther address was a flat overlooking the harbour so many daytrippers were queuing at the fish and chip shop they had spilled out on to the pavement the woman who lived in the flat was an artist she offered fox some herbal tea but little else she had bought the place from the previous owner who had died of old age yes it had been a rental property at one time but she had no details mail sometimes arrived for people shed never heard of but she just threw it in the bin she didnt recognise the name alice watts and none of the old tenants had ever paid a visit fox made show of admiring her work the walls were covered in vibrant paintings of fishing boats harbours and coastlines and left her to it but only after shed pressed a business card on him and informed him that she did commissions ill bear that in mind he said making good his escape he considered a trip to glasgow it would take maybe ninety minutes but made a few calls from his car instead eventually someone got back to him from govan police station the officer had driven out to the address himself its an office block he informed fox offices fox frowned as he stared at alice wattss university details how long has it been like that it was a warehouse until renovated in nineteen eightythree the year watts had arrived at st andrews i must have the wrong address reckon so the officer agreed no housing in that street at all far as i can tell never has been fox thanked him and ended the call he tried alice wattss home phone number again the constant tone told him no such number existed he held the two photos of alice next to one another a low sun had broken from behind the clouds causing him to lower his windscreen visor even with the windows closed he could smell batter and oil from the chippy ive got a gun that shouldnt exist and a student whos vanished without trace he explained to the photographs so i have to wonder alice just who the hell are you and where was she now thanks for meeting me tony kaye said the cafe was in a tiredlooking shopping centre next to the bus station all strip lighting and bargain bins teresa collins had dark rings under her eyes and he reckoned the stains on her clothes were blood from a few days earlier hed actually gone back to her street sitting in the mondeo for a time smears on her livingroom window blood again he hadnt gone to see her though instead he had pushed a note through her door with his phone number and request then waited for her to get back to him im starving she said pushing the matted hair out of her eyes there were faded homemade tattoos on the backs of her hands and one wrist was bandaged the other needing nothing more than a large sticking plaster he pushed the menu towards her whatever you like he said she ordered a banana split and a mug of hot chocolate i wanted to apologise about the other day he said once the order had been placed and its true about paul carter hes been done for murder kaye nodded seeing little harm in the lie so he wont be bothering you again poor man she muttered paul you mean she shook her head the one he killed he could see she was itching for a cigarette the pack was on the table in front of her and her fingers played with a cheap plastic lighter but when the dessert arrived she tucked in three sachets of sugar were added to the accompanying drink there was something almost childlike about the way her face softened as she ate as though she were remembering past pleasures good he asked yeah but as soon as shed finished she asked if they could leave he paid the bill leaving his own coffee untouched and she led him out on to the high street lighting the needed cigarette and inhaling deeply where do you want to go he asked she shrugged and kept walking they crossed at some lights he knew they were headed in the vague direction of the football park towns seen better days he speculated seen worse ones too youve always lived here i went to london once hated it how long were you there for until the money ran out took me nearly three days to hitch home the shops thinned out many of them looking closed permanently a few highrises separated them from the seafront she walked towards one of them and in through a broken set of doors stopping at the lift want to show you something she told him the lift jolted them upwards to the top floor when they stepped out on to the walkway the wind hit them hard she stretched her arms wide facing the onslaught of air loved coming here as a kid she explained always expected to be lifted clean off my feet and taken somewhere else kaye stared at the drop and felt a moments giddiness instead he focused on the view across the water towards edinburgh i had an auntie lived here teresa collins was saying she wasnt really an auntie just my mums pal i got to stay with her when my dad was home she saw that kaye didnt quite understand he was in the army lots of time away when he came back there was always booze and shagging and then maybe a few slaps your mum didnt want you to see it collins shrugged either that or she didnt want him starting on me she paused fixing him with a look all the places he went stories he told he never brought me back a present not once men are right bastards eh never met one that wasnt that makes me a bastard then she didnt deny it but tried lighting a fresh cigarette instead he held his coat open to shelter the lighters flame thanks she said leaning over the wall of the walkway exhaling a stream of smoke what happened to your auntie he asked moved away then i heard shed died your mum and dad mum had a stroke died a year later no idea where my dad is do you want to know she shook her head no man in your life at the moment teresa now and again she admitted but only when im short of cash the smile was rueful you got any cash to spare i could lend you twenty she looked at him and why would you do that mr policeman he shrugged pushing his hands deep into his coat pockets what is it you want she asked struggling to push the hair out of her eyes im just curious she waited for him to go on you didnt take your original complaint against paul carter very far but then later on you did what changed your mind i couldnt let him get away with it that line sounds rehearsed so what ive said it often enough you think somebody paid me is that it his eyes narrowed a little hadnt crossed my mind he said quietly she turned away from him wrapping her arms around herself cigarette tightly held between thumb and forefinger nobody needed to pay me she said i did it because it had to be done but did you talk to anybody is that what youre getting at he took a step closer remembering what shed said back in the cafe poor man pauls uncle alan carter she was staring up at the sky the wind had caught her hair again wrapping it around her face so that it seemed to be muffling her alan carter kaye persisted she pushed up on to her toes and flung out her arms again for a second he thought she was going to launch herself into the void he went as far as stretching out a hand towards her she had her eyes squeezed shut a child readying to fly teresa kaye said all that stuff about paul carter was it true he deserved what he got she recited hes a disgrace to the service not her words but kaye could imagine a fellow officer saying them or a retired one cant let him get away with it wouldnt just be me thered be others her eyes were still closed deserved what he got kayes fingers had closed around her thin forearm lets get you back to the lift he said cant i stay here for a bit not on your own no she opened her eyes and looked at him i need you to be safe teresa they all say things like that she told him they all want to look after you kaye wondered if it was just the breeze forcing a tear from her eye but they all change she said quietly allowing him to lead her away from the dream of escape joe naysmith took one look at the desk sergeant and thought better of it ever since the murder squad had arrived the man had looked ready to explode his station his fiefdom not any more detectives and uniforms swarmed through reception toting equipment or with questions and demands they needed chairs desks and electrical adaptors for their incident room they hardly acknowledged him or gave him the time of day no naysmith doubted hed get anything from sergeant robinson but that didnt matter he had another plan the cid rooms were chaotic but he found cheryl forrester in a corner watching the activity with excited eyes she saw him and he gestured towards the corridor by the time she reached him he was loading coins into the drinks machine buy you a can of something he offered sprite she said squeezing closer to him as two detectives jogged past how are you bearing up he asked handing her the chilled drink great she said do you need me for more questions sort of he realised they were going to get no peace in the corridor so led her towards the stairwell she asked him if he didnt want anything to drink for himself i ran out of change he admitted she smiled and offered him her opened can he took a sip and handed it back all very mysterious she said studying her surroundings im after a favour he conceded you wont remember a detective called gavin willis ive heard the name died a long time back naysmith told her but presumably you knew superintendent hendryson of course she took a slurp from the rim of the can i was wondering if there was any way of contacting him hes retired does he never look in she shook her head bit of a hike from portugal he moved to portugal i think it was his wifes idea he sends us a postcard now and then always makes sure to mention how warm the sea is someone must have an address then eh forrester stared at him whats this all about no idea he dissembled im just running an errand for my boss i know that feeling she paused and tilted her head a little to the side you doing anything this evening why just thought you could buy me a drink dinner too if you like i might have something for you by then naysmith thought for a moment im not sure cheryl because youre the complaints yes but im not under investigation am i youll still figure in the final report so its an ethical thing well be eating dinner thats all and ill be giving you the address your boss needs naysmith pretended to be weighing up the options okay then he told her if youre not too busy she was teasing him now somewhere local he guessed she shook her head again smashing wee place in north queensferry why there its where i live is it now when she broke into a smile he couldnt help smiling back yeah he said yeah why the hell not professor john martin jdm to friends and colleagues lived in a chic newbuild apartment block behind edinburgh zoo although the evening temperature had dropped he was happy to allow fox a few moments on the balcony can you hear them he asked fox nodded animals snuffles and bellows and squawks you can smell them sometimes too the professor said anyone round here with a garden is prone to pester the zoo for manure amongst other things it has certain rebarbative qualities meaning scares domestic cats stops them crapping in your flower beds the thirdfloor flat didnt quite have a view into the zoo itself but fox could see the outline of the pentland hills to the south and hear the traffic on corstorphine road professor martin had moved indoors again so fox followed suit sliding the door shut classical music was playing but just barely audible it sounded modern and minimalist the openplan room boasted a wall of packed bookshelves and a cream leather suite an archway led to a small kitchen of shining chrome and mahogany panelling nice place fox commented been here long couple of years martin had poured them both drinks red wine for him sparkling water for fox we downsized when our offspring flew the nest martin swilled the wine around his glass and tested it with his nose i admit im intrigued tell me how you found me fox gave a shrug which he hoped looked modest i spent the weekend surfing online scottish militancy in the s your name kept coming up when i saw youd written a book on the subject been out of print for years martin stressed it was my doctoral thesis fox reckoned that would be about right martin could only be in his midforties tall toned and handsome fox had spotted a tennis racquet in the hall and a photo of martin with some trophy hed won the book had been published in written in the late eighties fox speculated finished in martin confirmed but youve still not explained how you found me your online biography said you taught at edinburgh university fox gave another shrug but before calling them i thought id try the telephone directory martin chuckled easy when you know how he raised his glass in a toast but i need to confess ive probably forgotten a lot of that book my specialism has shifted in the years since scottish politics fox reeled off constitutional procedure parliament and protocol martin offered up another toast probably a wise move on your part fox concluded not so many paramilitaries about these days martin smiled the lesson of northern ireland bring your terrorists into the fold they end up wearing suits and running the country does that hold for scotland martin considered this im not absolutely sure the snp polished up its act got itself a leader with charisma to fit the rhetoric devolution provided a rostrum no need for grievance plenty of grievances in the eighties and in the seventies martin added with roots stretching back much further he paused im sure i can find you a spare copy of the magnum opus ive already ordered one fox confessed ah the internet again i think its a review copy that gives it a certain rarity value my publishers didnt do much in the way of promotion professor martin paused is it to do with the bombs sir peebles and lockerbie surely no one thinks the snla and its ilk are back one of my colleagues asked much the same thing but i doubt anyones looking in that direction its certainly not the reason im here i want to ask you about francis vernal martin took a sip of wine and was thoughtful a man i wish id met he eventually commented his speeches read well but to hear him was something else a few recordings exist you know and some film footage too fox gave a nod has something come to light some new evidence its more in the way of a personal interest not official then semiofficial lets say martin nodded and seemed lost in thought again i had the devil of a job you know he said at last one morning i got the feeling someone had been in my flat and had taken a look at a few chapters then when the thesis was placed in the university library someone stole it it was hardly there a week he shook his head i was almost starting to believe the conspiracy theories up until then youd dismissed them francis vernal was a heavy drinker in a bad marriage nobody could be surprised at how things turned out did you interview his widow for your book she wouldnt see me how did you do your research in what sense inspector the music had finished playing martin lifted a tiny white remotecontrol unit from the coffee table and the same sequence of tunes started again you tried talking to mrs vernal that makes it sound hands on so im wondering if you managed to talk to any of the actual groups a few fellow travellers and sympathisers i wrote to all of them and almost none got back to me so i tried again same thing happened he paused what has this got to do with francis vernal wasnt he rumoured to be a banker of sorts for some of the groups yes im trying to build up a picture of him it was foxs turn to pause do you think he took his own life either that or his wife had him killed why would she do that maybe to protect all her lovers or because her husband was involved with someone she says the papers made up all those stories about her being unfaithful martins eyebrows lifted a little youve spoken to her he sounded intrigued and impressed another toast was made this time with an empty glass he went into the kitchen for a refill fox waited for him to return did you turn up anything at all linking vernal to these terrorist groups he asked he would doubtless have called them freedom fighters either that or the resistance martin went back to swirling his wine anecdotal stuff only he eventually admitted people would mention his name there were minutes of meetings usually in code but easy enough to read i think they often referred to him as rumpole from the tv show a fellow lawyer you see fox nodded his understanding so he attended meetings yes maybe even led those meetings he was never mentioned as a leader youve heard of donald maciver fox nodded another name gleaned from the internet hes in carstairs these days carstairs the maximumsecurity psychiatric facility which is why i failed to get an interview maciver led the dark harvest commando he almost certainly knew francis vernal martin paused are you suggesting vernal was killed by one of the groups he supported i dont know or by some shadowy establishment conspiracy fox shrugged he reckoned his home and office had been broken into and his widow confirms it maybe he was being watched and now youve just told me you think people spied on your work too it went further actually my first publisher went bust a second decided all of a sudden he didnt want the book had to go to a small leftwing press in the end pretty slapdash job they made of it too youre really whetting my appetite fox joked i just hope you didnt pay over the odds for your copy worth every penny im sure no guarantees inspector martin leaned back in his chair arms resting over either wing any other names fox asked one or two are probably still a bit cracked living as hermits in the western isles and writing anarchist blogs most of them probably found that as they got older they became the sort of person theyd previously despised the establishment in other words these were bright people in the main even the ones scooping up handfuls of anthrax from gruinard even them professor martin said sounding sleepy from all the wine its all changed now though hasnt it nationalism has entered the mainstream if you ask me theyll sweep the next election a few years from now we could be living in an independent european democracy no queen no westminster no nuclear deterrent that would have been impossible to predict a scant few years back never mind quarter of a century pretty much what the snla and all the others were fighting for fox concurred pretty much is there anyone i could try talking to about all of this other than psychiatric patients and hermits do you know john elliot i dont think so hes on tv all the time news and current affairs never heard of him he merits a mention in my book what about alice watts who fox repeated the name but it was clear professor martin had never heard of her fox showed him the two matriculation photos anyway martin blinked a couple of times as if trying to focus oh yes he said suddenly animated its good to have a name for her at last he got to his feet quite slowly but managed to make it to the bookshelves without too much of a detour fox went with him and watched as he plucked out a copy of his own book no mere parcel of rogues how dissent turned violent in postwar scotland catchy title incidentally fox commented a misquote from burns martin had opened the book two thirds of the way through at a section comprising blackandwhite photographs he pointed to one of these it filled half a page and looked to fox like a cnd demo coulport martin confirmed it was the handling and maintenance depot for polaris warheads every week a nuclear convoy would set out from there on its way by road to the royal ordnance factory near reading thats a fair few hundred miles i know and by road an accident a hijacking it boggles the mind the risks they took ten demonstrators had been arrested that particular day sunday april three weeks before vernals death martins finger slid to the photo covering the bottom half of the page do you see your man he asked i see him fox said quietly this second photo was of a protest outside a police station inside which presumably were the ten martyrs one man older than his neighbours was at the centre of the shot francis vernal next to him in dungarees and a knitted hat stood alice watts whos that shes linking arms with fox asked he meant not vernal but the man to alices left tall with long black hair a bushy black beard and sunglasses i wish i knew what did you say the young ladys name was alice watts fox repeated watts martin broke into a huge smile bravo inspector twenty years too late but bravo anyway enlighten me another of the code names martin explained steam he was still smiling steam as in james watt fox guessed and from james watt to alice watts fox nodded his agreement that it was entirely feasible do you still have the notes from the meetings he asked i only have my notes of their notes i was shown them i wasnt allowed to take them away shown them by a sympathiser quite the opposite actually one of the problems with all these splinter groups was that they couldnt stop splintering and when factions fell out it got as messy as any divorce i was shown records of the meetings so i could see how amateurish the group had become fox held up a finger to interrupt the professors flow which particular group are we talking about he asked the dhc dark harvest commando martin nodded they were extreme even by extremist standards the paramilitary wing of the scottish citizen army youve already mentioned the anthrax and alice watts was a member fox studied the photograph again id say so yes martin paused is that important inspector what if i told you she was also francis vernals lover and that she disappeared almost immediately after his death the professor was silent for a moment he closed the book and pressed it to his chest id say he said softly that a new edition of my book might be in prospect it gets better fox added because as far as i can work out alice watts was never alive in the first place that night fox watched tv with the sound muted and ignored one call from his sister and two from evelyn mills he was wondering what it would be like to live next to a zoo hearing and smelling the animals without ever seeing them and what it would be like to be a student choosing to live in a small place like anstruther or work in television news and current affairs or be incarcerated in carstairs or be suspected of murder when the credits rolled he realised a film had been playing he couldnt remember the first thing about it jude had sent him a text go see dad its your turn she was right of course and it isnt as if youve got anything better to do foxy he told himself no mere parcel of rogues a misquote from burns according to professor martin fox hadnt studied burns since his schooldays he reached for his laptop fount of all knowledge some of it even dependable he would look up the line in question and then maybe hed also check a couple of names donald maciver john elliot bed straight after he promised himself maybe with the window open an inch or two allowing in the noises and scents of the night eight fox woke up early and went to see his father there was a bench in the garden of lauder lodge and mitch fancied sitting there so fox got him wrapped up and one of the staff provided a travel rug for his legs but mitch drew the line at a hat and scarf any more swaddling and ill be fit for a pharaohs tomb the gardens high walls gave protection from the north seas gusts the gardener looked like hed be checking in as a guest some time soon he nodded a greeting then carried on with his work i was never one for gardening mitch told his son mum had the green fingers fox agreed if id had my way id have turned the whole lot into a patio remember that time i was hanging from the clothesrope it snapped and i bounced off the nearest flagstone your mum phoned me from the hospital three stitches was it fox rubbed at the crown of his head five he corrected his father mitch smiled know what your mum said when she called she told me shed have a job getting the blood out fox remembered a striped bath towel wrapped around his head to staunch the wound he hadnt seen it again afterwards mitch watched as his son tried stifling a yawn late night a bit business or pleasure take a guess works all well and good malcolm but theres got to be more to life still it explains why i havent seen you in a few days judes been visiting though saturday and sunday your absence was noted i was busy not just avoiding us then no fox shifted on the bench we always seem to end up fighting though you and your sister mitch nodded slowly i think shes annoyed that the money for this place is coming out of your pocket i dont begrudge it theyve hiked the fees again though havent they its not an issue maybe jude thinks it is fox offered nothing more than a shrug hows fife mitch asked after a lull i was in st andrews went to a caravan there once when your mum and me were winching had to make sure her dad never found out mitch looked at his son whats so funny i just dont hear people say winching these days what do they say dating i suppose fox paused did we ever go to st andrews as a family i mean maybe for a day do you think you remember it fox shook his head i just seem to have forgotten quite a lot join the bloody club i remember that the caravan was pale green but i couldnt tell you what i had for dinner last night mitch watched his son try to swallow back another yawn ive got pills in the bathroom you should sneak a few out with you i might do that fox said only halfjoking jude was looking through the shoebox again i dont know if its for my benefit or hers both maybe plenty memories in there no photos of the caravan though he paused we had some good holidays could be thats what judes looking for times when you and her were a team were still a team she visits i pay the bills there are other places i could go you know places cheaper than this must be its no wonder you cant afford a new shirt or tie fox peered down towards his chest whats wrong with my shirt and tie you were wearing them last time you were here was i i dont remember his father gave a sudden smile and slapped him on the knee no me neither im just winding you up thanks for that youre more than welcome they were still smiling when the tea tray arrived by the way mitch said im sorry about the other day teasing you in front of sandy is that what it was teasing i could see you were hurt but we both know youre good at your job thats not what you were saying though you were wondering whether im cut out for life outside the complaints ive been asking myself the same thing well im sorry i said it anyway dont worry about it gives me a bit of ammo next time jude tells me im your favourite you are though you know that fox looked at his father do you say the same to jude when im not around of course i do thought as much when mitch fox started to laugh his son couldnt help but join in the three men fox kaye and naysmith convened at their office at hq while naysmith made coffee for all of them stifling yawns of his own and needing a shave kaye told fox about his meeting with teresa collins thing is he concluded if alan carter did get her to testify against his nephew were stuck with the nephew as prime suspect in the murder and it is murder now naysmith confirmed fiscals office gave the murder squad the nod when did you hear that kaye asked naysmith hesitated last night he eventually admitted whos your source joe kaye gave a wolfish smile certain young lady in cid keep you out late did she naysmith kept his back to his colleagues as he finished making the drinks billie and bekkah only knew alan carter through billies boyfriend right fox asked kaye tosh garioch kaye confirmed do i talk to him next cant do any harm any reason to suppose hed grass up his boss fox offered a shrug and took the proffered mug from naysmith accepting his own drink kaye made a little kissing sound naysmith scowled but refused to meet his eyes joe fox said got anything on gavin willis for me not exactly naysmith eased himself on to his desk letting his legs hang over the side and placing his coffee next to him best i could do is a number for superintendent hendryson he lives in portugal theres an address too he brandished a page torn from a notebook and all it cost him was his virtue tony kaye offered by the way naysmith added ignoring kaye mark haldanes back from sick leave effective as from this morning that means the two of you can have a proper word with him fox said he had risen from his chair and taken the phone number from naysmith portugal eh he commented as he looked at it portugal joe naysmith confirmed and you got this from cheryl forrester yes careful there joe no fraternising with the enemy kaye added teasingly shes not the enemy naysmith couldnt help sounding defensive maybe not now fox cautioned but all the same bob mcewan arrived just as kaye and naysmith were leaving off to fife he guessed kaye gestured in foxs direction how soon till we get our pal back not my decision how near are you to being able to make a comprehensive report nobodys admitting anything kaye told him mcewans focus moved to naysmith is that true joe yes sir you dont sound too sure nobodys admitting anything naysmith echoed and the tap hasnt he stopped abruptly winded by kayes elbow finding his kidneys what tap mcewan asked quietly were about to lift it bob fox explained walking towards his boss i didnt authorise any surveillance it was a fife call fox stated i should still have been told sorry about that mcewan stabbed a finger towards fox i dont like this malcolm yes sir mcewan stared at him hard then turned his attention back to kaye and naysmith off you go then kaye didnt need telling twice steering naysmith out of the door ahead of him whats going on malcolm mcewan asked nothing whos under surveillance scholes fox admitted but with paul carter a murder suspect were pulling it this is a simple enough procedure three interviews three reports these things have a way of growing bob you know that yourself there was a finger pointing at fox again a simple enough procedure mcewan repeated laying equal stress on each word if that has somehow changed i need to know the why and the what understood understood sir fox knew he had only to bide his time the two men settled at their desks and worked in silence when fox got up to make more coffee mcewan refused his offer which told fox that he was still in the bad books fortyfive minutes later mcewan checked his watch and sighed making to rise from his chair another planning meeting got enough to keep you busy mcewan asked always fox replied mcewan found the paperwork but then had to come back because hed left his phone charging beside one of the sockets when hed left for a second time fox got up and went to the doorway checking that the corridor was empty he closed the door and returned to his desk picking up the phone and placing a call to portugal when a woman answered he told her he wanted to speak to mr hendryson is that you andrew my names fox im phoning from edinburgh just a minute then she trilled he could hear her placing the phone on a solid surface and then calling out for her husband rab youve a call from the old country it was a few moments before anything happened fox was trying to visualise the scene a view of a mirrorflat blue bay perhaps wooden decking with recliner chairs the retired superintendent in flipflops and baggy shorts maybe there was a golf course nearby and an expat golfing buddy called andrew whose voice sounded a bit like foxs robert hendryson a voice said as the phone was picked up again mr hendryson my names malcolm fox im an inspector at lothian and borders police i know who you are oh pitkethly told me did she now she used to call me a lot when she first took over finding her feet but not always able to locate the key to a cupboard or some requisition form and shes still in touch she wanted to let me know about alan carter you knew him then a little he was cid and i wasnt youll know yourself theres a tribalism there plus alan was retired before i took over at kirkcaldy so what did superintendent pitkethly tell you just that the complaints were in town led by someone called fox all that business about paul carter youd have known him better than his uncle fox stated paul could be a handful inspector but he got results and i never heard a bad word about him until i was nearly retired but when the allegation was made did you ever doubt his innocence innocent until proven guilty hendryson recited then is that what this is about he considered for a moment and answered his own question of course it is you want to know if cid really did cover up for paul maybe you think it went beyond cid the whole station eh not at all sir i dont need to speak to you you know the voice was growing irritated i can put the phone down right now fox waited for hendryson to draw breath when he did fox uttered a name and waited again what hendryson said bemused by the switch gavin willis fox repeated i was wondering what you could tell me about him nothing to be afraid of hes been dead for years why do you want to know simple curiosity alan carter is dead and the two of them seem to have been very close what has any of that got to do with the complaints its a fair question sir paul carters looking a likely candidate for his uncles murder i happen to be in a minority i dont think he did it so im trying to build up a picture of alan carters life hoping it might help me understand why he died hendryson spent some time mulling this over yes he said at last i can see that the thing is i barely knew the man and never as a serving officer how then there were gettogethers sometimes reunions i suppose youd say though it might just be a few drinks one night after work what was he like a big nononsense guy the sort of cop we used to treasure knew everyone in the town and if something happened hed have a pretty good instinct who was to blame graffiti on a wall or a stone through a window more likely than not justice would be dispensed on the spot fox thought of a phrase alan carter had used the backlands where things tend to get fixed on the quiet a slap around the ear he guessed as and when needed and no bleedingheart liberals to cry foul wed be better off if that was still the case is that why you emigrated wife wanted a bit of sun on her face hendryson explained but you have to admit policings got a lot harder were more accountable fox countered being the complaints youd think that a good thing of course fox didnt want to get into an argument so instead he asked how close willis had been to alan carter like teacher and star pupil from the minute alan joined cid gavin was there to see him right did they work together on the francis vernal case hendryson took a moment to place the name the lawyer smashed his car and topped himself thats the one what case are we talking about i just meant the crash site collecting evidence and what have you ive no idea did you know anything about the deceaseds car what is there to know willis seems to have salvaged it from the scrapyard its been sitting in his garage all these years news to me inspector now that ive told you what do you think im retired i dont think anything bit of luck wasnt it sir you leaving the force just as all this was about to break all what paul carter you mean for starters alan carter came to you and you decided to take it to your own complaints people yes no thought of brushing it under the carpet alan wouldnt hear of it he wanted an inquiry or or hed talk to the newspapers even so the local complaints didnt get very far did they not until that woman changed her mind teresa collins yes why do you think she decided to speak up ive no idea alan carter cant have been too happy when the original investigation drew a blank there was silence on the line interrupted only by a crackle of static is there anything else hendrysons voice eventually responded when did gavin willis die nineteen eightysix towards the end of january keeled over in the street one day heart attack and alan carter snapped up the cottage what if he did hendryson waited but fox had no answer worth giving are we done here just you go and enjoy the sunshine while you still can fox told the man ending the conversation he had parked his volvo on the street outside the police station sergeant alec robinson looked to left and right as he crossed the car park and craned his neck to make sure there were no witnesses at the windows he got into the passenger seat without ceremony drive he ordered fox did as he was told when theyd left the police station behind robinson relaxed a little he was wearing a forceissue outerwear jacket over his uniform not quite mufti but as close as he could get thanks for this fox acknowledged robinson shrugged off the show of gratitude im not going to shit on my own kind he warned im not asking you to im just trying to find out a bit more about gavin willis in police terms sergeant youre as close to methuselah as im going to get robinson looked at him not exactly buttering me up are you would you appreciate it if i did fox watched as robinson shook his head what rank did you have back in the mideighties robinson thought for a second constable he answered so you wouldnt have had many dealings with cid not many probably didnt know willis and alan carter too well there were times we worked together doortodoor enquiries scouring the area for a missing person and nights in the pub eh not just nights not back then fox nodded his agreement lunchtime sessions they were being phased out by the time i signed on the line robinson was looking at him how long have you been in the complaints a few years you like it maybe i want to make sure the force is on the side of the angels thats the answer you always give fox smiled i change the wording a bit but is it the whole truth im not sure fox paused checking to left and right as they stopped at a junction im also not convinced paul carter killed his uncle then who did thats what id like to know got any ideas yourself how does gavin willis fit into it willis and alan were pals as well as colleagues alan obviously doted on the man to the extent of buying his house when he died fox glanced at robinson we found francis vernals car tucked away in a garage next to the cottage oh aye have you any notion why willis would have hung on to it let everyone think it had been scrapped robinson shook his head or why alan carter would have left it there another shake of the head its a mystery then fox seemed to concede but heres something else the gun used to kill alan carter was part of a police haul that should have been destroyed back in the eighties when gavin willis was on the detail oh aye robinson repeated you knew both men and you know alans nephew theres something im not seeing here and i was hoping you could help gavin willis was a tough customer robinson admitted that much i sense a rulebreaker too from time to time but back then that was the norm more or less i suppose it was people were scared of gavin willis but only if they deserved to be if you kept your nose clean there was no reason for him to be interested in you he was alan carters mentor you think some of that rubbed off alan was a different generation he wasnt just some sort of replica but there were similarities fox thought for a moment so maybe he made enemies in the force and out of it you mean his security firm there was a bit of trouble with the shafiqs last year scholes seems keen on reminding everyone about that i also know alan carter hired people for their brawn rather than their brain if a fight breaks out in a club college degrees arent the first thing you reach for alan carter knew that he joined the force straight from school same as me we learned on the job inspector not from textbooks did willis ever get into any trouble disciplinary hearings that sort of thing robinson shook his head what about alan carter nothing paul on the other hand a loose cannon from a family of cops therefore protected ray scholes kept him in the right out of respect for his dad and uncle robinson had shifted a little in his seat the better to face malcolm fox you really think paul didnt do it im fighting the tide on that one and your theory is that it all somehow ties to gavin willis maybe if gavin willis saved that revolver from the furnace and francis vernal i dont know what happened there either lazy policing or pressure from upstairs but the case should have been investigated and wasnt i doubt gavin willis would have reacted well if someone had told him to drop it maybe thats why he hung on to the car evidence on its way to being destroyed but then he didnt do anything with it and neither did alan carter but alan kept it there under the tarpaulin anyway nineteen eightyfive inspector long time back you really think youre going to make progress now would anyone care if i didnt robinson shook his head again but they might if you did he peered through the windscreen you can drop me here ill walk the rest you sure better that than the pair of us being seen together fox signalled and drew to a stop by the side of the road robinson undid his seat belt and got out fox thought he might have some parting words a helpful sentence or two but he just closed the door and marched away zipping up his jacket fox drummed his fingers against the steering wheel youre nowhere he told himself when his phone rang he answered it with a halfhearted yes sounds like youve already heard evelyn mills said heard what my boss has ordered us to pull the surveillance i tried fighting your corner but with paul carter looking like a murder suspect surveillance could jeopardise any trial fox said finishing the argument for her sorry malcolm to be honest my own boss would have pulled it anyway you eventually owned up someone let it slip pissing him off in the process well we gave it our best shot and im grateful then you can buy me dinner some time she waited but fox stayed silent to be honest malcolm the tap was getting us nowhere anyway just that one call a second one this morning arranging a drink together tonight carter and scholes and the other two haldane and michaelson yes whose idea was that paul carters i think he wants reassurance that he still has a few pals sounded to me like the pressures getting to him what did scholes say he sounded pretty reluctant but carter kept on at him she paused is it important first time the four of them will have been together since the trial that we know of that we know of he agreed you wouldnt mind being a fly on the wall are you saying youd steer clear she gave a little laugh would it really matter what i said where are they meeting the wheatsheaf at eight oclock mind you dont bump into anyone from the murder squad thanks evelyn i tried calling you last night malcolm i mustve been asleep not giving me the brushoff then no are you sure about that he assured her he was then ended the call punched in tony kayes number and waited when kaye picked up fox asked him if he was in the middle of something wee chat with tosh garioch is he giving you anything i doubt hed give me the smell from his farts no tell a lie in that one respect hes being more than generous paul carters taking his mates out for a drink tonight all of them all of them how do you know its the last thing well glean from the phone tap you reckon we should be there pubs called the wheatsheaf why dont you check it out see if theres any chance of us blending in they know all our faces theres always the dressingup box hat and scarf and a pair of glasses kaye sounded doubtful joes always been in the background you and me have done all the talking true one guy standing at the bar whos to know joe might have plans for tonight nothing he cant cancel kaye seemed to be thinking it through cant do any harm to give the place the onceover soon as ive finished with garioch thanks tony listen one last thing yes your pal evelyn mills what about her she phoned me i got the feeling she was after some gen on you relationship status and such thanks for letting me know im not trying to put you off or anything quite the opposite shes married tony not always a bad thing malcolm im putting the phone down now he could hear kaye chuckling as he ended the call fox started driving again not really sure where he was headed not for the first five minutes anyway after which he realised he was on the kinghorn road he passed the filling station where paul carter had been spotted on the night of the murder signalling right the volvo climbed the gradient coming to a stop at the door to the cottage the field was empty no vans or patrol cars with the incident room set up in kirkcaldy the team had finished with gallowhill cottage but not before boarding up the window of the living room to deter gawpers fox got out and checked but the door was padlocked and there was no key beneath the flowerpot on the windowsill he walked to the garage judging by the outline under the tarpaulin francis vernals car was still there he was starting down the slope again when he heard another vehicle approaching paul carter parked his silver astra directly behind the volvo blocking fox in what are you doing here carter asked slamming shut his driversside door just came for a look was all fox could come up with carter said nothing to this he took some keys from his pocket selected one and undid the padlock kicking open the door this all yours now fox asked until they do me for his murder paul carter muttered nobodys found a will yet and im next of kin he walked inside and fox followed so what happens to your uncles company goes to the wall im guessing hes the only one that can sign cheques carter was looking around the hallway hell am i supposed to do with all this there are companies who clear houses fox offered bonfire might be a better bet i could be back inside any day sheriff cardonalds still deliberating bastards taking his time are you surprised he let you out been better for me if he hadnt carter walked into the living room place has been given a good goingover he commented they took my prints fox admitted and mine fox was studying carters face if he had killed his uncle would it show as he stood here would images from the night flash before him he looked flustered and fearful but without remorse or obvious guilt fox noticed that the table had been cleared every scrap of paper had been bagged and removed by the inquiry team no one however had washed the fine spray of blood from the window carter opened a drawer it too had been emptied of paperwork all those neatly kept household bills and bank statements carter slid it shut again and stood in the middle of the room running a hand through his hair scratching at his scalp when was the last time you were here fox asked night he died after ray phoned me he wanted to be the one to break the news and before that months maybe a year he said you came here drunk one day spouting off about stuff i was in court remember carter muttered i heard it from his own lips but he wasnt lying i was off my tits no idea what i said or didnt say but would that have been the last time you were here yes when he made the accusation you didnt come back here to ask him why what good was that going to do me so why do you think he phoned you the evening he died no idea he hadnt spoken to you since the trial carter shook his head he walked over to the wall next to the fireplace and ran a hand down the uneven wallpaper did all this himself you know top to bottom my dad used to say he was cackhanded he found a join in the paper and slid a finger underneath tearing it cackhandeds just about right without uttering another word he left the room and started climbing the stairs after a few moments fox followed there were three rooms in the eaves two bedrooms and a bathroom look at this carter said he was showing how wallpaper badly fitted to the ceiling in the main bedroom was falling off then he knocked against a skirting board with the heel of his shoe showing that nails were missing the door didnt close properly and the knob was loose cackhanded he repeated fox saw cracks in the plasterwork badly fitted windows loose floorboards some of the cupboards were open showing that alan carters wife had not bothered taking all her clothes with her when she left him had he kept them in the hope that she might come back and then after her death to keep her memory alive in the bathroom tiles were missing from the shower and the bath looked antiquated both of the handbasins taps dripped fox tried not to linger on the dead mans toiletries his wetrazor denture cream nail scissors what would you do with the place carter asked same thing your uncle presumably did when he got hold of it rip it up and start again when he first bought it my dad dragged me along a few times dad found it hilarious the way uncle alan thought he was tarting the place up when he was actually making it worse carter seemed caught for a moment in the memory but shook it away maybe i should torch the place and collect on any insurance are you sure you should be telling me that carter managed a smile he looked washedout the interviews had taken their toll maybe the whispers and stares around town had too thing is i liked him when i was a kid and i thought he liked me i forget what was his wife called aunt jessica you always had to get it right if you tried jess or jessie shed be quick to correct you turned out shed been seeing someone behind uncle alans back and that was the end of that did you really make your parents lives a misery plenty of nippers do but after youd stopped being a nipper carter shrugged and moved from the bathroom to the small spare bedroom this was used for storage boxes and suitcases piled high bonfire he muttered again before turning towards fox i wasnt so different from anyone else if he told you i was some sort of monster he was lying he grassed you up fox stated quietly then maybe hes the monster you ever considered that i have actually paul carter had not expected this he studied fox eyes unblinking fox noted a slight nervous tremor just below one eye carter conscious of it pressed a finger to the flesh as if this would cure it know what they do to cops in jail he asked quietly before answering his own question course you do you put cops away all the time just the ones that deserve it you think i deserve it carters voice was rising for asking one sad wee slut for half an hour of her ohsoprecious time why did the other two women come forward carter banged the heel of one hand against the wall the whole building seemed to shudder i dont know he cried out she must have told them to she didnt know them i never did anything to those two never even tried this time he took a swipe at the wall with his foot cracking the plaster remember this is your place now fox cautioned i dont want it carter ran his hand across his head again im sick of all this i want my life back any minute now that judge could make his mind up or cash could charge me with murder some choices eh he looked at fox but whats the point of telling you you dont give a damn he shouldered fox aside and descended the stairs two steps at a time fox waited a moment before following by the time he reached the hallway carter had started the astras engine and was making an awkward threepoint turn from the doorway fox watched the car head down the hill the padlock hung loose it wouldnt lock without the key paul carter hadnt been bothered about that the cottage was just another weight dragging him down fox closed the door as best he could got into his own car and started the long journey home to edinburgh the days post waiting for him inside his front door included the copy of no mere parcel of rogues it was scuffed and the section of photos had come loose but it was still serviceable fox skimmed it for an hour or so professor martin was sparing with names fox jotted a few down anyway then just before the index he saw a note stating that the names were fictitious changed to protect the subjects thanks a bunch fox said he went back to the paperwork charles mangold had given him there were trial reports from the early eighties and this time the names would be real there were photographs too taken at police stations after the suspects had been arrested a few bruised faces cuts on lips and noses swollen eyes donald maciver merited a few mentions along with john elliot wikipedia had a whole page on the broadcaster when fox saw his photograph he realised that he had seen him present the scottish news a few times his wikipedia entry stated that he had been involved in fringe politics as a student and had faced trial for plotting the hijacking of a government ministers car fox compared photos yes the newscaster and the radical student were one and the same the hair had been longer back then the clothes scruffier and the skin sallower fox wouldnt have called the twentyyearold elliot handsome but promotional shots of him these days showed a chiselled chin gleaming eyes and a healthy glow the hair immaculate the teeth pearly and the shirt crisp elliot employed a management company and could be hired for corporate and charity functions fox noted the phone number got up to stretch his spine and went to make some tea when six oclock came he turned on the tv but it was someone else presenting the days headlines he went back to his desk for an hour phoned his sister to tell her hed visited lauder lodge got into the usual argument with her then ate a tin of tuna mashed with mayonnaise and mustard at half past eight his phone rang it was tony kaye tell me fox said they clocked him kaye growled meaning joe naysmith had not been able to blend in at the wheatsheaf fox exhaled slowly and noisily did he get anything place wasnt exactly mobbed but they were at a table and he had to stick by the bar a good eight or ten feet away so what happened he says it was haldane kept staring then said something to the others scholes comes storming over and tells joe to sod off after that theres silence in the bar everybody knows who joe is and joe knows hes going to get heehaw it was a long shot fox conceded i blame joe though can i assume hes listening in were in the mondeo fifty yards downhill from the pub any point tailing them not if we cant hear anything theyre saying tony kaye suggested okay then might as well get yourselves home and thank joe for trying foxy says thanks for nothing fox heard kaye tell the hapless naysmith youre a cruel man tony kaye cruel but fair i think youll find fox wished his colleague good night nine john elliot was filming a piece for later in the day the up side was fox didnt need to drive into the centre of glasgow the downside he was on a trading estate on the outskirts for some reason a modern black slab of a hotel had been placed there and elliots crew had taken over the restaurant bemused guests were eating breakfast in the bar area while lights were repositioned cameras slotted into place on their tripods its guerrilla stuff the segments director told fox fox had been provided with a little cafetiere and a couple of miniature pains au chocolat elliot was being attended by a makeup woman in a corner of the restaurant there was a large illuminated mirror and something resembling a toolbox but filled with cosmetic products rather than wrenches mad business elliot commented to fox meeting his eyes in the mirror his hair was being combed into place his nose and forehead checked for sheen a paper towel protecting his shirt collar from smudges his eyes glittered and fox wondered if drops had been applied he was dressed in an opennecked shirt black cotton jacket and faded denims frayed at the bottom i appreciate you seeing me at short notice when im done here well have about fifteen minutes after that i have to be back in the studio the director had arrived at elliots side he was holding a script and looking stressed chef says the lobsters claws are taped shut so theres no danger he was explaining the glamour of television elliot said meeting foxs eyes again and sandblasting him with a smile there was a rehearsal after which it took three takes to get the piece right then there were cutaways and changes of angle and lighting and other stuff fox didnt quite understand an hour and a half after starting they had their three minutes of screen time elliot was rubbing a wetwipe across his face as he crossed the room towards fox the gear was being packed away tables and chairs returned to their original positions one guest a middleaged woman intercepted elliot and asked him to sign her copy of the breakfast menu a pleasure he said a small tremor seemed to pass through her as she watched him write get a lot of that fox asked when he was eventually able to shake the presenters hand better a fan than the abuse id get on sauchiehall street after closing time lets sit here elliot nodded towards a banquette in the openplan bar so he said slapping his palms against his knees my nefarious past catches up with me its no secret is it my whole life is public property inspector a waiter came over to ask if they needed anything elliot ordered mint tea then changed his mind to sparkling water fox was nursing half a cup of lukewarm coffee are you still interested in politics he asked when the waiter had retreated the question is was i ever you nearly went to prison elliot nodded slowly but even so how much of it was posture i mean students back then we didnt always think too clearly about the reasoning what was it then a way to pick up the opposite sex elliot gave a lopsided smile maybe he wriggled in his seat making himself more comfortable that court case it was ridiculous really we were made to look like the mujahideen but we were just kids playing games his eyes widened slightly perhaps hoping fox would share his incredulity hijack a government car hold the minister to ransom he shook his head the ransom incidentally consisting of a referendum on scottish selfgovernment how harebrained is that you doubt it would have worked of course it wouldnt have worked people were laughing at us during the trial theyd sit in the public gallery and their shoulders would be heaving as we explained the tactics the prosecution went on about planning but as we pointed out this amounted to a couple of nights in the pub and a few doodles on the back of a napkin might explain why none of you went to jail our university didnt even bother kicking us out thats how seriously everyone took it might be different today fox commented almost certainly stirling was your university elliot nodded then thanked the waiter as his water arrived there was a bill with it but the presenter pointed the waiter in the direction of one of the crew ever see any of your old gang fox asked hardly ever none of them still active active you mean plotting the overthrow of the state no none of them are still active he sipped the water stifling a belch we were young and foolish inspector is that what you really think youve got me pegged as some sort of sleeper agent fox returned elliots smile not at all but youre a public figure its good pr to play down a militant past maybe make light of it turn it into an afterdinner routine thats probably true and they were very different times they were plus as far as i can tell the dark harvest commando had a seriousness of purpose if youd just been along for a laugh i doubt theyd have tolerated you elliots face darkened a little the dhc was too much for me he confided you went to a few of their meetings though a few so you knew donald maciver poor donald they got him eventually even managed to have him certified after he attacked another prisoner hes in carstairs now ever thought of visiting him no elliot seemed surprised by the question he must have been close to francis vernal though i cant believe anyones finally paying attention to that elliot said in what way we all knew francis had been assassinated mi had him on their hit list when he died nobody seemed bothered no police investigation almost nothing in the papers he took another sip of water but it did the job all right how do you mean a lot of the groups got the message and disbanded they didnt want to end up like francis how well did you know him i didnt you never met him at meetings i was in the same room as him a few times but i was a foot soldier he was at the top table he was the money man wasnt he another reason the groups fell apart when francis went the cash went with him it wasnt as though anyone used bank accounts we didnt have a chequebook with dark harvest commando on it i suppose not elliot remembered something there was one meeting where things got a bit heated hawkeye needed money for something francis went outside and came back in with a wedge of fivers and tenners where was this a pub in glasgow we used the back room sometimes spit and sawdust and patriot songs the money must have been in vernals car then i suppose so the car saved from the scrapyard by gavin willis had he taken it back to his garage to strip it if so how had he known about the money and if there was money to be found what did he do with it and why hang on to the car whos hawkeye fox thought to ask elliot offered a shrug never knew his real name he wasnt normally the type to attend meetings everyone was a bit scared of hawkeye oh he definitely wasnt just playing at radicalism two or three armed robberies im pretty sure he was responsible the members liked to talk about hawkeye when he wasnt there he was our robin hood liked his explosives too the bombs sent to downing street and parliament more than likely why the name hawkeye no idea elliot had finished his water the equipment had been packed away the crew heading for their vans i need to go he apologised you really think you can get to the truth after all this time im not sure reckon anyone out there really wants to hear it inspector fox didnt bother answering this he reached into his pocket instead and produced professor martins book ever seen this he asked ive heard of it elliot stated taking it from fox and flipping through its pages youve never wanted to read it archaeology doesnt interest me fox took the book back from him found the photo of vernal and alice watts outside the police station and held it open for elliot to see do you remember her he asked no you dont recognise her from the meetings elliot shook his head is it important she seems to have had some sort of relationship with mr vernal id like to talk to her about it i wish i could help her name back then was alice watts elliot tried to place it but failed back then he prompted fox didnt say anything but when he went to close the book elliot took it from him still open at the photograph seventh of april were you there that day in a manner of speaking i was one of the ones they arrested but we were out again by late evening but you dont recall seeing alice watts elliot shook his head again nice to see hawkeye again though he turned the book towards fox thats him there arm in arm with the young lady fox took the book back and studied the photo again the man professor martin hadnt known the one with long hair beard and sunglasses youre sure fairly sure one of the production runners was standing in front of them hugging her clipboard to her chest and tapping at an imaginary watch on her wrist i really have to go elliot apologised to fox can you give me anything else on hawkeye afraid not a first name his accent fox was trying not to sound desperate scottish was all elliot said rising to his feet and there was that smile again the one that told the world john elliot had moved on that he lived for the present and not the past can we talk again fox proposed i really dont have anything more to say i might have more questions elliot stretched out his arms underlining that hed told fox as much as he could youre the first terrorist ive ever met fox told him i hope ive lived up to expectations elliots voice had hardened were out hunting bombers right now wonder if theyll be hosting tv shows in a few years youll excuse me he turned away and started to follow the assistant fox was only a step or two behind him did your side win he asked elliot paused and seemed to give the question some consideration the assistant started to say something but he silenced her with a gesture were closer than ever to an independent scotland he told fox maybe that process started when the government in london had to acknowledge our existence sounds to me like youve still got a few political bones left in your body mr elliot im not allowed to take sides inspector bad for the public image the assistant was actually tugging at elliots arm with a slight bow of the head in foxs direction he allowed himself to be led away to the waiting van foxs phone rang he was staring at the photograph as he answered paul carters dead tony kayes voice informed him what happened some time last night they pulled him from the harbour early this morning drowned bodys gone for autopsy christ on a bike tony quite so do we know anything else not much fox was remembering his last meeting with carter remembering too that joe naysmith had seen him even more recently the wheatsheaf fox commented suppose i better let someone know we were there when i saw him at the cottage he seemed pretty wrung out suicidal though i wouldnt have said he was the type me neither you know malcolm just for once id like a nice clearcut death are you in kirkcaldy stations a bit subdued does the incident room know yep what about scholes havent seen any of that lot yet you better talk to di cash let him know about last night okay will the autopsy be at the hospital far as i know then ill see you there cash might not like it mood im in thatll suit me fine just so long as i can have a seat ringside tony kaye said bring a pair of white gloves and ill make you referee fox ended the call and headed out to his car always in the basement joe naysmith commented as they walked along the windowless corridor all three were rubbing antibacterial foam into their hands path labs autopsy suites you want them in the car park tony kaye shot back so everyone can see the cadavers time was fox stated the public liked a postmortem exam thats because the public as we all know are sick and twisted kaye pushed open another set of doors and almost wished he hadnt well well di cash drawled the gangs all here come to check out your handiwork he turned towards ds brendan young nothing the rubber heels like better than hounding a man to his death while all you were doing was accusing him of murder fox countered how long did the questioning go on nine ten hours at a stretch cash stabbed a finger towards fox i seem to remember sending you to the wilderness and i was quite happy there but weve got a bit of news we need to share cash slid his hands into his pockets and went up on his toes thisll be good he told young first we need to hear what the autopsy says join the queue young muttered checking the time on his phone on cue the door marked examination suite swung open the pathologist was suited and booted and looked impatient how many of you want to watch we only have three sets of scrubs naysmith looked relieved to hear it kaye stared dolefully at fox knowing rank was about to be pulled on him five minutes later fox cash and young were inside listening to the hum of the extractor fan and the pathologist chivvying his assistant were a man down but it cant be helped he told cash fox knew that scots law required corroboration meaning two pathologists should have been present we can always put him in the fridge until tomorrow but cash shook his head lets get on with it paul carter was laid out on the metal table water was still seeping from him being diverted to the tables drainage channels and from there into pails beneath fox could see that carters face was swollen there was a brackish smell in the small already claustrophobic room maybe hed misjudged this fox hadnt been present at many autopsies he was hoping he wouldnt keel over nor was brendan young looking too comfortable the pathologist spoke into a microphone as the examination got under way he pushed down on the chest expelling a gurgling stream of water from the corpses mouth foxs own mouth was dry his heart pounding in his ears the body had probably been in the water eight to ten hours putting time of death at somewhere between eleven pm and one am core temperature was tested and the eyeballs checked once the yincision had been made and the ribcage prised open the pathologist was able to examine the contents of the lungs no doubt in my mind that he drowned he said whether he fell in or jumped he made a gesture that could have been a shrug as the examination continued organs removed and weighed brendan young shuffled back until he was resting against the wall eyes all but closed fox stood his ground though he was concentrating with his ears rather than his eyes nose is broken the pathologist said almost to himself as he peered closely at the face maybe the body took a pounding against the sea wall cash offered not much wind last night doubtful there was enough of a swell to cause an injury like that the pathologist moved to carters hands and arms tissue on the knuckles is scraped same goes for the tips of the fingers he was in a fight fox speculated or fell to the ground put his hands down instinctively and grazed them eventually the stomach was opened smell that the pathologist asked turning his attention to his audience booze cash said lager i think and spirits of some kind the man bent down over the body and sniffed whisky so hes drunk and he goes walking down by the harbour its one scenario another would be a tussle of some kind but he was alive when he went in the water fox asked almost definitely the pathologist stated quarter of an hour later they had taken off the protective clothing splashed water on their hands and faces and were back in the corridor leaving the pathologist and his assistant to finish up spit it out cash told fox an unfortunate choice of words since ds young had just spent several minutes bent over the sink attempting to hack some residual taste from the back of his throat he looked pale and was still perspiring when naysmith offered him a stick of gum he snatched at it carter had a meeting in a local bar last night fox said but before i tell you who with i want a promise that me and my team wont be kept out in the cold no promises cash said fox took his time considering this he even turned his head to make eye contact with kaye i need to know what you know first cash went on his tone softening a little the meeting was with scholes haldane and michaelson fox conceded cash slid his hands into his pockets again the habit was beginning to annoy fox it was as if the detective inspector had learned most of his moves from old gangster films how do you know that he asked we sent naysmith in to eavesdrop and how did you know about the meeting in the first place does it matter the thing is the four of them were out together last night youre going to want to talk to them and i want to hear what theyve got to say cash was looking at naysmith what sort of time it was just before eight when they sat down with their drinks naysmith obliged and when did they leave naysmith looked towards tony kaye for help they clocked him kaye told cash by ten past the hour we were on our way cash didnt say anything for a few moments happy to bask in the complaints inefficiency so your undercover surveillance lasted a maximum of fifteen minutes he turned his attention to fox and offered a gloating smile all right youve had your fun fox said coldly the thing is theyll know what sort of state paul carter was in and what time the session broke up that they will cash acknowledged with a nod so we need to talk to them cash stared at him no promises remember fox had had enough he got right into cashs face one thing youre forgetting my report goes straight to your chief constable that reports already going to make pretty interesting reading the whole reason were here is so your boss can show everyone how spick and span everything is last thing he wants is the media getting wind that obstacles were put in our way names will be named detective inspector cash fox paused i never did catch your first name better spell it out for me just to be on the safe side cash made fox wait which was fine by fox he knew the man would climb down eventually eventually he held his hands up in a show of surrender cooperation has always been my byword he said with a humourless halfsmile were all on the same side after all arent we fox maintained eye contact their faces only inches apart duly noted he told the cid man there was further news waiting for them at the station news that changed everything cash mulled it over and decided he wanted all three of paul carters colleagues in the same room at the same time the interview room was too cramped so he cleared the cid office ds young had been sent to fetch scholes haldane and michaelson weve got recording equipment fox told cash the di nodded his agreement and joe naysmith started setting everything up video as well as audio the three others cash fox and kaye started moving desks making a decentsized space eight chairs were needed five facing three phones rang but went unanswered cash wiped sweat from his forehead with a voluminous white handkerchief you three he explained to fox are here to listen until advised otherwise fox agreed the door opened and four figures trooped in haldane and michaelson looked dazed scholes wary ds young pointed towards the three chairs what is this scholes asked got a few questions for you cash stated scholes took in the three complaints officers and nodded his understanding next time you try a stunt like that he said eyes on fox but gesturing towards naysmith use someone old enough not to be asked for proof of age by the landlord the colour rose to joe naysmiths cheeks as he checked the gear scholes had turned to his colleagues its because we were out with him last night he told them then he sat down there was silence in the room until naysmith said okay cash took a deep breath and folded his arms its pretty grim all of this he said sorry youve lost a friend scholes grunted a response as you say you were out with him last night few jars at the wheatsheaf michaelson stated what time was that we left the back of nine maybe half past cash kept his attention on scholes whether or not he was the one to answer what were the four of you talking about this and that his uncles death for a bit you all left the wheatsheaf together there wasnt an immediate answer haldane glanced in scholess direction yes ds haldane cash prompted him wed had a few words scholes admitted preempting his colleague bit unsettling to find youre being tailed he gave naysmith a hard stare paul was on his high horse about it and after a few drinks he did have a bit of a temper it wasnt that haldane blurted out it was just such a bloody headache listening to him drone on droning on was he the complaints the court case hanging over him then his uncle and the finger of blame poor bastard was cracking up scholes commented so you had words in the pub cash asked scholes nodded we left him to it he was still there we had work the next day cash nodded slowly i gave the manager a bell he reckons it was close to eleven when dc carter staggered out of there manager guesses hed had about six pints and three nips by then he paused unfolding his arms and pressing his hands together so how do you think he ended up in the water does it matter scholes glared at cash makes your job that bit easier doesnt it now hes not here to fight his corner pin his uncles murder on him case closed no trial necessary all nice and tidy ah but thats just what it isnt cash waited for his words to sink in how do you mean michaelson eventually asked we had a phone call earlier member of the public happened to be out walking his dog last night he saw a man down on the beach he was being chased by another man first guy wasnt screaming or shouting or anything just running as best he could cash broke off waiting for a reaction what makes you think it was paul scholes eventually asked cash shrugged just that the witness saw him run into the sea his only chance of getting away onlooker took them for a couple of drunks having a laugh he looked down at his lap were not long back from the autopsy dc carter somehow ended up with a broken nose and grazes on his hands wait a minute haldane said voice unsteady he had gripped the arms of his chair and was starting to rise to his feet sit down cash said scholes placed a hand on haldanes shoulder and haldane lowered himself back on to the chair whats this got to do with us scholes asked you tell me i will then the answer is nothing we left paul in the pub went back to our cars and drove home you werent over the limit of course not were the law arent we and you went your separate ways meaning none of you can vouch for the others unless you have psychic powers michaelson snorted and shook his head this is fucking unbelievable he announced pointing a finger at fox that lotll stop at nothing to see us flushed down the pan your wife will vouch that you were home before ten cash asked absolutely how about you ds haldane i went round to my mums left her place just after eleven night owl is she she nodded off for a bit the news does that to her cash nodded which brings us to you di scholes i really cant believe im hearing this scholes looked calm enough but he only just had his emotions under control when he spoke it was as if his voice was trying to rid itself of a straitjacket paul was our mate now youre saying one of us smacked him youre saying he was so scared of us he ran into the sea scholes actually laughed arching his head back im waiting cash said sounding as if he had all the time in the world scholes stopped laughing you might as well lock me in the cells he stated all i did was drive to milnathort to see my girlfriend she was out so i came back to town didnt see or speak to anyone he stared at cash so i mustve done it mustnt i only if you cant think of anybody else dc carter couldnt have been the most popular character in kirkcaldy scholes seemed to give this some thought youre right he conceded and here i am in a room with the people who probably hated him the most he pressed his hands together in imitation of cash and leaned in towards him going to charge me or what dont give them the satisfaction ray michaelson said this interview is over cash got to his feet checked the time and announced it out loud for the benefit of the recording scholes remained seated eyes on malcolm fox im sorry about paul fox told him fat lot of good that does anybody scholes replied what about a lineup tony kaye asked cash once scholes michaelson and haldane had departed maybe the witness got a good look thats not the message we received ds young countered just two figures he only marked them out as male because of their size and the way they moved so were only guessing that paul carter was the one being chased fox added cash gave him a look muddying the water seems to be your particular party trick fox i call it keeping an open mind cash turned back to brendan young lets bring the witness in anyway need to get a proper statement from him if carter ran into the water and drowned joe naysmith speculated whats the charge might not be one cash acknowledged on the other hand if he got himself in a fight realised he couldnt win and legged it and the assailant young continued gave chase putting the fear of god into him then that assailants guilty of something kaye determined thatll be for us to decide cash cautioned meaning cid not the complaints he turned his attention back to fox so you and your merry band of fuckups can bugger off back across the forth cant do that fox responded not until your chief constable tells us thats what he wants us to do youre not even supposed to be here cash jabbed a finger into foxs unyielding chest we handed you those three on a plate am i supposed to kiss your feet for that a simple thank you would suffice six young broke in you handed us six on a plate thats right cash said with a nod i forgot you three were there last night just naysmith and me kaye corrected him that true cash asked fox i was at home in edinburgh anyone with you no cash turned his attention towards kaye and naysmith then well start with the two of you he walked over to the video camera how does this work son naysmith looked to fox for instruction youve made your point cash fox stated the hell i have this has got to be done by the book dont tell me the complaints wouldnt agree theres a local copper lying on a slab and here i am with two witnesses who saw him the night he died cash gestured towards ds young know how to operate this thing brendan cant be that hard young suggested cash turned back towards fox you still here i might have to make a complaint inspector fox looked ready to stand his ground but kaye gave a jerk of the head towards the door ill be outside fox said to nobody in particular best place for you brendan young muttered in reply fox sat in his car for a while drumming his fingers against the steering wheel and staring out of the windscreen without really seeing anything he tried the radio but couldnt find a station he liked there were no messages on his phone eventually he got out and paced the car park he thought of paul carter lying in the chill gloom of the mortuary his last moments filled with fear and flight then he pictured alan carter seated at his desk in gallowhill cottage quite relaxed unafraid of whoever stood behind him unafraid or unaware francis vernal had driven off the road or been shunted off it shot while he was driving maybe it would have taken a marksman but marksmen could be found foxs last memory of paul carter alive running from the cottage to his car im sick of all this i want my life back me too pal fox muttered lifting his phone to check the incoming message start the engine were blowing this joint he had just reached the stations rear door as it swung open kaye led the way joe naysmith behind him well fox asked he pissed us about as long as he felt able to kaye reported not sure he quite bought joes story but then neither did i i drove to north queensferry naysmith explained to fox to see his squeeze kaye added did cash ask for her name fox watched naysmith shake his head thats just as well we cant go giving him any more ammo any second now the bosses are going to decide were more trouble than were worth home sweet home kaye answered rubbing his hands together i cant wait we were given a job fox reminded him kaye rolled his eyes from which you quickly absconded dusting off the history books instead i was kicked into touch remember thing is malcolm youre so happy there id swear youd fallen on a team of pompom girls naysmith smiled at the image after a moment so did fox eventually kaye joined in too what if i show you fox suggested show me joes been there its right and proper you should see it too naysmith nodded his understanding how many cars he asked fox just the one should do it and mine seems to be closest indeed it was hed parked it in superintendent pitkethlys bay again the door was still unlocked didnt look as if anyone had been there since foxs last visit so who gets it kaye asked as practical as ever he was examining the cottage like a prospective buyer paul carter seems to be the only family fox answered pushing open the door id have the land rover joe naysmith added rather that than the house can you imagine being shown round kaye was following fox into the living room the selling agent trying to avoid the obvious should we even be in here naysmith asked its still a crime scene isnt it one thats been picked clean fox reassured him he was studying tony kaye for all his faults kaye had a true cops instinct fox wasnt expecting revelations he was hoping kaye might reinforce a few theories he himself had alan carter was seated here he explained touching the back of the solid wooden chair paperwork in front of him everything hed discovered about francis vernals death everything you sure about that malcolm everything we know about he let his killer in according to carters best friend the door was usually kept locked no signs of a breakin fox shook his head someone he knew then which brings us back to the nephew the papers had been moved swept to the floor deceased could have done that himself kaye commented annoyed about something fit of temper naysmith was resting his backside against the arm of alan carters fireside chair why leave the dog he asked good question kaye replied with a nod an animalloving assassin there was no grievance against the dog fox said as far as they were concerned naysmith added alan carter had to die kaye gave a grunt that sounded like agreement so what had he turned up he asked fox the vernal case you mean fox considered his answer not a whole lot as far as i can see that might be a dead end then and were back to the nephew again kaye did a circuit of the room opening drawers studying ornaments even crouching down in front of the fireplace and peering at the ash and dead cinders in the grate he got to his feet sniffed and made for the kitchen after which all three men climbed the stairs to the upper floor cottage used to belong to gavin willis fox recited willis was alan carters mentor seasoned di to his lplate dc when willis died carter bought the place and practised his lack of diy skills on it shouldve stuck to the day job kaye agreed when paul carter was young his dad brought him here uncle alan said he didnt need any help he was lying kaye stated bit of replastering new wallpaper kaye looked at fox you think he was looking for something money went missing when vernal died a few thousand cash that would make a hell of a bump in any patch of wallpaper maybe it wasnt money then fox speculated kaye had caught on by now he knew fox was using him as a sounding board and acknowledged as much with a wink the car joe naysmith asked much better hiding place yes fox agreed but the car was in the garage right kaye said so why tear the cottage to pieces maybe alan carter didnt know about the car naysmith replied not straight off maybe fox conceded you want to come back here with some tools and start stripping the place kaye offered he watched fox shake his head because you think if anything was here alan carter found it this time fox shrugged kaye took another of his little tours opening drawers and cupboard doors were all cops here he commented where would we hide something in full view naysmith suggested that might actually work so long as it was the likes of cash and his stooge looking for it how about you foxy under the mattress maybe a loose floorboard kaye stared at him at least joes got a bit of imagination there are acres of farmland and hundreds of trees out there could be anywhere kaye considered this seems to me paul carters still the obvious candidate he paused can we go home now fox met his colleagues stare id like it if you took a look at the garage first he requested and then we can go home maybe fox hedged the key to the garages padlock was back on its hook in the kitchen it seemed that nobody from cid had been particularly interested in the rusting wreck naysmith and fox removed the tarpaulin while kaye looked at the tools and paint cans on the cobwebbed shelves removed from the crash site before anyone could really examine it fox stated willis went to the scrapyard personally naysmith added had them bring it here so kaye brushed dust from his palms all we really know about willis is he was oldschool he was close to alan carter and he maybe pocketed firearms instead of getting rid of them none of which ties him to francis vernal except that vernal had links to radical groups and those radical groups had weapons what do we have on the gun that killed the lawyer next to nothing fox conceded kaye folded his arms okay he said give me the wildest fucking conspiracy theory you can come up with fox hesitated for only a moment spooks he said vernal was being followed office and home broken into his friends in the dark harvest commando were scaring the powersthatbe they assassinated him why he was a threat naysmith offered was he though kaye asked fox fox considered the question at most he handled the money nobody seems to think he led any group then who did donald maciver have you spoken to him hes in carstairs fox paused you think i should go see him your call not mine kaye walked around the volvo youve checked it out i did naysmith replied climbed in and had a rummage find anything no the logbook fox corrected him look in the boot when fox shook his head kaye lifted a chisel from the workbench and started prising at the metal naysmith joined in with a screwdriver eventually the lock gave way there was straw inside all that remained of a nest of some kind the spare tyre was flat the rubber perished kaye lifted it and checked beneath when he tried moving the felt flooring it crumbled there was a jack but nothing else fox realised hed been holding his breath half expecting the money to be there kaye made a noncommittal noise and walked to the other end of the vehicle examining the crumpled frame i thought these things were built of bricks must have been doing a fair lick vernal had been visiting his lover fox informed him was he in a hurry to get away someone could have been on his tail spooks again eh reckon theyd open their files to us doubtful kaye placed the tarpaulin on the ground and lay down on it shuffling underneath the car doesnt look like anythings been tampered with hard to say though after all this time when he emerged he brushed himself down does the girlfriend have anything to add she did a vanishing trick soon after which you interpret as someone putting the frighteners on her not necessarily kaye rubbed at his jaw if im being honest malcolm i dont think youve got anything but is that because theres nothing there to get kaye narrowed his eyes and thought this over i wouldnt go quite that far would you keep at it though me personally kaye shook his head slowly simple lifes what im after you on the other hand he didnt feel the need to finish the sentence fox stared at the car then grabbed a corner of the tarpaulin joe naysmith helped him cover it up again fox dropped them back at the car park behind the police station whats next he asked kaye looked at naysmith id say were ready to prep a final report i might have a couple of supplementary questions naysmith countered and would those be for the fragrant dc forrester naysmith tried his hardest not to let the colour rise to his face kaye chuckled and slapped him on the back how about you he asked fox cash doesnt want me anywhere near here the perfect excuse to go back to your archaeological dig something like that kaye nodded then slung an arm around naysmiths shoulders he was offering dating advice as the two of them headed for the stations rear door fox sat in his car with the engine idling thinking of the smashedup maroon willis had wanted it for a reason he must have thought that it represented evidence of something a little insurance policy of some kind if he had removed the money why hang on to the car and how could he have known about the money in the first place unless he had ties to the dark harvest commando close ties a member a sympathiser fox looked down at the floor in front of the passenger seat the s logbook was lying there he reached down and picked it up what was it naysmith had said in full view and tony kaye that might actually work a lot of the pages had stuck together fox tried separating them but they tended to tear he ran his fingers over them feeling for anything hidden inside at the back was the clear plastic pocket containing mots and service invoices these werent in the best of health either the cars owner was listed as mr f vernal address in the grange the car had been serviced by a garage on edinburghs south side replacement tyres oil changes brake fluidmile service new windscreen wipers fox stared at one of the sheets trying to make sense of it it was on the same headed paper mjm motors but the handwriting was different it looked like an invoice but it wasnt one you sneaky little bastard fox said quietly to himself gavin williss work had to be a list of firearms supplied to someone called hawk presumably short for hawkeye the sums added up to almost twelve hundred pounds looked to fox as though there had been three or four different deliveries totalling twelve weapons and numberless rounds of ammo two revolvers two pistols a shotgun and seven rifles fox ran a finger across the word hawk whether member or sympathiser here was evidence that gavin willis had definitely been a supplier dealing with the man called hawkeye who would then use the guns in his armed robberies willis must have told alan carter and carter didnt want his mentors reputation sullied nobody could ever know even with willis in his grave couldnt risk it could you fox muttered aloud couldnt risk anyone buying the cottage and finding something had the revolver been there all along alan carter holding on to it in which case someone had wrested it from him and made him sit at the table fox shook his head slowly he couldnt imagine it alan carter would have stood toetotoe with any assailant if told to sit he would have refused wouldnt he fox went through the other invoices but there were no other clues he wondered if alan carter had known no because wouldnt he have destroyed it come to that wouldnt he also have rid himself of any gun he found yes ripping up the cottage and destroying whatever he deemed incriminating williss reputation had to be upheld tony kayes words rang in his head i dont think youve got anything not strictly true compadre fox said determinedly ten nothing happened for a few days the complaints were back in their office in edinburgh kaye and naysmith were writing up their report for fife constabulary the message had come through with the death of paul carter no further action was to be taken just give the bosses in fife whatever youve got bob mcewan had explained alan carters body had been released but not his nephews carters wish had been for cremation ashes scattered on the rose beds outside the crematorium building fox attended the ceremony teddy fraser led the tributes and sure enough when the minister failed to mention alans football prowess teddy put him right with mention of the twentyninegoal season jimmy nicholl was there too teddy carrying the compliant dog with him to the podium refusing offers of help the chapel was packed fox wondered if thered be half as many at paul carters funeral somehow he doubted it the fife constabulary brass might feel they had to show willing but a lot of the townsfolk would stay away they knew the rumours alan carters body had been released only because his killer was also deceased as they waited for the coffin to arrive retired cops shook hands with each other patted backs slapped shoulders and reminisced robinson was there in his sergeants uniform its silver buttons gleaming half the town seemed to have known alan carter there were scowls and mutterings concerning the presence of the shafiq family the ones carters firm had butted heads with father and two sons the sons with their hair slicked back sharply suited raybans a fixture throughout fox had asked teddy fraser about the history storm in a whisky glass he explained except that the dads teetotal scholes haldane and michaelson were in attendance too but kept clear of fox and the shafiqs evelyn mills went for a drink with fox afterwards case goes on she told him just because the major suspects also dead doesnt mean we brush it under the carpet she paused on the other hand no ones going to be busting a gut fox guessed he had suspected as much from the look of di cash and ds young as they sat in their pew faces relaxed job done thing is evelyn if paul didnt do it the killers still out there give me another name then give me something concrete charles mangold had asked much the same of him a night later imogen is slipping away from us inspector she may not be here much longer sorry to hear that fox had said time is pressing im doing what i can except that he had done almost nothing mostly hed been preparing to give evidence in court a case dating back almost a year and a half had finally come to trial reading back through the notes he realised there were a couple of gaps little holes in proper procedure which a good counsel would spot and then jab away at like a boxer spying a nick above their opponents eye fox had worked on his defence honing two or three counterarguments only for the trial to be postponed at the last minute so now he sat in the office at fettes offering occasional help to kaye and naysmith as they prepared the report and providing a sympathetic ear to mcewan as he muttered darkly about the latest meetings and proposals for costcutting are we police or accountants if id wanted to spend all my time on a calculator id have paid more attention during mr gentrys maths lessons when the phone rang on foxs desk it was reception telling him he had a visitor detective chief inspector jackson fox narrowed his eyes you sure its me he wants jackson the tourist from special branch in london youre the only fox weve got the officer on the front desk said want me to fob him off point him in the direction of the canteen fox instructed ending the call and shrugging his arms back into the sleeves of his suit jacket jackson was queuing at the counter nothing on his tray as yet fox caught up with him as he stood in front of the till what can i get you jackson asked tea fox said two teas jackson told the server pot and two tea bags she suggested perfect jackson responded with a smile they went to a table by the window sitting down so that they faced one another what brings you here fox asked just passing jackson saw the look on foxs face and gave another smile no not really how are things going with lockerbie and peebles okay found your bombers yet jackson stared at him they are out there you know id have thought you would understand that how do you mean the case youre working on it was foxs turn to stare what about it i was curious so i did a bit of digging you have to admit the internet is a real old vipers nest isnt it halftruths and guesswork and theories from the outer limits plenty of conspiracies fox made show of agreeing from what i hear though your researcher was killed by his nephew some sort of longheld grudge jackson sipped his tea peering at fox above the rim of the cup thats all right then isnt it fox responded why was alan carter so interested in francis vernal more to the point why are you jackson shrugged as if to concede that the question was fair i spoke to a detective inspector he tells me the lawyers cars been found thanks cash supposedly went for scrap jackson continued but someone decided to keep it fox made a noncommittal noise willis is that the name was the name fox corrected him willis and the researcher were friends colleagues i still dont see why any of this would concern you or you come to that jackson countered who was alan carter working for what makes you think he was working for anyone the lawyer died a quarter of a century back im guessing something or more likely someone piqued his interest what if they did jackson took another sip of tea and shifted his gaze to the world outside the windows those outer limits i was talking about plenty of conspiracy theorists seem to think the security services might have had a hand in francis vernals demise youre here to tell me theyre wrong the games changed these days inspector lots of new ways to spread gossip and disinformation a good number of people out there have a vested interest in seeing the security services tripped up and tarred he glanced back towards fox it would reassure me if i knew who had ordered the investigation into vernals death nobody with a grudge against your sort fox stated are you sure about that a friend of the widow he wants her to have a sense of closure before she dies no other motive fox visualised the redfaced rotund lawyer no other motive he said jackson gave a thoughtful pout thank you for that inspector he seemed to be considering what to say next you went digging fox prompted him jackson nodded slowly and you found something something and nothing friend vernal had been on our radar for some time special branch sort of mi jackson offered a twitch of the mouth hed been under surveillance the night he died yes he had a tail on him could that be why he was speeding im not sure but there were fox sought the right word there were agents tracking his car jackson nodded but said nothing but that means when he crashed foxs eyes were boring into jacksons there were people there within seconds nobody shot him though they checked he was breathing then got the hell out of there to phone for an ambulance jackson shook his head afraid not why couldnt risk it any involvement the operation would have been jeopardised they just left him there breathing not looking too bad at all this is all in the files reading between the lines fox thought for a moment reading between the lines was he also assassinated no how can you be so sure they were watchers not an armed detail and no orders to kill him absolutely not but they did break into his house his office jackson looked ready to concede as much there were rogue elements on both sides back then inspector lets remember that vernals friends were nothing short of terrorists bombs guns and bank raids those were his creed he paused im telling you this because were on the same side you and me fox stared at him a car crash an injured victim and they just walked away jackson didnt respond to this what fox persisted they took a quick look first rifled the car you mean fox saw he was right bloody hell there was stuff missing his cigarettes a lucky fiftypound note they were questioned about that they didnt take anything did they turn up a revolver fox asked eventually no that was only found later yes at some distance from the car fox thought for a moment and you got all this from the files jackson nodded fox was wondering about the dhc funds secreted somewhere in vernals car the agents hadnt found the cash had they there was silence at the table for a few moments vernal and his friends wanted to bring us to our knees jackson stated quietly who killed him fox asked we dont know can i talk to the men who tailed him no so much for being on the same side what do you think they could add hard to say without speaking to them jackson leaned back in his chair do i get the name of the man who employed alan carter not from me you dont many of these men went unpunished inspector i dare say theyre still out there warmed by their past antics he paused they had plenty of help at the time too fox wondered if gavin willis supplier of guns had been on the security services radar there was no way to ask jackson without giving quite a lot away so fox concentrated on the beverage in front of him jacksons phone was switched to silent mode it was vibrating as he lifted it from his pocket and studied the screen i have to take this he said rising from the table he walked towards the entrance to the cafeteria his back to fox fox watched the mans head dip as he listened to whatever the caller was telling him his face looked grim as he ended the call and turned back towards fox i have to go he said peebles fox guessed jackson shook his head how long will it take me to drive to stirling this time of day maybe an hour a bit less if youre lucky another explosion jackson explained his phone was vibrating again i really have to go he started walking away answering the call mad buggers with bombs fox muttered to himself why did there seem no end to them his own phone started to ring when he answered and the caller identified herself he knew he had a journey of his own to make organising this visit had taken several days and more than a few phone calls but now fox was driving through the gates of carstairs state hospital carstairs to many was a stop on the night train between london and edinburgh there wasnt much of anything there the railway station a village with a shop and not far away the home to many of scotlands most violent and least predictable prisoners he parked in a ringfenced area was buzzed through a gate and entered the main building a few other visitors had arrived at the same time as him they looked inured to the security procedures palms were checked by a machine it would show if the visitor had been in contact with drugs in the recent past a positive reading meant no visit that day bags were checked and there seemed to be a random sampling of mobile phones a swab identifying traces of illicit substances the queue shuffled forward the faces were docile if strained one woman had brought her young daughter the kid clung to her mother and sucked on a dummy she was probably a year or two too old for inspector a woman was pushing past the queue she shook foxs hand and introduced herself as gretchen hughes its dutch she explained as if to intercept a question she was always being asked thanks for getting back to me fox said no problem she went to a window and retrieved an id badge for him fox reckoned the drill would be the same as at any prison so handed over his phone at the same time donald doesnt get many visitors hughes was telling him he gets some though not in the past year and before that she studied him she had short blonde hair and paleblue eyes there was a plain gold band on her wedding finger indicating the existence of a mr hughes that sort of information probably requires a formal request probably fox agreed as she led him past the queue all he had asked for was a meeting with donald maciver but would donald tell me i doubt you could trust his answer is he a fantasist she looked at him again and gave a wide smile have you been reading up on the subject fox was not about to admit that he had no not a fantasist she decided to answer but he has good days and bad the medication keeps him on a fairly even keel any subjects i should avoid just be sure to call him mr maciver i worked with him almost two years before we were on firstname terms how many inmates do you have she made a tutting sound patients inspector please remember that patients usually get better and leave their hospitals fox replied does that happen much here doors had been unlocked and locked again behind them fox wasnt sure what he had expected it was a lot quieter than a jail plenty of people but they moved slowly cautiously the staff were in tshirts and looked as if they trusted this new arrival a lot less than they did their regular charges where am i seeing him he asked into the silence he was trying to work out if gretchen hughes was a doctor of some kind her badge wasnt giving anything away his room she answered he likes it there fine with me a few moments later they arrived at the open doorway hughes tapped on the jamb with her knuckles donald this is the visitor i was telling you about she took a step back so that fox could walk past her into the room maciver was seated at a table there was space for a single bed and some shelves an antique map of scotland had been blutacked to the wall maciver was reading a newspaper he had a stack of them on the floor next to him he was marking words and phrases with a thick blue crayon so far he seemed to have underlined almost every paragraph of the page under scrutiny there was a chair opposite him so fox eased himself down on to it do you want anything hughes asked fox started to shake his head until he realised the question had been aimed at maciver nothing the man muttered still intent on his task ill just be outside she said moving away but leaving the door open fox studied maciver trying to think of him as patient rather than inmate the man was tall maybe six three or four and broadshouldered he had long grey hair reaching halfway down his back and a grey beard that would have made a wizard proud the eyes behind the circular spectacles were large the spectacles themselves smeared and in need of a wipe his short fingernails were crusted with grime and there was a slightly sulphurous smell in the room mr maciver my names fox fox could see newsprint reflected in the spectacles another paragraph needed to be underlined maciver did it with painstaking care skipping any word he did not deem essential as far as fox could see it was a story about the plans for a new road bridge across the firth of forth theyve done away with the toll you know fox said the forth road bridge one of the first things the snp did when they got into power was call that power maciver interrupted the voice sounded as if it was being drawn from the bottom of a well powers exactly what that isnt fox waited for more but maciver was back at work what is power then he decided to ask its something you hold in both hands like a weapon something you can choose to use to strike at your enemies hearts when you bring light to the deserving and cold darkness to everyone else thats power fox was scanning the books piled on one shelf some names he recognised some he didnt i remember reading macdiarmids poetry at school he commented christopher murray grieve that was his real name you knew him we might have crossed paths there were certain howffs in edinburgh and glasgow preachers and communists gentlemen philosophers his voice drifted away and he stopped his work staring at the page without seeing it finally he looked up into the face of his visitor have we met before should i know you no only i forget things my names fox and im interested in francis vernal he died i know a martyr to the cause you really think so when francis spoke he could make kings or topple them you knew him pretty well then he was that rarest of creatures a thinker who could do a man who didnt just talk about things but worked to make them happen he was pretty active fox seemed to agree which was why he had to die you think he was targeted the man was shot at pointblank range no more than four weeks later they came for me theyd been busy in the interim planting evidence in my basement all very impressive when they kicked the door down and came in dressed in their radiation suits i was wearing pink striped pyjamas he was enunciating with care what teeth fox could see were blackened and uneven wouldnt even let me get dressed and they knew exactly where to look for their evidence you went to prison at first aye but that wasnt enough for them they could see i was prospering there talking to the men opening their eyes to the tyranny you got in a fight with another inmate he was paid for his efforts thats the only explanation as to why i was the one punished solitary then barlinnie then peterhead more violence more goading and intimidation maciver corrected him more of everything that might break the spirit and drive a man towards the madhouse he wagged a finger at fox but im as sane as you are take that news with you when you go fox nodded as though in agreement so what did francis vernal do exactly within the organisation i mean francis was our oneman brains trust lot of hot heads that needed cooling he was the man for the job he looked after the finances too didnt he he was useful in many ways the money came from holdups and robberies fox persisted you used it to buy guns and explosives a necessary evil did mr vernal keep any guns in his car maciver blinked a few times as though waking from a nap what are you doing here why all these questions he looked down at the newspaper as if he had never laid eyes on it before burns said it best you know bought and sold for english gold he stabbed a finger against the artists impression of the new bridge thats what youre seeing here a parcel of rogues in a nation fox said finishing the quote while reaching into his pocket he had the photo from professor martins book the one of vernal with alice watts and hawkeye he placed it on top of the newspaper along with the two matriculation photographs of alice francis maciver said rubbing his thumb across vernals face and alice his eyes widened and he lifted one of the snaps holding it up and studying it any idea what happened to her fox asked the old man shook his head he was stroking his beard with his free hand he seemed transfixed by the picture youth energy beauty everything a movement needs she was sleeping with vernal alice had many admirers including yourself did you ever hear from her afterwards she did the right thing they assassinated francis and then came for me alice went underground and hawkeye fox leaned forward a little to tap the photograph hawkeye arm in arm with alice still out there i dare say somewhere in the world where theres a cause worth fighting for did you know his real name he was always hawkeye does no one from the old days keep in touch why would anyone want to come see me ive nothing to offer i spoke with john elliot recently hes not exactly gone underground has he ive seen him on the television hes never visited maciver shook his head that photographs from a book fox went on it was written by an academic called john martin like the singer different spelling he asked to speak to you and you turned him down did i thats what he says maciver shrugged i dont remember him fox thought for a moment does the name gavin willis mean anything to you gavin willis maciver rolled the words around his mouth gallowhill cottage yes beautiful spot somewhere over in fife near burntisland gavin was a policeman when you knew him maciver nodded and a sympathiser fox paused more than a sympathiser never an active member he got guns for you though didnt he maybe kept them at the cottage until you needed them and i suppose he could get rid of them for you too when occasion demanded after a bank job say who was going to notice an extra handgun going into the furnace evidence destroyed gavin held on to francis vernals car mr maciver why would he do that clever man maciver said quietly i always wondered wondered what whether anyone found the money the money from the armed robberies a few thousand wasnt it thats what they said they didnt want the public to know know what we were good at what we did we sent anthrax to the highest in the land razed government buildings held up banks and armoured cars he smiled at the memory we were several hundred strong and im the only one they ever locked up how much money was in the car mr maciver thirty or forty thousand maciver paused to think more or less did he keep it in the boot maciver nodded below the spare tyre fox remembered tony kaye crowbarring open the boot and lifting the perished tyre nothing underneath youre sure about that figure thirty or forty a lot of money back then fox nodded in agreement recalling the price of an edinburgh flat in thirtyfive thousand was it money worth killing for of course it was people had died for far less there are bombs going off right now in scotland he told maciver you think the bombers are justified justified is an interesting word we could spend a year and a day debating it maciver fixed fox with a stare they have a cause they have passion and commitment they have seen the systems around them fail yet the status quo remains frustration turns to anger and anger to a sense of injustice thats how you felt back in the day we all felt it macivers voice was rising as his agitation grew suddenly gretchen hughes was in the doorway flanked by a couple of orderlies is everything all right she asked maciver was on his feet he stared down at the newspaper with all its underlined paragraphs then snatched at it and began tearing it to shreds the orderlies moved forward fox making room for them betrayed and given trinkets maciver was spluttering call that power why not call it what it is hughess hand was on foxs arm time for us to leave she said fox stood his ground what is it he asked maciver the hand on his arm tightened i think thats quite enough inspector its a kind of death maciver stated voice shaking and were paying for it mark my words were paying for it he slumped down on his chair you need to go now hughes was telling fox im going he assured her backing out of the room fox had no way of getting in touch with dci jackson so he started driving in the direction of stirling the radio news reports told him the blast had happened somewhere close to the village of kippen foxs satnav advised him to take the a and the m his heartbeat was returning to something like normal as he played back the visit to carstairs in his head maciver had lost little of his zeal he wasnt an orator like francis vernal perhaps but fox could imagine him filled with passionate argument sounding heated but rational he could well imagine young people hanging on his every word he would have sounded like a man with justifiable grievances if few answers other than insurrection fox stopped at a service station filled the cars tank and stayed parked while he ate a sandwich and drank a bottle of irnbru when he got back on the road and started to see signs to kippen he found himself part of a convoy tucking in behind a van with a satellite dish on its roof the tv crews were on their way to cover the bomb blast the van eventually signalled to enter a country park at the foot of a range of hills paths led into the woods and there was a muddy car park filled with police patrol cars fox hauled his volvo on to the closest verge and got out journalists were talking into their phones or to each other uniformed officers were trying to stop them wandering off bemused ramblers were returning to their cars only to find them blocked in fox could see no sign of jackson he showed his id to a uniform and was pointed in the direction of the righthand path on another day it would have been a pleasant enough hike though fox would have chosen different footwear he slipped on leaves a few times just about staying upright as he walked further into the forest it grew eerily quiet and he stopped and listened breathing deeply he was reminded of the hermitage of braid near where hed grown up in edinburgh as a kid hed gone there with jude playing games of hideandseek and chasing sticks down the narrow fastflowing stream right up until the day she started finding other boys more interesting than her brother he took out his phone tempted to call her and share the memory but hesitated a couple of uniformed officers emerged from the path ahead they asked to check his id im not a reporter he assured them but they took a good look anyway the one who handed the warrant card back looked like he had a question to ask whats this got to do with the complaints but fox moved on before he got the chance the climb levelled out and he could see a clearing over to his left several figures had gathered there fox walked towards them no one paying him any attention jackson arms folded was talking to a darkhaired woman she wore a cream trench coat and green wellingtons and she too had her arms folded fox stood and waited for jackson to notice him it was the woman who turned her head first narrowing her eyes a little as she tried to place the new arrival jackson turned to see what had caught her attention he muttered something to her and tramped in foxs direction what the hell are you doing here he asked keeping his voice low sorry fox apologised i wouldve called if id had your number jackson was trying to lead him out of the clearing but fox stayed put there was a small crater that everyone else seemed interested in blackened foliage and strewn earth fox wondered for a second why the trees were glinting then realised their bark was studded with shrapnel bits of nails and nuts and bolts looks like theyve got the quantities about right he stated jackson had placed himself between fox and the scene look ill give you my number we can talk later it was just the one question really jackson didnt seem to be listening he handed fox his business card the address was new scotland yard london just the one question fox repeated cant it wait fox stared at him jackson sighed and folded his arms again the watcher team is that what you called them the ones who rifled vernals car while he lay injured in the front seat what about them did they leave their jobs soon after or maybe start buying flash watches and italian suits what are you talking about ive just heard that there was thirty or forty grand in that car you think they stole it fox shrugged its a theory and that means i may have to write it up look write whatever the hell you want ive told you what i found in the vaults youve not told me their names and im not going to are they still active ive no idea over by the bomb crater the woman cleared her throat jackson took the hint you need to go he told fox who is she shes the chief constable of central scotland and right now im keeping her waiting didnt recognise her without her uniform fox said ill let you get back to it then jackson didnt need a second invitation he strode towards the circle of investigators and mumbled some sort of apology fox took his time returning along the path another forensics team passed him lugging heavy boxes of equipment the tv vans had got their satellite dishes properly positioned one reporter was doing a piece to camera fox recognised the face he worked on the same show as john elliot somehow elliot himself onetime dabbler in terrorism was stuck doing pieces about restaurant menus no word from the authorities as yet the reporter was telling the audience at home but a press conference will take place in an hour or sos time the sound recordist wasnt happy a dog was barking in the back of a nearby car the dogs owner was remonstrating that he was boxed in by the reporters own van middle of bloody nowhere the cameraman complained and theres still always something a few cars had arrived after fox and had parked behind him locals it looked like curious to see what was going on fox manoeuvred past them and headed in the direction of the m his phone let him know hed missed a call he checked voicemail it was fiona mcfadzean asking him to ring her but the signal was dropping so fox decided on a detour north and east along the a into fife heading for glenrothes tulliallan police college wasnt far away at one point and that got him thinking about evelyn mills again there was a weeklong course coming up bob mcewan had mentioned it in passing nobody in the office had shown interest but fox wondered if mills might know about it three days and nights back at the scene of the crime shes married he reminded himself out loud then he switched the radio on turning the music up trying to drown out his own thoughts you shouldnt have come all this way mcfadzean said when she opened the door to him paul was seated at his computer and offered a wave by way of greeting fox nodded back i was actually in the vicinity he lied ive been hearing about kippen just gets grimmer and grimmer doesnt it fox made a noncommittal sound what was it you wanted to tell me mcfadzean gestured towards paul who twitched his head meaning he wanted fox to approach the computer remember you asked about those revolvers specifically provenance yes fox bent at the waist the better to study the monitor it was a paper trail paul had managed to split the screen in half so one side showed information on the gun that had killed alan carter and the other the revolver found near francis vernals body theres a connection paul stated both weapons were reported lost or mislaid in june stolen from an army base good guess but not quite right im amazed they were still using revolvers in the eighties but apparently some officers liked them paul clicked the mouse again and fox read the details the falklands the falklands the young man confirmed conflict kicked off that month lot of equipment was handed out but not handed back there was list after list to confirm this he kept clicking on the mouse so fast fox couldnt keep up but then that was the whole point so how did the guns end up here fox asked servicemen probably smuggled them back mcfadzean joined in either as keepsakes or so they could sell them on definitely the latter in this case paul added a few other firearms from the conflict pistols rather than revolvers turned up on the streets of britain in the mideighties the police reports appeared on the screen london manchester nottingham birmingham newcastle glasgow mcfadzean added and belfast paul stressed mustnt forget belfast we even caught one of them mcfadzean told fox the police photograph duly appeared on the screen name was william benchley paul said operated out of essex left the army after the campaign even picked up his medal but stolen weaponry became his business did he sell the revolvers paul shrugged and looked to his boss no idea she confessed where is he now fox was studying the photo of the shavenheaded scowling benchley died in barbados a few years back drowned in his swimming pool moved there after serving his sentence paul explained bearing in mind his lifestyle id say some of the arms money was waiting for him when he got out much good it did him fox said quietly reading the news report of benchleys death anyway paul cautioned weve no reason to suppose he sold those particular guns but someone did someone did the young man agreed the one found at the scene of the vernal car smash ive got nothing else for you on that fox took the hint go on he said took a bit of tracking down paul paused the internet was no use a lot of stuff in the fife constabulary vaults hasnt been digitised paul had to actually spend time poring over something other than a screen paul stuck his tongue out in response to mcfadzeans sarcasm then he handed fox a set of stapled photocopied sheets the revolver found next to alan carter had been handed in to police in october it was found in a hedge in tayport near dundee fox asked the fife side of the tay bridge police at the time wondered if it might have been used in a robbery thered been a bookmaker in dundee relieved of the weeks takings by a masked man toting a handgun this was three days before the revolver was discovered so the gun had gone from the falklands to dundee paul shrugged could have ended up there after being passed along a chain of owners was the gunman ever caught but fox could see well enough from the printout that the case had never been solved the profit from a weeks betting just shy of nine hundred pounds would that have been enough to tempt the likes of the dark harvest commando it was hardly a bank heist any of this useful mcfadzean asked as fox continued reading im not sure he confessed then he patted paul on the shoulder but its bloody good work all the same once home fox called tony kaye hows the report going were managing to make it look like it was put together by a pair of einsteins no change there then what are you up to tonight dinner with my good lady want to join us cant spare the time tony i keep forgetting about your busy social calendar kaye paused well the offers always there thanks but im sorted any news from the kid hes headed back over to fife been to the barber and everything cheryl forrester again hes smitten warn him off will you we dont know what titbits she might be collecting for scholes and the others you reckon her for a mata hari wouldnt be the first time fox was lying along the sofa the tv remote in his free hand he flicked to a news channel keeping the sound muted did you hear about stirling sounds like a copycat to me these nutters see it on tv and think i could do that stir things up a bit the brass seemed to be taking it seriously enough there was silence on the line while tony kaye digested this what were you doing there looking for dci jackson the guy from special branch i had something i needed to ask him this is vernal isnt it youre still digging and i think im hitting a few worms too according to jackson the spooks had nothing to do with vernals death but donald maciver says there was a chunk of cash hidden in the car boot thirty to forty grands worth who the hells donald maciver he led one of the splinter groups at the time and where is he now fox hesitated before answering carstairs youve been to carstairs had to be done tony was he in a straitjacket bit highstrung but coherent with it and you believe him about the money yes kaye seemed to think for a moment then gavin willis got it he surmised and did what with it fox countered plus how would he have known it was there but of course there was every chance willis might have known guns exchanged for cash maybe at dead of night in a deserted car park more questions than answers malcolm tony kaye was saying mind if i give you a word of advice youre going to tell me to drop it something like that yes hand the whole lot over to cid not fife necessarily theres got to be someone in edinburgh you can give it to just when im starting to enjoy myself is that what youre doing kaye gave a sigh youve not got anything to prove malcolm to me or the high hiedyins or anyone else he paused for a moment at least take a night off go see a film or something i should visit mitch except thats not exactly a night off is it bound to be a jason statham playing somewhere lots of explosions and cars getting wrecked thosell help me feel the benefit will they dont just sit there stewing thats all im saying fox thanked kaye and ended the call he didnt fancy going out for dinner not on his own again he looked online and saw that the filmhouse was showing the maltese falcon for five minutes he told himself he would go then he drove to lauder lodge to see his father instead mitch was drowsy there was whisky on his breath and though seated in his chair he was already in his pyjamas fox checked his watch it wasnt even eight oclock he sat opposite his father for over an hour sifting through the photographs from the shoebox concentrating on cousin chris jude as a toddler and foxs own mother he would glance at his sleeping father from time to time the mouth slightly open chest rising and falling we played football you and me you wanted me to be a goalie less chance of an injury you said and you sat with me night after night as i tried learning my times tables you laughed at bad tv sitcoms and shouted at refereeing mistakes as if they could hear you from behind the glass screen on remembrance sunday you stood to attention for the minutes silence you were never much good in the kitchen but always made mum a cup of tea before bed she wanted two sugars but you only ever added one telling her she was sweet enough already and look theres jude on a donkey at blackpool beach youre walking beside her making sure shes safe youve rolled the legs of your trousers up a concession to the sunshine you saved all year for the summer holiday a little bit out of each weeks pay packet are you happy with the way weve turned out will you ever stop worrying about us so many of the photographs showed faces fox didnt know none of them still alive moments in time captured but also flattened you could see the beach but not feel its salty heat you could study the smiles and the eyes above those smiles but not see beyond them to the hopes and fears ambitions and betrayals when a member of staff opened the door it took fox a moment to realise anyone was there we should be getting your father into bed she said fox nodded his agreement ill give you a hand he said quietly but she shook her head regulations she explained got to stick to the script or theyll have my head on a block yes of course fox replied starting to put the photographs away on his way home he stopped at a fishandchip shop and bought a haggis supper while he waited for a fresh batch of chips he stood at the counter and stared at the tv the scottish news was on the press conference from earlier flashes going off and the chief constable alison pears reading from a prepared statement taking a couple of questions afterwards she had tidied her hair and was wearing regulation uniform she seemed to speak calmly and authoritatively though he couldnt hear any of it above the sizzle of the deepfat fryer the report cut to the car park at kippen and the same reporter fox had seen earlier live from the scene according to the onscreen banner there were fewer vehicles now that night had fallen and no barking dog to mess things up the reporter held one of those big fluffy microphones in front of him it was starting to drizzle rainwater dotting the camera lens the reporter was trying to look both knowledgeable and interested but fox could sense fatigue in his unblinking gaze he seemed to get a question in his earpiece and nodded before starting to answer the director cut to a blurry photo of the bomb crater it looked to have been taken with a mobile phone presumably snapped by a member of the public before the area could be cordoned off a second picture followed this time showing a closeup of one of the trees with the metal shards embedded there bloody hellish thing the proprietor of the chip shop said he sounded polish to fox but it could have been bosnian romanian just about anywhere really fox was not exactly an expert on another night he might have asked just out of curiosity but not tonight back home he ate on the sofa and caught the press conference again when it cut to the studio the presenter had some news police confirmed just a short time ago that they are working on a definite line of inquiry and well keep you up to date as that story progresses now all the latest sport with angela fox must have dozed off at some point because he woke up stretched along the sofa with his shoes still on and the halfempty plate resting on his chest the food was cold and unappetising he could smell sauce on his fingers and went to the kitchen to dump the remnants of the meal into the pedal bin and wash his hands in the sink he returned to the sofa with a mug of tea and found himself face to face with chief constable pears again they had gone to her live as she stood on what he guessed were the steps of central scotland force hq presumably in stirling itself she had to push the hair out of her face as the wind gusted around her she had no statement this time but still sounded coolly professional fox was blinking the sleep out of his eyes when she stopped speaking and listened to a journalists question she jutted her chin out a little fox tried to think who it was she reminded him of jude maybe the jutting chin denoting concentration but it wasnt jude it was a photograph fox hauled his laptop on to the sofa and punched her name into the search engine alison pears was one of only two female chief constables in scotland she was married to the financier stephen pears fox knew that name pears was in the papers a lot pulling off deals and seemingly keeping the straitened financial sector afloat in scotland he found photos of the couple had to admit the chief constable scrubbed up well and filled a little black dress with easy glamour on the tv however she was fighting the elements and dressed in the same uniform as before the rain was coming at her nearhorizontally the ticker tape along the bottom of the screen read three arrests in bomb scare fast work fox said toasting her with his mug then he got to work himself finding as much of her curriculum vitae as he could while failing to locate any historical photos of her nevertheless he was fairly sure very fairly sure in shed been a recent graduate of the scottish police college at tulliallan not pears back then she was yet to meet her husband and take his name alison watson born in fraserburgh in not such a jump really from alison watson to alice watts he reached for the photo in professor martins book and the two matriculation snaps there was the slightly jutting chin it was evident in some of the online photos too at a film premiere an awards dinner a graduation ceremony hand in hand with her husband stephen pears glowed did the tan come from skiing or a salon the hair was immaculately clipped the teeth shiny a chunky watch on one wrist he was stocky his face fattened by success twelve years since theyd first met married for ten of those quite the pair mr and mrs pears fox muttered to himself but she was even better connected than that because her brother andrew was a member of the scottish parliament he was part of the snp government andrew watson minister for justice minister for justice fox pushed the computer aside and slumped back against the sofa head arched towards the ceiling what the hell do i do with this he asked himself and what exactly did it mean eleven bloody hell foxy did you get any sleep at all last night not much fox admitted as kaye dragged out a chair and sat down across from him it was just after nine in the morning and the police hq cafeteria was doing a roaring trade in breakfast rolls and frothy cappuccinos fox had a halfdrunk cup of tea in front of him alongside an apple he had yet to start kayes tray held a mug of coffee and a tunnocks caramel wafer good dinner last night fox asked cost enough kaye grumbled did you go out like i told you to fox nodded slowly whatever film you saw kaye commented looks like it was downer enough for both of us he took a slurp of coffee leaving a white milky mark on his top lip and peeled the wrapper from the biscuit fox started at the beginning more or less first sighting of alison pears in the flesh then on tv and then the connection and his findings and theories her photos on page one of metro today kaye said picking bits of caramel from between his teeth three homegrown terror suspects in custody her brother was on the box this morning too fox added he had watched from his sofa having spent much of the night there some of it busy at the laptop andrew watson four years younger than his sister short red hair steelframed glasses a pudgy face with some traces of acne peelywally mitch fox would have said hes only justice minister because everyone before him either screwed up or fell out with the great chieftain by which fox knew tony kaye meant the first minister handy to have him on your side though if youre a chief constable kaye managed a rueful smile youre really going to stand up and accuse her of being a terrorist no what then a spy kaye stared at him a spy he repeated infiltrating dark harvest commando and god knows who else and shagging francis vernal into the bargain kaye took a deep breath if that ever got out wouldnt do her reputation any good fox confirmed so youll be having a quiet word with her i suppose so rather you than me shes suddenly the face of equality in the police glass ceiling shattered nobodys going to want that to change no fox agreed bloody hell look what the cat dragged in kaye smiled as joe naysmith trudged his way towards the table nothing in his hand but a can of some supercaffeinated energy drink naysmiths eyes were bleary and he had skipped a shave yeah yeah he commented sitting down next to kaye shes too much woman for you young joseph kaye persisted maybe i should take her in hand naysmith gulped at his drink eyes squeezed shut when he opened them he looked from kaye to fox and then back again something i should know he asked fox gave an almost imperceptible shake of the head in tony kayes direction man talk joe kaye went on to explain nothing for you to worry your little head about hows dc forrester fox asked shes fine any word on paul carter naysmith thought for a second then nodded another witness he decided to confide saw a man walking along the high street some time after midnight a man with shoes that squelched fox frowned not carter this guy was bald shaved head anyway but hed definitely been in some water according to the witness worried look on his face might have had a tattoo on his neck naysmith paused eyes on kaye the side of his neck who is it fox asked kaye rubbed a hand down his face sounds like someone i know he conceded who though tosh garioch kaye answered billies boyfriend naysmith was nodding might not be of course but it fits the description you gave me after you interviewed him gariochs the doorman fox checked the one who worked for alan carters firm thats him kaye confirmed big tattoo of a thistle creeping up his neck shaved head criminal record he turned his attention back to naysmith did you let on to forrester naysmith shook his head kaye and fox shared a look decisions decisions kaye commented but i like our choices better than yours foxy stirling there were armed officers and security checks outside central scotland police force hq keeping the media at bay and on the lookout for terrorist sympathisers and demonstrators inside the main building the alert status had been raised to critical in all his years as an officer fox had never seen that before after critical there was nowhere else to go fox had been seated in reception for over half an hour around him there was a real buzz of anticipation he got the distinct feeling this wasnt normally the case somewhere in the vicinity the three suspects were being questioned outside the tv broadcast vans had set up camp on the main road print journalists clustered in each others cars foragers had been sent out returning with pies and bridies hot drinks and crisps on his way in fox had spotted the news reporter from the previous day he looked exhausted and exhilarated in equal measure and was rubbing his hands together to keep warm an asyetunneeded earpiece draped over one shoulder a couple of uniformed officers in visored riot helmets body armour strapped across their chests had been placed at the entrance to the car park and were being filmed by cameramen who lacked anything more interesting to fill the time foxs request to the woman behind the reception desk had been clear and succinct need a word with the chief constable my names fox professional standards unit lothian and borders police the woman had studied his warrant card you know shes kind of busy she had asked voice heavy with sarcasm arent we all he had retorted the look on her face told him he wasnt making a new friend take a seat inspector thank you after five minutes hed walked up to the desk again only to be told she hadnt managed to get through to the chief a further ten minutes same story hed been busying himself with his phone checking for news and emails deleting old messages and watching the hubbub around him twenty minutes a shake of the head from the receptionist same thing at the halfhour mark and then the journalists had arrived camera crews in tow they had to be allocated visitor passes and shown where the news conference was happening fox decided to queue up with them the receptionist gave him a questioning look thought it might pass the time he explained so he too filled in his details and was handed a pass and a laminate sleeve with a clip on the back he fixed it to his jacket and followed the herd the large conference room was bursting at the seams fox realised there was some sort of unspoken arrangement whereby the most senior journalists were saved seats at the front his own tv reporter was there next to the aisle chairs had been laid out in rows some looked to have been requisitioned from the canteen others from offices a young woman in plain clothes was handing out a press release people got busy on their phones texting the salient points to their newsrooms and studios she gave fox a look that told him she knew most of the media representatives but not him he just smiled and relieved her of another copy of the release three arrests no charges as yet if needed extra time in custody would be sought under the prevention of terrorism act material found at the scene was being examined fox was still reading when the chief constable brushed past him and made her way down the aisle towards a table festooned with microphones the cameras got busy and the audience switched their phones to record mode alison pears was flanked by her deputy chief constable and a dci who had nominally been put in charge of the case she cleared her throat and began to read from a prepared statement fox could smell her perfume it lingered where she had pushed past him tony kaye would be able to place it but fox couldnt he felt a hand touch his forearm turning he saw dci jackson standing in the doorway jacksons eyes narrowed his brow furrowing the unspoken question was clear what the hell are you doing here fox gave him a wink and turned to concentrate on pearss closing remarks there were questions from the seats again fox saw a hierarchy at work if a hand went up from the front row pears would go there first she had been well briefed knew what would be asked and had her answers ready were the suspects local what nationality did anything tie them to the blasts near lockerbie and peebles pears gave away precious little but did so while appearing open and friendly once or twice she batted a question to the dci who was gruffer and less gifted but also knew what to say and what not to say jackson was tugging at foxs arm again gesturing towards the corridor but fox shook his head as the press conference broke up pears led her small delegation back towards the door fending off a slew of questions with a pleasant smile and a wave of the hand she wasnt looking at fox as she made to pass him but he stepped in front of her care to make a statement about francis vernal he asked her eyes drilled into him face frozen who nice try alice he responded the dci placed a hand on foxs chest clearing the route fox took a step back apologising to the cub reporter whose toes he managed to squash pears was out of the room stalking down the corridor jackson had caught up with her but she was saying something to her own dci he peeled off and approached fox handing him a card put your mobile number on there he growled ive already been waiting a while shell get back to you fox scribbled down his number and the dci snatched the card back as the man left it seemed to be jacksons turn what are you trying to do he muttered his mouth close to foxs ear so no one else could hear youve got your case ive got mine youre the complaints not some fucking simon schama history seems to have a funny way of repeating itself jackson glowered at him the journalists were comparing notes or on their phones or preparing themselves for their pieces to camera but they kept glancing over towards the two men too recognising at least one of them from the site of the kippen explosion leave it be jackson urged in a fierce undertone i need some time with her why fox shook his head slowly maybe afterwards he offered youre a bastard fox really and truly coming from you ill take that as a compliment trust me its not meant as one not in the slightest jackson turned and headed back down the corridor the young woman who had handed out the press releases was ushering everyone from the room she had been joined by an assistant ensuring that no one wandered off on their own linda says shes not seen you before the assistant informed fox temporary assignment he explained me too im usually community liaison she looked around her makes a change i suppose fox nodded his agreement and followed everyone else back to reception alison pears had his number all he could do was wait he drove into stirling and started seeing signs pointing him towards the wallace monument he could see it in the distance a single gothiclooking tower atop a hill he tried to remember what he knew about wallace like every other scot hed watched braveheart won over by it stirling bridge was the battle wallace had won against the english invaders having no other plan fox kept following the signposts eventually turning into a car park a couple of singledecker buses sat idling awaiting the return of their tour parties fox got out of the volvo and wandered into the legends cafe he was recalling more snippets of information about wallace mostly about his lifes excruciating end there was an information desk and the woman behind it told him it cost to visit the monument seven seventyfive he queried theres an audiovisual presentation and wallaces sword anything else well you can climb to the top of the tower the hill looks pretty steep theres a free bus to the top free if i pay seven seventyfive fox pretended to be thinking about it is the statue still there the one that looks like mel gibson its been moved to brechin she replied a little coolness entering her voice fox smiled to let her know he wasnt going to become a customer instead he saved five pounds by settling for peppermint tea in legends where he had a good view of the hillside and the memorial above it wallace was reckoned a patriot could the same really be said of francis vernal had he been justified that word maciver had wanted to debate in his stance and his actions and what would either of them make of the scotland where fox found himself was this the same country they had fought for and lost their lives for there were visitors in the shop next to the reception desk they were debating the purchase of beach towels made to look like kilts theirs was probably a romantic scotland of glens and castles speyside malts and eightsome reels other scotlands were available if you cared to check and at least as many people these days favoured looking forward to the longing glance back at the nation left behind the tables around him were filling up he didnt bother pouring a second cup from the teapot as he was returning to his car his phone rang but it wasnt alison pears mr fox this is the nurse at lauder lodge im afraid your fathers been taken ill he drove back to edinburgh in a daze it was only when he reached the royal infirmary that he realised the car radio had been switched on throughout he couldnt remember listening to any of it hed been told to try a and e first mitch had been found on the floor of his room could just be a fall the nurse had told fox her tone of voice indicating that she didnt believe her own words was he conscious not really fox parked on a double yellow line in the ambulances dropoff zone and headed inside someone was being served by the receptionist so he waited his turn there were only two or three people seated in the waiting area they were staring at a tv in the corner of the room the receptionist didnt seem to be in a hurry so fox walked past her desk and towards the receiving area nobody stopped him or asked him what he was doing patients lay on trolleys some in curtained cubicles fox did a circuit of the room a member of staff was busy at a computer he asked her where he might find mitchell fox he was brought in an hour ago he explained from lauder lodge nursing home might not be in the system yet she walked over to a markerboard on the wall and studied it then asked another member of the team who nodded and approached fox are you a relative im his son mr fox has gone for an xray after that itll be straight to the day ward is he all right well know more in a little while theres a waiting area just can i see him the receptionist will let you know fox was pointed back in the direction of reception by the time he got there there was no queue so he gave his name and was told to take a seat he slumped as best he could on the hard plastic chair and stared at the ceiling no one was watching the tv any more they were busy peering at the screens of their phones a woman with a bandaged arm kept walking around when she got too close to the doors they opened automatically allowing in a blast of cold air from the world outside it was a process she seemed happy to keep repeating there was a cupboard nearby that kept being unlocked and locked again by members of staff fox couldnt see what they were doing in there exactly the two toilet cubicles were being kept busy as were the snack machines one young man was trying to get the coin slot to accept a particular tenpence piece every time it was rejected he tried again having studied the coin for any obvious flaws fox eventually went over and replaced it with a tenpence piece of his own this one worked but the young man looked no happier youre welcome fox told him returning to his seat one member of staff seemed to have the job of emptying the waste bin and removing any newspapers that had been left lying around the bin bag wasnt even halffull when he replaced it ten minutes later he was back checking to see how full the new bag was then moving the bin across to the other side of the room fox managed to stop himself asking why on the tv a man was telling another man how little a small ornament was worth it then went for auction and failed to sell was it an heirloom fox wondered when first purchased had the buyer had any inkling that it would one day feature on a daytime programme and sorely disappoint its current owner the waiting areas resident smoker returned from another cigarette break her hacking cough heralding her arrival then the doors shuddered open again as the woman with the bandaged arm wandered past them fox turned in his seat to face her will you bloody well stop that he shouted she looked surprised so did the receptionist who followed this with a frowned warning fox held up a hand in capitulation and went back to staring at the ceiling it wasnt just his dad he realised it was everything else too the questions that seemed to whirl all around him the characters whose lives were suddenly connected to his own the hours of sleep he was lacking the sense of utter abject futility and then his phone interrupted with a text it was from a number he didnt recognise and when he opened the message it was an address postcode and time the postcode was fk the time pm fox copied the postcode into his phones map the highlighted area took in stirling university fox guessed that he was being invited to alison pearss home and that she and her husband lived practically next door to the university he decided not to bother replying but he added the phone number to his address book just for future reference and for something to do after almost an hour he asked the receptionist for a progress report and was told his father was in combined assessment along there she explained pointing through another set of doors fox nodded his thanks and followed the signs on the wall eventually he arrived at a nurses station his father seemed to have arrived only a few minutes before staff were still fussing around his bed a machine was monitoring his heart rate it gave a regular beep creating a rhythm with the other machines nearby how is he fox asked a doctor will be along soon but hes all right the doctor will have a word a chair was provided for foxs use his fathers eyes were closed the bottom half of his face covered by a translucent oxygen mask fox went to squeeze his hand but saw that there was a springloaded clip on one finger linking it to the machine he touched the wrist instead finding it warm he looked for any signs that his father might be about to open his eyes there was a bruise on his forehead and a bit of swelling probably from the fall dad fox said just loud enough for his father to hear its malcolm no response his fingers sought the pulse in mitchs wrist it beat a slow steady tattoo in time to the machine dad he repeated the staff seemed to be discussing something at the nurses station fox wondered where his fathers clothes were he was wearing a shortsleeved hospital gown one of the staff had broken off from the discussion to make a phone call we cant take any more admissions he explained no spaces left so it could always have been worse mitch could have been kept waiting on a trolley in a corridor fox wondered if there were some sort of hierarchy and whether that meant things were serious could just be a fall i dont believe it the voice came from behind him he turned his head and saw jude standing there arms by her sides fox got to his feet they say he fell he began to explain i dont mean dad she said her voice shaking i mean you it took fox a moment to realise what crime he had committed jude im sorry walked into lauder lodge as usual oh they tell me did your brother not say your fathers been rushed to hospital so thanks for that malcolm thanks a bunch a member of the nursing team was approaching gesturing for them to keep the noise down i plain forgot jude i was up to high doh how do you think ive been all the way here in the taxi she had turned her attention from malcolm to mitch not knowing what i was going to find sit down fox said offering her the chair ill get you some water i dont want any of your water look the nurse started to warn them i know this is difficult but youll have to keep it down for the sake of the other patients whats wrong with him jude was still studying her father it might be a stroke the nurse said but we cant know that for sure yet a stroke jude lowered herself on to the chair gripping its sides with both hands hes already had an xray fox explained to his sister therell be a doctor along in a minute the nurse added fox nodded to let the nurse know everything was fine now but when he made to squeeze judes shoulder she shrugged him off dont touch me she said so fox stood there and watched as she leaned forward until her head was resting against the edge of the bed her whole body spasmed as she sobbed fox looked over towards the staff but theyd seen it all before eventually the same nurse came with a few words of advice theres a cafe in the main entrance you might be better off there give us your number and well buzz you when the doctor turns up but jude shook her head she was staying so fox stayed too another chair was found for him and he placed it next to his sister she was squeezing their fathers hand and failing to dislodge the fingerclip they found him on the floor of his room fox explained quietly he hit his head when he fell he paused realising there was nothing else to add apart from yet another apology jude wouldnt look at him when she did lift her face from the bed she focused on the machine instead when the doctor arrived he seemed impossibly young to fox barely out of his teens surely no white coat or stethoscope just a shirt and tie and rolledup sleeves no bones broken no fractures he recited flicking through the notes hed been handed might just do a scan well keep him in a day or so someone mentioned a stroke fox said mmm its one possibility fox had been expecting the doctor to shine a light in mitchs eyes or take his blood pressure and pulse something like that but the young man just glanced at the patient the notes were telling him what he needed to know well start to get a better idea when he comes round should we try rousing him fox asked best leave it the doctor had come to the end of his reading scan later today or maybe tomorrow after that well hopefully have some firmer news and with that he was gone moving to a patient on the other side of the room jude didnt say anything and neither did fox hed seldom felt as useless when someone from the nurses station asked if theyd like a cup of tea he nodded and felt pathetically grateful jude wanted water and both drinks duly arrived fox said sorry again and this time jude looked at him you never think of me either of you she said not now jude leave it for later fox nodded towards mitch he might be able to hear maybe i want him to hear even so she took a sip of water from the plastic glass cupping it in both hands foxs tea was too strong the only way to make it drinkable was to add both sachets of sugar look he told his sister i was in the middle of something when they phoned me i wasnt thinking straight even when i got here no room in that head of yours for me eh can we cut the martyr crap jude just this once he managed to hold her gaze but only for a few seconds youre some piece of work malcolm she said slowly and steadily you really are better to be something than nothing eh he made the mistake of glancing at his watch somewhere you need to be she asked always dont let family get in the way will you he was trying to calculate how long it would take him to get to stirling would the evening rush hour slow him christ you really are planning to up and leave judes mouth stayed open whatever it is it cant be more important than this just because you dont understand doesnt mean dad wouldnt and im supposed to just sit here youll do whatever you want to do jude same as always said the kettle to the pot it was hard to disagree so fox didnt bother trying he asked her if she needed money for the cafe she kept him waiting for an answer before admitting that the taxi had cleaned her out he placed a twentypound note on the bed next to where she was holding mitchs hand ill be back later he promised you going to be all right what if i say no then ill feel worse than i already do just bugger off malcolm which was exactly what he did after handing one of the nurses his card with his mobile number on it the nurse nodded but then looked over towards jude is she going to throw another wobbly fox shook his head with some confidence just so long as im not here he explained it was a large modern house down a side road opposite the university and not far from the wallace monument a low brick wall separated it from its neighbours there were fake shutters either side of each set of windows and palladianstyle pillars flanking the front door the gates had been left open for him and the driveway was tarmacked as fox parked alongside a sleek maserati and a small sporty lexus the door opened fox recognised stephen pears from his photographs the man beckoned towards him as if welcoming a guest to a party alisons taking a phone call he said shell only be a minute then he stretched out his hand for fox to shake he had good teeth and that tan but was a stone or two heavier than necessary his permanent five oclock shadow could not disguise the double chin and jowls life it seemed to fox was close to proving too much of a good thing for stephen pears find the place okay he asked as he led fox into a doubleheight hallway yes thanks a dog appeared at pearss side a labrador with a glossy black coat fox reached down a hand to stroke its head whats she called he asked hes called max hiya max but the dog had already lost interest in the visitor and was turning away fox straightened up there were photographs lining the wall next to him fox recognised a number of celebrities they were all pictured standing alongside pears smiling occasionally shaking hands sean connery fox commented nodding towards one particular photo bumped into him and just had to get a snap looks like the new club fox commented pears looked surprised are you a member fox shook his head you he asked its nice and central when i want to impress people pears explained come on through wont you i was just pouring andy a drink andy being justice minister andrew watson he rose from the sofa at foxs approach and they shook hands malcolm fox fox said by way of introduction no reason for watson to be told any more than that lothian and borders police watson commented okay so the justice minister knew fox nodded and turned down pearss offer of a malt waters fine he said it came with ice cubes and a wedge of lime in a heavy crystal tumbler pears clinked glasses with his brotherinlaw and sniffed the whisky before sampling it not bad stephen watson said approvingly sit down inspector pears commanded hands in movement again most of the ground floor seemed to be devoted to this huge openplan space four or five sofas a vast glass dining table with a dozen chairs placed around it a fiftyinch tv screen on one wall spotlights picked out undersized paintings in overwrought frames piano music was being piped from somewhere fox couldnt see any speakers the french doors to the rear of the room led out to a terrace with lawns and a tennis court beyond the tennis court was floodlit either in an effort to impress or because pears could well afford to waste the electricity hows she bearing up watson asked his host your sister doesnt bear up pears chided him she commands she overcomes she triumphs and how is she triumphing tonight pears smiled into his glass this is just the sort of thing shes been needing otherwise its all meetings and numbercrunching watson nodded i know the feeling fox was staring at the ice cubes in his drink you all right there pears asked fine yes sure sure but something made fox change his mind my dads in hospital just happened this afternoon sorry to hear that pears said while watson made a grunting sound that could have passed for commiseration shouldnt you be there alison can make a bit of space in her diary tomorrow fox gave a shrug im here now pears nodded keeping his eyes on fox something serious he enquired theyre doing tests pears smiled i meant your business with alison shes been a bit cagey hasnt she andy a bit it was that scotland yard bloke who mentioned youre lothian and borders dci jackson fox guessed left here half an hour ago pears stated i think he was keen to stick around the justice minister was loosening his tie undoing the top button of his shirt he said youve got some case in fife fox nodded slowly started off pretty straightforwardly he admitted then it got complicated the opposite of my business pears commented getting up to refill his glass he offered to do the same for watson but watson shook his head i like taking complex things and turning them into something thats simple to understand and communicate that way you sell it to people problem with the way finance was going the past ten or so years nobody could grasp any of it so nobody questioned it back to basics thats my motto watson looked as if he had heard this speech many times he did everything short of roll his eyes when the financier was seated again he leaned forward towards fox is it anything you can talk about pears asked i swear i wont breathe a word though i cant vouch for the justice minister there was a cid officer misusing his position fox began he felt a crushing tiredness all of a sudden and had to grip the tumbler for fear he would drop it then his uncle died looked like suicide but it wasnt cid seem to have the nephew in the frame for it but fox had pearss full attention the nephews dead now too someone chased him into the sea and he drowned pears sat back in his chair as if to think this through watson however was checking his phone for messages apparently uninterested the uncle was doing some research into the death of an snp activist called francis vernal fox went on watson stopped what he was doing now he was interested i know that name he said he was in the news around the time i joined the party i thought you were still in a babygro when you took the pledge pears teased his brotherinlaw not quite i was in high school one of our teachers was an snp councillor you underwent the indoctrination process pears swallowed some more whisky watson grew prickly we all know your politics stephen i dont fox countered watson looked at him take a wild guess im even hearing rumblings of a peerage now the tories are in power down south camerons stuffing them into the house of lords like theres no tomorrow pears laughed and shook his head while still seeming gratified ill bet you fifty quid your bossll end up in the same place eventually maybe when he gets a drubbing at the next election thats not going to happen with the lead labour have got well pick up votes from the lib dems they hate what your lot have done to their party in westminster pears seemed to think about this then turned back to fox whats your opinion inspector are you a political animal i try to keep my head down sir one way of avoiding the shrapnel pears conceded but youve got me intrigued now what has all this stuff about drownings and activists got to do with my wife she was a student at st andrews at the time mr vernal died theres a theory she may have known him st andrews watson was shaking his head two years at aberdeen then she jacked it in and joined your lot instead pears was nodding someones fed you a line inspector watson was holding his phone to his ear having punched in a number rory he asked what times the car picking me up he listened checking his watch fine he said ending the call such a busy life pears said feigning sympathy all of it paid for by the inspector and me and worth every bloody penny watson muttered he glanced towards the sweeping staircase is she ever coming down maybe i should go up finish your drink man pears found to his surprise that hed finished his own again he rose to his feet and this time fox needed his own tumbler refilling one more pears stated and ill call it a night watson pursed his lips telling fox that this might not necessarily be the case there was the sound of a door closing upstairs alison pears made an exasperated sound as she descended the staircase phone in hand do i need to be there every minute of every day she complained then to fox hello again the inspector has been telling us what hes working on pears said handing her a gin and tonic all very mysterious but also a wasted trip got you mixed up with someone who was a student at st andrews the chief constable toasted the room with her drink and took a slug exhaling afterwards better her husband asked better she confirmed then to fox lets go into the study and clear this up her brother got to his feet i need a word first ali when my boss asks what can i tell him about these bloody bombers nothing so far to indicate they wont be charged she said after a moments thought the house they were renting is a gold mine material blueprints and manuals even a list of targets glasgow airport again her husband guessed raf leuchars she corrected him and the naval dockyard and our exprime minister whoever caught them should get a medal pears said staring with purpose at the justice minister they might at that watson conceded come on then alison pears said to fox lets hear this story of yours might take my mind off things be gentle with the inspector her husband suggested hes had some bad news she led him to a door in the corner of the room it opened on to a study with woodpanelled walls and a fake bookcase a small brass telescope stood on a tripod by the window there was a twoseater brown hide sofa and a swivel chair in front of the desk pears took the chair and signalled that fox should take the sofa the leather creaked as he settled she was dressed casually baggy pink tshirt black joggers nike trainers fox wondered if there was a gym somewhere on the property bad news she said echoing her husbands words fox shrugged the question aside ready with one of his own he doesnt know she considered the range of answers and evasions open to her know what fox gave her a look that said lets not do this neither of them do he persisted bringing out the matriculation photographs wonder what theyll say when i show them these youve changed but not quite enough to be unrecognisable she studied the photos saying nothing for a moment andy knows i did some undercover work in my early years on the force she eventually conceded but not that you posed as a st andrews university student for two years no she admitted though he may be wondering about it now she was using her feet against the floor to swivel gently in the chair there was a slice of lime in her glass and she extracted it placing it on a corner of the desk dci jackson filled you in fox surmised some maybe not all she squeezed the bridge of her nose as if trying to ward off a headache whats this bad news youve had never mind fox said lets concentrate on your affair with francis vernal he ignored the glower she gave him it was a way of infiltrating the dark harvest commando she was still giving him the same hard stare i know what youre thinking fox went on it was a long time ago you were a different person and this isnt the best time for it all to come bobbing up again he paused placing the photos back in his pocket ill tell you what it was she eventually said keeping her voice low in case anyone outside the door might be listening it was two years down the pan because of the car crash she nodded slowly the whole bloody edifice just crumbled after that some were too scared to go on they thought mi were out to assassinate the lot of them and were they i wasnt mi you were recruited by special branch they needed someone on the inside a pretty face usually does the trick but it couldnt be a pretty face from south of the border could it the english were supposed to be the enemy while you were fresh out of tulliallan and looked younger than your years so special branch managed to get you into st andrews where you could become political burrow ever deeper and feed information back if you know so much why do you need me i need you because a man was murdered and no one at the time or since has done anything about it he watched her for a moment it was impossible to read her face the home address in glasgow shortterm office let she explained used for mail drops and all the time you were edging closer to francis vernal francis was the conduit he was supposed to lead to the people we were really interested in fox was thoughtful for a moment he was with you that evening the night he died yes and you knew he was being tailed she gave a slow nod did you know about the money he kept in the car he usually had some every meeting the dhc held someone needed a bit of cash for buying weapons all sorts of reasons according to donald maciver there could have been as much as forty grand hidden in the boot that was a chunk of money back then donald maciver she gave a wistful smile he lives in a fantasy world inspector he always did he remembers you fondly its alice he remembers she corrected him how about john elliot i see him on tv sometimes hes never gleaned that youre alice watts we didnt know one another back then john was only interested in women who were on heat she stared at him as far as i know youre the first to make the connection so well done you her voice dripped sarcasm alan carter never got in touch hes the exdetective she watched fox nod i didnt know anything about that until jackson mentioned it do you know the name charles mangold she gave a heavy sigh this really cant wait a week or two it really cant fox stated charles mangold he repeated franciss partner in the law firm he had a thing for mrs vernal i seem to remember francis thought so anyway mangold was paying alan carter to look into vernals death he wanted to prove something to the widow what fox shrugged either that her husband was a political assassination or or that he was a terrorist and sleazebag shes been a fool to idolise all these years you sound like you favour the latter theory i think i do you never met the wife she shook her head id no interest in her all i wanted was whatever information francis could provide did you get any not much but you went to quite a lot of trouble to seek it out the glower was back meaning sleeping with him who says i did youre telling me you didnt im telling you its none of your business he let the silence sit between them for a moment then mentioned that he had the letters what letters she failed to stop a spot of colour appearing on either cheek the letters you sent him imogen vernal found them and hung on to them he waited for her to take this in youre telling me you never loved him she squeezed shut her eyes then blinked them open again im telling you its ancient history and also none of your business youre a complaints officer this is not a complaints matter youre right maybe i should just hand everything over to cid dont be crass fox waited a beat before continuing there was a cop called gavin willis he led the inquiry such as it was when vernal died but youd vanished by then special branch didnt want me sticking around the questions could have been awkward besides the dhc had scattered so you said for some reason willis held on to vernals car her eyes widened a little why did he do that im not sure one thing i do know he was selling guns to groups like the dhc specifically to a man called hawkeye fox handed her the photograph she took her time studying it i havent seen this in years the man youve linked arms with fox prompted hawkeye yes he looks a bit awkward doesnt he the arm thing would have been my idea he wasnt much of one for socialising or for the ladies never went to the pub after meetings most people that was what they looked forward to not the political theory but the boozeup after vernals death you never spoke to any of them again she shook her head and folded her arms across her chest as if suddenly chilled i was another person she stated quietly how do you think francis vernal died i think he shot himself why the drink his marriage the fear of discovery he knew we were monitoring him the two of you didnt argue that night not really i think it annoyed him that all i ever wanted to talk about was the group he said it was a madness in me she unfolded her arms and studied the photograph again he never twigged you were undercover i dont think so if he had it might have led him to do something i suppose did you ever see a gun in his car doesnt mean one wasnt there thats a no then fox paused for a moment dci jackson doesnt know about francis and me she considered this i dont think so why should he hes been digging in the files why wondering why i was interested he told me something what the agents tailing francis vernal took a look at him after the crash fox was studying her reaction he was still alive no head shot at that point what did they do the blood had drained from her face her voice was pitched just above a whisper if jacksons to be believed they didnt kill him they just walked away and left him there no call to the emergency services nothing she seemed to wrap her arms more closely around herself thats awful she said im glad we agree there was silence in the room for almost a full minute they could have shot him alison pears eventually conceded shot him and taken the money they could fox agreed tell me was vernal really just a job to you her look hardened a little how often do i need to say it thats something im not willing to discuss it might be the one thing i can take back to charles mangold for him to give to the widow i think this has gone far enough alan carter really never contacted you never connected you to alice watts ive already told you inspector youre the first she stood up indicating that the meeting was over reluctantly fox got to his feet i need to know how far youre going to take this she asked i cant answer that it would put my mind at rest she persevered theres a job i should be focusing on he nodded his understanding thank you for seeing me he was holding out his hand for the photograph id like to keep it she said fox kept his hand held out her phone rang and she answered it relinquishing the photo at the same time speak to me she said as she listened fox watched her turn into a chief constable again it was as if her talk with him had been slotted into a filing cabinet somewhere no she was stating govan cant bloody well have them theyre my suspects govan the highsecurity police station in glasgow it was where terrorist suspects usually ended up but pears was fighting her corner as the argument continued fox realised she craved the media attention because it gave her the chance to shine what was it her husband had said something about her needing this case by the time she ended the call she had made her determination clear to the other participant she looked at fox and he knew what she was telling him im a fighter im used to winning just remember that he nodded and opened the door for her she marched out ahead of him making for the stairs again stephen pears was watching tv but rose to greet fox everything cleared up he asked watching his wife disappear from view im fairly satisfied fox decided to answer he noted that andrew watson seemed to have left the lights by the tennis court had been switched off a case of mistaken identity then the financier was stating it happens fox concurred pears patted him on the back and said he would show him out in fact its such a lovely evening i might take max for a walk thank you again mr pears fox said shaking the mans hand pears applied his free hand to foxs wrist sorry again about your father i hope hes all right he paused still grasping foxs wrist and if you ever need anything inspector fox could see he meant nothing by it it was just something the selfmade millionaire had grown used to saying but he thanked him again anyway jude was asleep on her chair the nurse said she hadnt moved from the spot we told her to go stretch her legs but she wouldnt i brought her tea and biscuits but she left them they were standing at the nurses station keeping their voices low almost all the patients were asleep my dads not woken up fox asked not yet what about the scan cts a bit backed up itll be tomorrow now whats the drip for fox nodded towards the tube inserted into his fathers arm need to keep his fluids up the nurse explained do you want to rouse your sister or will i do it fox had been informed on his arrival that there was a bed ready for his father on a proper ward orderlies would be coming to wheel the bed along to its new berth ill do it he said he walked up behind jude and rested a hand against her neck her skin was cool she inhaled twitched and jolted awake giving a moan of complaint theyre putting him on a ward fox explained nothing we can do till tomorrow let me give you a lift home i can manage sleepily she pushed the hair out of her eyes theres buses and a taxi rank outside be a lot quicker if i did it he paused please jude she focused on him and saw something in his eyes for whatever reason he needed to do this for her she was giving a little nod of acquiescence as the orderlies arrived for their patient the nurse made sure brother and sister had the ward details and a contact number fox thanked her and walked with jude back along the corridor past the a and e desk he didnt recognise any of the people waiting the doors swung open jude sucking in lungfuls of the cold night air better he asked her she made a noncommittal sound and followed him to his car they didnt say much during the drive fox was thinking back to the house in stirling the chief constable and her politician brother and the money man making sure everyone got what they needed fox was wondering if he had got what he needed it took him a moment to realise that jude was crying he assured her that everything would be fine what if it isnt though then it isnt but he found himself saying it will be instead he dropped her at her terraced house she had a neighbour called pettifer and fox said she should knock on her door ill do it for you if you like he offered but jude shook her head ill just go to bed she countered bit of a liedown fox could only nod ill pick you up tomorrow well go see him together dont put yourself out on my account lets not do this jude she rubbed at her eyes what time then ill phone you something might come up she warned him i wont let it didnt stop you tonight did it she studied his face then gave a sigh all right she conceded ill see you in the morning she closed the passengerside door and began walking up the path towards her house with its curtainless front window and unkempt garden fox remembered a promise hed made three or four months back ill help you tidy it only take us a couple of hours a couple of hours he had never quite found jude didnt glance back over her shoulder towards the car didnt turn and wave once indoors her lights went on but she didnt come to the window fox put the car into gear and drove off twenty minutes later he was sitting outside another house nicer more modern no front garden for tony kaye just lots of lovely monoblock so he could park his mondeo offroad fox had just ended the call he watched shadows moving behind the livingroom curtains then the curtains parted and kaye gestured towards him but fox shook his head the door opened and kaye padded out in what looked like a pair of leather carpetslippers his shirt was untucked open at the neck my place not good enough for you he said yanking open the passengerside door and getting in didnt want to disturb you hows hannah she was fine till five minutes ago now shes wondering what shes done to offend you kaye peered towards the house as if expecting to see his wife scowling at a window ive had a hell of a day and i need to dump it on someone fox confided think youve had it hard i spent about three hours on the phone to cash trying to persuade him to bring tosh garioch in for an interview and tomorrow morning first thing kaye sounded proud of the achievement what about the report on your desk mcewan likes it well enough has it gone to fife constabulary not without your sayso foxy then ill look at it in the morning kaye nodded then fixed his eyes on fox is it evelyn mills he asked what throwing herself at you and you need my advice i havent heard a cheep from her is that a good thing or a bad thing give it a rest tony kaye gave a low chuckle and patted foxs leg then shifted a little in the passenger seat the better to face his friend okay he said small talk done and dusted time for you to spit it out and i want every single gory detail so fox gave him the lot twelve foxs alarm woke him at seven his thinking go to hq grab the report and take it to the hospital with him he poured allbran into a bowl then found that the inch of milk left in the carton had turned to yoghurt he used cold water from the kitchen tap instead and wrote out a shopping list while he ate driving to fettes avenue he felt that his breakfast had formed a solid mass in his stomach the canteen was just opening so he took a coffee to the complaints office and unlocked the door as kaye had promised foxs copy of the report was waiting on his desk kaye had added a yellow postit note affix gold star here fox peeled it off and binned it he couldnt help flicking to the last page the summary was four lines long and suggested that concrete evidence against the three officers would be hard to find leaving only legitimate concerns about the level of competence and compliance he smiled to himself knowing that given a freer hand tony kayes language would have been altogether more colourful what the investigators were saying to the brass in glenrothes was theres a problem but its up to you if you want to pursue it and the best of british luck there were another twentythree pages of text but they could wait fox rolled the report into a tube he could fit in his jacket pocket he looked around the office naysmith had left a note on tony kayes desk reminding him that he now owed the best part of a tenner in tea n coffee kitty arrears naysmith had broken the figure down like any accountant of repute though fox doubted it would do him much good he checked his office phone for messages but there werent any no mail either bob mcewans desk was strewn with reports and other paperwork fox knew that when it got too messy it would be stuffed into one of the drawers when he left the office he locked the door again after him no one except the complaints had access to the room not even the cleaner once a week naysmith shredded the contents of the various wastepaper baskets and sent it off for recycling fox stared at the sign on the door professional standards unit how professional was he being by rights he should be writing his own report laying down everything he knew and suspected about the deaths of alan carter and francis vernal the report could then go to cid theres a problem up to you if you want to pursue it the very man a voice barked from behind him he turned to see the chief constable jim byars striding towards him in almost military fashion arms swinging the chief stopped a couple of inches from foxs face what in the name of the holy father is going on he demanded sir how have you managed to get up andrew watsons nose i needed to discuss something with his sister byars glared at him i take it you mean alison pears chief constable of central scotland constabulary thats the one who happens to be a personal friend of mine and who is also currently leading the highestprofile inquiry of her career so she probably doesnt need me sticking my oar in fox nodded slowly well she answered my questions so thats that what was it you were asking in the first place just a tenuous link to the death of alan carter byars rolled his eyes as tenuous as your connection to the whole bloody thing hard to disagree sir fox conceded well then fox removed the report from his pocket ive got our conclusions right here just need to check a few details before it goes to fife constabulary and thatll be the end of it thatll be the end of it fox stated i can put andrew watsons mind at rest absolutely fox paused you can also remind him that his job title includes the word justice whats that supposed to mean the chief constable was asking as fox began to walk away he drove to judes house she wasnt answering her phone he wondered if shed maybe knocked herself out with some tablets or a few slugs of vodka when he rang her doorbell there was no response he put his face to the livingroom window but the place seemed deserted he bent down at the letter box and yelled her name nothing no sign of life at her neighbours house either so he got back in his car and headed for the hospital he was hitting the rush hour and the traffic crawled then it took him a few minutes to find a bay in the car park he entered the main concourse the cafe and shop were doing good business not just staff and visitors but patients too identifiable by name tags on their wrists fox was gasping for a coffee but took one look at the queue and kept walking as hed suspected jude was seated by mitchs bedside thought i was collecting you he complained woke up early she was holding her fathers hand again hes still not come round she shook her head there were three other beds in the ward one of them vacant elderly patients in the other two shouldnt you be at work she asked ive already been he pulled the report from his pocket i was going to sit here and read this fine chairs were stacked against a nearby wall he lifted one down and carried it to his fathers bedside he didnt know if it was a conscious decision on her part or not but judes chair was angled so that if he were to sit next to her his own chair would be sticking out into the room posing a possible obstacle to the staff instead of asking her to slide over a bit he seated himself on the other side of the bed from her have they given you a time for the scan she shook her head again she was stroking their fathers hair there was grey stubble on his cheeks and chin and a line of dried saliva at the side of his mouth a nurse stopped to check the readout on the machine and enter the findings on a chart at the bottom of the bed fox asked her about the scan hopefully before lunchtime she told him he had a peaceful night she smiled as if to reassure him hes not peaceful fox wanted to correct her hes comatose but he just returned her smile and thanked her as the nurse moved away fox saw that his sister was scowling at him what he asked cant you throw some weight around she hissed what sort of weight youre a cop arent you have a word with them see if theres any way of jumping the queue theyre not the enemy jude not exactly putting themselves out either though are they she had barely finished when two attendants arrived the nurse brought them over to the bed ct scan she announced thank you fox said again can we go with him jude asked getting to her feet best stay here one attendant stated well have him back in no time the man had tattoos on his arms he was broadshouldered and sported a couple of scars on his face he seemed to have placed fox as a policeman just as fox would have bet money on the man having served time jude was reluctant to let go of her fathers hand she leaned over him to plant a kiss on his forehead then burst into tears nothing to worry about the nurse stressed then to fox maybe take her for a cup of tea jude didnt want a cup of tea but fox managed to navigate her down the corridor towards the cafe she pulled herself away and told him she was going outside for a cigarette thought youd stopped he said someonell give me one she replied walking towards the automatic doors fox bought a paper at the shop then queued for coffee and a bacon roll he ordered the same for jude and sat at a table his phone buzzed caller id tony kaye morning tony hows your old man doing just gone for a scan you at the infirmary yes were just heading across the bridge back to sunny fife ive not had a chance to look at the report yet no rush conclusion looks sound though fox had made the mistake of opening the bacon roll the meat was as grey as the faces around him he pushed it away i had a text from cash first thing kaye was saying joe and me both get to sit in on the interview were supposed to keep our traps shut but if theres something we think hes missed we give him a sign and discuss it outside the door you okay with that you know me malcolm fox smiled to himself thats why im asking nothing i like better than obeying an order especially when theres a complete prick on the other end of it naysmith made a comment from the cars passenger seat whats joe saying fox asked hes accusing me of getting too close to the beamer in front outside lane fox guessed seventyfive eighty and and making a phone call just jumpstarting young joes heart so hes on his mettle in kirkcaldy let me know how it goes just you focus on your old man kaye paused hows jude coping not brilliantly what about you im all right nothings more important than family malcolm so you told me last night because its true paul carter and his uncle francis vernal none of them are coming back flesh and blood sometimes has to take priority fox watched jude reenter the building she saw him and he gestured towards the roll and coffee waiting for her she shook her head and pointed in the direction of the ward then moved off that way quickly disappearing from view let me know how it goes fox repeated into the phone then are you playing alex harvey again got to keep reminding joe that theres more to life than lady gaga kaye explained ending the call tosh gariochs lawyer wasnt sure about the presence of kaye and naysmith they are here to observe di cash told him the interview was being recorded and naysmith cast a jaundiced eye over ds youngs efforts to set up the apparatus even sighing once or twice to youngs obvious annoyance tosh garioch had pushed his chair back from the desk the better to splay his legs he was stocky and muscular bald dome shining and the thistle tattoo wending its way up the side of his neck you know why youre here mr garioch cash asked poising a pen above his notebook across the table the lawyer also had a pen he kept clicking it until cash asked him to stop anyone listening might think i was firing staples at you cash explained then he repeated the question yeah garioch agreed hand cupping his crotch as he repositioned everything down there i suppose i do so what were you doing last wednesday night i was at home normally id have been working as a doorman for alan carters company not so easy now hes dead you could always ask the shafiqs for a job cash paused eyes fixed on garioch or maybe not after you wrangled with them on your employers behalf kaye was standing against the far wall hands behind his back garioch gave a glance in his direction he was wondering where cash had got that info the shafiqs were business the doorman stated it all got cleared up is any of this relevant the lawyer interrupted doodling on a sheet of paper just warming up cash informed him with a cold smile then to garioch mind me asking who was at home with you yes classic mistake cash admitted as much with a twitch of his mouth never ask a question where the answer gets you no further forward were you on your own i was with my girlfriend ah cash dug a scrap of paper out of his pocket and studied it billie donnelly yes garioch couldnt help looking in tony kayes direction again kaye responded with a wink is this going anywhere di cash the lawyer asked feigning boredom weve got a witness description fitting your client to a t cash explained walking down the high street in wet clothes not too long after paul carter was beaten up and chased into the sea another witness saw the actual chase looks to me like a lineup has to be the next order of business no way garioch said turning to his lawyer for confirmation the lawyer slid his thickrimmed spectacles back up his nose cash leaned across the desk towards the pair of them two witnesses tosh and talk about a motive youre on the dole because your boss has been topped and the whole town knows who did it now you see him staggering out of the wheatsheaf none of his cid mates are there to help him a few angry words and it begins to turn nasty we all know paul carters rep fair old temper on him im not saying he didnt throw the first punch cash made show of studying gariochs face for injuries on the other hand he definitely came off worse he knew it wasnt going to get any better so he ran and you went after him along the promenade then down on to the shore itself youre a big man but not in the best of shape maybe you were never going to catch him but he was so scared he ran into the surf anyway or you did catch him cashs voice drifted off maybe you did at that do i have to listen to this garioch asked his lawyer i think di cash would be foolish to think of charging you at this altogether shoddy juncture the lawyer speculated therell be other witnesses cash warned them we havent even put the description out yet huge bald brute of a man with a tattoo on his neck stumbling through the streets in drenched trousers think back tosh you know yourself you were spotted nice lineup well put together but only after weve brought billie in give her a good hard session kaye found himself moving forward half a pace ready to step in looked to him as though garioch was gearing up to go for his tormentors throat cash seemed to realise it too but it only made him lean a little further across the table towards the man she might perjure herself for you but thatll count against her in court shell end up going down same as you you know that old thing they say on tv movies motive means opportunity cash held up three fingers my scratchcards showing three gold bars tosh he eased back in his chair clasping his hands together garioch leaned his knuckles against the edge of the desk then rose slowly to his feet did i say you could leave cash asked not unpleasantly i can go when i want garioch checked with his lawyer the lawyer nodded then im out of here harder you make it for me the more im going to enjoy it cash warned both men garioch glared at him but said nothing then he noticed that tony kaye was standing between him and the door theres a deal to be done kaye stated if paul carter was being set up by his uncle and you had anything to do with it theyre both dead whats it going to matter did i give you permission to speak cash said his voice almost too calm kaye ignored him and kept his eyes locked on gariochs theres a deal to be done he repeated quietly holding out a business card garioch looked from kaye to cash and from cash to everyone else in the room fuck the lot of you he growled pushing past tony kaye and hauling open the door but only after snatching the business card from kayes hand at lunchtime fox drove home the tests on his father had so far proved inconclusive it still looked like a stroke but they wouldnt know more until mitch regained consciousness cant you make him jude had asked a shot of adrenaline or something there had been some more tears and the consultant had suggested that a break from the hospital might be an idea fox had offered to drive her but shed insisted she would take the bus this is just stupid he had made the mistake of telling her are you going to be like this the rest of your days shed aimed a swipe at his face and stormed off he had passed her in his car standing in the bus shelter arms folded angry at the whole world he made good time and parked outside his house just before one as he was getting out of the car his phone rang tony kaye how did it go fox asked him i think di cash may be in the huff with me excellent work fox pushed his thumb down on the key fob locking the volvo i take it you couldnt keep your gob shut i might have accidentally offered tosh garioch a deal what sort of deal go easy on him over the drowning if he talks to us about his boss cash wasnt keen on that not overly id say hes close to running us out of town the club has room for two more fox conceded he was standing at his front door staring at it any word on your dad im going to have to ring you back fox ended the call and walked to the livingroom window peering into the house no sign of movement back at the front door he noted the damage to the jamb there wasnt much of it a crowbar or some sort of chisel had been enough he couldnt help thinking of the damage to the door of gallowhill cottage he studied the neighbouring properties it was a quiet street people kept themselves to themselves it had probably taken the thief half a minute to effect entry could have made it look like he was ringing the doorbell or pushing a delivery through the letter box fox edged the door open with his foot and stepped into the hall it didnt look as though any of the papers on his dining table were missing maybe theyd been looked at it was hard to say his laptop was gone along with its cable and charger though the tv and dvd player hadnt been touched in the kitchen the radio had vanished from its spot next to the kettle upstairs bedroom drawers spilling out their contents his good watch was missing but his passport remained contents of the wardrobe tipped out on to the floor he sat on the bed and rested his chin on his hands worth calling it in yes but only so he could get a reference number to pass on to the insurers he doubted thered be prints a joiner would put the door right whoever had been there had left without taking the spare set of keys they werent coming back it had been made to look like a regular breakin but fox wasnt convinced he went downstairs again and stared at the paperwork on the table charles mangolds name stared back at him from the topmost sheet written there in capitals hed jotted down other names too along with dates and queries if id been here he wondered would i have been made to look like a suicide get a grip malcolm he muttered to himself he tried to think how much information was to be found on the laptop more of his thoughts in more detailed sequence than the written notes he hadnt got round to adding alison and stephen pears and andrew watson to the mix had he made mention of francis vernals logbook the connection between gavin willis and the dark harvest commando specifically the man called hawkeye he thought so nothing had been printed off but hed copied the contents of the folder on to a memory stick a memory stick now missing and professor martins book with it a fourquid memory stick and a tatty old book no selfrespecting housebreaker would have bothered with either spooks special branch was this the same warning intended for alan carter only that time things had gone wrong fox took out his phone and reported the breakin then went outdoors again and checked that vernals logbook was still in the glove box of the car it was he tried the bungalows either side of his but no one was home across the street mr anderson elderly and hard of hearing had seen nothing unusual a car or van fox persisted but anderson just shook his head and offered to make a pot of tea for them both another time fox told him he tried two more neighbours but no one had seen or heard a vehicle no strangers noticed quiet as usual when the patrol car arrived fox showed them his warrant card then pointed to the damage one of the officers had a handheld electronic device into which he tapped the details serial number for the laptop he asked fox went to fetch the guarantee he could have said it wont turn up but then they would have wanted to know why he was so sure not lothian and borders issue is it the other officer enquired fox shook his head nothing workrelated on it then no he lied at least you wont face a disciplinary the officer commented bit of a blessing his colleague added does the sarcasm come at no extra charge fox asked and a disciplinarys only if youve been negligent i dont think breakins count theyd had their fun at the complaints expense so stopped smirking and suggested getting a team in to dust for prints fox argued it wasnt worth the bother not so sure about that inspector the elder of the two countered been a few homes broken into round here in the past six months might be able to tie yours to them then when we catch the wee bastards the younger officer said fine then fox said it took an hour for a forensic car to arrive a young woman brought her box of tricks into the house and got to work fox had got the bedroom back to normal he watched her as she brushed powder on to the front door didnt take much she commented no not even your telly means they were probably on foot yes she paused in her work im not getting much here she admitted a few minutes later she was in the living room he asked her to dust the surface of the dining table she came up with a few prints probably mine fox conceded she lifted a few samples anyway then took his prints to check them against fox was reminded of the scene outside alan carters cottage he was still wondering if he was lucky to have been out of the house but if theyd really wanted him there they could have chosen their moment relatively easy to find his home address a word in the right ear maybe even a bit of computer hacking he wasnt in the phone book though jude was hell he could even have been tailed from police hq they had either watched him leave the house or theyd known he was on his way to the hospital after his brief trip to the office were they listening to his phone calls had someone planted bugs in his house office or car he tried to snort the thought away but knew it would bother him for the rest of the day the woollysuits gave you a reference number the forensics officer was asking having finished with the upstairs bedroom woollysuits uniforms she explained with a smile there was a di who used to call them that they gave me a reference number yes all you can do is put in a claim then and get a stronger door for next time fox nodded could have been worse eh she said with a smile he seemed to agree with her that it could the same meeting room as before at mangold bain and as expected charles mangold could spare only a few minutes there was no offer of a drink time as mangold himself put it did not permit he pressed his hands together lips brushing the tips of his fingers and listened to what fox had to say my homes been broken into the stuff you gave me got left behind but they took my laptop some of my own work on the vernal case was on it theyll have your name now mangold waved this aside who do you think is responsible im not sure ive had a few runins with someone from special branch ah and last night i went to see alice watts mangold didnt bother trying to conceal his surprise the girl francis was seeing you found her yes where is she whats she doing he watched fox shake his head slowly why not i have my reasons mangold seemed to be considering pressing the point but foxs look told him it would be futile did she talk to you about francis he asked instead fox nodded well the lawyer demanded she didnt love him mangold stared at him youre sure of that he watched fox nod again why did she disappear off the face of the earth did she have something to do with his death i dont think so not directly but you can put imogen vernals mind at rest fox paused though im not sure thats ever been your intention the two men locked eyes i think what you really want is for the scales to fall from her eyes is that so it galls you that all these years shes held fast to an image of her husband the crusader the patriot no matter what youve done for her including adding her name to the law firm shes never given you your due has she i dont see that this outburst serves any purpose inspector fox shrugged the complaint aside why did you choose alan carter to be your bloodhound youd had years to look into vernals death and my guess is thats what you did it didnt get you very far but you knew gavin willis had led the original inquiry and you probably discovered that hed been a mentor to alan carter foxs eyes narrowed you werent interested in what he found you wondered how much he would try to conceal that way youd have a better understanding of the role gavin willis played and you had a point carter didnt tell you about vernals car for example tucked away all these years in a garage behind gallowhill cottage see it works both ways there was stuff he didnt want you to know thats probably why he took the job on he could control the investigation and make sure no mud stuck to gavin williss name i dont see mangold repeated his voice quiet but trembling with anger that this gets us any further fox sat in silence for a few seconds then shrugged a couple more names have come up he stated andrew watson for one our current justice minister the same do you know him no he was a lawyer though before becoming an msp a different generation from me and he practised in aberdeen criminal law it was mangolds turn to nod what has he got to do with franciss death an eyebrow shot up youre after him to reopen the investigation would you like that it would be a nightmare for imogen she might reach out for someone to hold her hand the look mangold gave told fox the lawyer reckoned this a very cheap shot whats the other name mangold asked fox shook his head slowly as if to indicate that it wasnt at all important just that i saw a photo of his brotherinlaw stephen pears taken in the new club hes a member i thought it was mostly lawyers and judges a fairly wide spectrum mangold corrected him is the justice minister a member too mangold thought for a moment do you know i dont think he is would vernal have known andrew watson fox asked both lawyers both keen nationalists wouldnt watson still have been at school when frank died mangold did the arithmetic in his head couldnt have been much more than sixteen or seventeen the age of idealism fox stated sort of age when youre open to ideas too though not perhaps the idea that your sister was sleeping with a man twice her age a married man a man called francis vernal lacking a computer at home fox returned to fettes hoping he wouldnt bump into the chief constable the car radio news told him that the three kippen suspects were likely to be charged by the end of the day but would remain in custody in any event extra time for questioning having been granted fox knew that after the megrahi case the scottish government would feel the spotlight was on them and on the justice system next to the reception desk the status was still critical even with the bad guys detained fox asked the desk officer we dont know how many more are out there the man replied and maybe wanting revenge fear fox had noticed the same thing when skimming the news reports from fear was everpresent when youd stopped needing to fear a ussoviet conflagration or an impending ice age something else came along in its place fear of crime always seemed to outpace the actual statistics right now people were fearing for their jobs and pensions fearing global warming and dwindling resources if these problems were ever resolved new worries would fill the vacuum he stared at the word critical then moved past the sign and headed for the stairs joe naysmith was in the complaints office he gave fox a wave done and dusted in fife fox asked him naysmith nodded so wheres tony naysmith shrugged and asked fox if he wanted a coffee sure fox said sitting down at his computer he took a twentypound note from his pocket folded it to make a paper plane and launched it in naysmiths direction the young man looked at him im paying off the kitty debts fox explained does that cover it with room to spare good fox said then he got to work doing a search on andrew watson as mangold had suggested the current justice minister would just have been starting at aberdeen university when francis vernal died fox looked carefully but could see no sign that watson had ever been a hardliner or especially radical hed graduated with a first in law then joined a practice snp councillor by the age of twentyseven and an msp at thirtyone the party leader seemed to like and respect him as a backroom boy watson was credited with helping the snp canvass its way into government the twentypound note seemed to have cheered joe naysmith up he sat with fox and let fox bounce ideas off him then got up and made more coffee while fox texted tony kaye to ask him where he was when his phone rang he reckoned it would be kaye but it was jude phoning from the hospital hes awake she said but hes not right fox drove out to the infirmary and found himself entering the car park just behind a slowmoving rover he sounded his horn in irritation and gestured for the driver to put his foot down after a couple of circuits he found an empty bay it was at the very furthest corner and he had to walk past the rover as he made for the hospital entrance the driver was foxs fathers age and looked fearful as fox stalked towards him the critical sign flashed in foxs head and he paused for a moment muttering the word sorry before carrying on when he reached his fathers bedside mitchs eyes were closed hands clasped on his chest jude was talking to a woman who introduced herself as mae ross mrs ross works at lauder lodge jude explained we were just wondering how hes doing mrs ross added and i was apologising for not getting in touch sooner fox just nodded you said he was awake he commented he is sort of fox leaned over his father and watched the eyelids flutter then open the eyes took a moment to focus chris his father said voice slurred its malcolm fox laid a palm against his fathers hands malcolm the word was barely recognisable strokes do that mrs ross stated then to the patient in the sort of singsong voice usually reserved for children were all looking forward to seeing our favourite client back at lauder lodge her wide smile disappeared as fox turned to face her hes not a client he growled hes my father she looked shocked i didnt mean anything mr fox jude seemed stunned by the outburst she placed a hand on foxs forearm chris mitch fox was repeating not chris malcolm his son informed him cousin chris jude guessed burntisland chris chris is dead fox was telling his father he fell off his motorbike remember fox took the photograph from his pocket the one showing chris fox cheering francis vernal he unfolded it and thrust it into his fathers face see he said thats chris he pointed to the face thats chris and im malcolm its okay malcolm jude was telling him while mrs ross looked at him as if he were mad the hospital staff were taking an interest too fox lowered the photograph and watched his fathers face clear chris was always so careful on that bike of his mitch fox said not careful enough though but a question was starting to form in foxs mind a question only one person could answer he turned towards jude who was still gripping him by his forearm theres somewhere i need to go he told her will you be all right here she nodded slowly looking a little fearful fox freed himself from her grasp and ran his hand down the side of her head but if anything changes ill call you she said i shouldnt be too long just come back to us when youre ready jude told him she even managed a smile of sorts as if keen to bolster him fox did something he hadnt done in a while leaned in towards her and kissed her on the cheek she lifted herself a little making it easier for him and then he was gone when fox got to police hq in stirling the media presence had not lessened and armed officers still gave his warrant card a thorough inspection he texted the chief constables mobile with a message tell jackson im downstairs ten minutes later the special branch man was standing in front of him fox took his time getting up from the same seat hed used on his previous visit what the hell do you want jackson snarled charged them yet fox asked casually jackson folded his arms and said nothing i had a good chat with the chief constable last night fox went on sorry she felt the need to keep you out of it jackson exhaled noisily through his nostrils his phone sounded and he checked the message on his screen fox waited until he had the mans attention again then started to speak chris fox does the name mean anything to you jackson stared at him then gave the slightest of nods wondered when youd get round to that he muttered come on fox was given a visitors pass by the same receptionist as the previous day he followed jackson along a corridor and down a flight of stairs another corridor but this time with an armed officer checking ids two interview rooms facing one another across the corridor kevlarvested officers standing guard outside both of them jackson pushed open one of the doors take a look he said standing in the doorway fox saw that a man was seated at a table he was handcuffed and refused to look up lightbrown skin thick wavy hair dark rings under his eyes the left eye swollen shut jackson closed the door again and stared at fox military and political targets first then civilian supermarkets football fixtures even hospitals he didnt care who got killed as long as we took notice whats your point fox asked my point is theres a real and current threat and wed be foolish to dwell on the past jackson could tell that the guards were listening he paced further down the corridor past shirtsleeved detectives who nodded a greeting at him there was a small empty office next to a further set of doors and jackson walked in waiting for fox to follow close the door he ordered fox did so and the two men faced one another a real and current threat the special branch man repeated quietly we do what is necessary to stop it becoming a reality i was asking about chris fox i thought thats what this was all about when i saw that surname in the vaults had to be a connection when we spoke at the cafeteria i already knew jackson confirmed made me wonder why you didnt bring it up i was beginning to think maybe you had something to hide such as jackson gave a shrug hes a relative of some kind cousin how come hes in the special branch vaults you dont know jackson sounded genuinely surprised fox watched him calculate how much to say strictly between us fox offered jackson took a few moments more to make up his mind he was a shop steward a radical shop steward liked nothing better than a violent picket or stirring things up cardcarrying member of the communist party plenty of them in fife but he switched to separatism he was a good friend to francis vernal in the early years the two of them hatched plans for marches and demos against visiting royals it would only have taken one hothead with a gun jackson paused it was the same back then as it is now a real and current threat with special branch doing everything necessary to stop it becoming a reality jackson fixed fox with a look we did not kill chris fox how do you know it was a motorbike accident pure and simple so if thats what all this is about its not what then i dont like the idea of people getting away with murder we can agree on that at least jackson paused what did the chief constable say to you last night nothing she wants you to know or shed have said her brothers furious with you i can live with that jackson stared down at his feet as if studying his shoes he looks quite normal doesnt he who jackson gestured towards the corridor they always seem so ordinary just that bit more driven and what is it that drives them jackson could only shrug what happened to him fox asked the black eye i mean punched himself in the face that way when the media eventually get their photo it looks as if hes been roughed up jackson looked at fox again dont worry local complaints have been informed statements taken thats all right then your cousin chris we were keeping tabs on him but nothing serious we didnt see him as the real threat who was the real threat vernal donald maciver or the foot soldiers like hawkeye whos hawkeye when hes at home you didnt come across his name fox watched jackson shake his head maybe you need another trip to the vaults then easier just to ask you ive no idea who he is hardly matters jackson speculated whatever threat there was we dealt with it at the time fox glowered at him i want to speak to the men who were tailing vernal that night its not going to happen itll have to if you want me off your back all theyd tell you is what ive already said they had nothing to do with his death i need to hear it from them why i just do jackson seemed to consider this before shaking his head slowly not good enough inspector he said pulling open the door and indicating that it was time to leave my house was broken into fox informed him reckon if someone goes into your precious vaults in a couple of decades time theyll find mention of it no shortage of criminals out there at least we agree on that fox replied they walked back down the corridor past the interview rooms and the guards i hope your father improves jackson said while fox handed his pass back at reception thanks jackson held out his hand for fox to shake we really are on the same side he stressed dont forget that when do you head back south next day or two but you always know where to find me if you need me to be honest fox said im hoping i never see you again at eight that evening fox was seated by his fathers hospital bed jude had been persuaded to go home for a few hours sleep mitch was asleep too fox had stopped off at lauder lodge for some bits and pieces and had ended up bringing the shoebox full of photographs with him he had looked at every single one of them wondering what sort of story they were trying to tell him a twentiethcentury family not very different from any other a roof over their heads and food in their bellies trips to the seaside and christmas mornings there was malcolm dressed in his favourite tshirt hair longer than his father liked tearing the wrapping from a present jude posing with her mother in a theatre auditorium it would have been a musical their mother had a passion for them father and son would always stay home to watch american cop shows on tv burntisland again chris fox with jude up on his shoulders and one of him showing off his motorbike a polishing rag in one hand radical violent picket stirrer fox would have liked to have known the man if his father wasnt sleeping hed maybe have tried asking a few questions mitchs breathing was ragged every now and then he would seem to choke coughing a few times without waking his cheeks seemed sunken to malcolm the drip was still feeding him awake hed not been able to swallow food fox tried to ignore the catheters tubing as it snaked from beneath the sheets towards the bag hanging from the beds metal frame proper detective work thats what im doing he wanted to tell his father for better or worse thats what im doing when his phone started to vibrate he checked the screen the callers identity was blocked he stood up and answered walking past the nurses station towards the corridor hello is that malcolm fox the voice sounded distinctly irritated yes they told me i had to talk to you oh there was the sound of a throat clearing fox got the feeling the caller was a man in his sixties i was there that night they said you needed to hear about it francis vernal fox stopped walking you were tailing him surveillance yes i need to call you back let me take down your number i might be retired but im not senile a name then how about colin or james or fred no names fox guessed no names the voice confirmed ive been out of the service for a long time and i certainly dont owe them anything so listen you get to hear this once and once only he paused as if expecting fox to respond in some way okay fox obliged vernal was driving like a maniac hed had more than a few drinks before setting out from anstruther hed been there all weekend with his lover the voice confirmed if thered been any traffic at all on that road it could have been a lot worse we heard the crash before we saw it straight into a tree hed gone front end crumpled and him with a few teeth missing in the drivers seat unconscious but breathing pulse steady if another car had stopped and seen us well we didnt want that but you hung around long enough to give the car the onceover too good a chance to miss you didnt take his money and cigarettes though we were asked about that at the time maybe your partner no any chance of him confirming that for himself died a year back natural causes in case youre wondering sorry to hear it what do you think happened to vernals cigarettes and his lucky fiftypound note no idea and there wasnt a gun in the car when you searched it plenty of places he could have hidden one hed also hidden thirty or forty thousand in cash i was told youd mention that kept in the boot apparently we didnt open the boot you sure about that we didnt know anything about any money youd been tailing vernal you must have seen him at dhc meetings coming out to the car and disappearing back inside again we never saw any money your mole didnt mention it the man paused again before answering ive told you what i know he said prove to me you were there what how am i supposed to know otherwise there was another long silence on the line the reason we hightailed it the voice said eventually is that he started coming round the first word out of his mouth was imogen we hadnt been expecting that you knew who imogen was she was his wife he was obviously in a bit of pain and she was the one he wanted to see not alice imogen but you just left him there no thought of calling for help we were called the watcher service fox thats what we did and a phone call to a doctor wasnt going to save him anyway was it fox didnt answer are we done was someone called hawkeye ever on your radar he was a dhc member slippery little bastard slippery how few times the watchers tried a follow he either did a houdini act or else clocked them the caller paused then repeated his previous question we done i dont know how you can live with it fox commented were done the voice stated the line went dead fox found that he was leaning with his back against the corridors wall he rested his head against its cool surface and stared at the framed print on the wall opposite then he looked up alison pearss number and punched it in what she snapped wanted to thank you for getting jackson to talk to me it doesnt seem to have stopped you pestering me ive just had a call from one of the two agents who were tailing vernal that night yes i just wondered im assuming you met them no you didnt know them we never had any direct contact they were spooks i was a junior police officer is that all you needed to know well since ive got you yes bit of a coincidence i come to your house and not long afterwards someone breaks into mine im sorry to hear that was anything taken laptop memory stick professor martins book i see am i being paranoid who do you think did it ive no idea have you maybe mentioned me to your handlers at special branch handlers this isnt john le carre fox youve not spoken to anyone believe it or not ive had more important things on my plate there was silence on the line for a moment then she asked him how his father was doing thanks but thats none of your business fox heard a doorbell and guessed alison pears was at home thatll be my brother she said by way of confirmation hes here for an update do we end this conversation before i open the door to him thats up to you i dont think theres anything else to say is there hang on though he heard her unlock her door and tell the justice minister him again that makes twice today the telephone changed hands fox listened as andrew watson began his tirade eight or nine words in fox ended the call and went back to his fathers bedside tony kaye met tosh garioch at the door of the dakota hotel in south queensferry neutral territory just the edinburgh side of the forth road bridge the hotel itself was a modern black box with its name picked out in neon in a retail park boasting a latenight supermarket and not much else thanks for coming kaye said hand held out garioch hesitated for a moment before pressing his own hand against kayes it didnt quite turn into a test of strength but it was close thought we could have a drink kaye added with a thin smile garioch nodded and they went in the main restaurant to the rear of the bar was doing a good trade businessmen eating alone couples whispering over the seafood platters there were some bar stools but kaye opted for a sofa garioch took the squishy chair opposite the low wooden table separating them its good you kept my number kaye said i had to dig in the bin to find it garioch held up kayes business card it had been torn in half the waiter arrived and they both ordered pints the young man couldnt help staring at gariochs thistle tattoo a bowl of nuts was placed on the table and garioch dug a paw into it filling his mouth so whats this deal he said kaye leaned forward way i see it we can go easy on you you had every right to be angry with paul carter came to blows and he took off you ran after him but gave up when he went into the water kaye shrugged we dont ask how far you followed him we dont mention the wet trouserlegs he drowned not your fault he was stupid enough to go swimming kaye gave the man time to think this over the drinks arrived and he paid for them took a mouthful and began again if we want to go a bit harder on you it comes out in a different light beating up a cop and hounding him to his doom wading into the water until you could be sure he wasnt coming out again he paused swirling the contents of his glass but for the deal to work well need to know about alan carter and paul youre not even cid garioch countered itll be cash giving evidence in court not you cash will listen to me hell have to kaye paused i blame myself anyway you were there when i took the call from my colleague talked to him about paul carter i jotted it down in my notebook didnt i paul carter wheatsheaf kaye produced the notebook and showed garioch the relevant page problem with that is if i tell cash about it then suddenly theres an element of premeditation see what i mean tosh you didnt just stumble across paul carter you were lying in wait for him kaye left it at that concentrating on his drink again garioch was right he had no power and as for cash doing what he told him no matter he just needed to sound confident here and now garioch slouched a little in his chair and kaye knew he had him alan was good to me garioch said quietly gave me a job and everything not so easy when youve done time when he asked a wee favour you werent going to say no garioch nodded his agreement with this paul usually went to that club on a friday night couple of times wed had to drag him off some woman he was drooling over billie and bekkah were supposed to follow him out when he left get chatting to him then make a complaint whether hed done anything or not garioch nodded again his head had fallen between his massive shoulders a woman had already complained about him but shed been scared off alan got me and mel to have a quiet word with her mel stuart kaye checked mels done a bit of time too hasnt he didnt it feel a bit strange the pair of you taking a wage from an excop alan was all right you knew where you stood with him so hed had you put a bit of pressure on teresa collins kaye prompted billie and bekkah were by way of an insurance policy garioch acknowledged but when they left the club they couldnt see him after a bit bekkah needed to pee and thats when he drew up in his car we didnt know he would have them lifted but it worked out okay for us your boss was happy he hated his nephew never quite understood it myself but thats families for you grievances get nursed you never asked him why he was doing it garioch shook his head and getting the girls involved that was alan carters idea yes did paul try anything with billie and bekkah just like they told it another reason for you to be furious with him garioch stared at tony kaye it was for what he did to alan he stated actually tosh were not so sure he killed your boss kaye commented meaning he might have died for nothing if you had a conscience i dare say that fact could end up troubling it kaye rose slowly to his feet well get a statement from you he said best if you talk to di cash direct tell him everything youve told me i thought you were going to talk to him and i will but best if it looks like youve made up your own mind take your lawyer with you kaye was buttoning his coat he nodded towards gariochs empty glass and no more of those tonight dont want to add drinkdriving to the list do we fox was asleep fully dressed on his sofa when the doorbell went he had an ache in his neck and rubbed at his eyes before checking the time five minutes shy of midnight the tv news was playing but just barely audible he got up and stretched his spine the bell went again he opened the livingroom curtains and peered out then went into the hall and opened the door bit late to be canvassing he told andrew watson i need a word with you the politician replied a car was parked outside foxs gate engine idling and a driver at the wheel better come in then he said bit of trouble watson had noticed the damage to the door breakin watson didnt seem interested he followed fox into the house im not used to people hanging up on me he said as if reading from a script but fox wasnt about to apologise instead he was pouring the dregs from a bottle of fruit juice into a glass and gulping it down there was no offer of anything for the justice minister fox sat down on the sofa and switched the tv sound to mute watson stayed on his feet i need to know whats going on he said ask your sister she wont tell me then i cant help why are the complaints so interested thats between her and me i could make it my business i dare say you could watson glared at him shes running the highestprofile case weve seen in this country for several years maybe even since megrahi fox agreed the snp mans eyes did everything short of glowing red i intend to see to it that you dont come within ten miles of her fox was rubbing at his eyes again he blinked them back into focus sighed and motioned for watson to sit down i prefer to stand sit down and listen to what i have to tell you watson sat down pressing his palms together as if to aid his concentration remember at the house fox began i mentioned francis vernal yes your sister was fresh out of tulliallan first job she got was deep cover posing as a student at st andrews matriculation tutorials the lot student politics got her closer and closer to some of the groups on the fringes she was feeding back any information she could get are you quite sure about that inspector fox showed him the two matriculation photographs look familiar watson studied them without emotion what of it he eventually commented she started seeing vernal spending a lot of time with him hed been with her that weekend had just left her when his car went off the road thats what i needed to talk to her about fox was staring at the politician gauging his reactions i never knew watson said quietly those groups tended to be separatists not so far from your own politics i remember it was a bad time for the snp some of us were a bit desperate a bit frustrated we were being marginalised that wont ever happen again believe me but back then tough times watson agreed did you know any of these groups seed of the gael dark harvest commando only by reputation you never met donald maciver no or francis vernal no and youd no idea what your sister was up to no idea watson echoed now ive told you what do you think watson turned this over in his mind for the best part of a minute then shrugged and shook his head im really not sure he said all those activists must have gone someplace fox commented maybe into government even no place for hotheads and racists in the modern party inspector watson seemed to study fox can i take it youre a unionist its irrelevant what i am are you sure about that dusting off old enmities and conspiracies hoping some mud might stick does the name hawkeye mean anything to you the question appeared to puzzle watson he thought for a moment just the character from mash he concluded and last of the mohicans fox added that too watson agreed he seemed tired all his energy and anger used up its working you know he said at last his eyes meeting foxs the administration i mean a quarter of a century back few would have said theyd see the snp in power in their lifetime and that includes a lot of us in the party but we got there he nodded to himself we got there he repeated then he stiffened but we cant afford another megrahi these bombblasts alison needs all her concentration meaning no sideshows id hardly call murder a sideshow murder alan carter the man investigating vernals death made to look like suicide but actually an execution you cant think alison had anything to do with that why not if carter knew about her and was about to blow the whistle never watson shook his head you really cant go bandying that sort of it seems to be the only way of getting anyones attention fox countered after all it got yours she cant have this hanging over her watson pressed alisons worked hard to get where she is i dare say you think youve worked hard too of course fox narrowed his eyes is it her youre worried about or yourself the job of justice minister seems to have a curse hanging over it doesnt it bit of a fillip to have a chief constable you can depend on especially if she can also deliver a few extra column inches what do you mean how about if i hang fire do nothing till after your terrorists are sentenced you get your moment of glory and afterwards i start asking my questions again watson stared at him what would you want in return he asked his tone softening nothing fox paused because its not going to happen i just wanted to see if youd bite watson flew to his feet for christs sake he spluttered fox ignored the outburst by the way i meant to ask how did you get my address what my address jackson watson snapped fox nodded to himself so the special branch man knew where he lived watson had paced to the window and back again is there any point trying to reason with you fox shrugged then ill have to take this up with your chief constable what will you do have me suspended remember to fill him in on your sisters history what is it you think shes done wrong exactly im still trying to figure that out fox met watsons gaze care to help me help you by reopening the vernal investigation properly this time set up a public inquiry he was being spied on by mi and an undercover police officer did that play any part in his death was there a coverup afterwards and does it connect to the murder of alan carter fox rose slowly to his feet keeping his eyes fixed on watson could be a real feather in your cap if you started to get some answers to those questions but the justice minister was shaking his head dark harvest commando the snla nobody wants those corpses resurrected nobody in your party fox corrected him nobody period you might be surprised watson kept on shaking his head just me then the question was rhetorical but watson answered it anyway just you three minutes later fox was watching from his window as the car pulled away the interior light was on the minister mulling over documents foxs phone let him know he had a text it was from jude you awake he called her back whats wrong he asked nothing didnt want to bother you if you were asleep speaking of which i cant stop tossing and turning she confessed with a sigh i keep thinking about dad what are we going to do with him malcolm im not sure he cant stay in hospital for ever no but unless he improves lauder lodge isnt much use to him either he agreed finishing the thought for her ill put my thinking cap on jude me too he listened to her shift positions guessed she was lying in bed remember when we were kids he said id sneak into your room and wed sing songs together under the sheets our own top of the pops until mum or dad heard us i havent thought of that for years i was in some woods a few days back fox began settling himself on the sofa again it took me back to the hermitage and the walks we used to take that was in the days when you still preferred me to other boys i never preferred you to other boys jude teased fox smiled and they continued chatting he had the tv remote in his hand and flicked through the available channels latenight shopping astrology phonein quizzes there was news but he didnt linger on it he settled on a comedy channel instead an old episode of mash was just starting hawkeye and trapper john and hot lips and radar the actor alan alda played hawkeye all floppy fringe loping walk and wisecracks jude was talking about a den theyd made one time at a secret spot in the hermitage but fox wasnt sitting so comfortably now his grip had tightened on the remote he pretended to yawn apologising to his sister i should let you sleep she told him im really enjoying talking but i can hardly keep my eyes open tomorrow at the hospital what time do you think youll be there he asked after breakfast you later probably things to do she guessed night sis night bro fox ended the call and wandered into the kitchen boiling the kettle and making himself some strong tea on another night he might have spent time reflecting on the thawing in his relationship with his sister but that would have to wait he took the mug back through to the living room and tried using his mobile phone to access the internet it was hopeless though slow and the screen too small after peering at it for a while he decided he needed to go to fettes and use one of the computers in the complaints office as he was readying to leave his phone trilled according to the display it was evelyn mills he let it keep ringing two minutes later there was a text need someone to talk to he stared at the message undecided he had his jacket on car key in his free hand the phone went again and he answered evelyn but it was a mans voice whoever you are just bugger off she doesnt need you the line went dead fox stared at the handset her partner freddie presumably fine then fox said to himself heading for the door its stephen pears fox repeated it was just shy of five am and he was seated at the breakfast bar in tony kayes kitchen he had spent the best part of an hour trying to persuade his friend of the truth of it the two men keeping their voices low so as not to wake kayes wife eventually kaye had sighed scratched his nose and suggested food as the toast was placed in front of fox he knew he wouldnt eat it and this is all because of a latenight repeat on the comedy channel kaye said pouring more coffee yes see when you took that trip to carstairs madness isnt catching is it ive told you hawkeye pierce hawkeye pears he was on the archery team in high school it was the obvious nickname for him after university hes supposed to have spent a couple of years drifting hes always been vague about it says he did a variety of jobs all over the world and came back to scotland with a chunk of money first anyone heard of him in the finance sector was mid and he had almost thirty k to invest split it between two startups and a year later hes quadrupled his stake and you got all this from a journalist fox nodded i drove to the scotsman offices night shift comprised one staffer he phoned the business editor for me did either of them wonder why you were interested i told him i was the media unit what media unit fox shrugged putting together a press pack about chief constable alison pears and to do that you needed to ask the media for help kaye shook his head slowly and brushed toast crumbs from the corners of his mouth in the middle of the night it was all i had fox reasoned and i got what i needed didnt i its not enough the guy in that photo looks nothing like stephen pears i can ask him fox had taken the photo from his pocket the one showing vernal alice and hawkeye it was scuffed from so much handling what if he denies it thats all hes got to do malcolm fox picked up his replenished mug but put it down again without drinking he knew his friend was right the photo wasnt enough the theories werent enough kaye swallowed some coffee and stifled a belch if it is him he speculated the wifes got to know im not so sure fox countered they met twelve years ago and have been married for ten that makes it thirteen years since shed laid eyes on hawkeye beard gone hair short and dyed a lighter colour a bit heavier around the waist and the face shes got to have known kaye persisted wiping at his mouth again fox didnt say anything he stared at the toast on his plate with its layer of pale yellow butter the very thought of it was making him queasy he slid the photograph back into his pocket as kaye spoke even supposing just for arguments sake that youre right it doesnt mean you can tie pears to anything are you saying he killed francis vernal and alan carter hed have had motive enough because his wifes risen through the ranks and he doesnt want anyone pooping her party theres that fox agreed plus hes on course for the house of lords a terrorist past might not sit too well with a tory peerage hes a donor to the party too kaye was staring at him you cant go saying any of this malcolm not without at least a few shreds of evidence i went on the internet pears spoke at a conference a few years back in barbados same time an arms dealer called william benchley drowned in his swimming pool benchley had been selling guns smuggled home by soldiers from the falklands kayes stare intensified malcolm fox held up a hand i know i know maybe i should check myself into carstairs he paused but what if at least some of it is true kaye pushed his empty plate aside and lifted his coffee mug i still dont see youre in a position to do anything about it he said maybe not fox conceded but since its a night for storytelling i can offer you one of my own fox tried hard to concentrate on tony kayes account of his meeting with tosh garioch so paul carter was being set up by his uncle he stated at the conclusion not exactly kaye argued garioch says paul did try it on with billie and bekkah and alan carter did put a bit of pressure on teresa collins but only after she made her original complaint fox was thoughtful uncle alan wanted to make sure the mud stuck he really did hate his nephew didnt he so why phone him that night phone him but not speak to him foxs eyes were on kaye the address book with pauls number in it it was left open for anyone to find so any check of calls made and pauls name would pop up but say it wasnt alan who did the calling the murderer fox was nodding slowly pauls been found guilty but suddenly hes not on remand any more the judge at his trial is no friend of the police yet he lets him out pending sentencing fox gave a little smile what is it kaye asked sheriff cardonald is a member of the new club i saw him there that time i met with charles mangold so so stephen pears is a member too pears gets his friend the sheriff to release paul carter paul was the perfect fall guy fox argued the court case had made it clear uncle and nephew loathed one another but it only worked if paul was back on the street kaye was actually sounding halfconvinced its all conjecture fox admitted you said so yourself wheres the proof dont always need proof to flush someone out kaye stated we know that from experience do you still think im mad maybe not so much tony kaye drained his coffee the thing is though what do you do about it ill have to think about that having showered shaved and changed his clothes fox was parked outside mangold bain at nine thirty he watched the receptionist arrive but failed to bring her name to mind he knew he needed sleep straight after this he promised himself mangold arrived on foot he turned his head at the sound of the car door opening good morning inspector he said did we have an appointment just curious about something fox explained does colin cardonald know stephen pears sheriff cardonald whats that got to do with anything its a simple enough question fox reasoned ive seen them together mangold conceded at the new club yes friends then colin cardonald likes to dabble dabble stocks and shares handy to have someone like pears to offer advice fox surmised id say so mangold paused does this have something to do with francis not at all fox lied like i say i was just curious curious enough to ambush me outside my office fox couldnt deny it youre close arent you mangolds voice had dropped though there was no one nearby to overhear he took a step towards fox theres a sort of fever in your eyes she wont like it you know fox responded who the widow if im right and it becomes public knowledge shell blame you she might very well end up hating your guts the lawyer reached out and gripped foxs forearm what is it he hissed tell me what it is youve found but fox shook his head slowly and got back into the car mangold stood by the driversside window peering in when fox turned the key in the ignition the lawyer thumped on the volvos roof with both hands he was still standing in the road as fox drove away decreasing in size and importance in the rearview mirror thirteen it took a few days to arrange but that was fine in the meantime the terror suspects had been charged remanded and moved into edinburghs saughton prison the justice minister had enjoyed giving interviews and had praised my big sister much to the delight of the tabloids the alert level at fettes remained critical but would soon be downgraded fife constabulary had written a letter to lothian and borders congratulating the complaints team on its exemplary report whether the media were informed or not fox and his team didnt know nothing seemed to appear in the press reprimands would be issued to scholes haldane and michaelson and that would be that mitchell fox had left hospital not for lauder lodge but for his sons living room fox had bought a single bed from ikea tony kaye helping him put it together the only toilet in the house was upstairs so fox tracked down a commode jude was promising to act as nurse for a short while not for ever and a day mind mitch was slow and occasionally confused and his speech was slurred but he was able to eat and drink with just a little bit of help lauder lodge warned fox that they couldnt keep his fathers room unoccupied for long but he had paid them until the end of the month which gave a bit of breathing space at night he sat and watched tv him on the sofa his dad propped up in bed the old boy could get up during the day though it was proving a challenge getting him dressed more often they left him in his pyjamas and a towelling robe mitchs old drinking buddy sandy cameron had visited and approved of the effort brother and sister were making your old mans proud of you i can see it in his eyes they cooked dinner on alternate nights and pretended everything was quite normal afterwards whatever the weather jude would disappear into the back garden for a cigarette she was already up to ten a day and fox would settle down on the sofa with the tv remote and the evening paper the room had become cramped bed and commode taking up space mitchs clothes had been relegated to a suitcase and bin liner in the hall the coffee table was covered with his paraphernalia and the dining table had been folded closed meaning all foxs paperwork was now spread across his bedroom floor a physio was due to pay a visit once a week to work with mitch a speech therapist had even been mooted theyd given him a rubber ball he was supposed to squeeze twenty times per hand three or four times a day the shoebox of photographs sat untouched on the coffee table jude made a shopping list furniture polish fabric conditioner vacuumcleaner bags and dusters plus an iron and ironing board she asked her brother how hed coped all these years drycleaning was his unconvincing answer stephen pears was due to address shareholders at a meeting in edinburgh on the tuesday at ten in the morning the venue was the ballroom of a venerable citycentre hotel foxs contact on the scotsmans business desk had proffered the information and had also asked if pears was in any trouble because whatever this is about inspector its not a profile of his sister fox had asked if there were any rumours flying around as far as the journalist was concerned their apparent lack was no great comfort these days seems anybody can go bust at an hours notice if i get anything fox assured the man youll be the first to know the shareholders piling into the ballroom looked quietly prosperous they carried their copies of the annual report and muttered about the levels of remuneration the board seemed keen on divvying up most appeared to be well into their twilight years they were the prudent cautious types who hadnt lost too much so far in the recession but would welcome good news from stephen pears and his team there was to be a reception afterwards drinks and canapes served names were ticked off and shiny brochures handed out on the front of the brochure a smiling couple held hands across a restaurant table futureproofing your dreams the headline announced fox took a copy then admitted that his name wasnt on the acceptance list he showed the staff behind the makeshift desk his warrant card then pointed to the three men behind him theyre with me he announced the attendants from carstairs stood either side of donald maciver fox had picked them up at quarter past eight gretchen hughes had repeated that maciver shouldnt get too much stimulus fox had signed his name to the paperwork knowing that if his bosses at fettes hq ever got wind of this he would be on a charge he had lied and lied again in order to convince hughes and her colleagues that he was fully authorised in his actions and that a murder inquiry might be stymied without donald macivers help maciver himself looked presentable as though making an effort for the occasion fox asked him when hed last set foot outside the compound a hospital visit he eventually remembered suspected appendicitis that was probably four or five years back theyd all decided that restraints would not be needed in the first instance the attendants looked like they worked out in what spare time they had and could probably handle their charge whatever happened during the drive theyd kept up a dialogue about various martial arts and dietary supplements while maciver stared at the passing scenery answering foxs questions with a series of grunts punctuated by the occasional yes and no not too many changes hed muttered as they entered the city a few new roads and buildings i could take a detour past the parliament fox had offered why bother had been macivers response bought and sold for english gold fox had quoted receiving a slow determined nod of the head in return so theyd headed for george street instead parking on a meter and entering the hotel the ballroom was larger than necessary there were eighty or ninety chairs laid out in rows of ten pearss team seemed to comprise sharply dressed young men and women who scanned the room for possible dissenters and handed out notepads and pens to anyone who needed them it didnt take them long to spot fox and his guests they remained standing at the back of the room and wouldnt budge when offered seats maciver seemed slightly agitated but the attendants didnt look worried his facial colouring was what fox would call prison grey but he didnt suppose his own was much better he hadnt slept well the past few nights and not just because of his fathers presence in the house the stage beyond the front row of seats didnt look permanent it supported a long table with a blue velvet cloth draped over it four place cards with names on them but too far away for fox to make out the actual names themselves carafes of water and prefilled tumblers microphones there were loudspeakers stageright and left people in the audience greeted each other with curt nods a young man stopped in front of fox but fox was ready for him he held his warrant card an inch from the lackeys nose and identified himself as a police officer i can say it louder if you want everyone else to hear he offered maciver gave a little growl and the young man took a step back then turned and fled he went into a confab with others in the team someone punched a number into their phone and started a whispered conversation holding their hand over their mouth as if fearing lipreaders good fox hoped the news would get backstage maybe the call had come too late though for now four men were arriving by way of a side door they strode purposefully towards the stage climbed the steps and settled themselves behind the table stephen pears tugged at the cuffs of his shirt and checked the straightness of his tie when introduced he nodded and smiled taking in the whole room there were others standing at the back now not just fox maciver and the two attendants but the team working for pears plus some latecomers one person in the third row started having a coughing fit and a staffer was quick to take them some water the four men on the stage tried not to let this distract them a statement of the companys achievements during the previous twelve months was being recited fox had eyes only for stephen pears though pears appeared focused on the rows of seats these were his constituents he had brought no papers with him when a phone chirruped in the room and went unanswered he tried not to look annoyed the attendant next to fox nudged him letting him know it was his phone that was the culprit it stopped but half a minute later started ringing again the ringtone had been set to maximum volume when fox lifted the device from his pocket and checked the screen he saw that it was tony kaye right on cue the man reading out the report had come to a stop reminding the room that all phones should be switched off people were turning their heads to look at fox he did eventually cancel the ringing but only when he was satisfied that he had at last gained stephen pearss attention fox stared back at him nodding an acknowledgement the report was in full flow again but pearss body language had changed he was stiffer less sure of himself when he looked towards the back of the room a second time fox leaned past the attendant and touched macivers arm whispering something to him you all right there mr maciver an innocent enough question to which maciver responded with the nod fox had wanted from him sure another nod fox turned his attention back to the stage and gave pears a little smile hoping it looked satisfied enough pears ran a hand through his hair leaned back in his seat gave the ceiling his full attention then the tabletop the report was winding to its conclusion he was being invited to say a few words about the future when people clapped fox clapped with them the noise didnt agree with maciver he pressed his hands over his ears and gave a low moan as pears stood up and the applause ended that moan could still be heard pears had taken hold of the microphone but he didnt say anything the attendants were trying to calm maciver no he said repeating the word a few times better take him out the attendant nearer to fox said fox nodded his agreement ill be there in a minute he replied the whole room watched as maciver was led away then they turned back to pears expecting the usual poised performance the noteless tour de force pears had finished all the water in his glass more was being poured after fifteen or twenty seconds he started his speech and it was fine fox doubted anyone who had heard him before would notice anything different about the delivery quite the actor he thought to himself but then he knew that already five minutes in he caught pearss eye again and offered a mimed handclap along with a slow nod then he headed for the doors taking out his phone as if to make a call maciver was seated in the hotels reception area running a finger along the stories on the front of a morning paper back to normal one of the attendants assured fox fox settled himself next to maciver and asked if hed recognised anyone on the stage maciver shook his head you sure fox persisted sure maciver echoed fox held out his copy of futureproofing your dreams its back cover consisted of smiling portrait photographs of the main players him fox asked dabbing a finger against stephen pears he was in the room yes he was i dont know him hes been on tv and in the newspapers his names stephen pears im pretty sure youd have known him as hawkeye maciver stared at him youre wrong he stated the wars over fox persisted no need to lie for a cause thats won but maciver was shaking his head slowly and defiantly can i go back back fox thought he meant to the ballroom home maciver corrected him he means carstairs one of the attendants clarified isnt that right donald thats right maciver confirmed i dont like it here he glared at the attendant and its mr maciver to you until you know me better ive known you almost two years youre still on probation what if we went back to the hall for a minute fox suggested just so you could hear him speak maciver was shaking his head again we dont want to make things worse the other attendant cautioned fox considered his options hadnt he got what he wanted maciver was back to his reading asking the attendants if they had a crayon ive got a pen fox offered has to be a crayon the same attendant told him and not too sharp fox nodded his understanding his phone bleeped a message it was tony kaye asking if it had worked more or less fox texted back maciver was studying the portraits on the back of the annual report but then he seemed to dismiss it and went back to his newspaper ready when you are mr maciver fox announced and i want to thank you for everything maciver got to his feet and took a last look at his plush surroundings russians or arabs he asked im not sure i understand who owns this place itll be one or the other mark my words and next year or the year after itll be sold on to china a nation bought and sold the attendants shared a look one rolled his eyes here we go again he said macivers grievances were growing louder as they accompanied him to the door having dropped the three men back at carstairs fox was halfway to edinburgh when his phone started ringing he had a good idea who it might be and was content not to answer not straight away eventually there was a sign pointing to a layby so he signalled and pulled to a stop the number wasnt one he recognised and no message had been left he took a handheld digital recorder from his pocket joe naysmith had assured him the batteries were brand new and it would be good for eight hours of continuous use fox switched it on then called the number and engaged the speakerphone mode hello it wasnt the voice hed expected female sounds of chattering all around stephen pears please he just phoned me from this number hold on the phone changed hands it was a mans voice this time yes stephen pears asked enjoying the canapes fox commented managed to get all those juicy directors bonuses past the shareholders where are you im driving had to drop donald maciver off the man who was with you pears pretended to guess your old pal fox paused watching a lorry hurtle past not much wrong with his memory what exactly is it that you think youre doing a bit of futureproofing fox stated there was silence on the line for a moment are we talking about money we could be or else your own future might not be too bright pears gave a little laugh i dont think i believe you oh nothing about you strikes me as the type the type to be bought off how much do you know about me though youve got my phone number but then i gave that to your wife did your little breakin provide any clues i wouldnt mind my laptop back by the way if youre done with it and the watch you can hang on to professor martins book what did you think of his thesis all that political energy wasted i dont know what youre talking about of course you dont and you were never known as hawkeye when you were part of the dark harvest commando you never held up banks and post offices never sent poison and letter bombs to london never stole all that money from francis vernals car after putting a bullet in his head these sound like ravings inspector you tell your version ill tell mine youll end up in a room next to your friend in carstairs fox tutted i didnt say anything about carstairs mr pears but youve got me wondering now would john elliot recognise you given a nudge maybe therell be others wholl come out of the woodwork the police can do wonders these days well take a recent photo and change the hair colour and length give you a beard reverse the ageing process then well start to see see what see hawkeye staring back at us the man who wanted to bring down the government the man with anarchy in his veins fox paused until greed got the better of him youre making a mistake i really dont think so i do it was pearss turn to pause now if youll excuse me ive got more important things to attend to you do that mr pears ill just give mrs pears a call alice watts as was have you seen that picture of the two of you arm in arm at the copshop demo do what you have to do inspector fine by me just need to toss a coin to decide which murder we charge you with first or were there more than two my arithmetics not what it was fox ended the call checked the quality of the recording then sat for a few minutes his hands resting against the steering wheel he hadnt got much nothing that would begin to stand up in court hawkeye had learned caution somewhere along the way fox was about to head back on to the road when his phone rang again same number as before he switched the recorder back on i seem to have hit a nerve he commented im a man who likes a deal inspector if theres any sort of deal to be done here im willing to consider it its only when you dont get your way that the killer instinct takes over fox speculated business requires a touch of ruthlessness pears seemed to agree but accommodation is always preferable and youre a reasonable man unless pushed too far fox stayed silent pretending to weigh things up we need to meet face to face he eventually stated why we just do im not sure thats a good idea the wallace monument five this evening i have plans for this evening five oclock mr pears fox ended the call and stared at his phone he found that his heart was pounding the blood whistling in his ears and there was a slight tremor in his hands other than that he felt fine i dont like this joe naysmith said its too quiet fox had to agree he was seated in his volvo phone pressed to his ear listening to his colleague he looked out at the car park the last time hed been here it had been the middle of the day and there had been a few tourists about now the place was almost deserted two other cars belonging to the staff most probably plus at the far end of the car park the unmarked white van with naysmith and tony kaye hidden in the back it was their surveillance hub filled with listening and monitoring equipment mostly it didnt stand out from the crowd but there was no crowd here could we park further away fox heard tony kaye ask signals not brilliant as it is naysmith answered fox pressed his free hand to his chest beneath his shirt a sticking plaster fixed the tiny microphone to his skin naysmith preferred plasters to ordinary tape sweat was less likely to affect them the microphone wire ran to the battery pack in foxs back trouserpocket is he sitting on the aerial kaye was asking tell him ill strap it to my head if thatll help fox commented joe naysmith passed the message along it had taken an hours paperwork before they were okayed use of the van and its contents but that was fine just a matter of boxticking fox was adept at boxticking at some point someone further up the ladder would see the completed form and maybe wonder about it but that was for later the vans fuel tank was nearly empty fox had handed naysmith fifty quid and told him to stop at the garage on queensferry road your own shilling kaye had asked thats the way i want it fox had confirmed why here kaye was now asking meaning why the wallace monument resonance fox responded his rearview mirror showed him that the tables were being wiped down in legends the lights turned off at the end of another working day it was ten minutes to the top of the hour theyd been in position since half past four fox was trying to guess which car pears would arrive in the maserati or the lexus he had his answer a couple of minutes later the black maserati emitting a low growl as it entered the car park hes early he said ending the call he watched as pears passed the van without seeming to pause the two other cars were empty so he drew to a halt next to foxs volvo but left the engine idling he lowered his window so fox did the same get in pears ordered why not my car pears shook his head i know mine better fox could hear music from the maseratis stereo jazz piano something similar had been playing at the house in stirling the night hed visited this is a dealbreaker inspector the financier added fox hesitated then slid the window shut pulled the key from the ignition and got out he walked towards the maserati his eyes fixed on its driver pears was studying the car park in his mirrors fox opened the passengerside door and got in pears was wearing leather driving gloves oldfashionedlooking things with stud fasteners the moment fox was in his seat pears put the car into reverse once out of the parking bay he started forward engine roaring as they made to pass the white surveillance van he slammed on the brakes want to say goodbye to your friends he asked sounding the horn then they were off again careering towards the main road as the engine noise increased pears pumped up the volume on the stereo think im that stupid he yelled baring his teeth as he pulled out to overtake traffic stupid enough to get us killed fox retorted reaching for his seat belt the car was already up to eighty and pears showed no sign of easing off he kept glancing in his rearview mirror until satisfied that no tail could have stayed with him while remaining unseen youve made your point fox conceded he unbuttoned his shirt and started to tug at the wiring hauling the battery pack from its hiding place see he removed the batteries and tossed everything on to the back seat then started doing the buttons of his shirt up again no gun pears asked no gun and just that old van for backup i wasnt expecting wacky races pears took the hint and eased his foot a little from the accelerator checking again in the rearview eventually he turned the music down are we headed anywhere nice fox asked he didnt recognise the road at all were just driving pears said driving and talking he glanced at fox i want you to understand why its all turned out like this do i need to know maybe youll see things in a different light so youre going to tell me why you killed francis vernal you have to go back further you have to understand how things were in the eighties i was there fox said were you though or did you sleepwalk through it all those newspaper stories you looked at did you remember half of it happening at the time the marches and protests the fear pears glanced towards fox be honest now maybe i was too busy getting on with life you and a few million others but some of us wanted to change the world and we knew politicians werent going to be much help to us unless we prodded them with letter bombs and anthrax you dont think terrorism works have you looked at northern ireland lately okay so you wanted to smash the system right up until the minute you saw all that cash in vernals car francis was becoming a problem he was drinking too much shooting his mouth off mi were all over him you were following him that night i was watching the house in anstruther two minutes after he turned up so did another car pretty obvious who they were if francis had drunk a bit less hed have been wise to them fox thought for a moment when he left you started to follow them vernal and the spooks both by the time i caught up the crash had already happened i saw them searching his car they werent especially good at it pears paused when theyd gone i went over maybe francis thought i was one of them he was coming round and pointing a bloody gun at me i made a grab for it and it went off there wasnt much i could do after that except empty the boot of the dhc kitty okay so i took the money you did a lot more than that those two agents swear there was no gun in the car thats because the gun was yours not vernals and it was no accident it was a clean shot to the side of the head identical to the way alan carter was killed you assassinated francis vernal and ive only just realised why fox paused waiting to see if pears would say anything but pears seemed to be concentrating on the road ahead you said it yourself you were watching the house in anstruther meaning it was alice watts you were interested in either because you suspected her or you had a thing for her im guessing the latter you had a thing for her yet for some reason she preferred going to bed with the overweight drunken lawyer i can see how that would rankle you in your leather jacket and sunglasses mr outlaw losing out to francis vernal put a bullet in his head and alice would think mi had done it maybe shed want your shoulder to cry on as fox spoke he couldnt help thinking of charles mangold and imogen vernal another case of neverquiterequited love but before any of that could happen he went on she had disappeared you had the money to tide you over and a murder everyone was calling suicide the group was in tatters so you walked away from it all and fell in love with the system you used to hate pears still had nothing to say so fox kept talking i saw something on the internet during a trawl the qualities you need to succeed in business are the same ones coldblooded killers have no empathy no emotion whatever it takes to get the result you want pears responded to this with nothing more than a halfsmile did you realise alice was working undercover fox went on pearss smile faded no he conceded so how did you meet up again a charity dinner she was being fasttracked through cid you recognised her almost immediately but she didnt remember you id changed more than she had you managed to keep it from her fox waited for an answer but none came you must have worked out that she was spying on you and your friends back then pears nodded slowly it didnt matter so much later it didnt matter at all pears glanced at fox again id fallen in love again fox commented properly pears corrected him for the first time you must have known someone would eventually place you pears gave a shrug did maciver really recognise me on that stage yes i dont think i believe you he wasnt sure where he knew you from fox lied glibly thats what got him upset but on the way back to carstairs with some prodding from you maybe a bit hes not going to make the most reliable witness in court not that you think this is going to court youre right pears paused im not even sure thats what you want then what do i want you want the truth known more widely destroying my life and alisons reputation in the process you think im a coldblooded assassin who has been trying to protect his own back when in fact youve been your wifes shining knight thats right alan carter had nothing on you it was alisons name he had his colleague had been put in charge of the vernal suicide that was gavin willis the man whod had a nice little sideline selling guns to you and your kind mi got to him pretty damned sharp and said he had to keep the name of alice watts out of it they told him she was actually a police officer not long out of college and working undercover if theyd bothered to give her an alias that wasnt so bloody similar to her real name pears shook his head the mistake annoying him even now carter found some stuff hidden in williss cottage a little insurance policy of a confession including the name alice watts and the information that shed been an undercover cop as well as vernals lover he put two and two together and tried blackmailing you fox guessed im the one with the money he knew what the tabloids would do with the story nasty little man not the sort that can be reasoned with i thought he was all right when i met him you saw what he wanted you to see he invited you to gallowhill cottage so you could pay him for his silence yes the door was unlocked so you just walked in he was seated at the table a sitting duck as it were you didnt kill the dog though its humans you have trouble with fox paused francis vernal might have been a spurofthemoment thing but alan carter took a bit of preparation first you asked a favour of your friend sheriff cardonald youd checked up on the blackmailer and you knew his history with the nephew with paul carter out you just had to set the scene phoning his mobile a couple of times luring him to the cottage then you went back home and snuggled up next to your wife fox paused how am i doing does it matter im not hearing anything a court would consider damning thats because youre good fox paused again cardonald must have been livid when the prisoner hed just released from custody was suddenly in the frame for murder wont do his reputation any favours cardonald knows his place ive made him a bit of money down the years plus id guess you can be persuasive when the occasion demands it what about the arms dealer in barbados was he proving troublesome too youre not seriously suggesting his name was benchley i know he drowned in his pool and thats just coincidence of course it is fox thought for a second cigarettes and a fiftypound note went awol from vernals car then someone must have taken them maybe one of your own kind inspector pears allowed himself another little halfsmile and signalled on to a new road seems to me youve a destination in mind fox commented maybe i do pears was checking in his mirror again no sign of any headlights behind him his mobile rang and he checked the display without answering chief constable wondering where youve got to fox guessed im beginning to wonder if youre jealous jealous its a normal enough emotion pears said when you see someone with something youve not got and probably cant get its what drove alan carter doesnt matter if its money status or love it can make you a bit crazy pears paused hows your father doing fox glared at him i know your own marriage didnt last long pears continued youve got a sister whos seen some trouble in the past and now your fathers been in hospital hes home though right not at that care home but home with you fox was still staring without looking pears knew it private care costs money he went on a sister with no job can be a bit of a drain then you look at what alison and i have got not that we didnt work hard for it but sometimes theres luck involved too he paused again i know youre not after money but that doesnt mean you cant feel bitterness at others good fortune pears gave fox a good long look how am i doing inspector he asked throwing foxs question back at him the worlds missing one alcoholic womaniser and one blackmailer three cheers for the world i think i know where we are fox said quietly gazing out of the passengerside window where else would we be pears pulled into the layby braking hard there was a churning of gravel he switched off the engine and turned to face fox a walk in the woods he suggested im fine here thanks fox replied but pears had reached beneath him and brought out another handgun a pistol this time kept a few souvenirs of the old days he explained aiming the barrel at foxs chest youre forgetting the witnesses fox stated the surveillance van for one thing as plans go its by no means perfect pears allowed so am i shooting myself in the head or what youre going to hang yourself am i at the scene of your obsession i saw proof enough of it at your house all those papers a computer filled with guesswork francis vernal got beneath your skin add that to your recent problems at work and an ailing parent i decide to end it all fox watched pears nod and what are you doing all this time we drove here together you proposed some crazy theories you directed me to this place thinking it would mean something to me then madness got the better of you and you ran into the woods i left you to it and drove home itll all still come out you and alice vernal and alan carter therell be hearsay pears agreed but i doubt the media will make much of it he paused i have a battery of lawyers at my disposal and i believe injunctions are all the rage trust me precious little will be allowed to emerge why not toss your mobile phone on to the back seat you wont be needing it fox hesitated and pears dug the tip of the gun into his ribs he winced and removed his phone threw it into the gap between the two seats out pears ordered he had opened his own door keeping the pistol pointed at fox fox undid his seat belt and got out of the car the air was cold and clear country air they were next to the small cairn commemorating francis vernals life a patriot it was a silent rural road there would maybe be another car passing in half an hour or so plenty of time for pears to carry out the execution and no witnesses there was a barking in the distance a farm dog or maybe a fox fox wished he was more like his animal namesake swift and lean and nimble cunning though there was always cunning pears had closed the driversside door and come around to foxs side of the maserati he slammed shut the passenger door not often you see an expensive sports car parked here fox speculated sure you dont want to leave it somewhere less visible ill just have to risk it pears responded lets get going no rope fox told him its waiting for us pears waved the gun in the general direction bit more planning than i gave you credit for i read about it a while back a man walked into a forest somewhere he was too old to get the noose over a high branch so he just tied it to a lower one placed his neck in it and leaned all the way forward thats what im going to do is it sounds like id be better off refusing and taking a bullet at least that way youll be in the frame pears shrugged my word against yours except you wont have any words a body could lie out here for years without anyone finding it he gestured towards the forest again lets not think about all that yet though lets just walk fox took a few steps forward until he was within touching distance of the first line of trees something nobody seemed to know he tried to sound beaten resigned to his fate what but you will i suppose intrigued pears repeated his question the actual tree vernals car collided with pears considered for a moment probably that one he answered gesturing with the pistol the moment it was pointed away from him fox made his move grabbing pearss wrist and twisting it pears gasped his fingers splaying involuntarily as the gun dropped to the ground fox scuffed it away with his foot but pears was the stronger of the two he got in a few heavy blows as fox wrestled with him it took fox only a few seconds to realise he was not going to win this fight not at close quarters he couldnt see the gun so he gave pears a shove backwards and ran for it pears didnt follow not straight away which gave fox a bit of time to dart between the trees he was a good twenty or thirty feet away the gloom working to his advantage when a bullet shattered some bark inches from his left shoulder a splinter penetrated his cheek stinging like hell he left it where it was and kept weaving as best he could he didnt know how deep the woods were how soon would it be till he reached open ground where hed be an easy target there was a halfmoon in the sky above obscured by a thin layer of shifting cloud enough light to see by more than enough for stephen pears a bullet lodged in a tree evidence waiting to be found but would anyone find it though times had changed the police could still be sloppy he patted his pockets if he started to discard credit cards and the like he would be leaving a trail for pears as much as for any investigators another bullet zinged past him and thumped into bark pears was heavyset probably didnt get much use of the gym at the house did fox have half a chance of outpacing him didnt matter it was the bullets he had to outpace and that wasnt going to happen outmanoeuvre him then but how the road was his best chance it would depend on an elusive passing car but his run of luck could change for the better couldnt it another option double back to the maserati pears hadnt locked it but fox couldnt remember if hed left the key his phone was on the back seat so was the little recorder hed borrowed from joe naysmith hed thrown it there along with the battery pack having switched it on first everything said in the car would he hoped be on it and audible but only useful to him if pears didnt find it another shot another miss would a farmer maybe hear a poacher sweat was running down foxs back he could remove his jacket but it was darker than his shirt and he didnt want to give his pursuer a more inviting target his chest was hurting he remembered the stitch when hed run across the forth road bridge stitch or not this time he had to keep moving the fourth shot however found its target he felt the impact against his left shoulder it went in and out again numbing him for a moment his legs almost buckled but he wouldnt let them a burning sensation and then pain shooting down his arm all the way to his fingertips he gritted his teeth knew he couldnt stop not even for a second warm blood oozing and running he gripped his left hand in his right cradling it against his chest and ran risked a glance behind him but could see no sign of pears he realised he was being stalked pears wasnt panicking he was being his usual methodical self he was watching listening and calculating he was wearing his quarry down let fox run in circles then pick him off fox cursed his own stupidity and kept moving images flashed into his mind mitch and jude imogen vernal and charles mangold mangold getting him into this in the first place no who was he kidding he only had himself to blame paul and alan carter scholes and haldane and michaelson evelyn mills and fiona mcfadzean players in the drama of his life and death alice watts morphing into alison watson hawkeye hiding behind the eyes of stephen pears dci jackson caretaker of state secrets chris fox and back to mitch and jude again they swirled around him as he headed up a noticeable incline moss and leaves mulched beneath him every breath he drew into his tired lungs tasted of loam fox the yelp from pears told fox that the man was maybe thirty or forty yards away it also hinted at irritation and this gave him a glimmer of hope he tried to smile but couldnt he licked his lips instead his saliva as sticky as wallpaper paste and he ran fox keep shouting pal means i know where you are every movement he made sent another jolt of pain through his shoulder blood was dripping on to his trousers and shoes thinking about it made him nauseous he swallowed hard tasting iron and bile emerging into a small clearing he paused for only a moment to stare at the noose hanging from a tree branch almost exactly in line with his eyes one end wrapped around the trunk and knotted fast move malcolm a steeper bank a single line of trees and then a gap he knew it had to be the road he was forced to claw at the ground with his right hand as he climbed when he stood up again he was inches from the tarmac he looked to left and right the boot of the maserati was just visible the rest of the vehicle hidden around the curve of the road fox headed in the other direction he was out in the open now couldnt hear any traffic or spot headlights in the distance his eyes stung and he wiped the perspiration from them he could always dive into the woods on the opposite side of the road safer there but more isolated too wait the sky was brightening he could make out the treeline silhouetted against the night and now he could hear the faint roar of an engine he remembered the local boy racers their names scored into the memorial cairn would they stop for him were their brakes equal to their reaction time it would be so bloody typical escape a gunman just to be mown down by a spotty teen in a supertuned cosworth the roar was definitely getting louder he was on a nice straight stretch he started to remove his jacket the lighter shirt might now be an advantage fox fox turned pears looked mightily pissed off the pistol hung at his side as he emerged from the trees seemed to fox that he had tripped and fallen a definite limp clothes and face smeared with dirt he took a few deep breaths straightened up and started to raise the gun fox was barely thirty feet away but the car was approaching fox was waving with his working arm pears was aiming at him as the car came into view headlights flashing from full beam to dipped and back again horn blaring a small car with a big engine fox was trying to shield his eyes a halfglance back told him pears was doing the same the car skidded to a stop ending up sideon to the direction of travel the passengerside door flew open you trying to get yourself killed pal just a kid maybe not sixteen yet bass booming from inside the car the driver leaving the engine idling as he too emerged another car arriving behind him more kids getting out more thumping music fox was staring at pears the gun was no longer visible hidden behind him he was making to retreat backing away is that blood someone was asking fox you crashed your motor or something pears was no longer visible fox asked the passenger if he could borrow his phone aye sure but foxs hand was shaking too hard his fingers slippery with blood so he recited the number instead the teenager punching it in and holding the phone towards his ear as he started to talk to tony kaye the mondeo turned up a couple of minutes after the armed response unit fox had given the four officers the lowdown type of weapon rounds already fired direction taken by assailant the teenagers had stuck around slightly nervous that there might be some hidden agenda despite foxs assurances they leaned against their cars smoking cigarettes and staring at the weaponry when one tried to take a photo a wagged finger was enough to deter him tony kaye was first out of the mondeo followed by joe naysmith the last of the armed officers was disappearing into the woods as they walked towards fox does it hurt naysmith asked nodding towards the wound like blazes fox informed him called an ambulance yet fox shook his head youve lost a bit of blood its a graze kaye stated giving foxs shoulder a cursory glance think we should see what theyre up to he gestured towards the woods after a moments hesitation fox nodded his agreement you lot stay here he ordered the teenagers and no phones or texting got that it was quiet in the woods no voices no gunfire just the crackling of twigs underfoot you got here quick fox said maniac at the wheel naysmith responded what did he have in mind for you kaye asked pushing his way past the encroaching branches suicide by hanging kaye shook his head i thought this guy was supposed to be a pro hes got away with it in the past overconfidence naysmith guessed then what if we get to him before the aru theres three of us kaye growled mood im in shooter or no shooter hes getting a doing you sure youre all right naysmith asked noticing that fox was faltering just a bit dizzy naysmith steadied him ill be fine joe honest fox wiped sweat from his face with his unbloodied sleeve when kaye looked to fox for guidance on the direction they should be taking fox started to shrug with his one good shoulder but then stopped as a yell rang out sounded like the aru giving due warning maybe that way he suggested the three men pushed on at a brisker pace more voices ahead of them but appearing to be in movement it felt to fox as though he were retracing his steps almost exactly part of his brain was telling him to stop but he kept going the sweat pouring from him they all heard the car engine when it kicked into life a low growl turning into a roar maserati naysmith guessed sure enough the armed response unit stood with pistols trained on the cars windscreen not that this was enough to dissuade the figure in the driving seat the maserati skidded backwards on to the road spun and started to speed away its headlights switched off back to the patrol car one of the aru men barked to his colleagues ronnie call it in what do you reckon kaye was asking fox mondeo might be up to the job malcolm needs patching up naysmith warned kaye ignored him awaiting foxs decision then came the sound of squealing tyres followed by the thump of impact the victoria hospital again fox didnt doubt that the reporter brian jamieson would be on the prowl somewhere in the vicinity foxs wound had been cleaned and stitched painkillers were swooshing around inside him and he had a prescription for more in his pocket his shoulder was strapped and there was a dull ache if he tried moving his left hand his jacket and shirt had been bagged as evidence forensics would head to the scene once it was light seeking out bullet casings and the pistol and the noose no weapon had been found in the car pears must have tossed it fox was standing in the injured mans room right now his was the only bed in there one of the medics had listed his injuries a couple of broken ribs two damaged knees and facial bruising why you should wear a seat belt the medic had stated a wire cage beneath the bedclothes was keeping pressure off the patients legs he had opened his eyes when fox stepped into the room there was a police officer on duty outside he had noted foxs name and taken a good look at his warrant card fox didnt blame him the borrowed hooded top and baggy jogging bottoms were hardly standard issue for a cop i think hes asleep the officer had said but stephen pears was awake for fox well find the gun fox told him and what will that prove that i was so scared of you i felt the need of it scared of me were you you and your outlandish theories pears tried to clear his throat his mouth parched he looked at the water jug next to his bed but fox wasnt about to oblige you dont seriously think thats going to work he asked instead youd just accused me of murder pears went on youd told me to drive to the spot where francis vernal died i panicked thinking you had a similar fate in mind for me he was staring hard at fox and thats all youve got to play with its all youre going to get from me fox watched as pears slowly turned his head away from him there was just the tiniest gasp of pain as he did so fox bided his time knowing another visitor would be arriving soon on cue the door behind him flew open alison pears ignored fox and strode towards the bed stephen she leaned over her husband planting a hard kiss on his cheek what in gods name happened can you believe they left me here alone with that madman pears replied she straightened up and turned towards fox your husband had plans to kill me fox informed her same as francis vernal and alan carter when a noose wouldnt do the job he tried using a gun instead get out she commanded fox shook his head slowly alison pearss eyes narrowed thats an order inspector fox held her stare im wondering how long youve known you do know dont you know what that you married hawkeye did you work it out before the wedding or after im not entirely sure the pair of you have ever talked about it ancient history after all you were both other people no need to dredge up the past happy healthy wealthy and going places im telling you to leave her voice was almost a snarl both rows of teeth bared so you can start to get your stories straight fox surmised cant have this huge talented edifice crumble is that your thinking i told you hes insane stephen pears complained the mans completely obsessed yes id say so his wife agreed her voice dropping a little obsessed and paranoid seeing conspiracies everywhere everywhere her husband echoed silence descended on the room fox stood his ground then nodded slowly youre going to fight this he asked whatever it takes alison pears replied fox nodded again and reached into his pocket removing the little digital recorder and pressing the play button the speaker was tiny but with the volume all the way up the conversation was clear enough so youre going to tell me why you killed francis vernal you have to go back further you have to understand how things were fox fastforwarded a little and hit play again okay so i took the money it was alice watts you were interested in his eyes fixed on those of alison pears he moved the recording forward a little further alan carter had nothing on you it was alisons name he had and forward again nasty little man not the sort that can be reasoned with fox switched the machine off and held it between thumb and forefinger alison pears seemed frozen for a moment then inhaled and exhaled before turning towards the bed youre a fool stephen and its beginning to look like you always were pears had squeezed shut his eyes as if every word was a fresh affliction she loomed over him hands gripping the metal siderail as she started to get her breathing back under control blood had risen to her cheeks and she rubbed her fingers down them as if to erase the colouring she ran her tongue across her lips and faced fox again i knew nothing about any of this she declared its all come as a complete and utter shock she straightened her jacket and brushed a few stray strands of hair back into place fox was reminded of the transformation that had taken place in her study when shed answered her telephone the pair of you are well matched he commented hard to know which one is the colder actually he gave a twitch of the mouth maintaining eye contact with alison pears fine then youll tell your story and ill tell mine whichever way it works out youve ended up married to a killer and i doubt thatll sit too well with the position of chief constable im guessing it might even be a matter for the complaints the recorder was back in his pocket he used his good hand to open the door the officer on duty was trying not to look too interested in the commotion hed just heard as fox stepped into the corridor he turned his head towards stephen pears but pearss eyes were still closed so fox let the door swing shut leaving him to his fate fourteen it wasnt much of a homecoming foxs father was asleep on the bed in the living room jude hadnt got round to tidying the place plates and mugs needed taking to the kitchen magazines put into a bag for recycling she gave him a peck on the cheek and said it was good to see him how long will you be off work she asked ill be able to look after dad if thats what youre asking it wasnt she said not meeting his eyes his legs were stiff from all that running and there was still a residual burning sensation in his lungs every few minutes he seemed to relive part of it but to everyone who asked him how he was he gave the same answer im fine he had so far avoided seeing any tv coverage there had been phone messages from evelyn mills fiona mcfadzean and charles mangold he had listened to them but not replied the same went for texts what was he supposed to say to any of them he felt bad about ignoring evelyn mills in particular but didnt know what else to do too many relationships had gone sour around him he didnt want to add any more fuel to the general misery jude made him tea while he sat on the sofa watching his father the chest rose and fell the mouth was slightly open mitchs hair needed washing and the room smelled faintly of talcum powder anything been happening he asked jude as she handed him his mug a lot of phone calls but thats about it and one of the neighbours came to the door to ask after you some old boy from across the street mr anderson fox informed her she nodded without really taking the information in anyway she said im glad youre here because i need to nip out for some ciggies ten a day still am i about to get a lecture fox shook his head on you go he told her she wasted no time fetching her coat then asked him if he wanted anything he shook his head again when she hesitated he knew she needed money so dug a twenty out of his pocket thanks she said sure you dont want tomato juice or something no the door closed after her leaving fox alone with his father he cleared some odds and ends from the chair next to the bed and sat down taking mitchs hand in his the eyelids fluttered and the breathing changed but he didnt wake up fox removed the photo from his pocket the one showing chris as he cheered on francis vernal he wrote both their names on the back and added it to the shoebox he spotted a halfbottle of whisky on the mantelpiece and another halfbottle of vodka next to it the vodka judes drink of choice was almost empty the whisky almost full fox stared at both bottles then got up and walked towards them he unscrewed the cap from the whisky and put his nose to the open neck inhaling and exhaling he knew it would be so easy to tip a measure into his mouth savouring before swallowing but instead he walked back to the bed and dipped a finger into the liquid dabbing his fathers lips with it the eyelids fluttered again thats some bedside manner youve got mitch fox said opening his eyes and smiling at his son now pour me a proper one will you fox didnt argue he fetched a couple of clean glasses filling one with tap water for himself none of that for me mind his father cautioned fox poured an inch of whisky into the tumbler and handed it over his father managed to sit up unaided and raised the drink in a toast heres tae us he said whas like us gey few fox recited lifting his own glass and theyre a deid he watched as his father sipped the whisky i can be a detective when i want to be he said quietly just so you know cant be that good at it or you wouldnt have a bullet hole in you mitch held out the empty glass his eyes demanding a refill judell kill me if i get you drunk then you wont have died in vain true enough i suppose so fox twisted the cap from the whisky bottle and poured again
