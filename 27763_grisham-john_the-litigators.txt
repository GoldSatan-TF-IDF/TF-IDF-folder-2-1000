the litigators john grisham chapter the law firm of finley amp figg referred to itself as a boutique firm this misnomer was inserted as often as possible into routine conversations and it even appeared in print in some of the various schemes hatched by the partners to solicit business when used properly it implied that finley amp figg was something above your average twobit operation boutique as in small gifted and expert in one specialized area boutique as in pretty cool and chic right down to the frenchness of the word itself boutique as in thoroughly happy to be small selective and prosperous except for its size it was none of these things finley amp figgs scam was hustling injury cases a daily grind that required little skill or creativity and would never be considered cool or sexy profits were as elusive as status the firm was small because it couldnt afford to grow it was selective only because no one wanted to work there including the two men who owned it even its location suggested a monotonous life out in the bush leagues with a vietnamese massage parlor to its left and a lawn mower repair shop to its right it was clear at a casual glance that finley amp figg was not prospering there was another boutique firm directly across the streethated rivalsand more lawyers around the corner in fact the neighborhood was teeming with lawyers some working alone others in small firms others still in versions of their own little boutiques f ampfs address was on preston avenue a busy street filled with old bungalows now converted and used for all manner of commercial activity there was retail liquor cleaners massages and professional legal dental lawn mower repair and culinary enchiladas baklava and pizza to go oscar finley had won the building in a lawsuit twenty years earlier what the address lacked in prestige it sort of made up for in location two doors away was the intersection of preston beech and thirtyeighth a chaotic convergence of asphalt and traffic that guaranteed at least one good car wreck a week and often more f ampfs annual overhead was covered by collisions that happened less than one hundred yards away other law firms boutique and otherwise were often prowling the area in hopes of finding an available cheap bungalow from which their hungry lawyers could hear the actual squeal of tires and crunching of metal with only two attorneyspartners it was of course mandatory that one be declared the senior and the other the junior the senior partner was oscar finley age sixtytwo a thirtyyear survivor of the bareknuckle brand of law found on the tough streets of southwest chicago oscar had once been a beat cop but got himself terminated for cracking skulls he almost went to jail but instead had an awakening and went to college then law school when no firms would hire him he hung out his own little shingle and started suing anyone who came near thirtytwo years later he found it hard to believe that for thirtytwo years hed wasted his career suing for pastdue accounts receivable fender benders slipandfalls and quickie divorces he was still married to his first wife a terrifying woman he wanted to sue every day for his own divorce but he couldnt afford it after thirtytwo years of lawyering oscar finley couldnt afford much of anything his junior partnerand oscar was prone to say things like ill get my junior partner to handle it when trying to impress judges and other lawyers and especially prospective clientswas wally figg age fortyfive wally fancied himself a hardball litigator and his blustery ads promised all kinds of aggressive behavior we fight for your rights and insurance companies fear us and we mean business such ads could be seen on park benches city transit buses cabs high school football programs even telephone poles though this violated several ordinances the ads were not seen in two crucial marketstelevision and billboards wally and oscar were still fighting over these oscar refused to spend the moneyboth types were horribly expensiveand wally was still scheming his dream was to see his smiling face and slick head on television saying dreadful things about insurance companies while promising huge settlements to injured folks wise enough to call his tollfree number but oscar wouldnt even pay for a billboard wally had one picked out six blocks from the office at the corner of beech and thirtysecond high above the swarming traffic on top of a fourstory tenement house there was the most perfect billboard in all of metropolitan chicago currently hawking cheap lingerie with a comely ad wally had to admit the billboard had his name and face written all over it but oscar still refused wallys law degree came from the prestigious university of chicago school of law oscar picked his up at a nowdefunct place that once offered courses at night both took the bar exam three times wally had four divorces under his belt oscar could only dream wally wanted the big case the big score with millions of dollars in fees oscar wanted only two thingsdivorce and retirement how the two men came to be partners in a converted house on preston avenue was another story how they survived without choking each other was a daily mystery t heir referee was rochelle gibson a robust black woman with attitude and savvy earned on the streets from which she came ms gibson handled the frontthe phone the reception the prospective clients arriving with hope and the disgruntled ones leaving in anger the occasional typing though her bosses had learned if they needed something typed it was far simpler to do it themselves the firm dog and most important the constant bickering between oscar and wally years earlier ms gibson had been injured in a car wreck that was not her fault she then compounded her troubles by hiring the law firm of finley amp figg though not by choice twentyfour hours after the crash bombed on percocet and laden with splints and plaster casts ms gibson had awakened to the grinning fleshy face of attorney wallis figg hovering over her hospital bed he was wearing a set of aquamarine scrubs had a stethoscope around his neck and was doing a good job of impersonating a physician wally tricked her into signing a contract for legal representation promised her the moon sneaked out of the room as quietly as hed sneaked in then proceeded to butcher her case she netted which her husband drank and gambled away in a matter of weeks which led to a divorce action filed by oscar finley he also handled her bankruptcy ms gibson was not impressed with either lawyer and threatened to sue both for malpractice this got their attentionthey had been hit with similar lawsuitsand they worked hard to placate her as her troubles multiplied she became a fixture at the office and with time the three became comfortable with one another finley amp figg was a tough place for secretaries the pay was low the clients were generally unpleasant the other lawyers on the phone were rude the hours were long but the worst part was dealing with the two partners oscar and wally had tried the mature route but the older gals couldnt handle the pressure they had tried youth but got themselves sued for sexual harassment when wally couldnt keep his paws off a busty young thing they settled out of court for and got their names in the newspaper rochelle gibson happened to be at the office one morning when the thencurrent secretary quit and stormed out with the phone ringing and partners yelling ms gibson moved over to the front desk and calmed things down then she made a pot of coffee she was back the next day and the next eight years later she was still running the place her two sons were in prison wally had been their lawyer though in all fairness no one could have saved them as teenagers both boys kept wally busy with their string of arrests on various drug charges their dealing got more involved and wally warned them repeatedly they were headed for prison or death he said the same to ms gibson who had little control over the boys and often prayed for prison when their crack ring got busted they were sent away for ten years wally got it reduced from twenty and received no gratitude from the boys ms gibson offered a tearful thanks through all their troubles wally never charged her a fee for his representation over the years there had been many tears in ms gibsons life and they had often been shed in wallys office with the door locked he gave advice and tried to help when possible but his greatest role was that of a listener and with wallys sloppy life the tables could be turned quickly when his last two marriages blew up ms gibson heard it all and offered encouragement when his drinking picked up she saw it clearly and was not afraid to confront him though they fought daily their quarrels were always temporary and often contrived as a means of protecting turf there were times at finley amp figg when all three were snarling or sulking and money was usually the cause the market was simply overcrowded there were too many lawyers loose on the streets the last thing the firm needed was another one chapter david zinc made it off the l train at the quincy station in downtown chicago and he managed to shuffle down the steps that led to wells street but something was going wrong with his feet they were getting heavier and heavier his steps slower and slower he stopped at the corner of wells and adams and actually looked at his shoes for a clue nothing just the same standard black leather laceups worn by every male lawyer in the firm and a couple of the females as well his breathing was labored and in spite of the chill he felt moisture in his armpits he was thirtyone years old certainly too young for a heart attack and though hed been exhausted for the past five years he had learned to live with his fatigue or so he thought he turned a corner and looked at the trust tower a glistening phallic monument jutting one thousand feet upward into the clouds and fog as he paused and looked up his heart rate quickened and he felt nauseous bodies touched him as they jostled by he crossed adams in a pack and plodded on the atrium of the trust tower was tall and open with plenty of marble and glass and incomprehensible sculpture designed to inspire and provide warmth when in reality it seemed cold and forbidding at least to david six escalators crisscrossed each other and hauled hordes of weary warriors up to their cubicles and offices david tried but his feet would not carry him to an escalator instead he sat on a leather bench beside a pile of large painted rocks and tried to understand what was happening to him people rushed by grimfaced holloweyed stressedout already and it was only on this gloomy morning a snap is certainly not a medical term experts use fancier language to describe the instant when a troubled person steps over the edge nonetheless a snap is a real moment it can happen in a split second the result of a terribly traumatic event or it can be the final straw the sad culmination of pressure that builds and builds until the mind and body must find a release david zincs snap was of the latter variety after five years of savage labor with colleagues he loathed something happened to david that morning as he sat by the painted rocks and watched the welldressed zombies ride upward to yet another day of useless labor he snapped hey dave you going up someone was saying it was al from antitrust david managed to smile and nod and mumble then he stood and followed al for some reason al was a step ahead as they got onto an escalator and he was talking about last nights blackhawks game david kept nodding as they rose through the atrium below him and following behind were dozens of lonely figures in dark overcoats other young lawyers rising quiet and somber much like pallbearers at a winter funeral david and al joined a group at a wall of elevators on the first level as they waited david listened to the hockey talk but his head was spinning and he was nauseous again they rushed onto an elevator and stood shoulder to shoulder with too many others silence al was quiet no one spoke no one made eye contact david said to himself this is itmy last ride in this elevator i swear the elevator rocked and hummed then stopped at the eightieth floor rogan rothberg territory three lawyers got off three faces david had seen before but didnt know by name which was not unusual because the firm had six hundred lawyers on floors seventy through one hundred two more dark suits got off at eightyfour as they continued to rise david began to sweat then to hyperventilate his tiny office was on the ninetythird floor and the closer he got the more violently his heart pumped more somber exits on ninety and ninetyone and with each stop david felt weaker and weaker only three were left at ninetythreedavid al and a large woman who was called lurch behind her back the elevator stopped a bell chimed pleasantly the door opened silently and lurch stepped off al stepped off david refused to move in fact he couldnt move seconds passed al looked over his shoulder and said hey david this is us come on no response from david just the blank hollow gaze of someone in another world the door began to close and al jammed his briefcase in the opening david you okay al asked sure david mumbled as he managed to move forward the door slid open the bell chimed again he was out of the elevator looking around nervously as if hed never before seen the place in fact hed left it only ten hours earlier you look pale al said davids head was spinning he heard als voice but didnt comprehend what he was saying lurch was a few feet away staring puzzled as if watching a car wreck the elevator pinged again a different sound and the door began to close al said something else even reached out a hand as if to help suddenly david spun and his leaden feet came to life he bolted for the elevator and made a diving reentry just as the door slammed shut the last thing he heard from the outside was als panicked voice when the elevator began its descent david zinc started to laugh the spinning and nausea were gone the pressure on his chest vanished he was doing it he was leaving the sweatshop of rogan rothberg and saying farewell to a nightmare he david zinc of all the thousands of miserable associates and junior partners in the tall buildings of downtown chicago he and he alone had found the spine to walk away that gloomy morning he sat on the floor in the empty elevator watching with a wide grin as the floor numbers zipped downward in bright red digital numbers and he fought to control his thoughts the people his wife a neglected woman who wanted to get pregnant but found it difficult because her husband was too tired for sex his father a prominent judge who had basically forced him to go to law school and not just anywhere but harvard law school because thats where the judge had gone his grandfather the family tyrant whod built a mega firm from scratch in kansas city and still put in ten hours a day at the age of eightytwo and roy barton his supervising partner his boss a prickish crank who yelled and cursed throughout the day and was perhaps the most miserable person david zinc had ever met when he thought of roy barton he laughed again the elevator stopped at the eightieth floor and two secretaries started to enter they paused momentarily when confronted with david sitting in a corner briefcase at his side carefully they stepped over his legs and waited for the door to close are you okay one asked fine david answered and you there was no response the secretaries stood rigid and quiet during the brief descent and hustled off at seventyseven when david was alone again he was suddenly worried what if they came after him al would no doubt go straight to roy barton and report that zinc had cracked up what would barton do there was a huge meeting at ten with an angry client a bigshot ceo in fact as david would think about things later the showdown was probably the tipping point that finally caused the snap roy barton was not only an abrasive prick but also a coward he needed david zinc and others to hide behind when the ceo marched in with a long list of valid complaints roy might send security after him security was the usual contingent of aging uniformed door guards but it was also an inhouse spy ring that changed locks videoed everything moved in the shadows and engaged in all manner of covert activities designed to keep the lawyers in line david jumped to his feet picked up his briefcase and stared impatiently at the digital numbers blinking by the elevator rocked gently as it fell through the center of the trust tower when it stopped david got off and darted to the escalators which were still packed with sad folks moving silently upward the descending escalators were unclogged and david ran down one someone called out hey dave where are you going david smiled and waved in the general direction of the voice as if everything was under control he strode past the painted rocks and bizarre sculpture and he eased his way through a glass door he was outside and the air that had seemed so wet and dreary moments earlier now held the promise of a new beginning he took a deep breath and looked around gotta keep moving he began walking down lasalle street quickly afraid to look over his shoulder dont look suspicious be calm this is now one of the most important days of your life he told himself so dont blow it he couldnt go home because he was not ready for that confrontation he couldnt walk the streets because he would bump into someone he knew where could he hide for a while think about things clear his head make a plan he checked his watch the perfect time for breakfast down an alley he saw the redandgreen flashing neon sign of abners and as he grew closer he couldnt tell if it was a cafe or a bar at the door he glanced over his shoulder made sure security was nowhere in sight and entered the warm dark world of abners it was a bar the booths along the right were empty the chairs were sitting upside down on the tables waiting for someone to clean the floor abner was behind the long wellpolished wooden counter with a smirk on his face as if to ask what are you doing here are you open david asked was the door locked abner shot back he wore a white apron and was drying a beer mug he had thick hairy forearms and in spite of his gruff manner he had the trusting face of a veteran bartender whod heard it all before i guess not david walked slowly to the bar glanced to his right and at the far end saw a man whod apparently passed out still holding a drink david removed his charcoalgray overcoat and hung it on the back of a stool he took a seat looked at the rows of liquor bottles aligned in front of him took in the mirrors and beer taps and dozens of glasses abner had arranged perfectly and when he was settled he said what do you recommend before eight oclock abner looked at the man with his head on the counter and said how about coffee ive already had that do you serve breakfast yep its called a bloody mary ill take one r ochelle gibson lived in a subsidized apartment with her mother one of her daughters two of her grandchildren varying combinations of nieces and nephews and even an occasional cousin in need of shelter to escape the chaos she often fled to her workplace though at times it was worse than home she arrived at the office each day around unlocked the place fetched both newspapers from the porch turned on the lights adjusted the thermostat made the coffee and checked on ac the firm dog she hummed and sometimes sang softly as she went about her routine though she would never admit it to either of her bosses she was quite proud to be a legal secretary even in a place like finley amp figg when asked her job or profession she was always quick to state legal secretary never just a gardenvariety secretary but a legal one what she lacked in formal training she made up for in experience eight years in the middle of a busy street practice had taught her a lot of law and even more about lawyers ac was a mutt who lived at the office because no one there was willing to take him home he belonged to the threerochelle oscar and wallyin equal shares though virtually all of the responsibilities of his care fell upon rochelle he was a runaway whod chosen f ampf as his home several years earlier throughout the day he slept on a small bed near rochelle and throughout the night he roamed the office guarding the place he was a passable watchdog whose bark had chased away burglars vandals and even several disgruntled clients rochelle fed him and filled his water bowl from the small fridge in the kitchen she removed a container of strawberry yogurt when the coffee was ready she poured herself a cup and arranged things just so on her desk which she kept in immaculate order it was glass and chrome sturdy and impressive the first thing clients saw when they walked through the front door oscars office was somewhat tidy wallys was a landfill they could hide their business behind closed doors but rochelles was in plain view she opened the suntimes and started with the front page she read slowly sipping her coffee eating her yogurt humming softly while ac snored behind her rochelle treasured these few quiet moments of the early morning before long the phone would start the lawyers would appear and then if they were lucky clients would arrive some with appointments others without to get away from his wife oscar finley left home each morning at seven but he seldom got to the office before nine for two hours he moved around the city stopping by a police station where a cousin handled accident reports dropping in to say hello to tow truck drivers and catch the latest gossip on the most recent car wrecks drinking coffee with a man who owned two lowend funeral parlors taking doughnuts to a fire station and chatting with the ambulance drivers and occasionally making his rounds at his favorite hospitals where he walked the busy halls casting a trained eye for those injured by the negligence of others oscar arrived at nine with wally whose life was far less organized one never knew he could blow in at fueled by caffeine and red bull and ready to sue anyone who crossed him or he could drag in at puffy eyed hungover and soon hiding in his office o n this momentous day however wally arrived a few minutes before eight with a big smile and clear eyes good morning ms gibson he said with conviction good morning mr figg she responded in similar fashion at finley amp figg the atmosphere was always tense with a fight just one comment away words were chosen carefully and received with scrutiny the mundane early morning salutes were cautiously handled because they could be a setup for an attack even the use of mr and ms was contrived and loaded with history back when rochelle had been only a client wally had made the mistake of referring to her as a girl it had been something like look girl im doing the best i can here he certainly meant no harm by it and her overreaction was uncalled for but from that moment on she insisted on being addressed as ms gibson she was slightly irritated because her solitude was interrupted wally spoke to ac and rubbed his head and as he headed for the coffee he asked anything in the paper no she said not wanting to discuss the news no surprise there he said the first shot of the day she read the suntimes he read the tribune each considered the others taste in news to be rather low the second shot came moments later when wally reappeared who made the coffee he asked she ignored this its a bit weak dont you think she slowly turned a page then had some yogurt wally sipped loudly smacked his lips frowned as though swallowing vinegar then picked up his newspaper and took a seat at the table before oscar won the building in a lawsuit someone had knocked out several of the walls downstairs near the front and created an open lobby area rochelle had her space on one side near the door and a few feet away there were chairs for waiting clients and a long table that was once used somewhere for dining purposes over the years the table had become the place where newspapers were read coffee consumed even depositions taken wally liked to kill time there because his office was such a pigsty he flung open his tribune with as much noise as possible rochelle ignored him and hummed away a few minutes passed and the phone rang ms gibson seemed not to hear it it rang again after the third ring wally lowered his newspaper and said you wanna get that ms gibson no she answered shortly it rang a fourth time and why not he demanded she ignored him after the fifth ring wally threw down his newspaper jumped to his feet and headed for a phone on the wall near the copier i wouldnt get that if i were you ms gibson said he stopped and why not its a bill collector how do you know wally stared at the phone caller id revealed name unknown i just do he calls this time every week the phone went silent and wally returned to the table and his newspaper he hid behind it wondering which bill had not been paid which supplier was irritated enough to call a law office and put the squeeze on lawyers rochelle knew of course because she kept the books and knew almost everything but he preferred not to ask her if he did then they would soon be bickering over the bills and unpaid fees and lack of money in general and this could easily spiral down into a heated discussion about overall strategies of the firm its future and the shortcomings of its partners neither wanted this a bner took great pride in his bloody marys he used precise amounts of tomato juice vodka horseradish lemon lime worcestershire sauce pepper tabasco and salt he always added two green olives then finished it with a stalk of celery it had been a long time since david had enjoyed such a fine breakfast after two of abners creations consumed rapidly he was grinning goofily and proud of his decision to chuck it all the drunk at the end of the bar was snoring there were no other customers abner was a man about his business washing and drying cocktail glasses taking inventory of his booze and fiddling with the beer taps while offering commentary on a wide variety of subjects davids phone finally rang it was his secretary lana oh boy he said who is it abner asked the office a mans entitled to breakfast isnt he david grinned again and said hello lana said david where are you its eight thirty i have a watch dear im having breakfast are you okay words out that you were last seen diving back into an elevator just a rumor dear just a rumor good what time will you be in roy barton has already called let me finish breakfast okay sure just keep in touch david put down his phone sucked hard on the straw then announced ill have another abner frowned and said you might want to pace yourself i am pacing myself okay abner pulled down a clean glass and started mixing i take it youre not going to the office today i am not i quit im walking away what type of office law rogan rothberg you know the outfit heard of it big firm right six hundred lawyers here in the chicago office couple of thousand around the world currently in third place when it comes to size fifth place in hours billed per lawyer fourth place when looking at net profits per partner second place when comparing associates salaries and without question first place when counting assholes per square foot sorry i asked david picked up his phone and asked you see this phone you think im blind this thing has ruled my life for the past five years cant go anywhere without it firm policy it stays with me at all times its interrupted nice dinners in restaurants its dragged me out of the shower its woken me up at all hours of the night on one occasion its interrupted sex with my poor neglected wife i was at a cubs game last summer great seats me and two buddies from college top of the second inning and this thing starts vibrating it was roy barton have i told you about roy barton not yet my supervising partner a pernicious little bastard forty years old warped ego gods gift to the legal profession makes a million bucks a year but hell never make enough works fifteen hours a day seven days a week because at rogan rothberg all big men work nonstop and roy fancies himself a really big man nice guy huh i hate him i hope i never see his face again abner slid the third bloody mary across the counter and said looks like youre on the right track pal cheers chapter the phone rang again and rochelle decided to answer it the law firm of finley amp figg she said professionally wally did not look up from his newspaper she listened for a moment then said im sorry but we do not handle real estate transactions when rochelle assumed her position eight years earlier the firm did in fact handle real estate transactions however she soon realized this type of work paid little and relied heavily upon the secretary with almost no effort from the lawyers a quick study she decided she disliked real estate because she controlled the phone she screened all calls and the real estate section of finley amp figg dried up oscar was outraged and threatened to fire her but backed down when she mentioned again that she might sue them for legal malpractice wally brokered a truce but for weeks things were more tense than usual other specialties had been cast aside under her diligent screening criminal work was history rochelle didnt like it because she didnt like the clients duis were okay because there were so many of them they paid well and they required almost no involvement on her part bankruptcy bit the dust for the same reason that real estate hadpaltry fees and too much work for the secretary over the years rochelle had managed to streamline the firms practice and this was still causing problems oscars theory one that had kept him broke for over thirty years was the firm should take everything that walked in the door cast a wide net then pick through the debris in the hope of finding a good injury case wally disagreed he wanted the big kill though he was forced by the overhead to perform all sorts of mundane legal tasks he was always dreaming of ways to strike gold nice work he said when she hung up i never liked real estate she ignored this and returned to her newspaper ac began a low growl when they looked at him he was standing on his small bed nose tilted upward tail straight and pointing eyes narrow with concentration his growl grew louder then on cue the distant sound of an ambulance entered their solemn morning sirens never failed to excite wally and for a second or two he froze as he skillfully analyzed it police fire or ambulance that was always the first issue and wally could distinguish the three in a heartbeat sirens from fire trucks and police cars meant nothing and were quickly ignored but a siren from an ambulance always quickened his pulse ambulance he said then placed his newspaper on the table stood and casually walked to the front door rochelle also stood and walked to a window where she opened the blinds for a quick look ac was still growling and when wally opened the door and stepped onto the front porch the dog followed across the street vince gholston exited his own little boutique and cast a hopeful look at the intersection of beech and thirtyeighth when he saw wally he flipped him the bird and wally quickly returned the greeting the ambulance came screaming down beech weaving and lurching its way through heavy traffic honking angrily causing more havoc and danger than whatever awaited it wally watched it until it was out of sight then went inside the newspaper reading continued with no further interruptionsno sirens no phone calls from prospective clients or bill collectors at am the door opened and the senior partner entered as usual oscar wore a long dark overcoat and carried a bulky black leather briefcase as if hed been laboring away throughout the night he also carried his umbrella as always regardless of the weather or forecast oscar toiled far away from the big leagues but he could at least look the part of a distinguished lawyer dark coats dark suits white shirts and silk ties his wife did the shopping and insisted that he look the part wally on the other hand wore whatever he could pull from the pile morning oscar said gruffly at ms gibsons desk good morning she replied anything in the newspaper oscar was not interested in scores or floods or market reports or the latest from the middle east a forklift operator got crushed in a plant out in palos heights ms gibson responded promptly it was part of their morning ritual if she did not find an accident of some variety to brighten his morning then his sour mood would only get worse i like it he said is he dead not yet even better lots of pain and suffering make a note ill check it out later ms gibson nodded as if the poor man were practically signed up as a new client of course he was not nor would he be finley amp figg rarely got to the accident scene first chances were the forklift operators wife was already being hounded by more aggressive lawyers some of whom were known to offer cash and other goodies to get the family on board buoyed by this good news oscar walked over to the table and said good morning morning oscar wally said any of our clients make the obituaries i havent got that far yet you should start with the obituaries thank you oscar any more tips on how to read a newspaper oscar was already walking away over his shoulder he asked ms gibson whats on my calendar for today the usual divorces and drunks divorces and drunks oscar mumbled to himself as he stepped into his office what i need is a good car wreck he hung his overcoat on the back of the door placed his umbrella in a rack by his desk and began unpacking his briefcase wally was soon standing nearby holding the newspaper does the name chester marino ring a bell he asked obit age fiftyseven wife kids grandkids no cause given oscar scratched his closecropped gray hair and said maybe couldve been a last will and testament they got him down at van easel amp sons visitation tonight service tomorrow ill snoop around and see whats up if hes one of ours you wanna send flowers not until you know the size of his estate good point wally was still holding his newspaper this taser thing is out of control you know cops in joliet are accused of tasering a seventyyearold man who went to walmart to buy sudafed for his sick grandchild the pharmacist figured the old man was using the stuff for a meth lab so the pharmacist being a good citizen called the cops turns out the cops all got themselves brandnew tasers so five of these clowns stop the old man in the parking lot and taser his ass critical condition so were back doing taser law are we wally damn right we are these are good cases oscar we gotta get a few oscar sat down and sighed heavily so this week its taser guns last week it was diaper rashesbig plans to sue the makers of pampers because a few thousand babies have diaper rashes last month it was chinese drywall theyve paid four billion bucks already in the drywall class action yes but we havent seen any of it thats my point oscar we have got to get serious about these mass tort cases this is where the money is millions in fees paid by companies that make billions in profits the door was open and rochelle was listening to every word though this particular conversation was getting a bit stale wally was talking louder we get us a few of these cases then hook up with the mass tort specialists give them a piece of the cake then ride their coattails until they settle and we walk away with a truckload its easy money oscar diaper rashes okay that didnt work but this taser thing is a gold mine another gold mine wally yep ill prove it you do that t he drunk at the end of the bar had rallied somewhat his head was up his eyes were partially open and abner was serving him coffee and chatting away all in an effort to convince the man it was time to leave a teenager with a broom was sweeping the floor and arranging tables and chairs the little pub was showing signs of life with his brain coated with vodka david stared at himself in the mirror and tried in vain to put things into perspective one moment he was filled with excitement and proud of his bold escape from the death march at rogan rothberg the next moment he was fearful for his wife his family his future the booze gave him courage though and he decided to keep drinking his phone vibrated again it was lana at the office hello he said quietly david where are you just finishing breakfast you know david you dont sound so good are you all right im fine im fine a pause then are you drinking of course not its only nine thirty okay whatever look roy barton just left here and hes in a rage ive never heard such language all kinds of threats tell roy to kiss my ass i beg your pardon you heard me tell roy to kiss my ass youre losing it david its true youre cracking up im not surprised i saw this coming i knew it im fine youre not fine youre drunk and youre cracking up okay i may be drunk but i think i hear roy barton again what should i tell him to kiss my ass why dont you tell him david you have a phone give mr barton a call with that she hung up abner was easing over curious to get the scoop on this latest phone call he was rubbing the wooden counter again for the third or fourth time since david had planted himself at the bar the office david said and abner frowned as if this were bad news for everyone the aforementioned roy barton is looking for me throwing things wish i could be a fly on the wall hope he has a stroke abner moved closer say i never caught your name david zinc a pleasure look david the cook just got here you want something to eat maybe something loaded with grease french fries onion rings a big thick burger i want a double order of onion rings and a large bottle of ketchup attaboy abner disappeared david drained his latest bloody mary and went to look for the restroom when he returned he assumed his seat checked the timeand waited for the onion rings he could smell them back there somewhere sizzling in hot oil the drunk to his far right was gulping coffee and struggling to keep his eyes open the teenager was still sweeping floors and arranging furniture the phone vibrated on the counter it was his wife david made no move to answer it when the vibrating was over he waited then checked the voice mail helens message was about what he expected david your office has called twice where are you what are you doing everyone is very worried are you all right call me as soon as possible she was a doctoral student at northwestern and when he had kissed her goodbye that morning at she was still under the covers when he arrived home the night before at they had dined on leftover lasagna in front of the television before he fell asleep on the sofa helen was two years older and wanted to get pregnant something that was looking more and more unlikely given her husbands perpetual exhaustion in the meantime she was pursuing a ph d in art history and doing so at a leisurely pace a soft beep then a text message from her where are you are you okay please he preferred not to speak to her for several hours he would be forced to admit he was cracking up and she would insist he get professional help her father was a shrink and her mother was a marriage counselor and the entire family believed that all of lifes problems and mysteries could be solved with a few hours in therapy at the same time though he couldnt stand the thought that she was frantically worrying about his safety he sent a text im fine i had to leave the office for a while ill be okay please dont worry she replied where are you the onion rings arrived a huge pile of goldenbrown circles covered in thick batter and grease hot from the fryer abner placed them in front of david and said these are the best how about a glass of water i was thinking about a pint of beer you got it abner found a mug and stepped to the tap my wifes looking for me now david said you got a wife dont ask sorry shes a great girl wants a family and all but we cant seem to get things started i worked four thousand hours last year can you believe it four thousand hours i usually punch in at seven in the morning and leave around ten at night thats a typical day but its not unusual to work past midnight so when i get home i crash i think we had sex once last month hard to believe im thirtyone shes thirtythree both in our prime and wanting to get pregnant and big boy here cant stay awake he opened the bottle of ketchup and unloaded a third of it abner placed a frosty pint of lager in front of him at least youre making plenty of dough abner said david peeled off an onion ring dipped it in ketchup and stuffed it in his mouth oh sure they pay me why would i subject myself to such abuse if i werent getting paid david glanced around to make sure no one was listening no one was there he lowered his voice as he ground away on the onion ring and said im a senior associate five years in my gross last year was three hundred k thats a lot of money and since i dont have time to spend it its just piling up in the bank but look at the math i worked four thousand hours but billed only three thousand three thousand hours tops in the firm the rest of it got lost in firm activities and pro bono work are you with me abner you look bored im listening ive served lawyers before i know how dull they are david took a long swig of lager and smacked his lips i appreciate your bluntness just doing my job the firm bills my time at five hundred bucks an hour times three thousand thats one point five mill for dear old rogan rothberg and they pay me a measly three hundred k multiply that by five hundred associates all doing pretty much the same thing and you understand why law schools are packed with bright young students who think they want to join a big law firm and make it to partner and get rich are you bored abner fascinating you want an onion ring no thanks david stuffed another large one into his parched mouth then washed it down with half a pint there was a loud thud at the end of the bar the drunk down there succumbed once again his head was on the counter whos the guy david asked his names eddie his brother owns half of the place so he runs a tab that never gets paid im sick of the guy abner eased away and spoke to eddie who didnt respond abner removed the coffee cup and wiped the counter around eddie then slowly made his way back to david so youre walking away from three hundred grand abner said whats the plan david laughed much too loud a plan havent got that far two hours ago i reported for work as always now im cracking up another swig my plan abner is to sit here for a long time and try to analyze my crackup will you help me its my job ill pay my tab sounds like a deal another pint please chapter after an hour or so of reading the newspaper eating her yogurt and enjoying her coffee rochelle gibson reluctantly went to work her first task was to check the client register for one chester marino now resting quietly in a modestly priced bronze casket at van easel amp sons funeral home oscar was right the firm had prepared a last will and testament for mr marino six years earlier she found the thin file in the storage room next to the kitchen and took it to wally who was hard at work amid the debris on his desk the office of wallis t figg attorney and counseloratlaw had been a bedroom in the original scheme of things but over the years as walls and doors were reconfigured the square footage had been expanded somewhat it certainly gave no hint of once being a bedroom but then it didnt much resemble an office either it began at the door with walls no more than twelve feet apart then doglegged to the right to a larger space where wally worked behind a sstyle fauxmodern desk hed snapped up at a fire sale the desk was covered with stacks of manila files and used legal pads and hundreds of phone message slips and to anyone who didnt know better including prospective clients the desk gave the impression that the man behind it was extremely busy maybe even important as always ms gibson walked slowly toward the desk careful not to upset the piles of thick law books and old files stacked along the route she handed him the file and said we did a will for mr marino thanks any assets i didnt look she said already backtracking she left without another word wally opened the file six years earlier mr marino was working as an auditor for the state of illinois earning a year living with his second wife and her two teenagers and enjoying a quiet life in the suburbs he had just paid off the mortgage on their home which was their only significant asset they had joint bank accounts retirement funds and few debts the only interesting wrinkle was a collection of three hundred baseball cards that mr marino valued at on page of the file there was a xerox copy of a card of shoeless joe jackson in a white sox uniform and under it oscar had written oscar cared nothing for sports and he had never mentioned this little oddity to wally mr marino signed a simple will he could have prepared himself for free but instead paid finley amp figg for the honors as wally read the will he realized its only real purpose since all other assets were jointly owned was to make sure his two stepchildren didnt get their hands on his baseball card collection mr marino left it to his son lyle on page oscar had scribbled wife doesnt know about cards wally estimated the value of the estate at somewhere in the range and under the probate scheme currently in place the lawyer handling mr marinos final affairs would earn about unless there was a fight over the baseball cards and wally certainly hoped there would be the probate would be painfully routine and take about eighteen months but if the heirs fought then wally could drag it out for three years and triple his fee he did not like probate work but it was far better than divorce and child custody probate paid the bills and occasionally it led to additional fees the fact that finley amp figg prepared the will meant nothing when it was time to probate it any lawyer could do so and wally knew from his vast experience in the murky world of client solicitation that there were scores of hungry lawyers poring over obituaries and calculating fees it was worth his time to check on chester and lay claim to the legal work necessary in tidying up his affairs it was certainly worth a driveby at van easel amp sons one of many funeral homes on his circuit t hree months remained on the suspension of wallys drivers license for drunken driving but he drove nonetheless he was careful though keeping to the streets near his home and office where he knew the cops when he went to court downtown he took the bus or the train van easel amp sons was a few blocks outside his comfort zone but he decided to roll the dice if he got caught he could probably talk his way out of trouble if the police didnt budge then he knew the judges he used the backstreets as much as possible and stayed away from the traffic mr van easel and his three sons had been dead for many years and as their funeral parlor passed from one owner to another the business had declined as had the loving and thoughtful service that was still advertised wally parked in the rear in an empty lot and walked through the front door as if he were there to pay his respects it was almost am on a wednesday morning and for a few seconds he saw no one else he paused in the lobby and looked at the visiting schedule chester was two doors down on the right in the second of three visiting rooms to the left was a small chapel a man with pasty skin brown teeth and a black suit approached and said good morning may i help you good morning mr grayber wally said oh its you again always a pleasure though wally had once shaken hands with mr grayber he made no effort to do so again he wasnt sure but he suspected him to be one of the morticians he had always remembered the soft chilly touch of his palm and mr grayber kept his palms to himself as well each man disliked the others profession mr marino was a client wally said gravely his visitation is not until this evening grayber said yes i see that but im leaving town this afternoon very well he sort of waved in the direction of the viewing rooms i dont suppose any other lawyers have stopped by wally said grayber snorted and rolled his eyes who knows i cant keep up with you people we had a service last week for an illegal mexican got himself pinned under a bulldozer used the chapel there he said nodding at the chapel door we had more lawyers here than family members poor guys never been so loved how nice wally said he had attended the service last week finley amp figg did not get the case thanks he said and walked away he passed the first viewing roomclosed casket no mourners he stepped into the second a dimly lit room twenty feet by twenty with a casket along one wall and cheap chairs lining the others chester was sealed up which pleased wally he put his hand on the casket as if fighting back tears just he and chester sharing one last moment together the routine here was to hang around for a few minutes and hope a family member or friend showed up if not then wally would sign the register and leave his card with grayber with specific instructions to tell the family that mr marinos lawyer stopped by to pay his respects the firm would send flowers to the service and a letter to the widow and in a few days wally would call the woman and act as though she were somehow obligated to hire finley amp figg because they had prepared the will this worked about half the time wally was leaving when a young man entered the room he was about thirty nice looking reasonably dressed with a jacket and tie he looked at wally with a great deal of skepticism which was the way a lot of people initially viewed him though this no longer bothered him when two perfect strangers meet at a casket in an empty viewing room the first words are always awkward wally finally managed to state his name and the young man said yes well uh thats my father im lyle marino ah soontobe owner of a nice collection of baseball cards but wally could not mention this your father was a client of my law firm wally said we prepared his last will and testament im very sorry thanks lyle said and seemed relieved i cant believe this we went to the blackhawks game last saturday had a great time now hes gone im very sorry so it was sudden a heart attack lyle snapped his fingers and said just like that he was at work monday morning at his desk all of a sudden he started sweating and breathing hard then he just fell on the floor dead im very sorry lyle wally said as if hed known the young man forever lyle was patting the top of the casket and repeating i just cant believe this wally needed to fill in some blanks your parents divorced about ten years ago right something like that is your mother still in the city yes lyle wiped his eyes with the back of his hand and your stepmother are you close to her no we dont speak the divorce was ugly wally suppressed a smile a feuding family would run up his fees im sorry her name is millie right look lyle i gotta run heres my card wally deftly whipped out a business card and handed it over chester was a great guy wally said call us if we can help lyle took the card and stuffed it into his pants pocket he was staring blankly at the casket im sorry whats your name figg wally figg and youre a lawyer yes finley amp figg a small boutique firm with lots of business in all major courts and you knew my father oh yes very well he loved to collect baseball cards lyle took his hand off the casket and looked square into the shifty eyes of wally figg you know what killed my father mr figg you said it was a heart attack right you know what caused the heart attack well no lyle glanced at the door to make sure they were still alone he glanced around the room to make sure no one could possibly be listening he took a step closer so that his shoes were almost touching those of wally who by now was expecting to hear that old chester had been murdered in some clever fashion in a near whisper lyle asked ever hear of a drug called krayoxx t here was a mcdonalds in the shopping center next to van easels wally bought two cups of coffee and they huddled in a booth as far away from the counter as possible lyle had a stack of papersarticles pulled from the internetand it was obvious he needed someone to talk to since his fathers death fortyeight hours earlier he had become obsessed with krayoxx the drug had been on the market for six years and its sales had grown rapidly in most cases it lowered the cholesterol of obese people chesters weight had slowly climbed toward three hundred pounds and this had caused other increasesblood pressure and cholesterol to name the most obvious lyle had hounded his father about his weight but chester couldnt stay away from the midnight ice cream his way of handling the stress of the ugly divorce was to sit in the dark and knock out one pint after another of ben amp jerrys once the weight was on he couldnt get it off his doctor prescribed krayoxx a year earlier and his cholesterol dropped dramatically at the same time he began complaining of an irregular heart rate and shortness of breath he reported these to his doctor who assured him there was nothing wrong the dramatic dip in his cholesterol far outweighed any of these minor side effects krayoxx was made by varrick labs a new jersey firm currently number three on big pharmas list of the worlds ten largest drug companies annual sales of some billion and a long ugly history of bruising battles with federal regulators and tort lawyers varrick makes six billion a year off krayoxx lyle was saying as he sifted through research with an annual increase of percent wally ignored his coffee as he scanned a report he listened silently though the wheels were turning so fast he was almost dizzy and heres the best part lyle said picking up another sheet of paper ever hear of a law firm called zell amp potter wally had never heard of krayoxx though at pounds and with a slightly elevated cholesterol he was mildly surprised his doctor had not mentioned the drug nor had he heard of zell amp potter but sensing they were major players in something important he wasnt about to admit his ignorance i think so he said frowning searching big plaintiffs firm in fort lauderdale yep they filed suit in florida last week against varrick a huge lawsuit for wrongful deaths caused by krayoxx heres the story in the miami herald wally scanned the story as his heart rate doubled im sure you heard about this lawsuit lyle said wally was constantly amazed at the naivete of the average guy over two million lawsuits are filed in the united states each year and poor lyle here was thinking that wally had noticed one filed in south florida yep ive been watching this one wally said does your firm handle cases like this lyle asked so innocently its our specialty wally said we cut our teeth on injury and death cases id love to go after varrick labs you would have you ever sued them before no but weve gone after most of the major drug companies this is great then youre willing to take my dads case damn right ill take it wally thought but through years of experience he knew not to rush in or at least not to seem overly optimistic lets just say the case has real potential ill need to confer with my senior partner do some research chat with the boys down at zell amp potter do my homework mass tort work is very complicated and it could also be insanely lucrative which was wallys primary thought at the moment thank you mr figg a t five minutes before eleven abner became somewhat animated he began watching the door as he continued shining martini glasses with his white towel eddie was awake again sipping coffee but still in another world finally abner said say david could you do me a favor anything could you move two stools over the one you got now is reserved at eleven each morning david looked to his rightthere were eight empty stools between him and eddie and to his left there were seven empty stools between him and the other end of the bar are you kidding david asked come on abner grabbed his pint of beer which was almost empty replaced it with a full one and situated everything two stools to the left david slowly lifted himself up and followed his beer whats the deal he asked youll see abner said nodding at the door there was no one else in the pub other than of course eddie minutes later the door opened and an elderly asian man appeared he wore a dapper uniform a bow tie and a little drivers cap he was helping a lady much older than himself she walked with a cane unassisted but with the driver hovering and the two of them shuffled across the floor toward the bar david watched with fascinationwas he finally seeing things or was this for real abner was mixing a drink and watching too eddie was mumbling to himself good morning miss spence abner said politely almost with a bow good morning abner she said as she slowly lifted herself up and delicately mounted the stool her driver followed her movements with both hands but didnt touch her once she was properly seated she said ill have the usual the driver nodded at abner then backed away and quietly left the bar miss spence was wearing a fulllength mink coat thick pearls around her tiny neck and layers of thick rouge and mascara that did little to hide the fact that she was at least ninety years old david admired her immediately his own grandmother was ninetytwo and strapped to a bed in a nursing home absent from this world and here was this grand old dame boozing it up before lunch she ignored him abner finished mixing her drink a baffling combination of ingredients one pearl harbor he said as he presented it to her she slowly lifted it to her mouth took a small sip with her eyes closed swirled the booze around her mouth then offered abner the slightest of heavily wrinkled grins he seemed to breathe again david not quite plastered but well on his way leaned over and said come here often abner gulped and showed both palms to david miss spence is a regular and she prefers to drink in silence he said panicky miss spence was taking another sip again with her eyes closed she wants to drink in silence in a bar david asked in disbelief yes abner snapped well i guess she picked the right bar david said flopping an arm around and taking in the emptiness of the pub this place is deserted do you ever have a crowd around here quiet abner urged his face said just be cool for a while but david kept on i mean youve had just two customers all morning me and old eddie down there and we all know that he doesnt pay his tab at the moment eddie was lifting his coffee cup in the general direction of his face but was having trouble finding his mouth evidently he did not hear davids comment knock it off abner growled or ill ask you to leave sorry david said and went silent he had no desire to leave because he had no idea where to go the third sip did the trick and loosened things up a little miss spence opened her eyes and looked around slowly and with an ancient voice she said yes i come here often monday through saturday and you my first visit david said but i doubt its my last after today ill probably have more time to drink and more reasons for doing so cheers he leaned across with his pint of lager and ever so carefully touched her glass cheers she said and why are you here young man its a long story and getting longer why are you here oh i dont know habit i guess six days a week for how long abner at least twenty years she apparently did not want to hear davids long story she took another sip and looked as though she wanted to nod off david was suddenly sleepy too chapter helen zinc arrived at the trust tower a few minutes after noon driving downtown she had tried to call and text her husband for the umpteenth time with no recent success at he had sent her a text message instructing her not to worry and at hed sent his second and final text in which he had said no swaet am ok dont wory helen parked in a garage hurried down the street and entered the atrium of the building minutes later she stepped off the elevator on the ninetythird floor a receptionist led her to a small conference room where she waited alone though it was lunchtime the rogan rothberg culture frowned on anyone leaving the building to eat good food and fresh air were almost taboo occasionally one of the big partners would take a client out for a splashy marathon an expensive lunch that the client would ultimately pay for through the timehonored tricks of file padding and fee gouging but as a general rulethough unwrittenthe associates and lesser partners grabbed a quick sandwich from a machine on a typical day david had both breakfast and lunch at his desk and it was not unusual to have dinner there as well he once bragged to helen he had billed three different clients an hour each as he shoved down a smoked tuna with chips and a diet soda she hoped he was only joking though she wasnt sure of the exact number he had put on at least thirty pounds since their wedding day he ran marathons back then and the extra weight was not a problem yet but the steady diet of bad food along with a nearcomplete absence of exercise worried both of them at rogan rothberg the hour between and was no different from any other hour of the day or night it was helens second visit to the office in five years spouses were not excluded but they were not invited either there was no reason for her to be there and given the avalanche of horror stories he brought home she had no desire to see the place or spend time with the people twice a year she and david dragged themselves to some dreadful rogan rothberg social gathering some miserable outing designed to foster camaraderie among the battered lawyers and their neglected spouses invariably these turned into sloppy drinking parties with behavior that was embarrassing and impossible to forget take a bunch of exhausted lawyers ply them with booze and things get ugly a year earlier on a party boat a mile out on lake michigan roy barton had tried to grope her if he hadnt been so drunk he may have succeeded and that would have caused serious problems for a week she and david argued about what to do david wanted to confront him then complain to the firms standards committee helen said no it would only harm davids career there were no witnesses and the truth was that barton probably didnt remember what hed done with time they stopped talking about the incident after five years she had heard so many roy barton stories that david refused to mention his bosss name at home suddenly there he was roy walked into the small conference room with a snarl on his face and demanded helen whats going on here funny i have the same question she shot back mr barton as he preferred to be called ran over people by barking first and trying to embarrass she would have none of it where is he he barked you tell me roy she said lana the secretary and al and lurch appeared together as if theyd been subpoenaed by the same marshal quick introductions were made as roy closed the door helen had spoken to lana many times on the phone but had never met her roy looked at al and lurch and said you two tell us exactly what happened they tagteamed through their version of david zincs last elevator ride and without the slightest bit of embellishment presented a fairly clear picture of a troubled man whod simply snapped he was sweating breathing hard pale and he actually dived headfirst back into the elevator landing on its floor and just as the door closed they heard him laughing he was fine when he left home this morning helen assured them as if to emphasize the point that the crackup was the firms fault and not hers you roy barked in the direction of lana youve talked to him lana had her notes she had spoken to him twice then he stopped answering the phone in the second conversation she said i got the clear impression that he was drinking his tongue was a bit thick his syllables were not as sharp roy glared at helen as if she were to blame where would he go roy demanded oh the usual place roy helen said the same place he always goes when he cracks up at in the morning and gets plastered there was a heavy pause in the room evidently helen zinc felt free to sass mr barton but the others certainly did not in a lower tone mr barton asked her is he drinking too much he doesnt have time to drink roy he comes home at ten or eleven sometimes has a glass of wine then hes out on the sofa is he seeing a shrink for what working a hundred hours a week i thought that was the norm around here i think all of you people need to see a shrink another pause roy was getting his ass handed to him and this was very unusual al and lurch stared at the table and worked hard to conceal grins lana was a deer in headlights ready to be fired on the spot so you have no information that might help us here roy said no and evidently you have no information to help me either right roy roy had had enough his eyes narrowed his jaws clenched his face turned red he looked at helen and said hell show up okay sooner or later hell get in a cab and find his way home hell crawl back to you and then hell crawl back to us he gets one more chance you understand i want him in my office tomorrow morning at sharp sober and sorry helens eyes were suddenly wet she touched both cheeks and in a cracking voice said i just want to find him i want to know hes safe can you help me start looking roy said there are a thousand bars in downtown chicago youll find him sooner or later and with that roy barton made a dramatic exit from the room slamming the door behind him as soon as he was gone al stepped forward touched helen on the shoulder and said softly look roys an asshole but hes right about one thing davids in a bar getting drunk hell eventually get in a cab and go home lurch stepped closer too and said helen this has happened before around here in fact its not that unusual hell be fine tomorrow and the firm has a counselor on the payroll a real pro who deals with casualties al added a casualty helen asked is that what my husband is at this point lurch shrugged and said yes but hell be okay al shrugged and said hes in a bar id love to be with him a t abners the lunch crowd had finally arrived the booths and tables were full and the bar was packed with office workers washing down burgers with pints of beer david had moved one stool to his right so that he was now next to miss spence she was on her third and last pearl harbor david was on his second when she offered him his first he had initially declined claiming he had no taste for fussy mixed drinks she insisted and abner whipped one up and slid it in front of david though it looked as harmless as cough syrup the drink was a lethal combination of vodka melon liqueur and pineapple juice they found common ground at wrigley field miss spences father had taken her there as a small girl and she had followed her beloved cubs her entire life she had held season tickets for sixtytwo years a record she was certain and she had seen the great onesrogers hornsby ernie banks ron santo billy williams fergie jenkins and ryne sandberg and she had suffered greatly along with all cubs fans her eyes danced as she told the wellknown story of the curse of the billy goat her eyes moistened when she remembered in detail the great fall of she took a long sip after recounting the infamous june swoon of she let it slip that her late husband had once tried to buy the team but was somehow outmaneuvered after two pearl harbors she was fairly smashed the third was putting her away she had no curiosity about davids situation rather she preferred to do most of the talking and david who was in slow motion was content to just sit and listen abner ventured by occasionally making sure she was happy at precisely just as abners lunch business hit full stride her asian driver arrived to collect her she drained her glass said goodbye to abner made no effort to pay a tab thanked david for the company and left the bar her left hand tucked inside her drivers elbow and her right hand working the cane her walk was slow but erect proud shed be back who was that david asked abner when he got close enough ill tell you later you having lunch sure those burgers look good double cheese with fries you got it t he cabdrivers name was bowie and he was a talker as they left the third funeral home his curiosity could no longer be restrained say pal i gotta ask he chirped over his shoulder whats with all these funeral homes wally had covered the rear seat in obituary pages city maps and legal pads lets head over to wood amp ferguson on rd street near beverly park he said temporarily ignoring bowies question they had been together for almost two hours and the meter was approaching a nice chunk in terms of cab fare but chump change in the context of krayoxx litigation according to some of the news articles lyle marino had given him the lawyers were speculating that a wrongful death case involving the drug could potentially be worth to million the lawyers would take percent and finley amp figg would of course have to share their fee with zell amp potter or another tort firm spearheading the litigation still after all the fee splitting the drug was a gold mine the urgent issue was finding the cases as they rushed around chicago wally was confident he was the only lawyer out of a million in the city who was at that moment shrewd enough to be combing the streets in search of krayoxx victims according to another article the drugs dangers had just been discovered and another one quoting a trial lawyer said that the medical community and the public in general were not yet aware of the krayoxx fiasco but wally was now aware and he didnt care how much he spent on cab fare i was asking about all these funeral homes bowie chirped again he was not going away and he would not be ignored its one oclock wally announced you had lunch lunch ive been with you for the past two hours you seen me eat lunch im hungry theres a taco bell up there on the right lets use the drivethru youre paying right right i love taco bell bowie ordered soft tacos for himself and a burrito supreme for his passenger as they waited in line bowie said so i keep thinking whats this guy doing at all these funeral homes you know none of my business but ive been driving for eighteen years and ive never had a ride who popped in on funeral homes all over town never had a ride who had that many friends know what i mean youre right about one thing wally said looking up from even more of lyles research its none of your business wow zinged me on that one didnt you pegged you for a nice guy im a lawyer from bad to worse just kidding you know my uncles a lawyer jerk wally handed him a bill bowie took the sack of food and distributed it back on the street he crammed a taco into his mouth and stopped talking chapter rochelle was secretly reading a romance novel when she heard footsteps on the front porch she deftly stuffed the paperback into a drawer and moved her fingertips to the keyboard so she seemed to be hard at work when the door opened a man and a woman entered timidly their eyes darting around almost in fear this was not unusual rochelle had seen a thousand come and go and they almost always entered with grim and suspecting faces and why not they wouldnt be there if they were not in trouble and for most it was their first visit to a law office good afternoon she said professionally were looking for a lawyer the man said divorce lawyer the woman corrected it was immediately obvious to rochelle that she had been correcting him for some time and he was probably fed up they were in their sixties though a bit too old for a divorce rochelle managed a smile and said please have a seat she pointed to two nearby chairs ill need to take down some basic information can we see a lawyer without an appointment the man asked i think so rochelle said they backed into the chairs and sat down then both managed to scoot the chairs farther away from each other this could get ugly rochelle thought she pulled out a questionnaire and found a pen your names please full names calvin a flander he said beating her to the punch barbara marie scarbro flander she said scarbros the maiden name and i might take it up again havent decided yet but everything else has been worked out and weve even signed a property settlement agreement one i found online and its all right here she was holding a large sealed envelope she just asked for your name mr flander said i got that can she take her old name back i mean you know its been fortytwo years since shes used it and i keep telling her that no one will know who she is if she starts going by scarbro again its a helluva lot better than flander barbara shot back flander sounds like someplace in europe or somebody who sleeps aroundfilander or filanderer dont you think so both were staring at rochelle who calmly asked any minor children under the age of eighteen both shook their heads two grown mrs flander said six grandkids she didnt ask about grandkids mr flander said well i damn sure told her didnt i rochelle managed to guide them through birth dates address social security numbers and employment histories without serious conflict and you say youve been married for fortytwo years both nodded defiantly she was tempted to ask why and what went wrong and couldnt this be salvaged but she knew better than to start that conversation let the lawyers deal with it you mentioned a property settlement i assume what you have in mind is a nofault divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences thats right mr flander said and the sooner the better its all right here mrs flander said clutching the envelope house cars bank accounts retirement accounts credit cards debts even furniture and appliances rochelle asked everything he said its all right here mrs flander said again and youre both satisfied with the agreement oh yes he said weve done all the work all we need is for a lawyer to draw up the papers and go to court with us no hassle whatsoever thats the only way to do it rochelle said the voice of experience ill get one of our lawyers to meet with you and go into more detail our firm charges for a nofault divorce and we require half of that to be paid at the initial conference the other half is due on the day you go to court the flanders reacted differently her jaw dropped in disbelief as if rochelle had demanded in cash his eyes narrowed and his forehead wrinkled as if this was exactly what he expecteda firstclass shaft job by a bunch of slimy lawyers not a word until rochelle asked is something wrong mr flander growled what is this the old bait and switch this firm advertises nofault divorces for then you get us in the door and double the price rochelles immediate reaction was to ask herself what has wally done now he advertised so much in so many ways and in so many odd places that it was impossible to keep up with him mr flander stood abruptly yanked something from his pocket and tossed it on rochelles desk look at this he said it was a bingo card from vfw post mckinley park across the bottom was a bright yellow ad announcing finley amp figg attorneys nofault divorces as easy as pie call justice rochelle had been surprised so many times that she should have been immune but bingo cards she had watched as prospective clients rifled through purses and bags and pockets to pull out church bulletins football programs rotary club raffles coupons and a hundred other little pieces of propaganda that attorney figg littered around greater chicago in his ceaseless quest to drum up business and now hed done it again she had to admit that she was indeed surprised the firms fee schedule was always a moving target with the costs of representation subject to change on the fly depending on the client and the situation a nicely dressed couple driving a latemodel car might get a quote of for a nofault from one lawyer and an hour later a working stiff and his haggard wife could negotiate half that much from the other lawyer part of rochelles daily grind was ironing out fee disputes and discrepancies bingo cards easy as pie for oscar would blow a gasket okay she said calmly as if bingo card advertising were a long tradition at their firm i need to see your property settlement mrs flander handed it over rochelle scanned it quickly then gave it back let me see if mr finley is in she said she took the bingo card with her oscars door was closed as always the firm had a rigid closeddoor policy that kept the lawyers shielded from each other and from the street traffic and riffraff that ventured in from rochelles perch near the front she could see every dooroscars wallys the kitchen the downstairs restroom the copy room and a small junk room used for storage she also knew the lawyers had a tendency to listen quietly through their closed doors when she was grilling a prospective client wally had a side door he often used to escape from a client who promised trouble but oscar did not she knew he was at his desk and since wally was hitting the funeral homes she had no choice she closed his door behind her and placed the bingo card in front of mr finley youre not going to believe this she said whats he done now oscar asked as he scanned the card three hundred and ninetynine dollars yep i thought we agreed that was the minimum for a nofault no we agreed on then then then next week im sure well agree on something else i will not do a divorce for ive been a lawyer for thirtytwo years and i will not prostitute myself for such a meager fee do you hear me ms gibson ive heard this before let figg do it its his case his bingo card im too busy right but figgs not here and youre not really that busy where is he hes visiting the dead one of his funeral laps around town whats his scheme this time dont know yet this morning it was taser guns oscar laid the bingo card on his desk and stared at it he shook his head mumbled to himself and asked what kind of tormented mind could even conceive of the notion of advertising on bingo cards in a vfw figg she said without hesitation i might have to strangle him ill hold him down dump this riffraff on his desk make an appointment they can come back later its an outrage that people think they can just walk in off the street and see a lawyer even figg without an appointment give me a little dignity okay okay you have dignity look they have some assets and almost no debt theyre in their sixties kids are gone i say you split em up keep her start the meter b y pm abners was quiet again eddie had somehow disappeared with the lunch crowd and david zinc was alone at the bar four middleaged men were getting drunk in a booth as they made big plans for a bonefishing trip to mexico abner was washing glasses in a small sink near the beer taps he was talking about miss spence her last husband was angus spence ring a bell david shook his head at that moment nothing rang a bell the lights were on but no one was home angus was the billionaire no one knew owned a bunch of potash deposits in canada and australia died ten years ago left her with a bundle she would be on the forbes list but they cant find all the assets the old man was too smart she lives in a penthouse on the lake comes in every day at eleven has three pearl harbors for lunch leaves at when the crowd comes in and i guess she goes home and sleeps it off i think shes cute shes ninetyfour she didnt pay her tab she doesnt get a tab she sends me a thousand bucks every month she wants that stool and three drinks and her privacy ive never seen her talk to anyone before you should consider yourself lucky she wants my body well you know where to find her david took a small sip of a guinness stout rogan rothberg was a distant memory he wasnt so sure about helen and he really didnt care he had decided to get wonderfully drunk and enjoy the moment tomorrow would be brutal and he would deal with it then nothing absolutely nothing could interfere with this delightful slide into oblivion abner slid a cup of coffee in front of him and said just brewed it david ignored it he said so you work on retainer huh just like a law firm what could i get for a thousand bucks a month at the rate youre going a thousand wont touch it have you called your wife david look abner youre a bartender not a marriage counselor this is a big day for me a day that will change my life forever im in the middle of a major crackup or meltdown or whatever it is my life will never be the same so let me enjoy this moment ill call you a cab whenever you want im not going anywhere f or initial client conferences oscar always put on his dark jacket and straightened his tie it was important to set the tone and a lawyer in a black suit meant power knowledge and authority oscar firmly believed the image also conveyed the message that he did not work cheap though he usually did he pored over the proposed property settlement frowning as if it had been drafted by a couple of idiots the flanders were on the other side of his desk they occasionally glanced around to take in the ego wall a potpourri of framed photos showing mr finley grinning and shaking hands with unknown celebrities and framed certificates purporting to show that mr finley was highly trained and skilled and a few plaques that were clear proof he had been justly recognized over the years the other walls were lined with shelves packed with thick somber law books and treatises more proof still that mr finley knew his stuff whats the value of the house he asked without taking his eyes off the agreement around twofifty mr flander replied i think its more mrs flander added this is not a good time to be selling a house oscar said wisely though every homeowner in america knew the market was weak more silence as the wise man studied their work he lowered the papers and peered over his drugstore reading glasses into the expectant eyes of mrs flander youre getting the washer and dryer along with the microwave treadmill and flatscreen television well yes in fact youre getting probably percent of the household furnishings right i suppose whats wrong with that nothing except hes getting most of the cash i think its fair said mr flander im sure you do do you think its fair she asked oscar shrugged as if it werent his business pretty typical id say but cash is more important than a trainload of used furniture youll probably move into an apartment something much smaller and you wont have enough room for all your old stuff he on the other hand has money in the bank she shot a hard look at her soontobeexhusband oscar hammered away and your car is three years older so youre getting the old car and the old furniture it was his idea she said it was not we agreed you wanted the ira account and the newer car thats because its always been my car and thats because youve always had the nicer car thats not true barbara dont start exaggerating like you always do okay louder barbara responded and dont you start lying in front of the lawyer cal we agreed we would come here tell the truth and not fight in front of the lawyer didnt we oh sure but how can you sit there and say ive always had the nicer car have you forgotten the toyota camry good god cal that was twenty years ago still counts well yes i remember it and i remember the day you wrecked it rochelle heard the voices and smiled to herself she turned a page of her paperback ac asleep beside her suddenly rose to his feet and began a low growl rochelle looked at him then slowly got up and walked to a window she adjusted the blinds to give herself a view then she heard itthe distant wail of a siren as it grew louder acs growl also picked up the volume oscar was also at a window casually looking at the intersection in the distance hoping for a glimpse of the ambulance it was a habit too hard to break not that he really wanted to stop he along with wally and now rochelle and perhaps thousands of lawyers in the city couldnt suppress a rush of adrenaline at the sound of an approaching ambulance and the sight of one flying down the street always made him smile the flanders though were not smiling they had gone silent both glaring at him each hating the other when the siren faded away oscar returned to his chair and said look folks if youre going to fight i cant represent both of you both were tempted to bolt once on the street they could go their separate ways and find more reputable lawyers but for a second or two they were not sure what to do then mr flander blinked he jumped to his feet and headed for the door dont worry about it finley ill go find me a real lawyer he opened the door slammed it behind him then stomped past rochelle and the dog as they were settling into their places he yanked open the front door slammed it too and happily left finley amp figg forever chapter happy hour ran from five to seven and abner decided his new best friend should leave before it started he called a cab soaked a clean towel with cold water then walked to the other side of the bar and gently punched him david wake up pal its almost five oclock david had been out for an hour abner like all good bartenders did not want his afterwork crowd to see a drunk facedown on the bar comatose snoring abner touched his face with the towel and said come on big guy partys over david suddenly came around his eyes and mouth flew open as he gawked at abner what what what he stammered its almost five time to go home david theres a cab outside five oclock david shouted stunned at the news there were half a dozen other drinkers in the bar all watching with sympathy tomorrow it could be them david got to his feet and with abners help managed to pull on his overcoat and find his briefcase how long have i been here he asked looking around wildly as if hed just discovered the place a long time abner replied he stuffed a business card into a coat pocket and said call me tomorrow and well settle the tab arm in arm they staggered to the front door and through it the cab was at the curb abner opened the rear door wrestled david into the seat said hes all yours to the driver and closed the door david watched him disappear into the bar he looked at the driver and said whats your name the driver said something unintelligible and david barked can you speak english where to sir the driver asked now thats a really good question you know any good bars around here the driver shook his head im not ready to go home because shes there and well oh boy the inside of the cab had started to spin there was a loud honk from behind the driver eased into traffic not so fast david said with his eyes closed they were going ten miles an hour go north david said i need a destination sir the driver said as he turned onto south dearborn rushhour traffic was already heavy and slow i might be sick david said swallowing hard and afraid to open his eyes please not in my car they stopped and started for two blocks david managed to calm himself a destination sir the driver repeated david opened his left eye and looked out the window next to the cab was a city transit bus waiting in traffic packed with weary workers its exhaust spewing fumes along its side was an ad three feet by one proclaiming the services of finley amp figg attorneys drunk driving call the experts justice address in smaller print david opened his right eye and for an instant saw the smiling face of wally figg he focused on the word drunk and wondered if they could help in some way had he seen such ads before had he heard of these guys he wasnt sure nothing was clear nothing made sense the cab was suddenly spinning again and faster now four eighteen preston avenue he said to the driver then passed out r ochelle was never in a hurry to leave because she never wanted to go home as tense as things could get around the office they were far tamer than her cramped and chaotic apartment the flanders divorce got off to a rocky start but with oscars skillful manipulation it was now on track mrs flander had hired the firm and paid a retainer of it would eventually be worked out and settled on nofault grounds but not before oscar clipped her for a couple of grand still oscar was fuming over the bingo card and lying in wait for his junior partner wally rolled in at after an exhausting day looking for krayoxx victims the search had turned up no one but chester marino but wally was undaunted he was onto something big the clients were out there and he would find them oscars on the phone rochelle said and hes upset whats up wally asked a bingo card showed up pretty clever huh my uncle plays bingo at the vfw brilliant she gave him the quick version of the flander situation see it worked wally said proudly you gotta get em in here ms gibson thats what i always say the is the bait then you pull the switch oscar did it perfectly what about false advertising most of what we do is false advertising ever hear of krayoxx cholesterol drug maybe why its killing people okay and its gonna make us rich i think ive heard this before hes off the phone wally went straight to oscars door rapped it as he pushed it open and said so you like my bingo card ads i hear oscar was standing at his desk tie undone tired and in need of a drink two hours earlier hed been ready for a fight now he just wanted to leave come on wally bingo cards yep were the first law firm in chicago to use bingo cards weve been the first several times and were still broke those days are over my friend wally said as he reached into his briefcase ever hear of a cholesterol drug called krayoxx yeah yeah my wifes taking it well oscar its killing people oscar actually smiled then caught himself how do you know this wally dropped a stack of research onto oscars desk heres your homework all about krayoxx a big mass tort firm in fort lauderdale sued varrick labs last week over krayoxx a class action they claim the drug vastly increases the risk of heart attack and stroke and they have experts to prove it varrick has put more crap on the market than any of the big pharmas and its also paid more in damages billions looks like krayoxx is its latest boondoggle the mass tort boys are just now waking up this is happening now oscar and if we can pick up a dozen or so krayoxx cases then were rich ive heard this all before wally w hen the cab stopped david was awake again though semiconscious with some effort he managed to toss two bills over the front seat and with even more effort managed to extricate himself from the cab he watched it drive away then vomited in the gutter afterward he felt much better rochelle was tidying up her desk and listening to the partners bicker when she heard heavy footsteps on the porch something hit the door then it swung open the young man was wildeyed redfaced unsteady on his feet but well dressed can i help you she said with great suspicion david looked at her but didnt see her he looked around the room wobbled squinted as he tried to focus sir she said i love this place he said to her i really really love this place how nice could i im looking for a job and this is where i want to work ac smelled trouble and walked around the corner of rochelles desk how cute david said loudly giggling a dog whats his name ac ac all right help me out here what does ac stand for ambulance chaser i like it i really really like it does he bite dont touch him the two partners had moved quietly into view they were standing in the door of oscars office rochelle gave them a nervous look this is where i want to work david repeated i need a job are you a lawyer wally asked are you figg or finley im figg hes finley are you a lawyer i think so as of eight oclock this morning i was employed by rogan rothberg one of six hundred but i quit snapped cracked up went to a bar its been a long day david leaned against the wall to steady himself what makes you think were looking for an associate oscar asked associate i was thinking more in terms of coming straight in as a partner david said then doubled over in laughter no one else cracked a smile they were not sure what to do but wally would later confess he thought about calling the police when the laughing stopped david steadied himself again and repeated i love this place why are you leaving the big firm wally asked oh lots of reasons lets just say i hate the work hate the people i work with and hate the clients youll fit in here rochelle said were not hiring oscar said oh come on i went to harvard law school ill work parttimefifty hours a week half of what ive been working get it parttime he laughed again alone sorry pal wally said dismissively not too far away a driver hit the horn a long frantic sound that could only end badly another driver slammed his brakes violently another horn more brakes and for a long second the firm of finley amp figg held its collective breath the crash that followed was thunderous more impressive than most and it was obvious that several cars had just mangled themselves at the intersection of preston beech and thirtyeighth oscar grabbed his overcoat rochelle grabbed her sweater they followed wally out the front door leaving the drunk behind to take care of himself along preston other offices emptied as lawyers and their clerks and paralegals raced to inspect the mayhem and offer solace to the injured the pileup involved at least four cars all damaged and scattered one was lying on its roof tires still spinning there were screams amid the panic and sirens in the distance wally ran to a badly crumpled ford the front passenger door had been torn off and a teenage girl was trying to get out she was dazed and covered in blood he took her arm and led her away from the wreckage rochelle helped as they sat the girl on a nearby bus bench wally returned to the carnage in search of other clients oscar had already found an eyewitness someone who could help place blame and thus attract clients finley amp figg knew how to work a wreck the teenagers mother had been in the rear seat and wally helped her too he walked her to the bus bench and into the waiting arms of rochelle vince gholston their rival from across the street appeared and wally saw him stay away gholston he barked these are our clients now no way figg theyre not signed up stay away asshole a crowd grew quickly as onlookers rushed to the scene traffic was not moving and many drivers got out of their cars to take a look someone yelled i smell gas which immediately increased the panic a toyota was upside down and its occupants were trying desperately to get out a large man with boots kicked at a window but could not break it people were yelling screaming the sirens were getting closer wally was circling a buick whose driver appeared to be unconscious oscar was handing out business cards to everyone in the midst of this mayhem a young mans voice boomed through the air stay away from our clients he yelled and everyone followed the voice it was an amazing sight david zinc was near the bus bench holding a large jagged piece of metal from the wreckage waving it near the face of a frightened vince gholston who was backing away these are our clients david said angrily he looked crazed and there was no doubt he would use the weapon if necessary oscar moved next to wally and said that kid may have some potential after all wally was watching with great admiration lets sign him up chapter when helen zinc pulled in to the driveway at preston the first thing she noticed was not the wellworn exterior of finley amp figg attorneysatlaw rather it was the flashing neon sign next door advertising massages she turned off the lights and the engine and sat for a moment to gather her thoughts her husband was alive and safe hed just had a few drinks according to one wally figg a somewhat pleasant man whod phoned an hour earlier mr figg was sitting with her husband whatever that meant the digital clock on the dash gave the time as so for almost twelve hours now she had been worrying frantically over his whereabouts and safety now that she knew he was alive she was thinking of ways to kill him she glanced around taking in the neighborhood disapproving of everything about it then got out of her bmw and slowly headed for the door she had asked mr figg how exactly her husband made his way from the tall buildings of downtown chicago to the bluecollar neighborhood around preston avenue mr figg had said he didnt have all the details and it would be best if they talked about it later she opened the front door a cheap bell rattled a dog growled at her but made no effort to attack rochelle gibson and oscar finley were gone wally was sitting at the table clipping obituaries from old newspapers and dining on a bag of chips and a diet soda he stood quickly swiped his hands on his pants and offered a big smile you must be helen he said i am she said almost flinching as he thrust out a hand to shake im wally figg he said already sizing her up a very nice package short auburn hair hazel eyes behind chic designer frames five feet eight slender well dressed wally approved he then turned and waved an arm in the direction of the cluttered table beyond it against the wall was an old leather sofa and on the sofa was david zinc dead to the world comatose again his right pants leg was torna small wound from the car smashup and its aftermathbut other than that he looked quite undisturbed helen took a few steps over and gave him a look are you sure hes alive she asked oh yes very much so he got into a scuffle at the car wreck and tore his pants a scuffle yep guy named gholston a slimeball across the street was trying to steal one of our clients after the big wreck and david here chased him off with a piece of metal somehow he tore his pants helen who had endured enough for one day shook her head would you like something to drink coffee water scotch i dont drink alcohol she said wally looked at her looked at david looked back at her must be a strange marriage he thought neither do i he said proudly theres fresh coffee i made a pot for david and he drank two cups before taking his little nap yes thank you she said they sipped coffee at the table and spoke softly the best i can tell wally said is that he snapped on the elevator this morning as he was going to work cracked up left the building and wound up in a bar where he pretty much spent the whole day drinking thats what i gather she said but how did he get here havent got that far yet but i gotta tell you helen he says hes not going back says he wants to stay here and work she couldnt help herself as she glanced around the large open cluttered room it would be difficult to imagine a place that appeared to be less prosperous your dog she asked thats ac the firm dog he lives here how many lawyers are in your firm just two its a boutique firm im the junior partner oscar finleys the senior partner and what kind of work would david do here we specialize in injury and death cases like all those guys who advertise on television we dont do tv wally said smugly if she only knew he worked on his scripts all the time he fought with oscar about spending the money he watched with envy as other injury lawyers flooded the airwaves with ads that in his opinion were almost always poorly done and most painfully he imagined all the lost fees from all the lost cases scooped up by less talented lawyers willing to roll the dice on a tv budget david made a gurgling sound and followed it up with a quick nasal snort and though he was at least making noises there was no indication he was anywhere near consciousness do you think hell remember any of this in the morning she asked as she frowned at her husband hard to say wally observed his romance with alcohol was long and ugly and he had spent many foggedin mornings struggling to remember what had happened wally took a sip and said look really none of my business and all but does he do this often he says he wants to work here and well we need to know if he might have a problem with the bottle he doesnt drink much at all never has he might occasionally at a party but he works too hard to drink much and since i rarely touch the stuff we dont keep it around the house just curious ive had my problems im sorry no its okay ive been sober for sixty days now that didnt impress helen as much as it worried her wally was still fighting the bottle with victory far away she was suddenly tired of the conversation and tired of the place i suppose i should take him home yes i suppose or he could stay here with the dog thats what he deserves you know he should wake up in the morning here on the sofa still dressed a splitting headache upset stomach parched tongue and have no idea where he is that would serve him right dont you think it would but id rather not clean up after him again hes already twice once on the porch once in the restroom im so sorry its okay but he needs to go home i know lets get him up o nce awake david chatted pleasantly with his wife as if nothing had happened he walked unaided from the office down the front steps and to the car he yelled a long goodbye and a hearty thanks to wally and even offered to drive helen declined they left preston and headed north for five minutes nothing was said then helen casually began look i think i have most of the major plot points but just a few details might help where was the bar abners a few blocks from the office he was sitting low with the collar of his overcoat turned up over his ears been there before no great place though ill take you there sometime sure why not tomorrow and you walked into abners at what time this morning between and i fled the office ran a few blocks found abners and started drinking oh yes recall what you consumed well lets see he paused as he tried to remember for breakfast i had four of abners special bloody marys theyre really good then i had a plate of onion rings and several pints of beer miss spence showed up and i had two of her pearl harbors wouldnt want to do that again miss spence yep she shows up every day same stool same drink same everything and you liked her i adored her very cute hot i see she married no a widow shes ninetyfour and worth a few billion any other women oh no just miss spence she left sometime around noon and uh lets see i had a burger and fries for lunch then back to the beer and then at some point i took a nap you blacked out whatever a pause as she drove and he stared out the windshield so how did you get from the bar to that law office back there a cab paid the guy forty bucks where did you get into the cab a pause dont remember that now were making progress and the big question how did you find finley amp figg david began shaking his head as he pondered this finally he said i have no idea there was so much to talk about the drinkingcould there be a problem in spite of what shed told wally rogan rothbergwas he going back should she bring up roy bartons ultimatum finley amp figgwas he serious helen had a lot on her mind plenty to say a long list of complaints but at the same time she couldnt help but be slightly amused she had never seen her husband so plastered and the fact that hed jumped from a tall building downtown and landed in the outback would soon become a family tale of legendary proportions he was safe and that was really all that mattered and he probably wasnt crazy the crackup could be dealt with i have a question he said his eyelids getting heavier i have lots of questions she replied im sure you do but i dont want to talk now save it for tomorrow when im sober okay its not fair to hammer me now when im drunk fair enough whats your question are your parents by chance in our home at this moment yes theyve been there for some time theyre very concerned how nice look im not walking into our home if your parents are there got that i dont want them to see me like this understand they love you david you scared all of us why is everyone so scared i texted you twice and said i was okay you knew i was alive whats all the panic about dont get me started so i had a bad day whats the big deal a bad day actually it was a pretty good day come to think of it why dont we argue tomorrow david isnt that what you asked yes but im not getting out of the car until they leave please they were on the stevenson expressway and traffic was heavier nothing was said as they inched along david struggled to stay awake helen finally picked up the cell phone and called her parents chapter about once a month rochelle gibson arrived for work expecting her usual quiet time only to find the office already opened the coffee brewed the dog fed and mr figg bustling around with excitement over a new scheme to stalk injured people this irritated her immensely it not only ruined the few tranquil moments in her otherwise noisy day but also meant more work she was barely inside the door when wally nailed her with a hearty well good morning ms gibson as if he were surprised to see her arrive at work at on a thursday good morning mr figg she replied with far less enthusiasm she almost added and what brings you here so early but held her tongue she would hear about his scheme soon enough with coffee yogurt and the newspaper she settled at her desk and tried to ignore him i met davids wife last night wally said from the table across the room very cute and nice said he doesnt drink much maybe blows it out from time to time i think the pressure gets to him occasionally i know thats my story always the pressure when wally drank he needed no excuse he boozed it up after a hard day and he had wine with lunch on an easy day he drank when he was stressed and he drank on the golf course rochelle had seen and heard it all before she also kept up with the scoresixtyone days without a drink that was the story of wallys lifea count of some sort always in progress days on the wagon days until his driving suspension was over days until his current divorce was final and sadly days until he was released from rehab what time did she get him she asked without looking up from the newspaper after eight he walked out of here even asked if he could drive she said no was she upset she was pretty cool relieved more than anything else the big question is whether hell remember anything and if he does then the question is whether hell find us again will he really walk away from the big firm and the big bucks i got my doubts rochelle had her doubts too but she was trying to minimize the conversation finley amp figg was not the place for a bigfirm type with a harvard degree and frankly she didnt want another lawyer complicating her life she had her hands full with these two i could use him though wally went on and rochelle knew the latest scheme was now on the way you ever hear of a cholesterol drug called krayoxx youve already asked me this it causes heart attacks and strokes and the truth is just now coming out the first wave of litigation is unfolding could be tens of thousands of cases before its over the mass tort lawyers are all over it i talked to a big firm in fort lauderdale yesterday theyve already filed a class action and are looking for more cases rochelle turned a page as if she were hearing nothing anyway im spending the next few days looking for krayoxx cases and i could sure use some help are you listening ms gibson sure how many names are in our client database both active and retired she took a bite of yogurt and seemed exasperated we have about two hundred active files she said at finley amp figg though a file deemed active was not necessarily one that received attention more often than not it was simply a neglected file that no one had bothered to retire wally usually had about thirty files he would touch in a weeks timedivorces wills estates injuries drunk drivers small contract disputesand another fifty or so he diligently avoided oscar who was more willing to take on a new client but was also slightly more organized than his junior partner had about one hundred open files throw in a few that were lost hidden or unaccounted for and the number was always around two hundred and retired he asked a sip of coffee another grunt last time i checked the computer showed three thousand files retired since i dont know whats upstairs upstairs was the final resting place for everythingold law books outdated computers and word processors unused office supplies and dozens of boxes of files oscar had retired before he added wally as a partner three thousand wally said with a satisfied grin as if such a large number were clear evidence of a long and successful career heres the plan ms gibson i have drafted a letter that i want you to print on our stationery it goes to every client current and past active and retired every name in our client database rochelle thought of all the unhappy clients who had left finley amp figg the unpaid fees the nasty letters the threats of malpractice lawsuits she even kept a file labeled threats over the years half a dozen or so disgruntled exclients had been angry enough to put their feelings on paper a couple promised ambushes and beatings one mentioned a snipers rifle why not leave these poor people alone they had suffered enough having passed through the office the first time wally jumped to his feet and walked over with the letter she had no choice but to take it and read it dear beware of krayoxx this cholesterol drug made by varrick labs has been proven to cause heart attacks and strokes though it has been on the market for six years scientific evidence is just now revealing the deadly side effects of this drug if you are using krayoxx stop immediately the law firm of finley amp figg is at the forefront of krayoxx litigation we will soon be joining a national class action lawsuit in a highly complicated move to bring varrick to justice we need your involvement if you or anyone you know has a history with krayoxx you may have a case more important if you know of anyone who has taken krayoxx and has suffered a heart attack or stroke please call immediately a lawyer from finley amp figg will be at your home within hours dont hesitate call now we anticipate a huge settlement sincerely wallis t figg attorney and counseloratlaw has oscar seen this she asked not yet pretty good huh this for real oh its so real ms gibson this is our biggest moment another gold mine bigger than a gold mine and you want to send three thousand letters yep you print em ill sign em well stuff em and they go out in todays mail thats over a thousand bucks in postage ms gibson the average krayoxx case will generate something like in attorneys fees and thats on the low side could be as high as per case if we can find ten cases the math gets real easy rochelle did the math and her reluctance began to fade her mind began to drift with all the bar journals and newsletters that crossed her desk she had seen a thousand stories about big verdicts and big settlements lawyers making millions in fees surely they would give her a fine bonus all right she said shoving her newspaper aside o scar and wally had their second krayoxx fight not long afterward when oscar arrived at am he could not help but notice the flurry of activity around the front desk rochelle was working the computer the printer was in high gear wally was signing his name to letters even ac was awake and watching whats all this oscar demanded the sounds of capitalism at work wally answered cheerfully what the hell does that mean protecting the rights of the injured serving our clients purging the market of dangerous products bringing corporate wrongdoers to justice chasing ambulances rochelle said oscar looked disgusted and continued to his office where he slammed the door before he could remove his coat and park his umbrella wally was at his desk nibbling on a muffin and waving one of the letters you gotta read this oscar he said this is brilliant oscar read it the wrinkles in his forehead getting deeper and deeper with each paragraph when he finished he said come on wally not again how many of these are you sending out three thousand our entire client list what think of the postage think of the wasted time here we go again youll spend the next month running around chirping about krayoxx this and krayoxx that and youll waste a hundred hours looking for worthless cases and on and on weve been here before wally come on do something productive like what like go hang out in an emergency room somewhere wait for a real case to come in i dont have to tell you how to find good cases im tired of that crap oscar i wanna make some money lets hit it big for a change my wifes been taking the drug for two years loves it did you tell her to stop that its killing people of course not as their voices grew louder rochelle eased over and quietly closed the door to oscars office she was returning to her desk when the front door suddenly opened it was david zinc bright and sober with a big smile sharp suit cashmere overcoat and two thick briefcases loaded to the max well well if it aint mr harvard rochelle said im back im surprised you could find us it wasnt easy wheres my office well uh lets see im not sure we have one perhaps we should ask the two bosses about this she nodded to oscars door beyond which voices could be heard so theyre here david asked yes they usually start the day with a round of bickering i see look harvard are you sure you know what youre doing this is another world youre taking a plunge here leaving the fancy life of corporate law for the bush leagues you might get hurt out here and you sure wont make any money ive done the bigfirm thing ms gibson and ill jump off a bridge before i go back just give me a little room somewhere to park myself and ill figure it out the door opened and wally and oscar emerged they froze when they saw david standing in front of rochelles desk wally smiled and said well good morning david you look surprisingly healthy thank you and id like to apologize for my appearance yesterday he nodded at all three as he spoke you caught me at the tail end of a rather unusual episode but it was nonetheless a very important day in my life i quit the big firm and here i am ready to go to work what type of work do you have in mind oscar asked david gave a slight shrug as if he didnt have a clue for the past five years ive labored in the dungeon of bond underwriting with emphasis on second and thirdtier aftermarket spreads primarily for foreign multinational corporations that prefer to avoid paying taxes anywhere in the world if you have no idea what that is then dont worry no one else does either what it means is that a small team of us idiots labored fifteen hours a day in a room with no windows creating paperwork and more paperwork ive never seen the inside of a courtroom or a courthouse for that matter never met a judge when he was wearing a robe never offered a hand to help a person who needed a real lawyer to answer your question mr finley im here to do anything think of me as a rookie fresh out of law school who doesnt know his ass from a hole in the ground but im a quick study compensation should have been the next issue but the partners were reluctant to talk money in front of rochelle she of course would take the position that anyone they hired lawyer or otherwise should be paid less than she was there is some space upstairs wally said ill take it its a junk room oscar said ill take it david said lifting his two briefcases ready to move in i havent been up there in years rochelle said rolling her eyes obviously unhappy with the firms sudden expansion a narrow door next to the kitchen led to a stairway david followed wally with oscar bringing up the rear wally was excited about having someone to help hustle krayoxx cases oscar was thinking only of how much this might cost in salary withholding taxes unemployment deductions and heaven forbid health insurance finley amp figg offered little in the way of benefitsno k no ira no retirement of any kind and certainly no health or dental plan rochelle had been griping for years because she was forced to buy her own private policy as did the two partners what if young david here expected health insurance as oscar climbed the stairs he felt the burden of a heavier overhead more spent at the office meant less to take home his retirement seemed even more elusive the junk room was exactly that a dark dusty landfill with spiderwebs and pieces of old furniture and boxes of files i like it david said when wally switched on the light he must be crazy oscar thought but there was a small desk and a couple of chairs david saw only the potential and there were two windows sunlight would be a nice addition to his life when it was dark outside he would be at home with helen procreating oscar swiped away a large spiderweb and said look david we can offer a small salary but youre gonna have to generate your own fees and this wont be easy at least initially initially oscar had been struggling to generate meager fees for over thirty years whats the deal david asked oscar looked at wally and wally looked at the wall the two had not hired an associate in fifteen years nor had they even considered doing so davids presence had caught them by surprise as the senior partner oscar felt compelled to take the initiative we can pay a thousand bucks a month and you keep half of what you bring in after six months well reevaluate wally jumped in quickly with it will be rough at first lots of competition out there on the streets we can toss some files your way oscar added well give you a piece of the krayoxx litigation wally said as if they were already banking huge fees the what david asked never mind oscar said with a frown look guys david said with a smile he was far more at ease than they were ive made a very nice salary for the past five years ive spent a lot but theres a chunk in the bank dont worry about me ill take the deal and with that he thrust out a hand shaking oscars first then wallys chapter david cleaned for the next hour he wiped dust from the desk and chairs he found an old hoover in the kitchen and vacuumed the plank floors he filled three large bags with trash and put them on the small porch out back he stopped occasionally to admire the windows and sunlight something hed never done at rogan rothberg sure on a clear day the view across lake michigan was captivating but he had learned during his first year with the firm that time spent gazing out from the trust tower was time that could not be billed rookie associates were placed in bunkerlike cubicles where they toiled around the clock and with time forgot about sunshine and daydreaming now david couldnt stay away from the windows the view admittedly was not as captivating looking down he could see the massage parlor and beyond it the intersection of preston beech and thirtyeighth the very spot where hed taken a piece of metal to the slimeball gholston and chased him away beyond the intersection was a block of more converted bungalows not much of a view but david liked it anyway it represented an exciting change in his life a new challenge it meant freedom wally dropped in every ten minutes to check on things and it became obvious he had something on his mind finally after an hour he said say david im due in court at eleven divorce court i doubt youve ever been there so i was thinking you could tag along and ill introduce you to the judge the cleaning had become monotonous david said lets go as they were leaving through the back door wally said is that your audi suv it is do you mind driving ill do the talking sure as they were pulling onto preston wally said look david the truth is that i got a dui a year ago and my license is suspended there i said it i believe in being honest okay youve certainly seen me drunk enough i have indeed but your cute wife told me youre not much of a drinker i on the other hand have quite a history im sober for sixtyone days now every day is a challenge i go to aa and ive rehabbed several times what else do you want to know i didnt bring this up oscar he has a few strong ones every night believe me with his wife he needs them but he keeps it under control some people are like that you know they can stop with two or three they can skip a few days even weeks no problem others cant stop until they black out kinda like you yesterday thanks wally where are we headed by the way the daley center downtown west washington me i do fine for a while ive quit four or five times you know how would i know that anyway enough of the booze whats wrong with oscars wife wally whistled and looked out the side window for a moment tough woman man one of these people who grew up in a nicer part of town father wore a suit and tie to work as opposed to a uniform so she was raised to believe shes better than most a real snot she made a major mistake when she married oscar because she figured he was a lawyer right lawyers make lots of money right not exactly oscar has never made enough to satisfy her and she hammers him relentlessly because she wants more money i loathe the woman you wont meet her because she refuses to set foot in the office which suits me just fine why not get a divorce thats what ive been saying for years me i got no problem with divorce been down that road four times four times yep and every trip was worth the hassle you know what they saythe reason divorce is so expensive is because its worth it wally laughed at this stale punch line are you married now david asked somewhat cautiously nope back on the prowl wally said smugly as if no woman were safe david couldnt imagine a less attractive person hitting on females in bars and at parties so in less than fifteen minutes he had learned wally was a recovering alcoholic with four exwives several trips through rehab and at least one dui david decided to stop with the questions over breakfast with helen he had dug a bit online and learned that ten years earlier finley amp figg had settled a sexual harassment suit brought by a former secretary on one occasion oscar had been reprimanded by the state bar association for overcharging a client in a divorce case on two prior occasions wally had been reprimanded by the state bar association for blatant solicitation of clients whod been injured in auto accidents including an apparently messy affair involving wally wearing doctors scrubs and barging into the hospital room of a badly wounded teenager who died an hour later at least four former clients had sued the firm alleging malpractice though it was unclear if any recovered damages and the firm had been mentioned in a scathing article written by a professor of legal ethics who was sick of lawyers advertising and all of this was just over breakfast helen had been alarmed but david took a hard cynical line and argued that such dubious behavior couldnt touch the cutthroat brand of law practiced by the fine folks at rogan rothberg he had only to mention the strick river case to win the argument the strick river in wisconsin had been thoroughly polluted by an infamous chemical company represented by rogan rothberg and after decades of brutal litigation and skillful legal wrangling the dumping continued wally was digging through his briefcase the skyline came into view and david looked at the tall majestic buildings crowded together in downtown chicago the trust tower was in the center i would be there right now he said softly almost to himself wally looked up saw the skyline and realized what david was thinking which one wally asked the trust tower i was in the sears tower one summer a clerk after my second year of law school martin amp wheeler and i thought thats what i wanted what happened couldnt pass the bar exam david added that to the growing list of defects youre not going to miss it are you wally asked no im breaking into a sweat right now just looking at the building i dont want to get any closer take a left on washington were almost there i nside the richard j daley center they passed through security scanners and took the elevator to the sixteenth floor the place was bustling with lawyers and litigants clerks and cops either hustling about or huddled in little pockets of serious conversations justice was looming and everyone seemed to be dreading it david had no idea where he was going or what he was doing so he stuck close to wally who seemed quite at home david was carrying his briefcase which held only a single legal pad they passed courtroom after courtroom have you really never seen the inside of a courtroom wally asked as they walked quickly their shoes clicking along on the worn marble tile not since law school unbelievable what have you been doing for the past five years you dont want to know im sure youre right about that this is us wally said pointing to the heavy double doors of a courtroom a sign said circuit court of cook countydivorce division hon charles bradbury whos bradbury david asked youre about to meet him wally opened the door and they stepped inside there were a few spectators scattered through the rows of benches the lawyers were seated up front bored and waiting the witness chair was empty no trial was in progress judge bradbury was reviewing a document and taking his time david and wally sat in the second row wally scanned the courtroom saw his client smiled and nodded he whispered to david this is known as an open day as opposed to a trial day generally speaking you can get motions granted routine matters approved crap like that that lady over there in the short yellow dress is our beloved client deeanna nuxhall and she thinks shes about to get another divorce another david asked as he glanced over deeanna winked at him bleached blonde huge chest legs everywhere ive done one already this would be my second i think she has a prior looks like a stripper nothing would surprise me judge bradbury signed some papers lawyers approached the bench chatted with him got what they wanted and left fifteen minutes passed and wally was getting anxious mr figg the judge said wally and david walked through the bar past the tables and approached the bench a low one that allowed the lawyers to almost see eye to eye with his honor bradbury shoved the microphone away so they could chat without being heard whats up he said we have a new associate your honor wally said proudly meet david zinc david reached over and shook hands with the judge who received him warmly welcome to my courtroom he said davids been with a big firm downtown now he wants to see the real side of justice wally said you wont learn much from figg bradbury said with a chuckle he went to harvard law school wally said even prouder then what are you doing here the judge asked and appeared to be dead serious got sick of the big firm david said wally was handing over some paperwork we have a slight problem here judge my client is the lovely deeanna nuxhall fourth row left in the yellow dress bradbury peered slightly over his reading glasses and said she looks familiar yep she was here about a year ago second or third divorce same dress i think yes i think so too same dress but the boobs are new you getting any not yet david felt faint the judge and the lawyer were discussing sex with the client in open court though no one could hear whats the problem bradbury asked i havent been paid she owes three hundred bucks and i cant seem to squeeze it out of her what parts have you squeezed haha she refuses to pay judge i need a closer look wally turned and motioned for ms nuxhall to join them at the bench she stood and wiggled herself from between the benches then proceeded to the front the lawyers went mute the two bailiffs woke up the other spectators gawked the dress was even shorter when she walked and she wore platform spiked heels that would make a hooker blush david eased as far away as possible when she joined the boys at the bench judge bradbury pretended not to notice her he was far too occupied with the contents of the court file basic nofault divorce right mr figg thats correct your honor wally replied properly is everything in order yes except for the small matter of my fee i just noticed that bradbury said with a frown it looks as though there is a balance of right thats correct your honor bradbury peered over his reading glasses and took in the chest first then the eyes are you prepared to take care of the fee ms nuxhall yes your honor she said in a squeaky voice but ill have to wait until next week you see im getting married this saturday and well i just cant swing it right now his eyes dancing from her chest to her face his honor said its my experience ms nuxhall in divorce cases the fees are never paid after the fact i expect my lawyers to be taken care of to be paid before i sign the final orders what is the total fee mr figg six hundred she paid half up front six hundred bradbury said feigning disbelief thats a very reasonable fee ms nuxhall why havent you paid your lawyer her eyes were suddenly wet the lawyers and spectators couldnt hear the details but they nonetheless kept their eyes on deeanna especially her legs and shoes david backed away even more shocked at this shakedown in open court bradbury moved in for the kill he raised his voice slightly and said im not granting this divorce today ms nuxhall you get your lawyer paid then ill sign the papers you understand this wiping her cheeks she said please im sorry but i run a tight ship i insist that all obligations be metalimony child support legal fees its just go borrow it from a friend ive tried your honor but please i hear this all the time youre excused she turned around and walked away his honor leering at every step wally watched too shaking his head marveling as if ready to pounce when the door closed the courtroom breathed again judge bradbury took a sip of water and said anything else one more judge joannie brenner nofault complete property settlement no children and most important my fee has been paid in full get her up here i m not sure im cut out for divorce law david admitted they were back on the street inching along in noon traffic leaving the daley center behind great youve been to court one time now for less than an hour and youre already streamlining your practice wally replied do most judges do what bradbury just did what you mean protect his lawyers no most judges have forgotten what its like to be in the trenches as soon as they put on the black robe they forget bradbury hes different he remembers what a bunch of creeps we represent so what happens now will deeanna get her divorce shell stop by the office this afternoon with the money and well get the divorce on friday she gets married on saturday and in six months or so shell be back for another divorce i rest my case im not cut out for divorce work oh it sucks all right ninety percent of what we do sucks we hustle the nickelanddime stuff to pay the overhead and dream of the big case but last night david i didnt dream and ill tell you why ever hear of a drug called krayoxx a cholesterol drug no well you will its killing people right and left no doubt the next big mass tort wave of litigation and we gotta get in fast where are you going i need to run a quick errand and since were downtown it wont take a second a minute later david parked illegally outside of abners ever been here he asked oh sure there arent many bars with which im unacquainted david but its been a while this is where i spent yesterday and i need to pay my bar bill why didnt you pay it yesterday because i couldnt find my pockets remember ill wait in the car wally said then took a long lustful look at the door into abners miss spence was on her throne eyes glazed cheeks red in another world abner was hustling around the bar mixing drinks pouring beer sliding along platters of burgers david caught him near the cash register and said hey im back abner smiled and said so youre alive after all oh sure just left court you got my tab somewhere close abner fished through a drawer and pulled out a ticket lets call it a hundred and thirty bucks is that all david handed over two bills and said keep it your chick is over there abner said nodding at miss spence whose eyes were temporarily closed shes not as cute today david said i gotta friend in finance he was in last night says shes worth eight billion on second thought i think she likes you but youd better hurry id better leave her alone thanks for taking care of me no problem come back and see me sometime highly unlikely david thought as they quickly shook hands chapter for an unlicensed driver wally proved to be a skillful navigator somewhere near midway airport he directed david through a series of quick turns onto short streets delivered them from two impossible dead ends insisted he drive two blocks the wrong way and did it all with a nonstop monologue that included i know this place like the back of my hand several times they parked at the curb in front of a sagging duplex with aluminum foil covering the windows a barbecue grill on the front porch and a huge orange cat guarding the front door and who lives here david asked taking in the rundown neighborhood two sketchy teenagers across the street seemed fascinated by his shiny audi here liveth a lovely woman by the name of iris klopeck widow of percy klopeck who died about eighteen months ago at the age of fortyeight died in his sleep very sad they came to see me about a divorce one time but then changed their minds as i recall he was rather obese but not nearly as large as she the two lawyers were sitting in the car talking as if they did not want to get out only a couple of fbi agents in black suits and a black sedan could have been more conspicuous so why are we here david asked krayoxx my friend krayoxx i want to talk to iris and see if by chance percy had been on the drug when he died if so then voila we have another krayoxx case worth somewhere between two and four mill any more questions oh dozens of questions davids mind was spinning as he realized they were about to coldcall ms klopeck to inquire about her dead husband is she expecting us he asked i havent called have you no actually wally yanked open the door and got out david reluctantly did the same and managed to frown at the teenagers admiring his car the orange cat refused to move from the doormat the doorbell could not be heard from outside so wally commenced knocking louder and louder while david continued to glance nervously at the street finally a chain was heard then a crack in the door who is it a woman asked attorney wally figg looking for ms iris klopeck the door opened and through the glass storm door iris presented herself as large as advertised she wore what appeared to be a beige bedsheet with openings for her head and arms who are you she asked wally figg iris i met you and percy when you were thinking about a divorce probably three years ago you guys came to my office over on preston percys dead she said yes i know im sorry thats why im here i want to talk about his death im curious about what medications he was taking when he died why does it matter because theres a lot of litigation over cholesterol drugs and painkillers and antidepressants some of these drugs killed thousands of people there could be a lot of money on the table a pause as she looked at them the house is a wreck she said what a surprise thought david they followed her inside to a narrow dirty kitchen and sat at the table she fixed instant coffee in three mixmatched bears mugs then sat across from them davids chair was a flimsy wooden model that felt as though it might collapse any second hers appeared to be of the same variety the trip to the door then to the kitchen along with the preparation of the coffee had winded her there was sweat on her spongy forehead wally finally got around to introducing david to ms klopeck david went to harvard law and hes just joined our firm wally said she did not offer a hand to shake nor did mr harvard she could not have cared less where david wally or anyone else went to college or law school her breathing was as noisy as an old furnace the room smelled of dried cat urine and yesterdays nicotine wally again expressed his phony condolences for dear percys demise then quickly got to the point the main drug im after is called krayoxx a cholesterol drug was percy taking it when he died with no hesitation she said yes hed taken it for years i used to take it but i quit wally was at once thrilled by percys usage and disappointed that iris had given it up something wrong with krayoxx she asked oh yes very wrong wally said rubbing his hands together he launched into what was becoming a fluid and compelling case against krayoxx and varrick labs he cherrypicked facts and figures from the preliminary research that was being touted by the mass tort lawyers he quoted heavily from the onesided lawsuit filed in fort lauderdale he made a convincing case that time was of the essence and iris needed to sign on with finley amp figg immediately how much will it cost me she asked not a penny wally fired back we front the expenses of litigation and take percent of the recovery the coffee tasted like saltwater after one sip david wanted to spit iris though seemed to savor it she took a long drink swirled it around her mammoth mouth then swallowed forty percent sounds like a lot she said this is very complicated litigation iris against a corporation with a zillion dollars and a thousand lawyers look at it like this right now you have percent of nothing in a year or two if you hire our firm you could have percent of something big how big tough question iris but then i remember that you always ask the tough questions thats what i always liked about you tough question and to be honest i cant answer it because no one can predict what a jury might do the jury might see the truth about krayoxx and get ticked off at varrick and give you five million bucks or the jury might believe the lies put forth by varrick and its shifty lawyers and give you nothing me i tend to think the case will go for around a million bucks iris but you gotta understand that im not making any promises he looked at david and said right david we cant make promises in cases like this nothing is guaranteed thats right david said convincingly the new mass tort specialist she sloshed some more saltwater around her mouth and glared at wally i could sure use some help she said its just me and clint and hes only working parttime these days wally and david were taking notes and nodding along as if they knew exactly who clint was she did not bother to elaborate im living off a month social security so anything you can get would be great well get you something iris i feel sure of it when might this happen another tough question iris one theory is that varrick will get hit so hard with krayoxx cases that the company will surrender and negotiate a huge settlement most of the lawyers including me expect this to happen within the next twentyfour months the other theory is that varrick will take a few of these cases to trial to sort of test the waters around the country see what juries think about their drug if this happens it might take longer to force a settlement even david with a fine law degree and five years of experience was beginning to believe wally knew what he was talking about the junior partner went on if a settlement occurs and we certainly believe it will happen the death cases will be negotiated first then varrick will be desperate to settle all of the nondeath cases folks like you im a nondeath case she asked confused for now the scientific evidence is not clear but there appears to be a decent chance that krayoxx is responsible for heart damage in many people who are otherwise healthy how anyone could look at iris klopeck and deem her healthy was mindblowing at least to david mercy she said as her eyes watered thats all i needmore heart problems dont worry about it now wally said without the slightest trace of reassurance well get to your case later the important thing is to get percy signed up youre his widow and his principal heir therefore you need to hire me and act as his representative he produced a folded sheet of paper from his rumpled jacket and spread it before iris this is a contract for legal services youve signed one before for the divorce when you and percy came to my office i dont remember signing one she said we have it on file you need to sign a new one before i can handle your claim against varrick and youre sure this is all legal and everything she asked hesitant uncertain it struck david as odd that the potential client would ask the lawyer if the document was legal wally though did not inspire a sense of strict ethical standards her question did not faze him all of our krayoxx clients are signing these he said fudging a bit because iris would technically be the first in her class to sign up there were other fish in the pond but no one had actually signed such a contract she read it and signed it as wally stuffed it back into his pocket he said now listen iris i need your help i need for you to scope out other krayoxx cases friends family members neighbors anyone else who may have been injured by this drug our firm is offering a referral fee of for a death case and for a nondeath case cash her eyes were suddenly dry they narrowed then a tiny smile formed at the corners of her lips she was already thinking of others david managed to maintain a lawyerly frown as he scribbled useless drivel on a legal pad and tried to digest what he was hearing was this ethical legal cash bribes to bring in more cases do you happen to know of another death case involving krayoxx wally asked iris almost said something but held her tongue it was obvious she had a name five hundred bucks huh she said her eyes suddenly darting from davids to wallys thats the deal who is it theres a man two blocks over used to play poker with percy croaked last year in the shower two months after my percy passed i know for a fact he was on krayoxx wallys eyes were wild whats his name you said cash right five hundred cash id like to see it mr figg before i give you another case i sure need it stung for a second wally rallied with a convincing lie well normally we make a withdrawal from the firms litigation account keeps the bean counters happy you know she folded her stumplike arms across her chest stiffened her spine narrowed her eyes and said fine go make your withdrawal and bring me the cash then ill give you the name wally was reaching for his wallet well im not sure i have that much cash on me david how liquid are you david instinctively reached for his wallet iris watched with great suspicion as the lawyers scrambled to find cash wally produced three bills and a bill and looked hopefully at david who found in assorted denominations if they had not stopped by abners to pay the tab they could have come within of covering iriss referral fee i thought lawyers had plenty of money iris observed we keep it in the bank wally shot back unwilling to concede an inch looks like we have about ill stop by tomorrow with the rest iris was shaking her head no come on iris wally pleaded youre now our client were on the same team were talking about a huge settlement one day and you wont trust us with two hundred bucks ill take an iou she said at this point david preferred to stand his ground show some pride rake the cash off the table and say goodbye but david was anything but surefooted and he knew it was not his call wally on the other hand was a rabid dog he quickly scribbled an iou on his legal pad signed his name and slid it across the table iris read it slowly disapproved then handed it to david you sign it too she said for the first time since his great escape david zinc questioned his wisdom approximately fortyeight hours earlier he had been working on a complicated repackaging of highgrade bonds being sold by the government of india all told the deal involved around billion now in his new life as a street lawyer he was being bullied by a fourhundredpound woman who was demanding his signature on a worthless piece of paper he hesitated took a deep breath shot wally a look of sheer bewilderment then signed his name t he rundown neighborhood got dramatically worse the deeper they drove into it the two blocks over iris had mentioned was more like five blocks and by the time they found the house and parked on the street in front of it david was worried about their safety the tiny home of the widow cozart was a fortressa small brick house on a narrow lot lined with eightfoot chainlink fencing according to iris herb cozart was at war with the black teenage thugs who roamed the streets he spent most of his days sitting on the front porch holding a shotgun glaring at the punks and cursing them if they got too close when he died someone tied party balloons along the fence someone else tossed a string of firecrackers onto the front lawn in the middle of the night mrs cozart was planning to move according to iris as david turned off the ignition he looked down the street and said oh boy wally froze looked in the same direction and said this could be interesting five black males teenagers all dressed in the appropriate rapper garb had noticed the shiny audi and were giving it the onceover from fifty yards away i think ill stay with the car david said you can handle this one by yourself good call ill make it quick wally jumped out with his briefcase iris had called ahead and mrs cozart was standing on the porch the gang was moving toward the audi david locked the doors and thought of how nice it would be to have a pistol of some variety just for protection something to show the boys so they would take their fun and games elsewhere but armed only with a cell phone he stuck it to his ear and pretended to be in deep conversation as the gang moved closer and closer they surrounded the car chatting nonstop though david could not understand what they were saying minutes passed as david waited for a brick to crash through a window they regrouped at the front bumper and all five leaned back casually as if they owned the car and needed to use it as a resting place they rocked it gently careful not to scratch or damage it then one of them lit a joint and they passed it around david thought about starting the engine and attempting to drive away but that would create several problems not the least of which was poor wally getting stranded he thought about lowering a window and engaging the boys in friendly banter but they did not appear friendly at all from the corner of his eye david saw mrs cozarts front door fly open and wally storm out of the house wally reached into his briefcase yanked out a very large black handgun and yelled fbi get off the damn car the boys were too startled to move or to move quickly enough so wally aimed at the clouds and fired a shot that sounded like a cannon the five bolted scattered vanished wally stuffed the pistol into his briefcase and jumped into the car lets get outta here he said david was already accelerating punks wally hissed do you always carry a gun david asked i have a permit yes i always carry a gun in this business you might need one do most lawyers carry guns i dont care what most lawyers do okay its not my job to protect most lawyers ive been mugged twice in this city so i aint getting mugged again david slid around a curve and sped through the neighborhood wally continued crazy woman wanted some money iris of course called and said we were coming over and of course she told mrs cozart about the referral fee but since the old gal is nuts all she heard was the part about the five hundred bucks did you sign her up no she demanded cash which is pretty stupid because iris should know that she took all our cash where are we going now to the office she wouldnt even tell me her husbands date of death so i figure well run a search and find out why dont you do that when we get to the office but hes not our client no hes dead and since his wife is crazy and i mean this woman is really nuts we can get a courtappointed administrator to approve his lawsuit more ways than one to skin a cat david youll learn oh im learning isnt it against the law to discharge a firearm within the city limits well well they did teach you something at harvard yes thats true and its also against the law to discharge a firearm with a bullet that goes into the head of another person its called murder and it happens at least once a day here in chicago and since there are so many murders the police are overworked and have no time to fool with firearms that discharge bullets that fly harmlessly through the air you thinking about turning me in or something no just curious does oscar carry a gun i dont think so but he keeps one in a desk drawer oscar was assaulted once in his office by an irate divorce client it was a simple nofault divorce uncontested on all issues and oscar somehow found a way to lose the case how do you lose an uncontested divorce i dont know but dont ask oscar okay its still a touchy subject anyway he told the client that they would have to refile and go through the entire process again and the client went crazy beat the hell out of oscar oscar looks like he can take care of himself the guy mustve been a bad dude who said it was a guy a woman yep a very large and angry woman but a woman nonetheless she got the drop on him by throwing her coffee cupceramic not paperand hitting him between the eyes then she grabbed his umbrella and started flailing away fourteen stitches vallie pennebaker was her name never forget her who broke it up rochelle finally got back thereoscar swears she took her timeand she pulled vallie off and settled her down then she called the cops and they hauled vallie away charged her with aggravated assault she countered with a lawsuit for malpractice took two years and probably five thousand bucks to get it all settled now oscar keeps a piece in his desk what would they think at rogan rothberg david asked himself lawyers carrying guns lawyers claiming to be fbi agents and firing into the air lawyers being bloodied by unhappy clients he almost asked wally if hed ever been assaulted by a client but bit his tongue and let it pass he thought he knew the answer chapter they returned to the apparent safety of the office at the printer was spitting out sheets of paper rochelle was at the table sorting and arranging stacks of letters what did you do to deeanna nuxhall she growled at wally lets just say her divorce has been postponed until she can find a way to pay her lawyer why shes called here three times crying and carrying on wanted to know what time youd be back really wants to see you good that means she found the money wally was scanning a letter from a stack on the table he handed one to david who took it and began reading he was immediately hooked by the opening beware of krayoxx lets start signing wally said i want these in the mail this afternoon the clock is ticking the letters were on finley amp figg stationery and sent by the honorable wallis t figg attorney and counseloratlaw after the sincerely signoff there was room for only one signature what am i supposed to do here david asked start signing my name wally replied im sorry start signing my name what do you think im signing all three thousand of these so im forging your name no i hereby give you the authority to sign my name on these letters wally said slowly as if speaking to an idiot then he looked at rochelle and said and you too ive already signed a hundred she said as she handed another letter to david look at that signature a first grader could do better and she was right the signature was an effortless scrawl that began with a wavy roll that was probably meant to be a w and then spiked dramatically for either the t or the f david picked up one of the letters wally had just signed and compared his signature with rochelles forgery they were slightly similar but both were illegible and indecipherable yes this is pretty bad david observed it doesnt matter what you fling down cant nobody read it anyway she added i think its very distinguished wally said signing away now can we all get busy david sat down and began experimenting with his scrawl rochelle was folding stuffing and putting on stamps after a few minutes david asked who are these people our client database wally replied with great importance over three thousand names going back how far about twenty years rochelle said so some of these folks have not been heard from in many years right thats right she said some are probably dead some moved away a lot of these folks wont be too happy to get a letter from finley amp figg if theyre dead lets hope krayoxx got em wally blurted and followed it with a loud laugh neither david nor rochelle saw the humor a few minutes passed without a word david was thinking about his room upstairs and all the work it needed rochelle was watching the clock waiting on pm wally was happily casting a wider net for new clients what kind of a response do you expect david asked rochelle rolled her eyes as if to say zero wally paused for a second and shook the stiffness out of his signing hand great question he admitted then rubbed his chin and gazed at the ceiling as if only he could answer such a complex question lets assume that percent of the adult population in this country is taking krayoxx now where did you get percent david interrupted research its in the file take it home tonight and learn the facts so as i was saying percent of our pool is about thirty people if percent of the pool has had problems with heart attacks or strokes then were down to about say five or six cases maybe seven or eight who knows and if we believe as i do that each case especially a death is worth a couple mill then were looking at a very nice payday i get the sense that nobody else around here believes me but im not going to argue i havent said a word rochelle replied just curious thats all david said a couple of minutes passed then he asked so when do we file some big lawsuit wally the expert cleared his throat in preparation for a miniseminar very soon we have iris klopeck signed up so we could file tomorrow if we wanted i plan to get chester marinos widow on board as soon as the funeral is over these letters go out today the phonesll start ringing in a day or so with some luck we might have half a dozen cases in hand within a week then well file ill start drafting the lawsuit tomorrow its important to file quickly in these mass tort cases well drop the first bomb here in chicago get the headlines and every person on krayoxx will toss the drug and give us a call oh brother rochelle said oh brother is right wait till we get around to the settlement and ill show you another oh brother state or federal court david asked quick to throttle the bickering good question and id like for you to research the issue if we go into state court we can also sue the doctors who prescribed krayoxx to our clients thats more defendants but also more highpowered defense lawyers causing trouble frankly theres enough money at varrick labs to make us all happy so im inclined to keep the doctors out of it on the federal side because the krayoxx litigation will go nationwide we can plug into the mass tort network and ride their coattails no one really expects these cases to go to trial and when the settlement negotiations begin we need to be hooked in with the big boys again wally sounded so knowledgeable that david wanted to believe him but hed already been at the firm long enough to know that wally had never handled a mass tort case nor had oscar oscars door opened and he emerged with his usual frown and look of fatigue what the hell is this he said pleasantly no one responded he walked to the table picked up a letter then dropped it he was about to say something when the front door burst open and a tall thick burly tattooed philistine stomped in and yelled at the entire room which one is figg with no hesitation oscar and david and even rochelle pointed at wally who was wildeyed and frozen behind the intruder was a tart in a yellow dress deeanna nuxhall from divorce court and she yelled thats him trip the short fat one trip went straight for wally as if he might kill him the rest of the firm scrambled away from the table leaving wally to fend for himself trip made a couple of fists hovered over wally and said look figg you little weasel were getting married saturday so my girl here needs her divorce tomorrow whats the problem wally still seated and hunkering down in anticipation of a beating said well i would like to get paid she promised to pay you later didnt she i sure did deeanna added helpfully if you touch me ill have you arrested wally said you cant get married if youre in jail i told you he was a smartass deeanna said because he needed to hit something but was not quite ready to slap wally around trip backhanded a stack of krayoxx letters and sent them flying get the divorce okay figg ill be there tomorrow in court and if my girl doesnt get her divorce then ill stomp your chubby little ass right there in the courtroom call the police oscar barked at rochelle who was too frightened to move trip needed something with more drama so he grabbed a thick law book off the table and tossed it through a front window glass shattered and rattled across the porch ac yelped but retreated to a hiding place under rochelles desk trips eyes were shiny and glazed ill snap your neck figg you got that hit him trip deeanna urged david glanced at the sofa and saw wallys briefcase he eased closer to it well be in court tomorrow figg you gonna be there trip took another step closer wally braced for the assault rochelle moved in the direction of her desk and this upset trip dont move youre not calling the cops call the police oscar barked again but made no effort to do so himself david inched closer to the briefcase talk to me figg trip demanded he embarrassed me in open court deeanna whined it was obvious she wanted bloodshed youre a slimeball figg you know that wally was about to say something clever when trip finally made contact he pushed wally a rather benign little shove that seemed tame in light of the buildup but it was an assault nonetheless hey watch it wally barked slapping at trips hand david quickly opened the briefcase and withdrew the long black magnum colt he was not certain if he had ever touched a revolver and he wasnt sure he could do so now without blowing his hand off but he knew to avoid the trigger here wally he said as he placed the gun on the table wally snatched it and jumped from his chair and the rules of engagement changed dramatically trip blurted holy shit in a highpitched voice and took a long step back deeanna ducked behind him whimpering rochelle and oscar were as stunned as trip was by the weapon wally did not aim the gun at anyone not directly anyway but he handled it in such a way that there was little doubt he could and would unload a few rounds in a matter of seconds first i want an apology he said as he moved toward trip who had lost his swagger you got a lotta balls coming in here and making demands when your girl there wont pay her bills trip who no doubt had some experience in handguns stared at the colt and said meekly yeah sure youre right man call the police ms gibson wally said and she dialed ac poked his head out and growled at trip i want three hundred bucks for the divorce and two hundred bucks for the window wally demanded trip was still backing away with deeanna practically unseen behind him be cool man trip said both palms facing wally oh im very cool do something baby deeanna said like what you see the size of that thing cant we just get outta here she asked no wally replied not until the cops get here he raised the gun a few inches careful not to point it directly at trip rochelle backed away from her desk and went to the kitchen be cool man trip pleaded were leaving no youre not t he police arrived in minutes trip was handcuffed and placed in the backseat of a patrol car deeanna cried without effect then she tried flirting with the cops and this proved slightly more useful in the end though trip was hauled away to face charges of assault and vandalism when the excitement was over rochelle and oscar went home leaving wally and david to sweep up the broken glass and finish signing the krayoxx letters they worked for an hour mindlessly signing wallys name and also discussing what to do about the broken window it could not be replaced until the following day and the office wouldnt survive the night with a missing window preston wasnt a dangerous neighborhood but no one left keys in cars or doors unlocked wally had just made the decision to sleep at the office on the sofa next to the table with ac nearby and the colt within reach when the front door swung open and dear deeanna popped in for the second time what are you doing here wally demanded we need to talk wally she said in a voice that was unsteady and much softer she sat in a chair near rochelles desk and crossed her legs in such a way as to leave most of the flesh exposed she had very nice legs and was wearing the same hookers heels she had displayed in court that morning ooh la la wally said under his breath then and what would you like to talk about he asked i think shes been drinking david whispered as he kept signing im not sure i should marry trip she announced hes a brute a real loser deeanna you can do better than that but i really want my divorce wally cant you help me out here then pay me i cant get the money before court tomorrow i swear thats the truth then too bad david decided that had the case been his he would do whatever necessary to get the divorce so deeanna and trip would be history an extra wasnt worth all the hassle she recrossed her legs and her skirt inched up even higher i was thinking wally that maybe we could make some other arrangements you know just me and you wally sighed looked at the legs thought for a second and said cant do it i gotta stay here tonight because some jackass knocked out the front window then ill stay too she cooed licking her bright red lips wally had never possessed the willpower to run from these situations not that he encountered them all the time seldom had a client been so open and obvious in fact he could not at that dreadful yet thrilling moment remember one being so easy we might work something out he said leering at deeanna im outta here david said jumping to his feet and grabbing his briefcase you can hang around she said the visual was instantaneous and uglyhappily married david romping around with a cute slut whod had as many divorces as her chubby and naked lawyer david ran for the door and slammed it behind him t heir favorite latenight bistro was within walking distance of their home in lincoln park they had often met there for a quick dinner just before the kitchen closed at eleven just as david staggered home from another crushing day at the office tonight though they arrived before nine and found the place bustling their table was in a corner at some point about halfway through his fiveyear career at rogan rothberg david had adopted the policy of not discussing his work of never bringing it home it was so unpleasant and distasteful and boring to boot he simply could not dump it on helen she happily went along with this policy and so they usually talked about her studies or what their friends were doing but things were suddenly different the big firm was gone as were the faceless clients and their tedious files now david worked with real people who did incredible things that had to be retold in great detail take for example the two near gunfights david had survived with his sidekick wally at first helen flatly refused to believe that wally had actually fired a shot in the air to scatter the street thugs but she eventually softened under davids relentless narrative nor did she believe the trip story on the first telling she was equally skeptical of the wallyjudge bradbury shakedown of deeanna nuxhall in open court she was incredulous that her husband would fork over all of his cash to iris klopeck then sign an iou for more oscar getting mauled by an angry female divorce client was slightly more believable saving the best for last david wrapped up his unforgettable first day at finley amp figg with and dear even as we speak wally and deeanna are naked on the sofa having a romp with the window open and the dog watching and the unpaid fee getting satisfied in spectacular fashion youre lying i wish the will be forgiven and deeanna will be divorced by noon tomorrow what a sleazeball which one how about both do most of your clients pay this way i doubt it i mentioned iris klopeck i suspect shes more in line with the firms client profile the fee couch couldnt hold up under the pounding you cant work for these people david come on quit rogan if you want but lets find a different firm somewhere these two clowns are a couple of crooks what about ethics i doubt if they spend much time discussing ethics why not look for a nice midsized firm somewhere with nice people who dont carry guns and chase ambulances and swap labor for sex whats my specialty helen something to do with bonds right i know a lot about highyield longterm bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations thats all i know about the law because thats all ive done for the past five years put that on a resume and the only people who might call are a handful of eggheads at other large firms just like rogan who might be in need of someone like me but you can learn of course i can but no one will hire a fiveyear lawyer at a nice salary and put him in kindergarten they demand experience and i dont have it so finley amp figg is the only place you can work or someplace like it ill treat it like a seminar for a year or two then maybe open my own shop great one day on the job and youre already thinking about leaving not really i love the place youve lost your mind yes and its so liberating chapter wallys massmailing scheme proved futile half of the letters were returned by the postal service for a variety of reasons phone traffic spiked a bit in the week that followed though most of the calls were from former clients who demanded to be removed from finley amp figgs mailing list undaunted wally filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the northern district of illinois naming iris klopeck and millie marino as well as others to be named later and claimed their loved ones had been killed by the drug krayoxx manufactured by varrick labs throwing darts wally asked for an even million in total damages and he demanded a trial by jury the filing was not nearly as dramatic as he wished he tried desperately to attract the media to the lawsuit he was brewing but there was little interest instead of simply filing it online he and david both dressed in their finest dark suits drove to the everett m dirksen us courthouse in downtown chicago and hand delivered the twentypage lawsuit to the clerk there were no reporters and no photographers and this upset wally he harangued a deputy clerk into snapping a photograph of the two grimfaced lawyers as they filed the lawsuit once back at the office he emailed the lawsuit and the photograph to the tribune the suntimes the wall street journal time newsweek and a dozen other publications david prayed the photograph would go unnoticed but wally got lucky a reporter from the tribune called the office and was immediately put through to an ecstatic attorney figg the avalanche of publicity began on the front page of section b the following morning a headline read chicago attorney attacks varrick labs over krayoxx the article summarized the lawsuit and said local attorney wally figg was a selfdescribed mass tort specialist finley amp figg was a boutique firm with a long history of fighting big drug companies the reporter though did some sniffing and quoted two wellknown plaintiffs lawyers as saying in effect weve never heard of these guys and there was no record of similar lawsuits filed by finley amp figg during the past ten years varrick responded aggressively by defending its product promising a vigorous defense and looking forward to a fair trial before an impartial jury to clear our good name the reproduced photograph was rather large this tickled wally and embarrassed david they were quite a pair wally was balding rotund and badly dressed while david was taller trimmer and much younger looking the story went wild on the internet and the phone rang nonstop at times rochelle was overwhelmed and david helped out some of the callers were reporters others were lawyers sniffing around for information but most were krayoxx users who were terrified and confused david wasnt sure what to say the firms strategy if it could be called that was to pick through the net and take the death cases then at some undefined point in the future corral the nondeath clients and lump them into a class action this was impossible to explain over the phone because david didnt quite grasp it himself as the phones rang and the excitement continued even oscar came out of his office and showed some interest his little firm had never seen such activity and well maybe this was indeed their big moment maybe wally was finally right about something maybe just maybe this could lead to real money which meant at long last the divorce he so fervently wanted followed immediately by retirement the three lawyers met at the table late in the day to compare notes wally was wired even perspiring he waved his legal pad in the air and said we got four death cases here brandnew ones and we gotta sign em up right now are you in oscar sure ill take one oscar said trying to appear reluctant as always thank you now ms gibson theres a black lady who lives on nineteenth not far from you bassitt towers number three she says its safe i will not go to bassitt towers rochelle said i can practically hear the gunfire from my apartment thats my point its right down the street from you you could stop by on the way home i will not wally slammed his legal pad onto the table cant you see whats happening here damn it these people are begging us to take their cases cases that are worth millions of bucks there could be a huge settlement within a year were on the verge of something big here and you as always couldnt care less i will not risk my neck for this law firm great so when varrick settles and the cash pours in you will forgo your share of the bonus thats what youre telling us what bonus wally walked to the front door and back to the table pacing well well how quickly we forget remember the sherman case last year ms gibson nice little car wreck a rearender state farm paid sixty grand we took a third a nice fee of twenty thousand for good ol finley amp figg we paid some bills i took seven grand oscar took seven and we gave you a thousand bucks cash under the table didnt we oscar yes and weve done it before oscar said rochelle was calculating as wally was talking it would be a shame to miss a piece of the lottery what if wally was right for a change he shut up and things were quiet and tense for a moment as the air cleared ac rose to his feet and began growling seconds passed then the distant sound of an ambulance could be heard it grew louder but oddly no one moved to the window or to the front porch had they already lost interest in their bread and butter had the little boutique firm suddenly outgrown car wrecks and moved on to a far more lucrative field how much of a bonus she asked come on ms gibson wally said exasperated i have no idea what do i tell this poor woman wally picked up his legal pad i talked to her an hour ago names pauline sutton age sixtytwo her fortyyearold son jermaine died of a heart attack seven months ago said he was a bit on the heavy side took krayoxx for four years to lower his cholesterol a charming lady but also a grieving mother take one of our brandnew krayoxx contracts for legal services explain it to her sign her up piece of cake what if she has questions about the lawsuit and settlement make an appointment and get her in here ill answer her questions whats important is getting her signed up weve created a hornets nest here in chicago every halfassed ambulance chaser in the business is now loose on the streets looking for krayoxx victims time is of the essence can you do it ms gibson i suppose thank you so much now i suggest we all hit the streets t heir first stop was an allyoucaneat pizza house not far from the office the restaurant was owned by a chain a somewhat infamous company that was suffering through a firestorm of bad press caused entirely by its menu a leading health magazine had analyzed its food and declared it all hazardous and unfit for human consumption everything was drenched with grease oils and additives and no effort was made to cook anything even remotely healthy once the food was ready it was served buffet style and offered at ridiculously low prices the chain had become synonymous with hordes of morbidly obese people feeding at its buffet troughs profits were soaring t he assistant manager was a plump young man named adam grand and he asked them to wait ten minutes before he could take a break david and wally found a booth as far away from the buffet tables as possible which wasnt far at all the booth was roomy and wide and david realized that everything in the place was oversizedplates glasses napkins tables chairs booths wally was on his cell phone eagerly lining up another meeting with a potential client david could not help but watch the enormous people digging through piles of thick pizza he almost felt sorry for them adam grand slid in beside david and said you got five minutes my boss is yelling back there wally wasted no time you told me on the phone that your mother died six months ago heart attack she was sixtysix and took krayoxx for a couple of years how about your father died three years ago sorry krayoxx perhaps no colon cancer brothers sisters one brother who lives in peru he will not be involved in any of this david and wally were scribbling away david felt as though he should say something important but had nothing on his mind he was there as the chauffeur wally was about to ask another question when adam threw a curveball say i just talked to another lawyer wallys spine straightened his eyes widened oh really whats his name he said he was a krayoxx expert and he could get us a million bucks no sweat is that true wally was ready for combat hes lying if he promised you a million bucks then hes an idiot we cant promise anything in the way of money what we can promise is that well provide the best legal representation you can find sure sure but i like the idea of a lawyer telling me how much i might get know what i mean we can get you a lot more than a million bucks wally promised now were talking how long will this take a year maybe two wally promised again he was sliding across a contract look this over its a contract between our firm and you as the legal representative of your mothers estate adam scanned it quickly and said nothing up front right oh no we front the litigation expenses forty percent for you guys is pretty steep wally was shaking his head thats the industry average all standard any lawyer doing mass torts whos worth his salt is getting percent some want but not us i think s unethical he looked at david for confirmation and david nodded and frowned at the thought of those shady lawyers out there who possessed questionable ethics i guess so adam said then signed his name wally snatched the contract and said great adam good move and welcome aboard well add this case to our lawsuit and kick things into high gear any questions yeah what should i tell this other lawyer tell him you went with the best finley amp figg youre in good hands adam david said solemnly and immediately realized he sounded like a bad commercial wally shot him a look that said seriously i guess that remains to be seen doesnt it adam said well know when the big check gets here you promised more than a million mr figg and i take you at your word you wont be sorry see you adam said and disappeared wally was stuffing his legal pad into his briefcase when he said that was easy you just guaranteed the guy something over a million is that wise no but if thats what it takes then thats what it takes heres how it works young david you sign em up get em on board keep em happy and when theres money on the table theyll forget about what you said up front say for example a year from now varrick gets sick of its krayoxx mess and throws in the towel lets say our new pal adam here is due less than a million pick a number now do you really believe that loser will walk away from that much money probably not exactly hell be one happy boy and hell forget about anything we said today thats how it works wally took a long hungry look at the buffet bars say you got plans for dinner im starving david had no plans but he would not be eating there yeah my wifes waiting for a late snack wally looked again at the troughs and the hulking masses of people grazing there he froze for a second then cracked a smile what a great idea he said complimenting himself im sorry look at those people whats the average weight i have no idea neither do i but if im a bit pudgy at those folks are well over pounds youre losing me wally look at the obvious david this place is packed with grossly overweight people half of whom are probably on krayoxx ill bet if i yelled out right now whos on krayoxx half of these poor bastards would raise their hands dont do that im not but dont you see my point you want to start handing out cards no smartass but there must be a way to screen these people for krayoxx users but theyre not dead yet it wont be long look we can add them to our second lawsuit of nondeath cases im missing something here wally help me arent we required to prove at some point that the drug actually causes some type of damage sure and well prove it later when we hire our experts right now the important thing is to get everybody signed up its a horse race out here david we gotta figure out a way to screen these folks and sign them up six oclock was approaching and the restaurant was packed david and wally had the only booth not being used for dinner a large family of four approached each holding two platters of pizza they stopped at the booth and cast menacing looks at the two lawyers this was serious business t heir next stop was a duplex in a neighborhood near midway airport david parked at the curb behind an ancient volkswagen beetle on blocks wally was saying frank schmidt age fiftytwo when he succumbed last year to a massive stroke i spoke with his widow agnes but david was only half listening he was trying to convince himself that he was really doing thisscrambling around the rough spots of chicagos southwest side with his new boss who couldnt drive because of problems after dark on the lookout for street thugs knocking on strange doors of untidy homes not knowing what was inside all in an effort to hustle clients before the next lawyer came along what would his friends from harvard law think about it how hard would they laugh but david decided he really didnt care any law job was better than his old one and most of his friends from law school were miserable he on the other hand had been liberated agnes schmidt was either hiding or not at home no one came to the door and the two lawyers hurried away as he drove david said look wally i really would like to get home and see my wife i havent seen her much in the past five years time to catch up shes very cute i dont blame you chapter within a week of filing its lawsuit the firm had a total of eight death cases a respectable number and one that would certainly make them rich because wally said it so often it had become the accepted belief that each case meant roughly half a million dollars in net fees to finley amp figg his math was shaky and riddled with assumptions that had little basis in reality at least at such a preliminary stage of the litigation but the three lawyers and rochelle began to think in terms of that kind of money krayoxx was making news around the country none of it positive and its future looked ominous as far as varrick labs was concerned the firm had worked so hard to get the cases it was a shock to realize they could actually lose one millie marino arrived at the office one morning in a foul mood and demanded to see mr figg she had hired him to probate her husbands estate and then she had reluctantly agreed to pursue a krayoxx claim for his death in wallys office behind closed doors she explained she could not resolve the fact that one lawyer in the firmoscarhad prepared a will that kept a sizable assetthe baseball card collectionout of her reach and now the other lawyerwallywas probating that same will this in her opinion was a glaring conflict of interest and downright sleazy to boot she was upset and began crying wally tried to explain that lawyers are bound by rules of confidentiality when oscar prepared the will he had to do what chester wanted and since chester wanted his baseball cards hidden until after his death then given to his son lyle so be it ethically oscar could not divulge any information to anyone about chester and his will millie didnt see it that way as his wife she had a right to know about all of his assets especially something as valuable as his cards she had already talked to a dealer and the shoeless joe card alone was worth at least the entire collection might fetch wally really didnt give a damn about the baseball cards or the estate for that matter the fee he had once contemplated was now peanuts he had a krayoxx case on the line here and he would say or do anything to keep it frankly he said gravely as he glanced at his door between the two of us i would have handled it differently but mr finley comes from the old school meaning what she asked hes pretty chauvinistic the husband is the head of the house keeper of all assets the only decision maker you know the type if the man wants to hide things from his wife nothing wrong with that me im much more liberated he followed this with a nervous laugh that was confusing but its too late she said the will has been written now its going to probate true millie but things will work out your husband left his baseball cards to his son but he left you with a beautiful lawsuit a beautiful what you know the krayoxx thing oh that yes im not too happy with that either ive talked to another lawyer and he says youre in over your head says youve never handled a case like this wally gasped for air then managed to ask in a squeaky voice why are you talking to other lawyers because he called me the other night i checked him out online hes in a big firm with offices all over the country and all they do is sue drug companies im thinking about hiring him dont do that millie these guys are famous for signing up a thousand cases then screwing their clients youll never talk to him again just some young paralegal in the back room its a scam i swear it is you can always get me on the phone i dont want to talk to you on the phone or in person either she was on her feet gathering her handbag please millie ill think about it figg but im not happy ten minutes after she left iris klopeck called and asked to borrow against her portion of the krayoxx settlement wally sat at his desk with his head in his hands and wondered what might happen next w allys lawsuit was assigned to the honorable harry seawright a reagan appointee who had been on the federal bench for almost thirty years he was eightyone anticipating retirement and not too excited about a lawsuit that could take a few years to resolve and eat up his calendar in the process but he was curious his favorite nephew had been taking krayoxx for several years with great success and no side effects at all not surprisingly judge seawright had never heard of the law firm of finley amp figg he directed his law clerk to check out the firm and the clerks email read a man ham and egg operation on preston southwest side advertises for quickie divorces duis the usual criminal domestic injury practice no record of any filings in federal court in the past years no record of jury trials in state court in past years no bar association activity they do occasionally go to courtfigg has either or duis in past years firm was once sued for sexual harassment settled seawright was incredulous he emailed his clerk these guys have no trial experience yet they filed a million lawsuit against the thirdlargest pharmaceutical company in the world the clerk responded correct judge seawright insane whats behind this the clerk krayoxx stampede its the latest and hottest bad drug in the country mass tort bar is in frenzy finley amp figg probably hopes to ride coattails all the way to a settlement judge seawright keep digging later the clerk responded the lawsuit is signed by finley amp figg but also a third lawyerdavid e zinc former associate at rogan rothberg i called a friend theresaid zinc cracked up bolted ten days ago somehow landed out there at ff no litigation experience guess he found the right place judge seawright lets watch this case closely the clerk as always v arrick labs was headquartered in a baffling series of glass and steel buildings in a forest near montville new jersey the complex was the work of a once famous architect who had since repudiated his own design it was occasionally praised as daring and futuristic but much more often it was denounced as drab hideous bunkerlike soviet style and a lot of other unkind words in several ways it resembled a fortress surrounded by trees away from the traffic and crowds protected because varrick got sued so often its headquarters seemed fitting the company was hunkered down out there in the woods braced for the next assault its ceo was reuben massey a company man who had led varrick for many years through turbulent times and always to impressive profits varrick was in a constant state of war with the mass tort bar and while other pharmaceuticals wilted or folded under waves of litigation massey managed to keep his stockholders happy he knew when to fight when to settle how to settle cheap and how to appeal to the lawyers greed while saving his company tons of money during his term varrick had survived a million settlement for a denture cream that caused zinc poisoning a million settlement for a stool softener that backfired and clogged things up a million settlement for a blood thinner that cooked a bunch of livers a billion settlement for a migraine remedy that allegedly caused high blood pressure a billion settlement for a high blood pressure pill that allegedly caused migraines a billion settlement for a painkiller that was instantly addictive and worst of all a billion settlement for a diet pill that caused blindness it was a long sad list and varrick labs had paid dearly in the court of public opinion reuben massey though continually reminded his troops of the hundreds of innovative and effective drugs they created and sold to the world what he did not talk about except in the boardroom was the fact that varrick had profited from every drug that had been targeted by the plaintiffs lawyers so far the company had won the battle even after forking over huge settlements krayoxx however could be different there were now four lawsuits the first one in fort lauderdale the second in chicago and now two new ones in texas and brooklyn massey closely monitored the workings and dealings of the mass tort bar he spent time each day with his inhouse lawyers studying the lawsuits reading the bar journals and newsletters and blogs and talking to his lawyers in big firms across the country one of the most revealing signals in any looming war was tv advertising when the lawyers began bombarding the airwaves with their sleazy getrichquick comeons massey knew varrick was in for another expensive brawl krayoxx ads were popping up everywhere the frenzy had begun massey had worried about a few of varricks other targets the migraine pill was a huge blunder and he still cursed himself for ramming it through research and approvals the blood thinner almost got him fired but he had never doubted krayoxx nor would he ever varrick had spent billion developing the drug it had been tested extensively in clinical trials in thirdworld countries the results had been spectacular its research was thorough and immaculate its pedigree was flawless krayoxx caused no more strokes and heart attacks than the daily vitamin pill and varrick had a mountain of research to prove it t he daily legal briefing was held at precisely in the varrick boardroom on the fifth floor of a building that resembled a kansas wheat silo reuben massey was a stickler for punctuality and his eight inhouse lawyers were in their seats by the team was led by nicholas walker a former us attorney former wall street litigator and the current mastermind behind every defense varrick erected to protect itself when the lawsuits began dropping like cluster bombs walker and reuben massey spent hours together coolly responding analyzing scheming and directing counterattacks when necessary massey entered the room at picked up an agenda and said whats the latest krayoxx or faladin walker asked gee i almost forgot about faladin lets stick to krayoxx for the moment faladin was an antiwrinkle cream that was allegedly causing wrinkles according to a few loudmouthed lawyers on the west coast the litigation had yet to gain momentum primarily because the lawyers were finding it difficult to measure wrinkleness before and after nicholas walker said well the gates are open snowballs rolling down the mountain pick your metaphor all hells breaking loose i chatted with alisandros at zell amp potter yesterday and theyre getting flooded with new cases he plans to push hard to establish multidistrict in florida and keep his finger on things alisandros why do the same thieves show up at every heist massey asked havent we paid them enough over the past twenty years evidently not hes built his own golf course for zell amp potter lawyers only and a few lucky friends and he invited me to come down and play eighteen holes please go nick we need to see how wisely our money is being invested by these thugs will do i got a phone call late yesterday afternoon from amanda petrocelli in reno says shes hooked her a few death clients putting together a class and will file suit either today or tomorrow i told her it really didnt matter to us when she filed suit we can expect more filings this week and next krayoxx is not causing strokes and heart attacks massey said i believe in this drug the eight lawyers nodded their heads in agreement reuben massey was not one to make bold statements or false claims he had doubts about faladin and varrick would eventually settle for a few million long before a trial number two on the legal team was a woman named judy beck another veteran of the mass tort wars she said all of us feel the same reuben our research is better than theirs if they actually have any our experts are better our proof is better our lawyers will be better perhaps its time we counterattack and throw everything we have at the enemy my thoughts exactly judy massey said you guys have a strategy nicholas walker said its evolving but for now we go through the same motions make the same public comments watch and wait and see who files what and where we look at the lawsuits study the judges and the jurisdictions and we pick our spot when the stars are all alignedthe right plaintiff the right city the right judgethen we hire the hottest gunslinger in town and push hard for a trial this has backfired you know massey said dont forget klervex that cost us two billion their miracle blood pressure pill was destined for greatness until thousands of its users developed horrific migraines theymassey and the lawyersbelieved in the drug and rolled the dice with the first jury trial which they fully expected to win in a slam dunk an overwhelming victory would dampen the tort bars enthusiasm and save varrick a ton of money the jury though felt otherwise and gave the plaintiff million this is not klervex walker said krayoxx is a much better drug and the lawsuits are much weaker i agree massey said i like your plan chapter at least twice a year and more often if possible the honorable anderson zinc and his lovely wife caroline drove from their home in st paul to chicago to see their only son and his lovely wife helen judge zinc was the chief justice of the supreme court of minnesota a position he had been honored to hold for fourteen years caroline zinc taught art and photography at a private school in st paul their two younger daughters were still in college judge zincs father and davids grandfather was a legend named woodrow zinc who at the age of eightytwo was still hard at work managing the twohundredlawyer firm hed founded fifty years earlier in kansas city the zincs had deep roots in that city but not deep enough to keep anderson zinc and his son from fleeing the harshness of working for old woodrow they wanted no part of his firm and left kansas city and this had caused a rift that was just beginning to mend another rift was brewing judge zinc did not understand his sons sudden career change and wanted to get to the bottom of it he and caroline arrived in time for a late lunch on saturday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised to see their son at home he was usually at the office downtown in a tall building on a visit the previous year they had never actually laid eyes on him he came home after midnight on a saturday then left to return to the office five hours later today though he was on a ladder cleaning the gutters he jumped down and hurried to greet them you look great mom he said as he lifted her up and spun her around put me down she said david shook hands with his father but there was no hug the zinc men did not hug each other helen appeared from the garage and greeted her inlaws she and david were both grinning goofily about something he finally said we have some big news im pregnant helen blurted you two geezers are about to be grandparents david said judge and mrs zinc took the news well they were after all in their late fifties and many of their friends were already grandparents helen was thirtythree two years older than david and well it was certainly about time wasnt it they digested this amazing news rallied nicely then offered congratulations and wanted details helen gabbed away as david unloaded their luggage and everyone moved inside over lunch the baby talk eventually subsided and judge zinc finally got down to business tell me about your new firm david he said david knew damn well his father had dug and dug and found what little there was to know about finley amp figg oh andy dont start that caroline said as if that were a raw subject that should be avoided caroline agreed with her husband and believed david had made a serious mistake but the news of helens pregnancy had changed everything for the future grandmother anyway i told you on the phone david said quickly anxious to have this discussion and get it over with he was also prepared to defend himself to fight if necessary his father chose a career that was not what old woodrow wanted david had now done the same its a small twoman firm with a general practice fifty hours a week which gives me time to fool around with my wife and keep the family name going you should be proud im delighted helen is expecting but im not sure i understand your decision rogan rothberg is one of the most prestigious law firms in the world theyve trained judges legal scholars diplomats and leaders of business and government how can you just walk away from that i didnt walk away dad i ran and im not going back i hate the memories of rogan rothberg and i think even less of the people they were eating as they spoke things were cordial andy had promised caroline he would not provoke a fight david had promised helen he would not engage in one so this new firm has two partners the judge asked two partners and now three lawyers plus rochelle the secretary receptionist office manager and a lot of other things support staff clerks paralegals interns rochelle handles all that its a small firm where we do most of our own typing and research hes actually home for dinner helen added ive never seen him so happy you look great caroline said both of you the judge was not accustomed to being outnumbered or outflanked these two partners are they trial lawyers they claim to be but i have my doubts theyre basically a couple of ambulance chasers who advertise a lot and survive on car wrecks what made you choose them david glanced at helen who looked away with a smile that dad is a long story that i will not bore you with oh its not boring helen said barely suppressing laughter what kind of money do they make the judge asked ive been there three weeks they have not shown me the books but theyre not getting rich and im sure you wanna know how much im making same answer i dont know i get a piece of what i bring in the door and i have no idea what might walk in tomorrow and youre starting a family yes and ill be home for dinner with my family and tball and cub scouts and school plays and all the other wonderful stuff parents are supposed to do with their kids i was there david i missed very little yes you were but you never worked for a sweatshop like rogan rothberg a pause as everybody took a breath david said we saved a lot well survive nicely just wait and see im sure you will his mother said switching sides completely and now fully aligned against her husband i havent started the nursery yet helen said to caroline if youd like we can go to a great shop around the corner and look at wallpaper perfect the judge touched the corners of his mouth with a napkin and said associate boot camp is just part of the routine these days david you survive that make partner and life is good i didnt sign up for the marines dad and life is never good at a huge law firm like rogan because the partners never make enough money i know these partners ive seen them for the most part theyre great lawyers and miserable people ive quit im not going back drop it it was the first flash of anger during lunch and david was disappointed in himself he drank some mineral water and took a bite of chicken salad his father smiled took a bite himself and chewed for a long time helen asked about davids two sisters and caroline jumped at the chance to change the subject over dessert his father asked pleasantly what type of work are you doing lots of good stuff this week i prepared a will for a lady whos hiding her assets from her children they suspect she inherited some money from her third husband which she did but they cant seem to find it she wants to leave everything to her fedex deliveryman i represent a gay couple who are trying to adopt a child in korea i have two deportation cases involving illegal mexicans who were caught in a drug ring i represent the family of a fourteenyearold girl whos been hooked on crack for two years and theres no place to lock her up for rehab a couple of drunkdriving clients sounds like a bunch of riffraff the judge observed no actually theyre real people with real problems who need help thats the beauty of street lawyou meet the clients facetoface you get to know them and if things work out you get to help them if you dont starve im not going to starve dad i promise besides these guys do hit the jackpot every now and then i know i know i saw them when i was practicing and i see their cases now on appeal last week we affirmed a million jury verdict a terrible case involving a braindamaged kid who got lead poisoning from some toys his lawyer was a sole practitioner who did a dui for the mother he got the case called in a gunslinger to try it now theyre splitting percent of million those numbers bounced around the table for a few minutes coffee anyone helen asked they all declined and moved to the den after a few moments helen and caroline left to inspect the guest room that was about to become a nursery when they were out of range the judge mounted his final assault one of my law clerks came across a story about the krayoxx litigation saw your picture online the one from the tribune with mr figg is he a straightup guy not really david admitted doesnt look like lets just say that wallys complicated im not sure your career will be advanced if you hang around with these guys you could be right dad but for now im having fun i look forward to getting to the office i enjoy my clients the few that i have and i am enormously relieved to be out of the sweatshop just relax a bit okay if this doesnt work out ill try something else how did you get involved in this krayoxx litigation we found some cases david smiled at the thought of his fathers reaction if he told the truth about their search for clients wally and his magnum wally offering cash bribes for client referrals wally hitting the funeral home circuit no there were things the judge should never know have you researched krayoxx the judge asked im in the process have you yes as a matter of fact the tv ads are running in minnesota the drug is getting a lot of attention looks like another mass tort scam to me pile on the lawsuits until the drugmaker is facing bankruptcy then broker a huge settlement that makes the lawyers richer and allows the manufacturer to stay in business lost in the shuffle is the issue of liability not to mention whats best for the clients thats a pretty fair summary david admitted so youre not sold on the case not yet ive plowed through a thousand pages and im still looking for the smoking gun the research to prove that the drug hurts people im not sure it does then why did you put your name on the lawsuit david took a deep breath and thought for a moment wally asked me and since im new at the firm i felt an obligation to join the fun look dad there are some very powerful lawyers around the country who have filed this same lawsuit and who believe this is a bad drug wally does not inspire a lot of confidence but other lawyers do so youre just riding their coattails hanging on for dear life dont get hurt the women were back and organizing a shopping trip david jumped to his feet and claimed to be infatuated with wallpaper the judge reluctantly tagged along d avid was almost asleep when helen rolled over and said are you awake i am now why your parents are funny yes and its time for my parents to go home that case your father mentioned about the little boy and the lead poisoning helen its five minutes after midnight the lead came from a toy and it caused brain damage right as i recall yes where is this going dear theres a lady in one of my classes toni and we had a quick sandwich last week in the student union shes a few years older kids in high school and she has a housekeeper who is from burma this is fascinating can we get some sleep just listen the housekeeper has a grandson a little boy whos in the hospital right now with brain damage hes comatose on a respirator things are desperate the doctors suspect its lead poisoning and theyve asked the housekeeper to search high and low for lead one source might be the childs toys david sat up in bed and switched on a lamp chapter rochelle was at her desk diligently tracking news of a bed linen sale at a nearby discount house when the call came a mr jerry alisandros from fort lauderdale wanted to speak with mr wally figg who was at his desk she routed the call through and returned to her online work moments later wally strutted out of his office with his patented look of selfsatisfaction ms gibson could you check flights to las vegas this weekend leaving midday friday i suppose whos going to las vegas well who else has asked about going to vegas me thats who theres an unofficial meeting of krayoxx lawyers this weekend at the mgm grand that was jerry alisandros on the phone maybe the biggest mass tort operator in the country says i need to be there is oscar in yes i think hes awake wally tapped on the door as he shoved it open he slammed it behind himself come right in oscar said as he pulled himself away from the paperwork littering his desk wally fell into a large leather chair just got a call from zell amp potter in fort lauderdale they want me in vegas this weekend for a krayoxx strategy meeting off the record all the big boys will be there to plan the attack its crucial theyll discuss multidistrict litigation which lawsuit goes first and most important settlement jerry thinks that varrick might want a quick endgame on this one wally was rubbing his hands together as he spoke jerry alisandros the legendary tort lawyer his firm made a billion off fenphen alone so you want to go to las vegas wally shrugged as if he could take it or leave it i dont care anything about going oscar but its imperative that someone from our firm show up at the table they might start talking money settlement big bucks oscar this thing could be closer than we realize and you want the firm to pay for your trip to vegas sure its a legitimate litigation expense oscar ruffled through a pile of papers and found what he wanted he lifted it and sort of waved it at his junior partner have you seen davids memo it came in last night the one about the projected costs of our krayoxx litigation no i didnt know he was the guys very bright wally hes doing the homework that you should be doing you need to take a look at this because its scary as hell we need at least three experts on board now not next week in fact we shouldve had them lined up before you filed suit the first expert is a cardiologist who can explain the cause of death of each of our beloved clients estimated cost to hire one is and thats just for the initial evaluation and deposition if the cardiologist testifies at trial add another its not going to trial thats what you keep saying number two is a pharmacologist who can explain to the jury in great detail exactly how the drug killed our clients what did it do to their hearts this guy is even pricier initially and the same if he testifies at trial that sounds high all of it sounds high number three is a research scientist who can present to the jury the findings of his study that will show by a preponderance of the evidence that statistics prove youre much likelier to suffer heart damage while taking krayoxx than some other cholesterol drug i know just the guy is it mcfadden thats him great he wrote the report that started this frenzy and now hes a bit reluctant to get involved in the litigation however if a law firm will fork over an initial retainer of he might favor the law firm with a lending hand thats outrageous its all outrageous please look at davids memo wally he summarizes the backlash against mcfadden and his work there are some serious doubts about whether this drug actually causes harm what does david know about litigation what do we know about litigation wally youre talking to me your longtime partner not some prospective client we bark and growl about hauling bad guys into the courtroom but you know the truth we always settle and were going to settle now oscar trust me ill know a whole lot more when i get back from vegas how much will that cost peanuts in the scope of things were in over our heads wally no were not well piggyback with the big boys and make a fortune oscar r ochelle found a much cheaper room at the spirit of rio motel the photos on its web site were of stunning views of the vegas strip and it was easy to get the impression that its guests were in the thick of things they were not as wally realized when the airport shuttle van finally stopped the tall sleek casinohotels were visible but fifteen minutes away wally cursed rochelle as he waited in the saunalike lobby to check in a standard room at the mgm grand was a night at this dump it was a twonight savings that almost covered his airfare pinching pennies while waiting on a fortune wally told himself as he climbed two flights of stairs to his rather small room he couldnt rent a car because of his dui conviction and lack of a valid license he asked around and learned that another shuttle ran from the spirit of rio to the strip every thirty minutes he played dollar slots in the lobby and won maybe this was his lucky weekend the shuttle was packed with overweight retirees wally couldnt find a seat so he stood clutched the handrails rocked along in bodily contact with sweaty people and as he glanced around he wondered how many might be krayoxx victims high cholesterol was definitely on display he had business cards in his pockets as always but he let it pass he roamed the casino for a while watching closely as an astonishing variety of people played blackjack roulette and craps games hed never played and had no desire to try now he killed some time at a slot machine and twice said no thanks to a comely cocktail waitress wally was beginning to realize that a casino was a lousy place for a recovering drunk at pm he found his way to a banquet room on the mezzanine two security guards blocked the door and wally was relieved when they found his name on the list inside there were two dozen or so welldressed men and three women engaged in light chatter over drinks a buffet dinner was being arranged along a far wall some of the lawyers knew each other but wally was not the only rookie in the crowd they all seemed to recognize his name and they all knew about his lawsuit before long he was beginning to fit in jerry alisandros sought him out and they shook hands like old friends others crowded around then little pockets of conversation peeled off here and there they talked about lawsuits politics the latest in private jets homes in the caribbean and who was getting divorced and remarried wally had little to add but he gamely hung on and proved to be a good listener trial lawyers prefer to do all the talking and at times they all talked at once wally was happy to just grin listen and sip his club soda after a quick dinner alisandros stood and began the conversation the plan was to meet at nine the following morning in the same room and get down to business they should be finished by noon he had spoken several times with nicholas walker at varrick and obviously the company was shellshocked in its long and colorful history of litigation it had never been hit so fast and so hard with so many lawsuits it was scrambling to get some sense of the damage according to experts hired by alisandros the potential pool of injured or dead could be as high as half a million this newsof so much misery and sufferingwas well received around the table the potential cost to varrick according to yet another expert hired by alisandros was at least billion wally was fairly certain he was not the only one at the table who did a quick multiplication percent of billion the others though seemed to take it all in stride another drug another war with big pharma another massive settlement that would make them even richer they could buy more jets more homes more trophy wives assets wally cared nothing for all he wanted was a chunk in the bank enough cash to make life enjoyable and free from the daily grind in a roomful of considerable egos it was only a matter of time before someone else wanted the floor dudley brill from lubbock boots and all plunged into the retelling of a recent conversation with a highranking varrick defense lawyer in houston who strongly implied that the company had no plans to settle until after the drugs liability was tested before a few juries therefore based on brills analysis of a conversation no one else in the room knew about he was of the firm opinion that he dudley brill of lubbock texas should lead the first trial and do so in his hometown where the jurors had proven they loved him and would fork over huge sums if he asked for them brill had obviously been drinking as had everybody else but wally and his selfserving analysis touched off a furious debate around the dinner table before long several skirmishes were under way with tempers flaring and insults being traded jerry alisandros managed to bring order i was hoping we could save all of this for tomorrow he said diplomatically lets retire now go to our separate corners and come back tomorrow all sobered up and rested f rom the looks of things the following morning not all of the trial lawyers went to their rooms and to bed puffy eyes red eyes hands grabbing cold water and coffeethe signs were there there was no shortage of hangovers there were not as many lawyers either and as the morning dragged on wally began to realize a lot of business had been conducted over drinks late the night before deals had been cut alliances forged backs stabbed wally wondered where he stood two experts talked about krayoxx and the most recent studies each lawyer spent a few minutes talking about his or her lawsuitnumber of clients number of potential client deaths versus injuries judges opposing counsel and verdict trends in the jurisdiction wally winged it nicely and said as little as possible an incredibly boring expert dissected the financial health of varrick labs and deemed the company fit enough to sustain huge losses from a krayoxx settlement the word settlement was used frequently and was always ringing in wallys ears the same expert became even more tedious when analyzing the various insurance coverages varrick had in force after two hours wally needed a break he eased out and went to find a restroom when he returned jerry alisandros was waiting outside the door when are you headed back to chicago he asked in the morning wally replied flying commercial of course wally thought i do not have my own jet so like most poor americans im forced to pay for a ticket on a jet owned by someone else sure he said with a smile look wally im headed to new york this afternoon why dont you hitch a ride my firm just bought a brandnew gulfstream g well have lunch on the plane and drop you off in chicago there would be a price to pay a deal to be cut but wally was looking for one anyway he had read about rich trial lawyers and their private jets but it had never crossed his mind that he would see the inside of one thats very generous he said sure meet me in the lobby at pm okay you got it t here were a dozen or so private jets lined up on the deck at mccarran fields general aviation center as wally followed his new pal jerry past them he wondered how many were owned by the other mass tort boys when they got to jerrys he climbed the steps took a breath then stepped inside the gleaming g a striking asian girl took his coat and asked what he wanted to drink just club soda jerry alisandros had a small entourage with himan associate two paralegals and an assistant of some kind they huddled briefly in the rear of the cabin as wally settled into the rich leather seat and thought about iris klopeck and millie marino and those wonderful widows whose dead husbands had led wally into the world of mass torts and now to this the flight attendant handed wally a menu down the aisle far away he could see a kitchen with a chef just waiting as they taxied jerry made his way to the front and sat down opposite wally what do you think he asked raising his hands to take in his latest toy sure beats commercial wally said jerry howled with laughterno doubt the funniest thing hed ever heard a voice announced takeoff and they all buckled their seat belts as the jet left the runway and shot upward wally closed his eyes and tried to savor the moment it might never happen again as soon as they began to level off jerry came to life he popped a switch and pulled a mahogany table out of the wall lets talk business he said its your plane wally thought sure how many cases do you realistically expect to sign up we might get ten death cases we have eight now nondeath im not sure we have a pool of several hundred potential cases but we havent screened them yet jerry frowned as if this werent enough not worth his time wally wondered if he might order the pilot to turn around or open a hatch somewhere have you thought about teaming up with a bigger firm jerry asked i know you guys dont do a lot of mass tort work sure im open to that discussion wally replied trying to conceal his excitement that had been his plan since the beginning my contracts provide for a contingency fee of percent how much do you want in our typical deal we front the expenses and these are not cheap cases we find the doctors experts researchers whomever and they cost a fortune we take half the fee percent but the expenses are paid back to us before any split of the fee that sounds fair whats our role in this simple find more cases death and nondeath round em up ill send a draft of an agreement on monday im trying to piece together as many cases as possible the next big step is the creation of an mdlmultidistrict litigation the court will appoint a plaintiffs trial committee usually five or six seasoned lawyers who will control the litigation that panel is entitled to an additional fee usually around percent and this comes off the top and out of the lawyers portion wally was nodding along hed done some research and knew the ins and outs most of them will you be on the trial committee he asked probably i usually am the flight attendant brought fresh drinks jerry took a sip of wine and continued when discovery starts well send someone to help with the depositions of your clients no big deal pretty routine legal work keep in mind wally that the defense firms see this as a gold mine too so they work the cases hard ill find a cardiologist we can trust one wholl screen your clients for damage well pay him out of the litigation fund any questions not now wally said he was not pleased to be giving away half the fee but he was delighted to be in business with an experienced and deeppocketed tort firm there would still be plenty of money for finley amp figg he thought of oscar and couldnt wait to tell him about the g whats your best guess for the timeline wally asked in other words when can i expect some money a long satisfying pull of the wine and based on my experience which as you know wally is quite vast i expect well reach a settlement in twelve months and start disbursing money right away who knows wally in a year or so you might have your own airplane chapter nicholas walker flew with judy beck and two other varrick lawyers to chicago on one of the companys corporate jets a gulfstream g that was just as new as the one that had so thoroughly impressed wally the purpose of their trip was to fire their old law firm and hire a new one walker and his boss reuben massey had hammered out the details of a master plan to deal with their krayoxx mess and the first major battle would take place in chicago first though they had to get the right people in place the wrong people belonged to a firm that had represented varrick labs for a decade and their work had always been considered topnotch their shortcoming was not their fault according to the exhaustive research done by walker and his team there was another firm in the city with closer ties to judge harry seawright and this firm happened to have a partner who was the hottest defense lawyer in town her name was nadine karros a fortyfouryearold litigation partner who had not lost a jury trial in ten years the more she won the more difficult her cases became and the more impressive her victories after chatting with dozens of attorneys who had faced her in court and lost nick walker and reuben massey decided that ms karros would lead the defense of krayoxx and they didnt care what it would eventually cost first though they had to convince her during a long teleconference she had seemed ambivalent about taking charge of a major case that was expanding daily not surprisingly she already had too much work on her desk her trial calendar was booked and so on she had never been involved in a mass tort case though as a pure litigator this was not much of an obstacle walker and massey knew her recent string of courtroom wins included a wide range of issuesgroundwater contamination hospital negligence the midair collision of two commuter planes as an elite courtroom advocate nadine karros could handle any case before any jury she was a partner in the litigation section of rogan rothberg on the eightyfifth floor of the trust tower with a corner office with a view of the lake though she seldom enjoyed it she met the varrick crew in a large conference room on the eightysixth floor and after everyone had a quick gawk at lake michigan they settled in for what was expected to be a twohour meeting minimum on her side of the table ms karros had the usual complement of young associates and paralegals a veritable entourage of grimfaced minions ready to say how high when she said jump to her right was a male litigation partner named hotchkin her righthand man l ater in a phone call to reuben massey nicholas walker would report shes very attractive reuben long dark hair strong chin and teeth beautiful hazel eyes that are so warm and inviting you think this is the woman i want to take home to meet momma a very pleasant personality quick with a nice smile a deep rich voice like one youd expect from an opera singer easy to see why jurors are so taken with her but shes tough no doubt about that reuben she takes charge and gives orders and you get the impression that those around her are fiercely loyal id hate to face this woman in court reuben so shes the one reuben asked no question i found myself looking forward to the trial just to watch her in action legs oh yes the package slender dressed like something out of a magazine you should meet her as soon as possible i t was her turf so ms karros quickly assumed control of the meeting she nodded to hotchkin and said mr hotchkin and i presented your proposal to our fee committee my rate will be an hour out of court in court with an initial retainer of million nonrefundable of course nicholas walker had been negotiating fees with elite lawyers for two decades and he was shockproof and how much for the other partners he asked calmly as if his company could handle anything she threw at them which in fact it could eight hundred an hour five hundred for associates she replied agreed he said everyone in the room knew the cost of defense would run into the millions in fact walker and his team had already pegged their initial estimate at to million peanuts when youre getting sued for billions with the air clear on what it would cost they moved on to the next important matter nicholas walker had the floor our strategy is simple and its complicated he began simple in that we pick a case from the myriad of those filed against us an individual case not a class action and we push hard for a trial we want a trial we are not afraid of a trial because we believe in our drug we believe and we can prove that the research being relied upon by the tort boys is deeply flawed we are convinced that krayoxx does what it is supposed to do and it does not increase the risks of heart attack or stroke we are certain of this so certain that we want a jury one right here in chicago to hear our evidence and soon we are confident the jury will believe us and when the jury rejects the attack on krayoxx when the jury finds in our favor the battlefield will change dramatically frankly we think the tort bar will scatter like leaves in the wind theyll cave it might take another trial another victory but i doubt it in short ms karros we hit them hard and fast with a jury trial and when we win theyll go home she listened without taking notes when he finished she said indeed thats pretty simple and not altogether original why chicago the judge harry seawright weve researched every judge in every krayoxx case filed so far and we think seawright is our man hes shown little patience for mass torts he despises frivolous lawsuits and junk filings he uses his rocket docket to ram cases through discovery and get them to trial he refuses to allow cases to gather dust his favorite nephew uses krayoxx and most important his close friend is former us senator paxson who now has an office on i believe the eightythird floor here at rogan rothberg are you suggesting we could somehow influence a federal judge she asked with her left eyebrow slightly arched of course not walker said with a nasty grin whats the complicated part of your plan deception we create the impression that we intend to settle the krayoxx cases weve been down this road before believe me so we know quite a lot about mass settlements we understand the greed of the tort bar and it is enormous beyond imagination once they believe that billions are about to hit the table the frenzy will get much worse with a settlement looming the preparation for a major trial will become less important why bother to prepare when the cases are about to settle weyouon the other hand are working diligently to get ready for the trial in our scheme judge seawright will crack the whip and the case will move along quickly at the perfect moment the settlement negotiations will collapse the mass tort bar will be in chaos and well be staring at a trial date that seawright will refuse to move nadine karros was nodding smiling enjoying the scenario im sure you have a case in mind she said oh yes theres a local divorce lawyer named wally figg who filed the first krayoxx case here in chicago not much of a lawyer threeman firm nickelanddime stuff down on the southwest side almost zero trial experience and absolutely none in the mass tort arena now hes hooked up with a lawyer in fort lauderdale named jerry alisandros a longtime nemesis whose goal in life is to sue varrick at least once a year alisandros is a force can he try a case nadine asked already thinking about the trial his firm is zell amp potter and they have some competent trial lawyers but they rarely go to trial their specialty is forcing companies to settle and raking in enormous fees at this point we have no idea who would show up here and actually handle the trial they might bring in a local lawyer to walkers left judy beck cleared her throat and began somewhat nervously alisandros has already filed a motion to consolidate every krayoxx case into an mdl multidistrict litigation and we understand mdl hotchkin broke in sharply of course alisandros has a favorite federal judge in southern florida and his mo is to create the mdl get himself appointed to the plaintiffs steering committee then control the litigation he of course receives extra compensation for being on the committee nick walker took up the narrative initially we would resist all efforts to consolidate the cases our plan is to select one of mr figgs clients and convince judge seawright to assign it to his rocket docket what if the judge in florida orders consolidation of all cases and wants them down there hotchkin asked judge seawright is a federal judge walker said the case has been filed in his court if he wants to try it here no one not even the supreme court can order him to do otherwise nadine karros was scanning a summary that had been passed around by the varrick team she said so if i follow things we select one of mr figgs dead clients and we convince judge seawright to extract this case from the group then assuming the judge goes along we respond rather softly to the lawsuit admit nothing issue bland denials take an easy approach to discovery because we dont want to slow things down take a few depositions give them whatever documents they want and sort of lead them down the primrose path until they wake up and realize they have a real trial on their hands meanwhile you lull them into a false sense of security with the illusion of another jackpot thats it nick walker said exactly t hey spent almost an hour discussing mr figgs dead clientschester marino percy klopeck wanda grand frank schmidt and four others as soon as the lawsuit was properly answered ms karros and her team would depose the legal representatives of the dead eight once they had the opportunity to observe and learn they would make the decision about which one to isolate and push toward a trial the matter of young david zinc was dealt with quickly though he had worked at rogan rothberg for five years he was no longer employed there no conflict of interest existed because at the time the firm did not represent varrick and zinc did not represent the dead clients nadine karros had never met him indeed only one associate on her side of the table could recall ever knowing who he was zinc had worked in international finance a world away from litigation z inc was now working in the world of street law and happy to be even further away from international finance very much on his mind these days was the burmese housekeeper and her leadpoisoned grandson he had a name a phone number and an address but making contact had proved difficult toni helens friend had suggested to the grandmother that the family consult a lawyer but this had terrified the poor woman to the point of tears she was emotionally spent confused and for the moment unapproachable her grandson remained on life support david had contemplated running the case by his two partners but quickly thought better of it wally might go charging into the hospital room and frighten someone to death oscar might insist on taking charge of the case and then want an extra percentage in the event of a settlement as david was learning his two partners did not split money equally and according to rochelle fought over fees points were given for the lawyer who made initial contact more for the lawyer who worked up the file and so on according to rochelle on almost every decent car wreck oscar and wally quibbled over the split david was at his desk drafting a simple will for a new clienttyping it himself because rochelle had informed him weeks earlier that three lawyers were far too many for one secretarywhen his email chimed with a note from the federal court clerk he opened the email and found an answer to their amended complaint his eyes went straight to the attorney register straight to the name of nadine karros of rogan rothberg and he felt faint david had never met her but he certainly knew her by reputation she was famous throughout the entire chicago bar she tried and won the biggest cases of all he had never uttered a recorded word in court but there they were names listed together as if they were equals for the plaintiffswallis t figg b oscar finley david e zinc of the firm of finley amp figg along with s jerry alisandros of the firm of zell amp potter and for varrick laboratories nadine l karros and r luther hotchkin of the firm of rogan rothberg on paper david looked as if he belonged in the game he read the answer slowly the obvious facts were admitted all liability was denied overall it was a straightforward almost benign response to a million lawsuit and it was not what they had anticipated according to wally the first response from varrick would be a vicious motion to dismiss accompanied by a weighty brief prepared by bright ivy leaguers who toiled in the firms research department the motion to dismiss would cause a significant skirmish but they would prevail because such motions were rarely granted according to wally along with the answer the defense filed a set of basic interrogatories that sought personal information about each of the eight dead clients and their families and requested the names and general testimonies of the expert witnesses as far as david knew they had yet to hire experts though jerry alisandros was believed to be in charge of that ms karros also wanted to take the eight depositions as soon as possible according to the clerk a hard copy of the answer and other filings was in the mail david heard heavy footsteps on the stairs wallys he lumbered in panting and said you see what they filed just read it david answered seems rather tame dont you think what do you know about litigation ouch sorry somethings up i gotta call alisandros and figure this thing out its just a simple answer and some discovery nothing to panic over whos panicked you know this womanit is your old law firm never met her but shes supposed to be terrific in the courtroom yeah well so is alisandros but we aint going to court he said this with a noticeable lack of conviction he left the office mumbling and stomped down the stairs a month had passed since they had filed the lawsuit and wallys dreams of a quick gold strike were fading it looked as though they would be required to do a little work before the settlement talks began ten minutes later david received an email from the junior partner it read can you get started on those interrogatories i gotta run down to the funeral home sure wally id love to chapter the minor charges against trip were eventually dropped due to a lack of interest though the court did require him to sign a statement promising to stay away from the firm of finley amp figg and its lawyers trip vanished but his exgirlfriend did not deeanna arrived minutes before pm her usual time on this day she was dressed like a cowgirlskintight jeans boots with pointed toes a tight red blouse upon which she had neglected to fasten the top three buttons is wally in she cooed at rochelle who couldnt stand her the cloud of perfume caught up with her and settled into the room causing ac to sniff then growl and retreat even farther under the desk hes in rochelle said dismissively thanks dear deeanna said trying to irritate rochelle as much as possible she strutted to wallys office and entered without knocking a week earlier rochelle had instructed her to sit and wait like all the other clients it was becoming apparent though that she had far more clout than the other clients at least as far as wally was concerned once inside the office deeanna walked into the arms of her lawyer and after a long kiss with an embrace and the obligatory fondle wally said you look great baby all for you baby she said wally checked to make sure the door was locked then returned to his swivel chair behind his desk i need to make two calls then were outta here he said drooling anything baby she cooed then she took a seat and pulled out a celebrity gossip magazine she read nothing else and was as dumb as a rock but wally didnt care he refused to judge her shed had four husbands hed had four wives who was he to pass judgment right now they were in the process of trying to kill each other in bed and wally had never been happier outside rochelle was tidying up her desk anxious to leave now that that hooker was in mr figgs office and who knew what they were doing in there oscars door opened and he emerged holding some paperwork wheres figg he asked looking at figgs closed door in there with a client rochelle said doors bolted and locked dont tell me yep third day in a row are they still negotiating his fee dont know he mustve raised it though the fee was smalljust a typical nofault divorce caseoscar was due a portion of it but he wasnt sure how to get his split when half was being paid on the sofa he stared at wallys door for a moment as if waiting for the sounds of passion and hearing none turned to rochelle and waved the papers have you read this what is it its our agreement with jerry alisandros and zell amp potter eight pages long lots of fine print already signed by my junior partner obviously without being read in its entirety says here that we must contribute to help front the litigation expenses figg never mentioned this to me rochelle shrugged it was lawyer business not hers but oscar was hot further it says that we get a fee of percent on each case half of which goes to zell amp potter but in the fine print it says that a fee of percent is paid to the plaintiffs litigation committee a little bonus to the big shots for their hard work and the percent comes off the top of the settlement and out of our portion so as i figure it we lose percent off the top and that gives us percent to split with alisandros who of course will get a chunk of the percent does this make sense to you ms gibson no that makes two of us were getting screwed right and left and now we must put up for litigation expenses oscars cheeks were red and he kept looking at wallys door but wally was safe inside david came down the steps and walked into the conversation have you read this oscar asked angrily waving the contract what is it our contract with zell amp potter i looked over it david said its pretty straightforward oh it is did you read the part about the upfront money for expenses yes and i asked wally about that he said wed probably just go to the bank hit the firms line of credit then pay it back when we settle oscar looked at rochelle who looked back at oscar both were thinking what line of credit oscar started to speak then abruptly wheeled around and returned to his office slamming the door after himself whats that all about david asked we dont have a line of credit rochelle said mr finleys worried that the krayoxx litigation will backfire and kill us financially this wouldnt be the first time one of figgs schemes blew up in our faces but it could certainly be the biggest david glanced around and took a step closer can i ask you something in confidence i dont know she said taking a cautious step back these guys have been at this game for a long time thirty plus years for oscar twenty plus for wally do they have some money stashed away somewhere you dont see any around the office so i figured they must have some buried rochelle glanced around too then said i dont know where the money goes when it leaves here i doubt if oscar has a dime because his wife spends everything she thinks shes a cut or two above and wants to play that game wally who knows i suspect hes as broke as i am but they do own the building free and clear david couldnt help but look at the cracks in the ceiling plaster let it go he told himself just curious david said there was a shriek of female laughter from deep inside mr figgs office im leaving david said grabbing his overcoat me too rochelle said e veryone was gone when wally and deeanna emerged they quickly turned off the lights locked the front door and got in her car wally was delighted to have not only a new squeeze but also one who was willing to drive he had six weeks left on his suspension and with krayoxx so hot he needed to be mobile deeanna had jumped at the chance to earn referral fees cash for a death case and for a nondeathbut what really thrilled her was listening to wallys predictions of taking down varrick labs in a massive settlement that would bring in huge fees for him and perhaps something for her as well though this wasnt exactly out in the open yet more often than not their pillow talk drifted away to the world of krayoxx and all it could mean her third husband had taken her to maui and she loved the beach wally had already promised a vacation in paradise at that stage of their involvement wally would have promised her anything where to dear she said racing away from the office she was a dangerous driver in a little mazda convertible and wally knew his chances would be slim in a collision just take it easy he said ratcheting down the seat belt lets go north toward evanston are we hearing from these people she asked oh yes lots of phone calls and wally wasnt lyinghis cell phone rang constantly with inquiries from people who had picked up his little beware of krayoxx brochure he had printed ten thousand and was littering chicago with them he tacked them on bulletin boards in weight watchers meeting rooms vfw posts bingo parlors hospital waiting rooms and the restrooms of fastfood restaurantsanywhere the shrewd mind of wally figg thought there might be people battling high cholesterol so how many cases do we have she asked wally did not miss the we part of her question he wasnt about to tell her the truth eight death cases several hundred nondeath but they have to be tested first im not sure every nondeath case is really a case gotta find some damage to the heart before we take on the case how do you do that they were flying along the stevenson dodging traffic most of which she didnt appear to notice wally was ducking with each near miss take it easy deeanna were not in a hurry he said youre always bitching about my driving she said as she gave him a long sad look just watch the road and slow down she eased off the gas and pouted for a few minutes as we were saying how do you know if these people have been damaged well hire a doctor to screen them krayoxx weakens the heart valves and there are some tests that can tell us if a client has been harmed by the drug how much are the tests she asked wally was noticing a growing curiosity into the economics of their krayoxx litigation and it was slightly irksome about a thousand bucks a pop he said though he had no idea jerry alisandros had assured him that zell amp potter had already retained the services of several doctors who were screening potential clients these doctors would be made available to finley amp figg in the near future and once the testing began their pool of nondeath clients would expand greatly alisandros was on a jet every day zipping across the country meeting with lawyers like wally piecing together big lawsuits here and there hiring experts plotting trial strategies and most important hammering away at varrick and its lawyers wally felt honored to be a player in such a highstakes game thats a lot of money deeanna said why are you so concerned about the money wally snapped glancing down at her unbuttoned cowgirl shirt im sorry wally you know im the nosy type this is all so exciting and stuff and well itll be so awesome when varrick starts writing those big checks that could be a long way off lets just concentrate on rounding up the clients a t the finley home oscar and his wife paula were watching a mash rerun on cable when they were suddenly confronted with the shrill voice and anxious face of a lawyer named bosch who was no stranger to cable commercials in the chicago market for years bosch had been pleading for car wrecks and tractortrailer accident victims and cases involving asbestos and other products and now evidently bosch had become an expert on krayoxx he thundered on about the dangers of the drug and said vile things about varrick labs and throughout the entire thirty seconds his phone number was pulsating across the bottom of the screen oscar watched with great curiosity but said nothing paula said have you ever thought about advertising on television oscar seems like your firm needs to do something to get more business this was not a new conversation for thirty years paula had dispensed unsolicited advice on how to run the law office a place that would never generate enough in revenue to satisfy her its very expensive oscar said figg wants to pursue it im skeptical well you certainly couldnt put figg on television could you that would scare away every potential client for a hundred miles i dont know the ads just seem so unprofessional typical of paula tv advertising might bring in some business and at the same time it was unprofessional was she for it or against it neither or both oscar didnt know and hed stopped caring years earlier doesnt figg have some krayoxx cases she asked a few yes oscar grunted she did not know that oscar as well as david had signed the lawsuit and was responsible for its prosecution she did not know that the firm was on the line for litigation expenses paulas only concern was the paltry monthly draw brought home by oscar well i discussed it with my doctor and he says the drug is fine it keeps my cholesterol under two hundred i am not getting off the drug then you should not he said if krayoxx did in fact kill people he wanted her to keep taking the full daily dosage but there are lawsuits everywhere oscar im still not convinced are you shes loyal to the drug but shes worried about the drug figg is convinced the drug causes damages oscar said a lot of big law firms agree and theyre going after varrick the general feeling is that the company will settle before going to trial too much at risk so if theres a settlement what happens to figgs cases theyre all death cases so far eight of them if they settle then well collect some nice fees how nice its impossible to say oscar was already making plans if and when the settlement talk became serious he would move out file for divorce then try to keep her away from his krayoxx money but i doubt theyll settle he said why not bosch here says there might be a big settlement bosch is an idiot and he proves it every day these big pharmaceuticals usually go to trial a few times to test the waters if they get hammered by juries then they start settling if they win they keep trying the cases until the plaintiffs lawyers give up this could take years dont get your hopes up dear d avid and helen zinc had been almost as amorous as wally and deeanna with david working shorter hours and their newfound energy it had taken less than a week to become pregnant now that david was home at a decent hour every night they made up for lost time they had just finished a session and were lying in bed watching latenight tv when bosch appeared on their screen when he was gone helen said looks like a frenzy oh yes wallys out there somewhere right now littering the streets with brochures it would be easier to advertise on television but we cant afford it thank god for that i really dont want to see you onscreen fighting it out with the likes of benny bosch i think id be a natural as a tv lawyer have you been injured we fight for you insurance companies fear us whatta you think i think your friends at rogan rothberg would howl with laughter i have no friends there only bad memories youve been gone what a month six weeks and two days and i have not for one moment wanted to go back and how much have you earned with your new firm six hundred and twenty dollars and counting well we do have an expansion under way have you thought about future earnings things like that you walked away from a year fine but we cant live on a month do you doubt me no but a little reassurance would be nice okay i promise you ill make enough money to keep us happy and healthy all three of us or four or five or whatever and how do you plan to do this tv ill go on the air to find krayoxx victims david said laughing me and bosch whatta you think i think youre crazy they were both laughing then groping chapter the official name of the gathering was a discovery conference and it was typically a brief lawyers gettogether in front of the judge to discuss the initial stages of the lawsuit no record was kept just informal notes taken by a clerk often and especially in the courtroom of harry seawright the judge himself begged off and sent a magistrate to pinchhit today however judge seawright was presiding as the senior judge in the northern district of illinois he had a large courtroom a splendid and spacious layout on the twentythird floor of the dirksen federal building on dearborn street in downtown chicago the courtroom was lined with dark oakpaneled walls and there were plenty of thick leather chairs for the various players on the right side and to the judges left was the plaintiffs team of wally figg and david zinc on the left side and to the judges right was the team of about a dozen or so rogan rothberg lawyers toiling away on behalf of varrick laboratories their leader of course was nadine karros the only female lawyer present and for the occasion she was modeling a classic armani navy suit skirt just above the knees nude legs and designer platform pumps with fourinch heels wally couldnt take his eyes off the shoes the skirt the entire package maybe we should come to federal court more often hed quipped to david who was in no mood for humor nor was wally to be honest for both of them it was their first venture into a federal courtroom wally claimed he handled cases in federal court all the time but david was doubtful oscar senior partner who was supposed to be there with them taking on the twin goliaths of rogan rothberg and varrick had called in sick oscar wasnt the only noshow the great jerry alisandros and his team of worldclass litigators were all lined up to blast into chicago for an impressive display of strength but a lastminute emergency hearing in boston had become more important wally freaked out when he got the call from one of alisandross underlings its just a discovery conference the young man said driving to court wally had expressed skepticism about zell amp potter for david the moment was extremely uncomfortable he was sitting in a federal courtroom for the first time knowing that he would not say a word because he had no idea what to say and his opposition was a team of welldressed and highly skilled lawyers from a firm hed once been loyal to a firm that had recruited him trained him paid him a top salary and promised him a long career and a firm that he had jilted rejected in favor of finley amp figg he could almost hear them snickering behind their legal pads david with his pedigree and harvard diploma belonged over there where they billed by the hour not on the plaintiffs side where you beat the streets looking for clients david did not want to be where he was nor did wally judge seawright settled himself into his perch and wasted no time wheres mr alisandros he growled in the direction of wally and david wally jumped to his feet offered a greasy smile and said hes in boston sir so he will not be here today thats right your honor he was on his way but got sidetracked with some emergency in boston i see hes an attorney of record for the plaintiffs in this case the next time we get together tell him to be here i will fine him for missing the conference yes sir and youre mr figg thats correct your honor and this is my associate david zinc david tried to smile he could almost see every rogan rothberg lawyer craning to have a look welcome to federal court the judge said sarcastically he looked at the defense and said i suppose youre ms karros she stood and every eye in the courtroom locked onto her i am your honor and this is my cocounsel luther hotchkin who are all of those other people this is our defense team your honor do you really need all these people for a simple discovery conference give em hell wally thought still staring at the skirt we do indeed your honor this is a large and complicated case so ive heard you may keep your seats for the remainder of this hearing judge seawright picked up some notes and adjusted his reading glasses now ive spoken to two of my colleagues in florida and we are not sure if these cases will proceed in a multidistrict litigation it appears as if the plaintiffs lawyers are having some difficulty getting themselves organized many it seems want a bigger piece of the pie which is not surprising at any rate we have no choice but to proceed with discovery in this case mr figg who are your experts mr figg had no experts and had no idea when he might retain them he was relying on the increasingly unreliable jerry alisandros to find the experts because thats what he promised to do wally stood slowly knowing that any hesitation would look bad well have them next week your honor as you know we are partnering with the law firm of zell amp potter a wellknown firm specializing in mass torts and with the flurry of activity around the country its been difficult to lock up the best experts but were definitely making progress thats nice please sit down so you actually filed this lawsuit before you consulted with any experts well yes your honor and thats not unusual judge seawright doubted if mr figg knew what was usual or unusual but he decided not to embarrass the guy this early in the game he picked up a pen and said you have ten days to designate your experts then the defense will be allowed to depose them without delay yes sir wally said falling back into his chair thank you now we have eight death cases here so were dealing with eight families to start with i want you to take the depositions of the personal representatives of all eight mr figg when can you make these people available tomorrow wally said the judge turned to nadine karros and said that soon enough she smiled and said we prefer reasonable notice your honor im sure you have a busy trial calendar ms karros as always yes and you also have unlimited resources i count eleven lawyers taking notes right now and im sure there are hundreds more back at the firm these are just depositions nothing complicated so on wednesday of next week youre going to depose four of the plaintiffs and on thursday youll do the other four two hours max per plaintiff if you need more time well do them later if you cant be there ms karros just pick out five or six from your squad and im sure they can handle the depositions ill be there your honor she said coolly mr figg well be there ill get my clerk to arrange the time schedule details and well email it to you by tomorrow then as soon as mr figg designates his experts we will schedule their depositions ms karros when your experts are in place please provide the necessary information and well go from there i want these initial depositions out of the way within sixty days any questions there were none he continued now i have reviewed three other lawsuits involving this defendant and its products and frankly im not impressed with varricks integrity or its ability to abide by the rules of discovery the company it seems has a great deal of trouble turning over documents to the other side it has been caught redhanded concealing documents it has been sanctioned by judges at the state and federal levels it has been embarrassed before juries and paid dearly with large verdicts yet it continues to hide documents at least three times its executives have been charged with perjury ms karros how can you assure me that your client will play by the rules she glared at the judge paused for a moment in a staredown then said i was not the attorney for varrick labs in those other cases your honor and i dont know what happened there i will not be tainted by lawsuits i had nothing to do with i know the rules inside and out and my clients always play by the rules well see your client needs to be warned that i am watching closely at the first hint of a discovery violation i will haul the ceo into this courtroom and draw blood do you understand me ms karros i do mr figg you have not yet made a request for documents when might this happen were working on that now your honor wally said with as much confidence as possible we should have it in a couple of weeks alisandros had promised an exhaustive list of documents to be sought from varrick but had yet to come through im waiting on you seawright said this is your lawsuit you filed it now lets get going yes sir wally replied anxiously anything else he asked most of the lawyers shook their heads his honor seemed to relax somewhat as he chewed on the cap of his pen he said im thinking this case might do well under local rule have you considered this mr figg mr figg had not because mr figg was not aware of local rule he opened his mouth but only dry came forth david quickly picked up the flag and spoke his first words in court weve considered that your honor but we have not yet discussed it with mr alisandros we should make a decision within the week seawright looked at nadine karros and said and your response we are the defense your honor and we are never eager to go to trial her candor amused the judge wally whispered to david what the hells rule david whispered back the rocket docket streamline the case balls to the wall we dont want that do we wally hissed no we want to settle and cash in no need to file a motion mr figg his honor said im placing this case in status on the fast track mr figg so lets get things moving along yes sir wally managed to mumble judge seawright tapped his gavel and said well meet again in sixty days and i expect mr alisandros to be here adjourned a s david and wally were stuffing files and notepads into their briefcases in hopes of a fast exit nadine karros sauntered over for a quick hello nice to meet you mr figg mr zinc she said with a smile that made wallys nervous heart skip another beat a pleasure he said david returned the smile as he shook her hand this promises to be a long bruising fight she said with a lot of money on the table i try to keep things on a professional level and hard feelings at a minimum im sure your firm feels the same way oh yes wally gushed and almost asked her to go have a drink david wasnt as easily manipulated he saw her as a pretty face and a warm facade but just below the surface was a ruthless combatant who would enjoy watching you bleed in open court i guess ill see you next wednesday she said if not sooner wally said a lame attempt at humor as she stepped away david grabbed wally by the arm and said lets get out of here chapter now that helen was expecting and her future would be consumed with the baby her studies at northwestern seemed less important she dropped one class because of morning sickness and she was struggling with motivational problems in most of her others david was pushing her delicately but she wanted to take a break she was almost thirtyfour thrilled at the prospect of becoming a mother and losing interest quickly in a doctorate in art history on a frigid day in march they were having lunch in a cafe near the campus when toni vance helens friend from class happened to drop by david had met her only once she was ten years older and had two teenagers and a husband who had something to do with containerized shipping she also had the burmese housekeeper with a grandson who was alive but probably brain damaged david had urged helen to push toni to arrange a meeting but the housekeeper had not been cooperative snooping without violating laws or anyones privacy david had learned that the little boy was five years old and for the past two months had been in intensive care at the lakeshore childrens hospital on chicagos north side his name was thuya khaing and he had been born in sacramento so he was a us citizen as for his parents david had no way of knowing their immigration status zaw the housekeeper supposedly had a green card i think zaw would talk to you now toni said as she sipped an espresso when and where david asked she glanced at her watch my next class is over at two then ill go home why dont you guys stop by at david and helen parked behind a jaguar in the driveway of a striking contemporary house in oak park whatever mr vance did with containerized cargo he did it well the house jutted here and there up and down with lots of glass and marble and no discernible design it tried desperately to be unique and it succeeded greatly they finally located the front door and were met by toni whod found time to change outfits and was no longer trying to look like a twentyyearold student she led them to a sunroom with full views of the sky and clouds and moments later zaw entered with a tray of coffees introductions were made david had never met a burmese woman but he guessed her age at sixty she was petite in her maids uniform with short graying hair and a face that seemed locked into a perpetual smile her english is very good toni said please join us zaw zaw awkwardly sat on a small stool near her boss how long have you been in the united states david asked twenty year and you have family here my husband is here work for sears my son too work for tree company and hes the father of the grandson whos in the hospital she nodded slowly the smile vanished at the mention of the boy yes does the boy have brothers and sisters she flashed two fingers and said two sister have they been sick too no okay can you tell me what happened when the boy got sick she looked at toni who said its okay zaw you can trust these people mr zinc needs to hear the story zaw nodded and began talking her eyes glued to the floor he get real tired all the time sleep a lot then bad pain here she tapped her stomach he cry so hard because of the pain then he start to vomit every day he vomit and he lose weight get real skinny we take him to doctor they put him in hospital and he go to sleep she touched her head they think he has brain problem did the doctor say it was lead poisoning she nodded yes no hesitation david nodded too as he let this soak in does your grandson live with you next door apartment he looked at toni and asked do you know where she lives rogers park its an old apartment complex i think everyone there is from burma zaw is it possible for me to see the apartment where the boy lives she nodded yes why do you need to see the apartment toni asked to find the source of the lead could be in the paint on the walls or in some of his toys it might be in the water i should have a look zaw rose quietly and said excuse me please a few seconds later she was back with a small plastic bag from which she removed a set of pink plastic teeth complete with two large vampire fangs he like these zaw said he scare his sisters make funny noise david held the cheap toy the plastic was hard and some of the coloring or paint had chipped off did you see him play with these yes many time when did he get these last year halloween she said without the h sound i dont know if it make him sick but he use them all the time pink green black blue many color so theres a whole set of these yes where are the others apartment i t was spitting snow when david and helen found the apartment complex after dark the buildings were sstyle blocks of plywood and tar paper a few bricks on the steps a few shrubs here and there all the units were two stories some with boarded windows and obviously abandoned there were a few vehicles all ancient imports from japan it was easy to get the impression that the place would have been condemned with bulldozers to follow but for the heroic efforts of the burmese immigrants zaw was waiting at b and led them a few steps to c thuyas parents looked to be about twenty years old but were really closer to forty they looked exhausted sad eyed and as frightened as any parents would be they were appreciative that a real lawyer would come to their home though they were terrified of the legal system and understood nothing about it the mother lwin hurried about preparing and serving tea the father zaws son went by soe and as the man of the house did most of the talking his english was good much better than his wifes as zaw had said he worked for a company that did all manner of tree work his wife cleaned offices downtown it was obvious to both david and helen that there had been a lot of discussion before their arrival the apartment was sparsely furnished but neat and clean the only effort at decor was a large photograph of aung san suu kyi the nobel peace prize winner and most famous dissident in burma something was on the stove in the kitchen and its pungent aroma reeked of onions in the car the zincs had vowed not to stay for dinner in the unlikely event they were invited thuyas two sisters were not to be seen or heard the yellowish tea was served in tiny cups and after a sip or two soe said why do you want to talk to us david took his first sip hoped it would be his last and said because if your son has in fact been poisoned by lead and if the lead came from a toy or something here in the apartment then you mayand i emphasize the word mayhave a case against the maker of the dangerous product i would like to investigate this matter but i am making no promises you mean we could get money possibly thats the purpose of the case or lawsuit but first we need to dig a little deeper how much money here of course wally would promise them anything david had heard him promiseor practically guaranteea million or more to several of his krayoxx clients i cant answer that david said its too early i would like to investigate see if we can put together a case and take it one step at a time helen was watching her husband with admiration he was doing a fine job in an arena where he knew nothing and had no experience hed never seen a lawsuit at rogan rothberg okay soe said what now two things david said first id like to have a look at his thingstoys books bedanything that might be a source of lead second i need for you to sign some papers that will allow me to begin accumulating his medical records soe nodded at lwin who reached into a small box and removed a plastic ziploc bag she opened it and on the small coffee table lined up five pairs of fake teeth and fangsblue black green purple and red zaw added the pink ones from the afternoon visit and the set was complete these called nasty teeth soe said david stared at the row of nasty teeth and for the first time felt the twinge of excitement of a big lawsuit he picked up the green oneshard but pliable plastic flexible enough to open and close easily he had no trouble seeing a pesky little brother with these in his mouth growling and snapping at his sisters your son played with these david asked lwin nodded sadly soe said he like them kept them in his mouth tried to eat dinner with them one night who bought them david asked i did soe said i bought a few things for halloween cost not too much where did you buy them david asked almost holding his breath he hoped for an answer like walmart kmart target sears macyssome chain with deep pockets at market soe said what market big mall near logan square helen said probably the mighty mall and davids excitement waned a bit the mighty mall was a hodgepodge of cavernous metal buildings housing a maze of cramped stalls and booths where one could find almost anything of legal value and many items from the black market cheap clothing household goods old albums athletic gear counterfeit cds used paperbacks fake jewelry toys games a million things the low prices attracted large crowds virtually all business was in cash record keeping and receipts were not priorities did these come in a package david asked a package would provide the name of the manufacturer and maybe the importer yes but it gone soe said in garbage long time ago no package lwin added the apartment had two bedroomsone used by the parents the other by the children david followed soe as the women stayed in the den thuyas bed was a small mattress on the floor near his sisters the children had a small cheap bookcase filled with coloring books and paperbacks next to it was a plastic tub filled with boy toys this his soe said pointing to the tub may i look through it david asked yes please david dropped to his knees and slowly went through the boxaction figures race cars airplanes a pistol and handcuffs the usual assortment of inexpensive toys for a fiveyearold boy when he stood he said ill look at these later for now just make sure that everything stays here back in the den the nasty teeth were ziplocked again david explained that he would send them to an expert on lead poisoning and have them evaluated if the teeth did indeed contain unsuitable levels of lead then they would meet again and discuss the lawsuit he cautioned that it might be difficult to pin down the maker of the toys and he tried to dampen any enthusiasm for the thought of one day collecting money the threezaw lwin and soeseemed as puzzled and apprehensive when the zincs were leaving as theyd been when they arrived soe was on his way to the hospital to spend the night with thuya t he following morning david sent by overnight parcel the set of nasty teeth to a lab in akron its director dr biff sandroni was a leading expert on lead poisoning in children he also sent a check for not from finley amp figg but from his personal bank account david had yet to discuss the case with his two bosses and planned to avoid doing so until more was known sandroni called two days later to say he had received the package and the check and that it would be a week or so before he could get around to testing the teeth he was keenly interested because he had never seen a toy designed to be placed in the mouth virtually every toy he examined was one that a child chewed on for whatever reasons the likely sources of the toy were china mexico and india and without the package it would be virtually impossible to determine the importer and manufacturer sandroni was a big talker and went on about his most significant cases he testified all the timelove the courtroomand took full responsibility for several milliondollar verdicts he called david david and insisted on being called biff as david listened he could not remember another conversation with someone named biff the bluster would have worried david but for his research into leadpoisoning experts dr sandroni was a warrior with impeccable credentials a t the next saturday morning david and helen found the mighty mall and parked in a crowded lot traffic was thick the place already busy it was thirty degrees outside and not much warmer inside they waited in a long line for beverages bought two tall cups of hot cocoa then began roaming as chaotic as the market appeared there was some semblance of organization the food vendors were near the front with such takeaway delicacies as pronto pups doughnuts and cotton candy drawing fans then a stretch of booths offering inexpensive clothing and shoes another long aisle was lined with books and jewelry then furniture and auto parts the shoppers as well as the vendors were of all shades and colors along with english and spanish there were many other languages asian tongues something from africa then a loud voice that was probably russian david and helen moved with the crowd stopping occasionally to inspect something of interest after an hour and with the hot cocoa growing cooler they found the household goods section then the toys there were three booths offering thousands of cheap gadgets and playthings none of which resembled a set of nasty teeth the zincs were well aware they were months away from halloween and were unlikely to find costumes and such david picked up a package containing three different dinosaurs all small enough for a toddler to chew on but too large to swallow all three were painted shades of green only a scientist like sandroni could scrape off the paint and test for lead but after a month of exhaustive research david was convinced that most of the cheapest toys were contaminated the dinosaurs were sold by larkette industries mobile alabama and made in china he had seen the name larkette as a defendant in several lawsuits as he held the dinosaurs his mind was carried away by the absurdity of it all a cheap toy is made five thousand miles away for pennies decorated with lead paint imported into the united states passed along the distribution system until it lands here in a giant flea market where its offered for where its purchased by the poorest customers taken home presented to the child who chews on it then ends up in a hospital brain damaged and ruined for life where are all of those consumer protection laws inspectors bureaucrats not to mention the hundreds of thousands of dollars required to treat the child and support him for his lifetime you buy the tiny hispanic woman barked no thanks david said coming back to reality he placed the toys back in the pile and turned away any sign of nasty teeth he asked as he stepped behind helen not a thing im freezing lets get out of here chapter as scheduled by judge seawrights clerk the depositions of finley amp figgs krayoxx clients began promptly at am in a ballroom of the downtown marriott since the defendant varrick labs was picking up the tab for the depositions there was a generous spread of rolls and pastries along with coffee tea and juice a long table had been arranged with a video camera at one end and a witness chair at the other iris klopeck was the first witness she had called the day before and rode in an ambulance to the hospital where they treated her for arrhythmia and hypertension her nerves were shot and she told wally several times she could not go through with the lawsuit he mentioned more than once that if she could tough it out she would soon be receiving a large check probably a million bucks and this helped somewhat also helping was a supply of xanax so when iris took the witness chair and looked at the legion of lawyers she was fairly glassyeyed and drifting off to lala land still she at first froze and looked helplessly at her lawyer its just a deposition wally had repeated therell be a lot of lawyers there but theyre nice people for the most part they didnt look nice to her left was a line of intense young men in dark suits and frowns they were already scratching away on their yellow legal pads and she hadnt said a word the nearest lawyer to her was an attractive woman who smiled and helped iris settle down to her right were wally and his two sidekicks the woman said ms klopeck my name is nadine karros and im the lead lawyer for varrick labs were going to take your deposition over the next two hours and i want you to try to relax i promise i will not try to trick you if you dont understand a question dont answer it ill just repeat it are you ready yes iris said seeing double next to iris was a court reporter who said raise your right hand iris did so then swore to tell the truth ms karros said now ms klopeck im sure your attorneys have explained that we are making a video of your deposition and this might be used in court if for some reason youre unable to testify do you understand this i think so so if youll look at the camera when you talk well do just fine ill try yes i can do that great ms klopeck are you currently taking any medication iris stared at the camera as if waiting for it to tell her what to say she took eleven pills a day for diabetes blood pressure cholesterol erratic heartbeat arthritis kidney stones and a few other ailments but the one she worried about was xanax because it could affect her mental state wally had suggested she skip any discussion about xanax if asked the question and here right off the bat ms karros was digging she giggled sure im on a lot of meds it took fifteen minutes to straighten them out with no help from the xanax and just when iris got to the bottom of the list she remembered another one and blurted and i used to take krayoxx but not anymore that stuffll kill you wally roared with laughter oscar thought it was funny too david suppressed a chuckle by looking directly across the table at the stonefaced boys from rogan rothberg not a single one of whom would allow himself even a grin but nadine smiled and said is that all ms klopeck i think so she said still not sure so youre taking nothing that would affect your judgment memory or ability to give truthful answers iris glanced at wally who hid behind a legal pad and for a second it was obvious that something was going unsaid thats correct iris said nothing for depression stress panic attacks anxiety disorders it was as if ms karros were reading iriss mind and knew she was lying iris was about to choke when she said not normally ten minutes later they were still grappling with not normally and iris finally admitted that she popped a xanax every now and then she proved sufficiently elusive though when ms karros tried to pin her down on her xanax use she stumbled when she referred to the drug as her happy pills but plowed on in spite of her thick tongue and drooping eyelids iris assured the wall of lawyers to her left that she was clearheaded and ready to roll address birth dates family members employment education the deposition quickly sank into tedium as nadine and iris fleshed out the klopeck family with emphasis on percy the departed iris with increasing lucidity managed to choke up twice when talking about her beloved husband dead now for almost two years ms karros probed into percys health and habitsdrinking smoking exercise dietand as much as she tried to whip the old boy into shape iris did a fair job of portraying him with accuracy percy came across as a fat sick man who ate bad food drank too much beer and rarely left the sofa but he quit smoking iris added at least twice they took a break after an hour and oscar excused himself saying he had to be in court but wally was suspicious he had armtwisted his senior partner to show up at the depositions sort of a show of force in the face of the ground troops rogan rothberg would send in though it was doubtful the presence of oscar finley would rattle the defense when fully manned the finley amp figg side of the table had three lawyers now minus one ten feet away on the other side wally counted eight seven lawyers to sit and take the same notes while one did the talking ridiculous but then wally began thinking as iris droned on that perhaps the show of force was a good thing perhaps varrick was so worried that they had instructed rogan rothberg to spare no expense maybe finley amp figg had them on the ropes and didnt realize it when they resumed the deposition nadine prompted iris to begin talking about percys medical history and wally zoned out he was still irritated that jerry alisandros had once again skipped the proceedings at first alisandros had big plans to attend the depositions with his entourage to make his first dramatic entrance into the case to do battle with rogan rothberg and stake out some turf but another lastminute urgency this one in seattle proved more important its only depositions alisandros told an agitated wally on the phone the day before pretty basic stuff basic indeed iris was talking about one of percys old hernias davids role was limited he was there as a warm body a real lawyer taking up space but with little to do but scribble and read he was reviewing an fda study on lead poisoning in children occasionally wally would politely say objection calls for conclusion the lovely ms karros would stop and wait to make sure wally was finished then she would say you may answer ms klopeck and by then iris would tell her all she wanted to hear judge seawrights strict twohour time limit was obeyed ms karros asked her last question at then graciously thanked iris for being such a good witness iris was going for her purse where the xanax was kept wally walked her to the door and assured her she had done a superb job when do you think theyll want to settle she whispered wally put a finger to his lips and shoved her out next up was millie marino widow of chester and stepmother of lyle the inheritor of the baseball card collection and wallys initial source of information about krayoxx millie was fortynine attractive somewhat fit reasonably well dressed and apparently unmedicated a far cry from the last witness she was there for her depo but she was still not a believer in the lawsuit she and wally were still bickering over her late husbands estate she was still threatening to pull out of the lawsuit and find another lawyer wally had offered to guarantee in writing a milliondollar settlement ms karros asked the same questions wally made the same objections david read the same memo and thought only six more after this one a fter a quick lunch the lawyers reconvened for the deposition of adam grand the assistant manager of an allyoucaneat pizza house whose mother had died the previous year after taking krayoxx for two years it was the same pizza house wally now frequented but only to secretly leave copies of his beware of krayoxx brochures in the restrooms nadine karros took a break and her number two luther hotchkin handled the deposition nadine though apparently loaned him her questions because he asked the same ones during his insufferable career at rogan rothberg david had heard many tales about the boys in litigation the litigators were a breed apart wild men who gambled with huge sums of money took enormous risks and lived on the edge in every large law firm the litigation section was the most colorful and filled with the biggest characters and egos that was the urban legend anyway now as he glanced occasionally across the table at the solemn faces of his adversaries he had serious doubts about the legend nothing he had ever experienced in his career was as monotonous as sitting through depositions and this was only his third one he almost missed the drudgery of plodding through the financial records of obscure chinese corporations ms karros was taking a break but she missed nothing this early round of depositions was nothing more than a little contest a pageant to provide her and her client the opportunity to meet and examine the eight contestants and select a winner could iris klopeck withstand the rigors of an intense twoweek trial probably not she was stoned during her depo and nadine had two associates already working on her medical records on the other hand some jurors might have great sympathy for her millie marino would make an impressive witness but her husband chester could potentially have the strongest link to heart disease and death nadine and her team would finish the depos watch them again and again and slowly eliminate the better ones they and their experts would continue to dissect the medical records of the eight victims and eventually select the one with the weakest claim when they picked their winner they would race to court with a thick coldblooded and wellreasoned motion to separate they would ask judge seawright to take the single case they wanted place it on his rocket docket and clear all obstacles between it and a trial by jury m inutes after pm david bolted from the marriott and almost ran to his car he was punchdrunk and needed his lungs full of cold air leaving downtown he stopped at a starbucks in a strip mall and ordered a double espresso two doors down was a party store that advertised costumes and favors and as had become his habit he wandered over for a look no party store was safe from him or helen these days they were searching for a set of nasty teeth in the wrapper with names of corporations in fine print this one had the usual inventory of cheap costumes gag gifts decorations glitter toys wrapping paper there were several sets of vampire teeth made in mexico and sold by a company called mirage novelties of tucson he was familiar with mirage even had a small file on the company privately owned sales last year of million most of its products along the same lines of what david was now inspecting he had files on dozens of companies that specialized in cheap toys and gadgets and his research was growing daily what he had not found was another set of nasty teeth he paid three bucks for a set of fangs to add to his growing collection then drove to the brickyard mall where he met helen at a lebanese restaurant over dinner he refused to describe his daythe same ordeal was planned for tomorrowso they chatted about her classes and not surprisingly the coming addition to their family lakeshore childrens hospital was nearby they found the icu then found soe khaing in a visitors room he had relatives with him and introductions were made though neither david nor helen caught a single name the burmese were visibly touched that the zincs would stop by and say hello thuyas condition had changed little in the past month the day after their visit to the familys apartment david had contacted one of the doctors after he emailed the paperwork signed by soe and lwin the doctor was willing to talk the boys outlook was bleak the level of lead in his body was highly toxic with substantial damage to his kidneys liver nervous system and brain he was in and out of consciousness if he survived it would take months or years to gauge the level of impaired brain activity normally though with this much lead children did not survive david and helen followed soe down the hall past a nurses station and to a window where they could see thuya strapped to a small bed and hooked to an astonishing assortment of tubes lines and monitors his breathing was aided by a respirator i touch him once a day he hear me soe said then wiped the moisture from his cheeks david and helen stared through the window but could think of nothing to say chapter another aspect of bigfirm life that david had learned to despise was the endless meetings meetings to evaluate and review to discuss the firms future to plan everything to greet new lawyers to say goodbye to old ones to stay current on the law to mentor rookies to get mentored by senior partners to talk about compensation labor issues and an endless list of other incredibly boring topics the rogan rothberg culture was nonstop work and nonstop billing but there were so many useless meetings that the making of money was actually often impeded with that in mind david reluctantly suggested his new firm have a meeting hed been there four months and had settled into a comfortable routine he was worried though about the lack of civility and communication among the other members of the firm the krayoxx litigation was dragging on wallys dreams of a quick jackpot were fading and revenue was down oscar was increasingly more irritable if that was possible in gossiping with rochelle david learned that the partners never sat around the table to think strategically and to air complaints oscar said he was too busy wally said such a meeting was a waste rochelle thought the idea was awful until she realized she would be invited then she became enamored with the idea as the only nonlawyer employee she thought the idea of being allowed a soapbox was appealing with time david was able to cajole the senior and junior partners and finley amp figg scheduled its inaugural firm meeting they waited until pm then locked the front door and put the phones on hold after a few awkward moments david said oscar as the senior partner i think you should run the meeting what do you want to talk about oscar shot back glad you asked david said as he quickly passed around an agenda number fee schedule number case review number filing number specialization this is just a suggestion david said frankly i dont care what we talk about but its important for each of us to be able to unload you spent too much time in a big firm oscar said so whats bugging you wally asked david nothings bugging me its just that i think we could do a better job of keeping our fees uniform and reviewing each others cases the filing system is twenty years out of date and as a firm were not going to make money if we dont specialize well speaking of money oscar said picking up a notepad since we filed these krayoxx cases our gross has declined for three straight months were spending far too much time on those cases and our cash is getting low thats whats bugging me he was staring at wally the payoffs coming wally said thats what you keep saying well settle the groomer car wreck next month and net around twenty grand its not unusual to go through a dry period oscar hell youve been doing this a long time you know the ups and downs last year we lost money nine months outta twelve and we still showed a nice profit there was a loud knock on the front door wally jumped to his feet and said oh no its deeanna sorry guys i told her to take the day off he raced to the door and opened it she made her entranceskintight black leather pants hookers heels tight cotton sweater wally said hey honey were having a little meeting what say you wait in my office how long she asked not long deeanna smiled like a tart at oscar and david as she strutted by wally led her to his office and closed her inside he sat down at the table slightly embarrassed know whats bugging me rochelle asked her she nodded toward wallys office why does she have to stop by every afternoon you used to see clients after five oscar jumped in now youre just locked in there with her shes not bothering anyone wally said and not so loud she bothers me rochelle said wally raised both palms arched his eyebrows and was instantly ready for a brawl look she and i are getting serious and its none of your business got that im not going to discuss it further there was a pause as everyone took a breath then oscar launched another round i suppose youve told her about krayoxx and the big settlement thats just around the corner so its not surprising shes hanging around right i dont talk about your women oscar wally fired back women more than one rochelles eyes widened and david remembered all the good reasons for hating firm meetings oscar glared at wally in disbelief for several seconds both men appeared stunned at their exchange lets move along david said id like permission to study our fee structure and attempt to come up with a proposed schedule that will aim for uniformity any objections there were none on a roll david quickly passed around some sheets of paper this is a case ive stumbled across and it has great potential nasty teeth oscar said looking at a color photo of the collection yep the client is a fiveyearold boy in a coma from lead poisoning his father purchased this set of teeth and fangs last halloween and the kid kept them in his mouth for hours the various paint colors are loaded with lead page is a preliminary report from a lab in akron where one dr biff sandroni examined the teeth his conclusion is at the bottomall six sets of plastic teeth are coated with lead dr sandroni is an expert on lead poisoning and he says this is one of the worst products hes come across in the last twentyfive years he thinks the teeth were probably made in china and imported by one of the many lowend toy companies here in the states chinese factories have a terrible history of coating a million different products with lead paint the food and drug administration and the bureau of consumer protection scream and order recalls but its impossible to monitor everything rochelle looking at the same handout as oscar and wally said that poor child is he gonna make it the doctors think not theres substantial damage to his brain nervous system and many of his organs if he lives hell be a very sad sight whos the manufacturer wally asked thats the big question ive been unable to find another set of nasty teeth in chicago and helen and i have been poking around for a month nothing online nothing in suppliers catalogs so far no clue its possible that the product shows up at halloween only the family did not keep the package there must be similar products wally said i mean if the company makes crap like this then surely it makes crap like fake mustaches and such thats my theory im accumulating a nice collection of similar items and im researching the importers and manufacturers who paid for this report oscar asked suspiciously i did twentyfive hundred bucks this caused a gap in the conversation as all four looked at the report finally oscar asked have the parents signed a contract with our firm no theyve signed a contract with me so i could get the medical records and begin the investigation theyll sign one with the firm if i ask them to the question is simply this does finley amp figg take this case if the answer is yes then we need to spend some money how much oscar asked the next step is to hire sandronis outfit to go into the apartment where the boy and his family live and look for lead it could be in other toys paint on the walls thats chipping even in the drinking water ive been to the apartment and its at least fifty years old sandroni needs to isolate the source of the lead hes fairly confident we have the source but he wants to exclude everything else and how much does that cost oscar asked twenty thousand oscars jaw dropped and he shook his head wally whistled and scattered the sheets of paper only rochelle was hanging on and she really didnt have a vote when the issue was spending money with no defendant theres no lawsuit oscar said why burn cash investigating this when you dont know who to sue ill find the manufacturer david said great and when you do then we have ourselves a lawsuit maybe the door to wallys office rattled then opened deeanna took a step out and said wally how much longer baby just a few minutes wally said were almost finished here but im tired of waiting okay okay ill be there in a minute she slammed the door and the walls shook i guess shes now running the firm meeting rochelle observed knock it off wally said to rochelle then to david he continued i like this case david i really do but with the krayoxx litigation in full swing we cant commit to spending big money on another case i say you put this on hold maybe keep looking for the importer and after we settle krayoxx well be in a great position to pick and choose youve got this family signed up this kid aint going anywhere lets keep it on a leash and crank it up next year d avid was in no position to argue both partners had said no rochelle would say yes if she had a vote but she was losing interest fair enough david said then i would like to pursue it myself in my spare time with my own money and under the protection of my own malpractice policy you have your own policy oscar asked no but ill get one easy enough what about the twenty grand wally asked according to the financials here youve grossed less than in the last four months true but each month has exceeded the prior one plus i have a little cash in the bank im willing to roll the dice and try to help this little boy its not about helping a little boy oscar shot back its about financing the lawsuit i agree with wally why not put it off for a year because i dont want to david replied this family needs help now wally shrugged and said then go for it i have no objections fine with me oscar said but i want to see an increase in your monthly gross youll see one wallys door opened again and deeanna stormed out she stomped across the room hissed the word bastard under her breath then yanked open the front door snarled dont call me in the general direction of the table and shook the walls again when she slammed the door behind her she has a temper wally observed what a class act rochelle said softly you cant be getting serious with her wally oscar said almost pleading she falls under the category of my business and not yours wally said anything left on the agenda im tired of this meeting nothing else from me david said meeting adjourned the senior partner announced chapter the great jerry alisandros finally made his appearance on the chicago stage of his grand war against varrick and his arrival was impressive first he landed in the gulfstream g that wally was still dreaming of second he brought with him an entourage that rivaled the one that surrounded nadine karros when she went to court with zell amp potter front and center the playing field seemed level third he had the skill experience and national reputation one would never find at finley amp figg oscar skipped the hearing because he wasnt needed wally couldnt wait to get there so he could strut in with his stud cocounsel david tagged along out of curiosity nadine karros her team and her client had selected iris klopeck as their guinea pig though neither her attorneys nor iris herself had the slightest whiff of the master scheme varrick had filed a motion to separate the plaintiffs cases to make eight different lawsuits out of one and to keep the litigation in chicago instead of having it lumped with thousands of other cases in the brandnew multidistrict litigation in southern florida the plaintiffs lawyers opposed these motions strenuously thick briefs had been swapped the mood was tense when the squads of lawyers gathered in judge seawrights courtroom as they waited a clerk came forth and announced that the judge was delayed by some urgent matter but should be out in half an hour david was loitering near the plaintiffs table chatting with a zell amp potter associate when a defense lawyer slid over for a contrived hello david vaguely recognized him from somewhere in the halls of rogan rothberg but he had tried hard to forget those people im taylor barkley the guy said on top of a quick handshake harvard two years ahead of you a pleasure david said then introduced barkley to the zell amp potter lawyer he had just met for a few minutes they chatted about the cubs and the weather and finally got around to the issue at hand barkley claimed to be working around the clock as rogan was getting slammed with krayoxx work david had lived that life and survived it and he had no desire to hear it again should be a hell of a trial david said to fill in a gap barkley snorted as if he had the inside scoop what trial he said these cases will never get near a jury you know that dont you he asked looking at the zell amp potter associate barkley continued half under his breath because the place was crawling with wired lawyers well defend like hell for a while pad the file rack up some obscene fees then advise our dear client to settle youll figure out this game zinc if you stay in it long enough im catching on david said watching every word he and the zell amp potter associate were both on their heels absorbing but not believing for what its worth barkley said in a whisper youre almost a legend around rogan these days a guy with the balls to walk away go find an easier job now sitting on a pile of cases that are a gold mine were still slaving away by the hour david just nodded hoping he would go away the courtroom deputy suddenly came to life and ordered everyone to stand judge seawright swept in from behind the bench and ordered everyone to sit good morning he said into his mike as he arranged his papers we have a lot of ground to cover in the next two hours and as always brevity with words will be appreciated i am monitoring discovery and it appears as though things are proceeding on course mr alisandros do you have any complaints about discovery jerry stood proudly because everyone was watching he had long gray hair swept back over his ears and bunched around his neck his skin was well tanned and his customtailored suit hung perfectly on his lean frame no sir your honor not at this time and i am delighted to be in your courtroom welcome to chicago ms karros do you have any complaints with discovery she stood in her light gray silk and linen dress vneck empire waist tight down the slender legs long below the knee with black platform pumps and all eyes feasted upon her david was looking forward to the trial just to watch the fashion show wally was drooling your honor we exchanged lists of experts this morning so everything is in order she said her voice rich her diction perfect very well seawright said that leads to the biggest issue of the daythat of where these cases will be tried the plaintiffs have filed a motion to move all the cases to join the multidistrict litigation in federal court in miami the defendant objects and not only prefers to keep the cases here in chicago but also to separate them try them one at a time beginning with the estate of one percy klopeck now deceased these issues have been thoroughly and exhaustively briefed ive read every word at this point ill allow remarks by both sides beginning with the attorneys for the plaintiffs jerry alisandros walked with his notes to a small podium in the center of the courtroom directly in front of and several feet below judge seawright he carefully arranged his papers cleared his throat and began with the typical if it pleases the court f or wally it was the most exciting moment in his career to think he a hustler from the southwest side was sitting in federal court watching great lawyers do battle over cases he had found and filed cases he was responsible for cases he had createdit was almost too much to behold as he suppressed a grin he felt even better when he touched his midsection and slid a finger under his belt down fifteen pounds sober for days the lost weight and clear head were no doubt linked to the indescribable fun he and deeanna were having in bed he was eating viagra driving a new convertible jaguar new to him but slightly used and financed over sixty months and feeling twenty years younger as he buzzed around chicago with the top down he dreamed endlessly of his krayoxx money and the glorious life ahead he and deeanna would travel and lie on beaches and he would work only when necessary he had already decided that he would specialize in mass torts forget the humdrum of the street the cheap divorces and drunk drivers and go for the big money he was certain he and oscar would split frankly after twenty years it was time though he loved him like a brother oscar had no ambition no vision no real desire to step up his game he and oscar had already had a conversation about how to hide their krayoxx money so his wife would see little of it oscar would go through a bad divorce and wally would be there to support him but when it was over the partners would split it was sad but inevitable wally was going places oscar was too old to change j erry alisandros got off to a bad start when he tried to argue that judge seawright had no choice but to transfer the cases to miami these cases were filed in chicago not miami the judge reminded alisandros no one made you file them here i suppose you couldve filed them anywhere you can find varrick labs which i presume is in any of the fifty states im having trouble understanding why a federal judge in florida thinks he can order a federal judge in illinois to transfer his cases down there can you help me here mr alisandros mr alisandros could not he tried valiantly to suggest that nowadays in mass tort litigation it is customary to establish multidistrict litigation and have only one judge preside over all the cases customary but not mandatory seawright seemed irritated that someone anyone would suggest that he was required to move the cases they were his d avid sat behind wally in a row of chairs in front of the bar he was enthralled by the drama of the courtroom the pressure the high stakes but he was also worried because it was apparent judge seawright was against them on this issue however alisandros had assured their team that winning these initial motions was not crucial if varrick labs wanted to try a single test case in chicago and to do so quickly then so be it he had never run away from a trial in his career bring it on the judge though seemed hostile why was david worried there would be no trial right all the lawyers on his side of the aisle believed secretly fervently that varrick labs would settle its krayoxx mess long before the trials started and if barkley on the other side could be believed the defense lawyers were also thinking settlement was it a rigged game was this how the mass tort business really worked a bad drug gets discovered the plaintiffs lawyers go into a frenzy rounding up the cases lawsuits are filed the big defense firms respond with an endless supply of expensive legal talent both sides slug it out until the drugmaker gets tired of writing fat checks to its lawyers then everything gets settled the plaintiffs lawyers rake in huge fees and their clients get far less than they expected when the dust settles the lawyers on both sides are richer the company cleans up its balance sheet and develops a replacement drug was this nothing more than good theater j ust as jerry alisandros began to repeat himself he sat down the lawyers perked up as nadine karros stood and walked to the podium she had a few notes but didnt use them since it was obvious the judge agreed with her she kept her arguments brief she spoke in long eloquent sentences as if they had been written down with plenty of forethought her words were clear her voice carried nicely around the courtroom nothing was wastedno extra verbiage no useless gestures the woman was meant for the stage from several angles she made the point that there was no case no rule of procedure no precedent anywhere that required a federal judge to transfer one of his cases to another federal judge a fter a few moments david was wondering if he would actually get to watch ms karros in action before a jury did she know at that very moment there would be no trial was she just going through the motions at an hour a month earlier varrick labs reported its quarterly earnings which were down significantly the company surprised analysts by writing off billion for the projected costs of ongoing litigation primarily krayoxx david was following this closely in financial publications and blogs opinion was split between those who thought varrick labs would hurry and clean up its mess through a massive settlement and those who thought the company might try to weather the storm through hardball litigation the stock price pingponged between and per share so the stockholders seemed reasonably calm he was also studying the history of mass tort litigation and found it surprising the number of times that a defendant corporations stock rose impressively when it settled and got rid of a bunch of lawsuits there was normally a dip in the stock price with the first wave of bad news and hysterics from the plaintiffs bar but as battle lines were formed and the numbers became firm wall street seemed to prefer a good settlement what wall street hated was squishy liability the kind that was often seen when a big case was handed over to a jury and the results were unpredictable in the past ten years virtually all of the major mass tort cases involving pharmaceuticals had been settled and for billions on one hand david was finding comfort in the research but on the other it had turned up little in the way of credible proof that krayoxx did all the terrible things it was accused of doing a fter a thorough and fair debate judge seawright had heard enough he thanked the lawyers for their preparation and promised a ruling within ten days the extra time was not neededhe could have ruled immediately from the bench there was little doubt he would keep the cases in chicago and he seemed to favor the idea of a show trial the plaintiffs lawyers retired to the chicago chop house where mr alisandros had reserved the back room for a private lunch including wally and david there were seven lawyers and two paralegals all men and they all took their places around an oblong table jerry had preordered wine and it was poured as soon as they sat down wally and david declined a toast jerry announced as he tapped his wineglass silence i propose a toast to the right honorable harry seawright and his famous rocket docket the trap has been laid and the fools at rogan rothberg think were blind they want a trial old harry wants one too so by god lets give em a trial everyone took a sip and within seconds the conversation spiraled down to an analysis of the legs and backside of nadine karros wally who had the righthand seat to the throne of mr alisandros offered comments that were deemed hilarious over salads the chatter quite naturally made its way to their second favorite subjectsettlement david who was saying as little as possible was coaxed into telling the story of his encounter with taylor barkley just before the hearing his narrative was received with great interesttoo much in his opinion it was jerrys stage and he did most of the talking in equal parts he was enthusiastic about a big trial with a big verdict but he was also supremely confident varrick would buckle and put billions on the table hours later david was still confused but he was also comforted by the presence of jerry alisandros the man had fought the wars inside the courtroom and out and he almost never lost according to lawyers weekly the thirtyfive partners at zell amp potter split billion in net profits the previous year net after new jets a firm golf course and every other lavish expense allowed by the irs according to florida business magazine jerrys net worth was somewhere around million not a bad way to practice law david had not shown these numbers to wally chapter for almost thirty years kirk maxwell represented idaho in the us senate he was generally well regarded as a steady hand who shunned publicity and preferred to work off camera to get things done he was quiet unassuming and one of the more popular members of congress however his sudden death was nothing short of spectacular maxwell had the senate floor microphone in hand arguing fiercely with a colleague from the other side of the aisle when he suddenly clutched his chest dropped his mike opened his mouth in horror and crashed forward into the back of the desk in front of his he died instantly of cardiac arrest and it was all captured on the official senate camera released without proper authorization and seen by the world on youtube before his wife could get to the hospital two days after his funeral his wayward son mentioned to a reporter that the senator had been taking krayoxx and the family was considering a lawsuit against varrick labs by the time this was digested through the news cycle there was little doubt that the drug had killed the senator maxwell was only sixtytwo in fine health but with a family history of high cholesterol an angry colleague announced a subcommittee hearing into the hazards of krayoxx the food and drug administration was besieged with demands that the drug be pulled varrick labs hunkered down in the hills outside of montville offered no comment it was another dark day for the company but reuben massey had seen worse such a lawsuit would be ironic for two reasons first in his thirty years in washington senator maxwell had taken millions from big pharma and as far as the industry was concerned had a perfect voting record second the senator was an ardent tort reformer who had voted for years to place severe restrictions on the filing of lawsuits but in the aftermath of a tragedy irony is often lost on those left behind his widow hired a noted plaintiffs lawyer in boise but for consultation only w ith krayoxx on the front page judge seawright decided a trial might be interesting after all he ruled against the plaintiffs on all issues the lawsuit wally had filed and then amended would be broken up into separate pieces with the case of the late percy klopeck being the first to get slotted into the fury of local rule the rocket docket wally was panicstricken when he received notice of the ruling but he began to settle down during a long and soothing conversation with jerry alisandros jerry explained that the death of senator maxwell was a gift from heavenin more ways than one because a rabid tort reformer had been silencedand would only increase the pressure on varrick to begin settlement talks and besides as jerry kept saying he would welcome the chance to be on center stage versus the lovely ms karros in a packed chicago courtroom the last place they want to see me is in a courtroom jerry said again and again his klopeck trial unit was hard at work at that very moment his firm had dealt with many egocentric federal judges with their own special versions of their own little rocket dockets seawright didnt create the rocket docket wally asked innocently heavens no wally i heard that term thirty years ago in upstate new york jerry went on to encourage wally to continue combing the streets for more krayoxx cases im about to make you rich wally he said again and again t wo weeks after senator maxwells death the fda caved and ordered krayoxx off the market the mass tort bar was orgasmic and lawyers in a dozen cities issued statements to the press most of the same variety varrick will have to answer for its gross negligence a federal investigation should be launched the fda should never have approved the drug varrick knew it had problems but had rushed the drug to market where in six years it had grossed over billion for the company who knows whats really buried in the varrick research oscar was conflicted by the news on one hand he obviously wanted the drug to generate as much bad press as possible to force the company to come to the table but on the other hand he was secretly fervently hoping the drug would take care of his wife pulling it would ratchet up the pressure on varrick but it would also remove the drug from her medicine cabinet actually oscars perfect outcome would be breaking news of a pending settlement at about the same time his wife croaked on the drug he could keep all the money avoid a messy divorce then file suit on behalf of his dear departed wife and nail varrick yet again he dreamed of such things behind his locked door the phone lines were blinking nonstop but he refused to pick up most of the calls were from wallys nondeath cases folks wally had tracked down through his various schemes let rochelle wally and young david worry about the calls and the frantic clients oscar planned to stay in his office and avoid the frenzy if possible r ochelle was ready to quit and she demanded another firm meeting see what youve started oscar sneered at david as all four gathered around the table late one afternoon whats on the agenda wally asked though everyone knew rochelle had twisted davids arm to the point where he was willing to run interference he cleared his throat and got right to the point we have to get these krayoxx cases organized since the drug was pulled the phones are ringing like crazy with people who either are already signed up or want to jump on board aint it great wally said with a wide satisfied grin maybe wally but this is not a mass tort firm were not equipped to handle four hundred cases at a time your big mass tort boys have dozens of associates and even more paralegals lots of bodies to handle the work we have four hundred cases oscar asked and it wasnt clear if he was pleased or overwhelmed wally slurped down some diet soda and said proudly we have the eight death cases of course and nondeath cases and counting and im sorry that these minor cases are causing so much trouble but when its time to settle and when we get to plug these guys into the compensation grid hammered out by jerry alisandros well probably learn that each nondeath is worth a paltry hundred thousand bucks or so times anybody here want to do the math thats not the issue wally david countered we get the math what youre missing is the fact that these cases may not be cases not a single one of these nondeath clients has been evaluated by a doctor we dont know if they have actually been harmed do we no not yet and we have not filed suit for these clients either have we now no but these people certainly believe theyre fullfledged clients and theyre about to be compensated youve painted a rosy picture when will they see a doctor oscar asked soon wally shot in his direction jerry is in the process of hiring an expert doctor here he will examine each patient and give a report and youre assuming that everyone has a legitimate claim david asked im not assuming anything how much will each exam cost oscar asked we dont know until we find the doctor whos paying for the exams oscar asked the krayoxx litigation group klg for short are we on the hook no are you sure what is this wally growled angrily why is everybody hammering me the first firm meeting was all about my girlfriend this one is all about my cases im starting to dislike firm meetings whats wrong with you guys im fed up with these people on the phone rochelle said its nonstop everybodys got a story some are crying because youve scared them to death wally some even stop by and want me to hold their hands they all think they got bad hearts because of you and the fda what if they do have bad hearts and their bad hearts are caused by krayoxx and were able to get them some cash isnt that what lawyers are supposed to do what if we hire a paralegal for a few months david suggested rather abruptly then braced for the reactions when the other three didnt speak quickly enough he plowed on we can stick him or her in the junk room upstairs and send all the krayoxx cases up there ill help him or her set up the litigation software and filing systems so that he or she is on top of every case ill supervise the project if you want all phone calls dealing with krayoxx can be routed to the new office we take the pressure off rochelle and wally can keep doing what he does besthustle cases were not in a position to hire anyone oscar said predictably our cash flow is far below normal thanks to krayoxx and since youre not paying the bills yet and not even close to doing so i might add i dont think youre in a position to suggest spending more money i understand david said i was just suggesting a way for the firm to get itself organized actually youre quite lucky we decided to hire you oscar thought to himself and almost said aloud wally liked the idea but at the moment didnt have the spine to take on his senior partner rochelle admired david for his boldness but she wasnt about to comment on an issue dealing with the overhead i have a better idea oscar said to david why dont you become the krayoxx paralegal youre already upstairs you know something about litigation software youre always squawking about getting organized around here youve been wanting a new filing system judging by your monthly grosses it looks as though you have some spare time itll save us some dough whatta you say it was all true and david wasnt about to back down okay whats my cut of the settlement oscar and wally looked at each other all four eyes narrowing as this rattled around their brains they had not yet decided how they themselves would split the money there had been some loose chatter about a bonus for rochelle and one for david but as for the real division of the spoils not a word well have to talk about that wally said yes this is a matter for the partners oscar added as if being a partner in their firm were akin to belonging to an exclusive and powerful club well hurry up and decide something rochelle said i cant answer all these calls and do all the filing there was a knock on the door deeanna was back chapter reuben masseys master plan to deal with his companys latest drug mess had been upended by the death of senator kirk maxwell who was now derisively known in the varrick hallways as jerk maxwell his widow had not filed suit but her windbag of a lawyer was thoroughly savoring his fifteen minutes in the spotlight he was readily available for interviews even got himself on a few of the cable yak fests he colored his hair bought some new suits and was living the dream of so many lawyers varricks common stock had dipped to its lowest price in six years two wall street analysts two men loathed by massey had issued sell recommendations one wrote after only six years on the market krayoxx accounts for onequarter of varricks revenue with it off the market the companys nearterm forecast is quite uncertain the other wrote the numbers are frightening with one million potential krayoxx plaintiffs varrick will be mired in the cesspool of mass tort litigation for the next ten years at least he got the word cesspool right massey mumbled to himself as he flipped through the morning financials it was not yet am the sky over montville was cloudy the mood inside his bunker was somber but oddly he was in good spirits at least once a week and more often if possible mr massey allowed himself the pleasure of eating someone for breakfast todays meal would be especially delightful a s a young man layton koane had served four terms in the us house before he was called home by the voters after a messy affair with a female staffer disgraced he was unable to find meaningful work back home in tennessee and as a college dropout he possessed no real talents or skills his resume was embarrassingly thin divorced unemployed bankrupt and only forty years old he drifted back to the capitol and decided to venture down the yellow brick road traveled by so many washedup politicians he embraced one of washingtons timehonored traditions he became a lobbyist unburdened by ethical considerations koane quickly became a rising star in the game of pork he could find it smell it dig it out and deliver it to clients willing to pay his constantly rising fees he was one of the first lobbyists to understand the intricacies of earmarks those addictive little dishes of lard so craved by members of congress and paid for by unwitting factory workers back home koane first got noticed in his new trade when he collected a fee from a wellknown public university in need of a new basketball arena uncle sam pitched in million for the project an appropriation found in the fine print of a threethousandpage bill passed at midnight when a rival school heard about it a brouhaha ensued but it was too late the controversy put koane on the map and other clients came running one was a real estate developer in virginia who envisioned the damming of a river thus creating a lake thus allowing lakefront lots to be sold at hefty prices koane charged the developer and instructed him to drop another into the pac of the congressman who represented the district where the dam was not needed once everyone was paid and on board koane went to work on the federal budget and found some spare change millionin a defense appropriation to the army corps of engineers the dam was built the developer made a bundle everyone was happy but the environmentalists conservationists and the communities downstream this was business as usual in washington and would have gone unnoticed but for a persistent reporter from roanoke embarrassment and black eyes all aroundthe congressman the developer koanebut in the lobbying trade there is no shame and all publicity is good koanes business soared after five years in the game he opened his own shopthe koane group specialists in governmental affairs after ten years he was a multimillionaire after twenty he was annually ranked as one of the three most powerful lobbyists in washington does any other democracy rank its lobbyists varrick paid the koane group a flat retainer of million per year and much more when actual work was done for that kind of money mr layton koane would come running when his client said so a s witnesses to the bloodbath reuben massey decided to use his most trusted lawyersnicholas walker and judy beck the three were in place when koane arrived alone as per masseys instructions koane now owned a jet had a chauffeur and liked to travel with an entourage but not today things got off to a cordial start as they exchanged pleasantries and nibbled on croissants koane had gained even more weight and his tailored suit was pulling at the seams it was shiny gray with a sheen similar to that usually seen on suits worn by television evangelists his wellstarched white shirt was bulging around the waist his fleshy triple neck was straining under his collar as always he wore an orange tie and orange pocket square regardless of his wealth he had never learned how to dress massey loathed layton koane and viewed him as a rube a dope a hack a huckster who was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time but then massey loathed almost everything about washington the federal government and its stifling regulations the horde of staffers who wrote them the politicians who approved them the bureaucrats who enforced them to survive in such a dysfunctional place he figured one had to be as greasy as layton koane were getting hammered in washington massey said stating the obvious not just washington koane replied with his twang i own forty thousand shares of your stock remember true varrick labs had once paid the koane group with stock options massey picked up some notes and peered over his reading glasses last year we paid your company over million three million two koane said and we contributed the maximum amount to either the reelection campaign or the pac of eightyeight out of a hundred members of the us senate including of course the late great maxwell may he rest in peace we maxed out to over three hundred members of the house in both houses we maxed out to both parties central slush funds whatever the hell theyre called we maxed out to no fewer than forty pacs all supposedly doing gods work down there in addition two dozen of our senior executives did their own version of maxing out all under your guidance and now thanks to the wisdom of the supreme court we are able to funnel into the electoral system vast sums of cash that cannot be detected over million last year alone if you tally all this up and you include all payments of all types reported and unreported above the table and below varrick laboratories and its executives forked over almost million last year to keep our great democracy on the right track massey dropped the papers and glared at koane forty million to buy one thing layton the one and only product you have to sell influence koane was nodding slowly so please tell us layton with all this influence that weve purchased over the years how in hell does the fda pull krayoxx off the market the fda is the fda koane replied its a world of its own immune from political pressure or so were led to believe political pressure everything was fine until a politician died it looks to me like his buddies in the senate pressured the hell out of the fda of course they did then where were you dont you have former fda commissioners on your payroll we have one but the important word is former he no longer gets a vote so it appears to me as if you got outpoliticked perhaps for now reuben weve lost the first battle but we can still win the war maxwells gone and hes being forgotten by the minute thats what happens in washingtonthey forget about you real fast theyre already campaigning in idaho to replace him give it some time and his death will be forgotten time were losing million a day in sales because of the fda since you arrived here this morning and parked your car weve lost in sales dont talk to me about time layton nicholas walker and judy beck were of course taking notes or at least scribbling something on their yellow legal pads neither looked up but both were enjoying this little workout are you blaming me reuben koane asked almost desperately yes absolutely i dont understand how that rotten place works down there so i hire and pay you a bloody fortune to guide my company through the minefield so yes layton when something goes wrong i blame you a perfectly safe drug has been yanked off the market for no valid reason explain that to me can you i cant explain it but its not fair to blame me weve been on top of this matter since the first lawsuits were filed we had solid contacts up and down the line and the fda showed little interest in pulling the drug regardless of how loud the trial lawyers were screaming we were safe and then maxwell collapsed in fine fashion on video that changed everything there was a pause as all four reached for their coffee cups koane never failed to bring along some gossip some inside knowledge that was passed along in whispers and he couldnt wait to share it a source tells me the maxwell family does not want to file a lawsuit a very good source who massey demanded another member of the club another senator whos very close to maxwell and his family he called me yesterday we had a drink sherry maxwell does not want a lawsuit but her lawyer does hes pretty shrewd realizes hes got varrick in his crosshairs if the lawsuit is filed its another round of bad news for the company more pressure on the fda to keep the drug off the market but if the lawsuit goes away then maxwell will soon be forgotten one headache down more to follow massey flipped his right hand in circles keep going spill it for million the lawsuit will go away ill handle it through my office it will be a confidential settlement no details whatsoever five million for what for a drug that did no harm no five million to soothe a big headache koane replied he was a senator for almost thirty years an honest one so his estate is not too impressive the family needs a little cash any news of a settlement will trigger an avalanche with the tort boys nicholas walker said you cant keep this quiet there are too many reporters watching i know how to manipulate the press nick we shake hands on a deal now sign the papers behind locked doors and wait it out the maxwell family and their lawyer will have no comment but ill make sure theres a nice leak to the effect that the family has chosen not to file suit look theres no law not even in this country that they have to sue people walk away from lawsuits all the time for all sorts of reasons we cut the deal sign the papers promise them the money in two years plus interest i can sell it massey stood and stretched his back he walked to a tall window and surveyed the fog and mist seeping through the woods without turning around he said what do you think nick thinking out loud walker said well it would certainly be nice to get the maxwell matter out of the way laytons right his pals in the senate will forget about him quickly especially if theres no lawsuit on page five million sounds like a bargain in the scheme of things judy agreed she said without hesitation the priority is getting the drug back on the market if making the maxwell family happy speeds this along i say go for it massey slowly returned to his seat cracked his knuckles rubbed his face sipped his coffee obviously a man in deep thought but he was anything but indecisive okay layton do the deal get rid of maxwell but if this settlement blows up in our faces im terminating our relationship immediately right now im not happy with you and your firm and im looking for a reason to shop around no need to do that reuben ill make maxwell go away super now how long before krayoxx is back on the market how long and how much koane gently rubbed his forehead and removed a few tiny beads of sweat i cant answer that reuben we need to go one step at a time and run out some clock ill shove maxwell under the rug then lets meet again when thirty days great thirty days is million in lost revenue i got the math reuben im sure you do i got it reuben okay masseys eyes were flashing and his right index finger was jabbing through the air in the direction of his lobbyist listen to me layton if this drug is not back on the market in the very near future im coming to washington to fire you and your firm then ill hire a whole new bunch of government affairs specialists to protect my company i can get a meeting with the vice president and the speaker of the house i can have drinks with a dozen or so senators ill take my checkbook and a truckful of cash and if i have to ill take a carload of hookers to the fda and turn em loose koane offered a fake smile as if hed heard something funny no need for that reuben just give me a little time we dont have a little time the quickest way to get krayoxx back on the market is to prove its not harmful koane said coolly wanting to divert the chatter away from being fired any ideas were working on it nicholas walker said massey stood again and returned to his favorite window meetings over layton he growled and did not turn around to say goodbye a s soon as koane was gone reuben relaxed and felt better about the morning nothing like a human sacrifice to get a hardnosed ceo in good spirits as nick walker and judy beck checked their emails on their smartphones reuben waited when he had their attention he said i suppose we should discuss our settlement strategy whats the timeline now the chicago trial is on track walker said there is no trial date but we should hear something soon nadine karros is watching judge seawrights calendar and theres a nice gap in late october with some luck it might happen then thats less than a year after the lawsuit was filed yes but weve done nothing to slow it down nadines putting up a stiff defense going through all the motions but no real obstacles no motion to dismiss no plans for summary judgment discovery is proceeding nicely seawright seems to be curious about the case and wants a trial today is june theyre still filing lawsuits if we start talking settlement now can we string it out until october judy beck responded no problem at all fetazine took three years to settle and there were half a million claims zoltaven took even longer the tort bar is thinking about one thingthe billion we charged off last quarter theyre dreaming of that much money hitting the table it will be another frenzy nick said lets get it started massey said chapter wally was sitting in divorce court on the sixteenth floor of the richard j daley center downtown on tap for the morning was strate v strate one of a dozen or so miserable little divorces that would forever hopefully separate two people who had no business getting married in the first place to untangle things they had hired wally paid him in full for an uncontested divorce and after six months were now in court on opposite sides of the aisle anxious for their case to be called wally waited too waited and watched the procession of scarred and warring spouses trek meekly to the bench bow at the judge speak when their lawyers told them to avoid eye contact with each other and after a few somber minutes leave unmarried again wally was in a group of lawyers all waiting impatiently he knew about half of them the other half hed never seen before in a city with twenty thousand lawyers the faces were always changing what a rat race what a grinding treadmill a wife was crying in front of the judge she didnt want the divorce her husband did wally could not wait until these scenes were history one day soon he would spend his time in a swanky office closer to downtown far away from the sweat and stress of street law behind a wide marble desk with two shapely secretaries answering his phones and fetching his files and a paralegal or two doing his grunt work no more divorces duis wills cheap estates no more clients who couldnt pay he would pick and choose the injury cases he wanted and make big money in the process the other lawyers were watching him warily he knew this they mentioned krayoxx from time to time curious envious some hoping wally would strike gold because that would give them hope others though were eager to see him fall flat because that would prove their drudgery was what they were meant to do nothing more his cell phone vibrated in his coat pocket he grabbed it focused on the name and number of the caller then jumped from his seat and sprinted from the courtroom as soon as he cleared the doors he said jerry im in court whats up big news brother wally alisandros sang i played eighteen holes of golf yesterday with nicholas walker ring a bell no yes im not sure who we played on my course i shot a poor nick was strokes back not much of a golfer im afraid hes the chief inhouse lawyer for varrick labs known him for years prince of an asshole but honorable there was a gap wally needed to fill here but he could think of nothing helpful so jerry you didnt call to brag about your golf game right no wally im calling to inform you that varrick wants to open a dialogue on the issue of settlement not actual negotiations mind you but they want to start talking this is the way it usually happens they crack the door we get a foot in they tapdance we tapdance and before you know it were talking money big money are you with me wally oh yes i thought so look wally we have a long way to go before your cases are in a posture to be settled lets get to work ill line up the doctors to do the examsthats the crucial part you need to jack up your efforts to find more cases well probably settle the death cases firsthow many do you have now eight is that all thought it was more its eight jerry with one on the fast track remember klopeck right right with that hot chick on the other side frankly id like to try that one just to stare at her legs all day anyway anyway lets kick into high gear ill call later this afternoon with a game plan lots of work to do wally but the fix is in wally returned to the courtroom and resumed his wait he kept repeating the fix is in the fix is in games up partys over hed heard it all his life but what did it mean in the context of highpowered litigation was varrick throwing in the towel surrendering so quickly cutting its losses wally assumed so he glanced at the haggard beatendown lawyers around him hamandeggers just like himself who spent their days trying to squeeze fees out of working stiffs with no money to spare you poor bastards he thought he couldnt wait to tell deeanna but first he had to talk to oscar and not at finley amp figg where no conversation was ever private t hey met for lunch two hours later at a spaghetti house not far from the office oscar had had a rough morning trying to referee six grown children fighting over their dead mothers estate in which there was virtually nothing of value he needed a drink and ordered a bottle of inexpensive wine wally at days sober had no trouble sticking with water over caprese salads wally quickly recapped his conversation with jerry alisandros and ended with a dramatic this is the moment oscar its finally going to happen oscars mood changed as he listened and gulped down the first glass he managed a smile and wally could almost see the skepticism evaporating he took out a pen shoved the salad aside and began scratching lets run through the math again wally is a death case really worth million wally glanced around to make sure no one was listening the coast was clear ive done a ton of research okay ive looked at dozens of settlements in mass tort drug cases there are too many unknowns right now to predict how much each case is worth you gotta determine liability cause of death medical history age of the deceased incomeearning potential stuff like that then we gotta find out how much varrick is tossing in the pot but a million bucks is the floor i think we have eight fees are at percent half to jerry plus a stroke for his expertise and were looking at a net to our firm of something like mill oscar was scribbling with a fury though hed heard these numbers a hundred times theyre death cases they gotta be worth more than a mill each he said as if hed handled dozens of these large cases maybe two wally said then we got all the nondeath cases as of now lets say only half can qualify after a medical exam based on somewhat similar casesthe mass drug varietyi think is a reasonable figure for a client whose heart valve has been slightly damaged thats million oscar our cut is something in the neighborhood of million oscar wrote something then stopped took a long drink of wine and said so we should talk about our split right is that where this is going the split is one of several pressing issues okay whats wrong with fiftyfifty all fee fights began with an even split wally stuffed a slice of tomato into his mouth and chewed it fiercely whats wrong with fiftyfifty is that i discovered krayoxx rounded up the cases and so far ive done about percent of the work i have the eight death cases in my office david has the other four hundred upstairs you if im not mistaken have no krayoxx cases in your office youre not asking for percent are you of course not heres my suggestion we have a ton of work to do all of these cases have to be screened by a doctor evaluated and so on lets put everything else asideme you davidand get to work we prep the cases while were also looking for new ones once the settlement news breaks every lawyer in the country will go crazy over krayoxx so we gotta get even busier and once the checks arrive i think a sixtythirtyten split is fair oscar had ordered the lasagna special and wally the stuffed ravioli when the waiter was gone oscar said your fee is twice mine thats never happened before i dont like it what do you like fiftyfifty and what about david we promised him a cut when he agreed to take the nondeath cases okay fifty for you forty for me ten for david rochelle gets a nice bonus but no piece of the pie with so much money on the way it was easy to toss around the numbers even easier to cut a deal there had been nasty fights over fees but not today the money soothed them and took away any desire to squabble wally slowly reached across and oscar did the same they quickly shook hands and plunged into their entrees after a few bites wally said hows the wife oscar frowned grimaced and looked away paula finley was a subject completely offlimits because no one at the firm could stand her including oscar wally pressed on you know oscar this is the moment if youre ever going to ditch her do it now marital advice from you yes because you know im right i assume youve been thinking about this yes because you have not and thats because youve never believed in these cases until now perhaps oscar poured more wine and said lets hear it wally leaned in closer again as if they were swapping nuclear secrets file for divorce now immediately no big deal ive done it four times move out get an apartment cut all ties ill handle it on your end and she can hire whomever she wants well draw up a contract date it six months ago and itll say that i get percent of the krayoxx settlements if any and you and david split percent you gotta show some income from krayoxx otherwise her lawyer will go nuts but most of the money can stay in a slush fund for i dont know a year or so until the divorce is over then at some unknown point in the future you and i settle up thats a fraudulent transfer of assets i know i love it ive done it a thousand times though on a much smaller scale i suspect you have too pretty clever dont you think if we get caught we could both get thrown in jail for contempt of court with no hearing we will not get caught she thinks krayoxx is all mine right right so itll work its our law firm and we make the rules on how the money gets split completely within our discretion her lawyers wont be stupid wally theyll know all about the big krayoxx settlement as soon as it happens come on oscar it aint like we hit these licks all the time over the last ten years i suspect your adjusted gross has averaged what oscar shrugged about the same as yours pretty pathetic dont you think thirty years in the trenches not the point oscar the point is that in a divorce theyll look at what youve earned in the past i know if the krayoxx money is mine then we can argue with evidence that your income hasnt changed what will you do with the money bury it offshore until the divorce is over hell oscar we could leave it offshore and pop down to grand cayman once a year to check on it believe me theres no way theyll ever know but you gotta file now and get out why are you so keen on me getting a divorce because i loathe that woman because youve been dreaming of a divorce since your honeymoon because you deserve to be happy and if you sack this bitch and hide the money your life will take a dramatic turn for the better think of it oscar single at sixtytwo with cash in the bank oscar couldnt suppress a smile he drained his third glass he took a few bites he was obviously struggling with something so he finally asked how do i break it to her wally dabbed the corners of his mouth stiffened his spine and assumed the voice of authority well there are many ways to do it and ive tried them all have you two ever talked about splitting up not that i recall i assume it would be easy to start a big fight oh so easy shes always unhappy about something usually money and we fight almost every day thats what i figured do it like this oscar go home tonight and drop the bomb tell her youre unhappy and you want out plain and simple no fighting no bickering no negotiating tell her she can have the house the car the furniture she can have it all if shell agree to a nofault and if she wont agree leave anyway come stay at my place until we can find you an apartment once she sees you walk out the door shell get angry and start scheming especially paula it wont take long for her to blow up give her fortyeight hours and shell be a cobra shes already a cobra and she has been for decades well file the papers have them served on her and thatll send her over the edge shell have a lawyer by the end of the week ive given this advice before just never thought id do it myself oscar sometimes it takes balls to walk away do it now while you can still enjoy life oscar poured the last of the wine into his glass and started smiling again wally could not remember the last time hed seen his senior partner so content can you do it oscar yep in fact i think ill go home early start packing and get it over with awesome lets celebrate with dinner tonight on the firm a deal but that bimbo wont be around right ill lose her oscar downed the wine like a shot of tequila and said damn wally i havent been this excited in years chapter it had been difficult to convince the khaing family that they sincerely wanted to help but after a few weeks of big mac dinners a high level of trust developed each wednesday after an early dinner of something healthier david and helen pulled through the same mcdonalds ordered the same burgers and fries and drove to the apartment complex in rogers park to visit the family zaw the grandmother and lu the grandfather joined in because they were also fond of fast food for the rest of the week they lived on a diet that was primarily rice and chicken but on wednesday the khaings ate like real americans helen seven months pregnant and looking every day of it was initially hesitant about the weekly visits if there was lead in the air she had an unborn baby to protect so david checked everything he badgered dr biff sandroni until he cut his fee from to with david doing most of the legwork david went through the apartment himself and collected samples of wall paint water ceramic coatings cups and saucers plates mixing bowls family photo albums toys shoes clothing virtually anything and everything the family came into contact with he drove this collection to sandronis lab in akron dropped it off then picked it up two weeks later and returned it to the family according to sandronis report there were only traces of lead acceptable levels and nothing for the family to worry about helen and the baby were safe in the khaing apartment thuya had been poisoned by the nasty teeth and dr sandroni was prepared to say so under oath in any court in the country david was sitting on a promising lawsuit but they had yet to find a defendant he and sandroni had a short list of four chinese companies known to make similar toys for american importers but they had not been able to pinpoint the manufacturer and according to sandroni there was a good chance they would never identify it the set of nasty teeth could have been made twenty years earlier then stored in a warehouse for a decade before being shipped to the us where it could have spent another five years languishing in the supply chain the manufacturer and the importer could still be in business or they might have gone bust years ago the chinese were under constant pressure from us watchdogs to monitor the amount of lead used in a thousand products and it was often impossible to determine who made what in the maze of cheap factories scattered around the country dr sandroni had an endless list of sources hed been involved in hundreds of lawsuits but after four months of digging he was emptyhanded david and helen had been to every flea market and toy store in greater chicago and they had put together an astonishing collection of fake teeth and vampire fangs but nothing exactly like nasty teeth their search wasnt over but it had lost steam thuya was home now alive but grievously wounded the brain damage was severe he could not walk without assistance speak clearly feed himself or control his bodily functions his vision was limited and he could barely respond to basic commands ask him his name and he would open his mouth and emit a sound similar to tay he spent most of his time in a special bed with guardrails and keeping it clean was a difficult task caring for the boy was a daily struggle that involved everyone in the family and many of the neighbors the future was beyond contemplation his condition was not likely to improve according to the rather tactful statements of his doctors off the record and away from the family they told david in confidence that thuyas body and mind would not grow normally and there was nothing else they could do and there was no place to put himno facility for braindamaged children thuya was spoonfed a special formula that was a mix of finely ground fruit and vegetables and loaded with daily nutrients he wore diapers made especially for such children the formula diapers and medications were running a month of which david and helen had pledged half the khaings had no health insurance and had it not been for the generosity of the lakeshore childrens hospital he would not have received such highquality care he would probably be dead in short thuya was now a burden that was almost inconceivable soe and lwin insisted that he sit at the table for dinner he had a special chair also donated by the hospital and when properly belted and latched down he sat straight and expected his food while the family devoured the burgers and fries helen carefully fed thuya with a baby spoon she said she needed the practice david sat on the other side with a paper towel chatting with soe about work and life in america thuyas sisters who chose to use the american names of lynn and erin were eight and six respectively they said little during dinner but it was obvious they were thrilled with real fast food when they did speak it was with perfect unaccented english according to lwin they were making straight as in school perhaps it was the gloomy prospect of an uncertain future or maybe it was just the meager existence being carved out by desperate immigrants but the dinners were solemn and subdued at various times the parents grandparents and sisters looked at thuya as if they wanted to cry they remembered the noisy hyper little boy with the quick smile and easy laugh and they were struggling to accept the truth that he would never return soe blamed himself for buying the fake teeth lwin blamed herself for not being more diligent lynn and erin blamed themselves for encouraging thuya to play with the teeth and scare them even zaw and lu blamed themselves they should have done something though they had no idea what after dinner david and helen walked thuya out of the apartment down the short sidewalk and with the entire family watching strapped him into the rear seat of their car and drove away for emergencies they brought along a small bag with extra diapers and cleaning supplies they drove twenty minutes to the lakefront and parked near navy pier david took his left hand helen his right and they began a slow plodding walk that was almost painful to watch thuya moved like a tenmonthold attempting his first steps but there was no hurry and he wasnt about to fall they eased along the boardwalk passing all kinds of boats if thuya wanted to stop and inspect a fortyfoot ketch they did so if he wanted to look at a large fishing boat they stopped and talked about it david and helen chattered nonstop like two proud parents with a toddler thuya jabbered back an incomprehensible stream of utterings and noises that they pretended to understand when he grew tired they pushed him to keep walking it was important according to the rehab specialist at the hospital his muscles could not get soft they had taken him to parks carnivals malls ball games and street parties the wednesday night excursions were important to him and the only break during the week for his family after two hours they returned to the apartment three new faces were waiting in the past months david had handled several minor legal matters for the burmese who lived in the complex there were the usual immigration matters and he was becoming adept in that growing specialty of the law there had been a near divorce but the spouses reconciled there was an ongoing lawsuit over the purchase of a used car his reputation was growing among the burmese immigrants and he was not convinced that was altogether a good thing he needed clients who could pay they stepped outside and leaned on the cars soe explained that the three men were working for a drainage contractor because they were illegals and the contractor knew this he was paying them a week in cash they were working eighty hours a week to make matters worse their boss had not paid them a dime in three weeks they spoke little english and because david could not believe what he was hearing he asked soe to carefully go through it a second time this version was the same as the first two hundred dollars a week straight pay for overtime no pay in three weeks and they were not the only ones there were others from burma and a whole truckload from mexico all illegals all working like dogs all getting screwed david took notes and promised to look into the situation driving home he described the case to helen but does an illegal worker have the right to sue a crooked employer she asked thats the question ill find out tomorrow a fter lunch oscar did not return to the office to do so would have been fruitless he had far too much on his mind to waste time puttering around his desk he was half drunk and he needed to sober up he filled his tank at a convenience store bought a tall cup of black coffee then headed south on i and was soon outside of chicago and passing through farmland how many times had he advised his clients to file for divorce thousands it was so easy to do under the circumstances look there comes a time in some marriages when a spouse needs to get out for you that time is now hed always felt so wise even smug when dispensing such advice now he felt like a fraud how could a person give such counsel unless hed been through it himself he and paula had been together for thirty unhappy years their only child was a twentysixyearold divorcee named keely who was becoming more and more like her mother keelys divorce was still fresh primarily because she enjoyed reveling in her misery she had a job that paid little lots of contrived emotional problems that required pills and her principal source of therapy was nonstop shopping with her mother at oscars expense im sick of both of them oscar said loudly and boldly as he passed the exit signs at kankakee im sixtytwo years old in good health with a life expectancy now of twentythree more years and i have the right to pursue happiness right of course he did but how to break the news that was the question what should he say to drop the bomb he thought of old clients old divorces hed handled over the years at the extreme end of the spectrum the bomb was dropped when the wife caught the husband in bed with another woman oscar could think of three maybe four cases where this had happened that was a bomb dropper all right the marriage is over honey ive found someone else at the other end hed once handled a divorce for a couple who never fought never discussed separation or divorce and had just celebrated their thirtieth wedding anniversary and purchased a retirement home on a lake then the husband came home from a business trip and the house was deserted all of his wifes clothes and half the furnishings were gone she moved out said she had never loved him she soon remarried and he killed himself it was never difficult provoking a fight with paula the woman loved to bicker and brawl perhaps he should drink some more go home half drunk get her started on his drinking push back hard with her endless shopping keep throwing gas on the fire until they were both screaming he could then pack some clothes in a huff and storm out oscar had never found the courage to walk out he should have dozens of times but he always slunk down the hall went to the guest bedroom locked the door and slept alone as he approached champaign he settled on his plan why go through the ruse of starting a fight so he could pin blame on her he wanted out so be a man and admit it im unhappy paula and ive been unhappy for years theres no doubt youre unhappy too otherwise you wouldnt bitch and quarrel all the time im leaving you can have the house and everything in it im taking my clothes goodbye he turned around and headed north u ltimately it was quite simple and paula took it well enough she cried a little and called him a few names but when oscar refused to take the bait she locked herself in the basement and refused to come out oscar loaded his car with clothes and a few personal items then sped away smiling relieved growing happier with each passing street sixtytwo about to be single for the first time in forever about to be rich if he could trust wally which he did at the moment in fact he was placing an enormous amount of trust in his junior partner oscar wasnt sure where he was going but he wasnt about to stop by wallys apartment and spend the night he saw enough of the guy at the office besides the bimbo was apt to drop in and oscar couldnt stand her he drove around for an hour then checked in to a hotel near ohare he pulled a chair to the window and watched the takeoffs and landings in the distance one day soon he would be jetting here and thereislands paris new zealandwith a pleasant lady at his side he felt twenty years younger already he was going places chapter at the following morning rochelle arrived nice and early with plans to enjoy her yogurt and newspaper with no one but ac around but ac was already playing with someone else mr finley was there and quite chipper rochelle could not remember the last time he had arrived before she did good morning ms gibson he said in a warm hearty voice his lined and craggy face full of joy what are you doing here she asked suspiciously i happen to own the building oscar said why are you so happy she asked dropping her purse on her desk because last night i slept in a hotel alone maybe you should do it more often dont you want to know why sure why because i left paula last night ms gibson i packed up said goodbye walked out and im never going back praise the lord she said wideeyed and wonderstruck you didnt yes i did after thirty miserable years im a free man this is why im so happy ms gibson well im happy too congratulations in her eight and a half years at finley amp figg rochelle had never met paula finley in person and she was delighted about this according to wally paula refused to set foot on the property because it was beneath her dignity she was quick to tell folks her husband was a lawyer with the requisite implications of money and power but was also secretly humiliated by the low standing of his firm she spent every dime he earned and if not for some mysterious family money on her side they would have gone broke years earlier on at least three occasions she had demanded that oscar fire rochelle and he had tried twice twice hed limped back to his office locked the door and licked his wounds on one noted occasion ms finley called and wanted to talk to her husband rochelle politely informed her he was with a client i dont care she said put me through rochelle declined again and instead put her on hold when rochelle picked up again paula was cursing near cardiac arrest and threatened to march right down there and straighten things out at the office to which rochelle responded do so at your own risk i live in the projects and i dont scare too easy paula finley did not appear but she did berate her husband rochelle took a step over and gave oscar a firm hug neither could remember the last time they had touched for any reason youre gonna be a new man she said congratulations should be a simple divorce he said youre not using figg are you well yes he works cheap i saw his name on a bingo card they shared a laugh then began swapping gossip at the table an hour later during the third firm meeting oscar repeated the news for the benefit of david who seemed a bit confused by the enthusiasm the news was generating not a trace of sadness anywhere it was obvious that paula finley had made plenty of enemies oscar was almost giddy at the thought of shedding her wally summed up his conversations with jerry alisandros and spun the news in such a way that it seemed as though big checks were practically in the mail as he rambled on david suddenly figured out the divorce unload the wife now and quickly before serious money rolled in whatever the scheme was david smelled trouble hiding assets rerouting funds setting up bogus bank accountshe could almost hear the conversations between the two partners warning flags went up david would be curious and vigilant wally exhorted the firm to kick into high gear to get the files in order find new cases set aside everything else and so on alisandros promised to provide medical screeners cardiologists all manner of logistical support to prepare his clients for the settlement every current case was worth serious cash every prospective case could be worth even more oscar just sat there and grinned rochelle listened intently david found the news exciting but he was also cautious so much of what wally said was hyperbole and david had learned to cut it in half still half would be a wonderful payday the zinc family balance sheet had dipped under in buried cash and while david refused to worry he was thinking about it more and more hed paid sandroni for a case that was probably worthless he and helen had committed a month to thuyas support which would hopefully go on for years they had not hesitated to do this but reality was setting in his monthly gross from the firm was rising steadily though it was unlikely he would ever earn what hed made at rogan that was not his benchmark with a new child he figured he needed a year to live comfortably krayoxx just might shore up the balance sheet though he and the two partners had not discussed his slice of the pie the third firm meeting ended abruptly when a woman the size of a linebacker in sweats and flipflops barged through the front door and demanded to speak to a lawyer about krayoxx she had taken it for two years could actually feel her heart getting weaker and wanted to sue the company that very day oscar and david vanished wally welcomed her with a smile and said well youve certainly come to the right place t he family of senator maxwell hired a boise trial lawyer by the name of frazier gant the number one man in a mildly successful firm that handled mostly tractortrailer accidents and medical malpractice boise is not exactly on the bigverdict circuit it rarely sees the liberal awards common in florida texas new york and california idaho frowns on tort litigation and juries there are generally conservative but gant could put together a case and get a verdict he was someone to reckon with and at the moment he happened to have the biggest tort case in the country a dead senator stricken on the senate floor and the cause of death pinned squarely on a huge corporation it was a trial lawyers dream gant insisted on meeting in washington as opposed to boise though layton koane was perfectly willing to meet anywhere in fact koane preferred anywhere but washington because that would bring gant into his office the koane group leased the top floor of a brandnew sleek shiny tenstory building on k street that stretch of asphalt packed with the real power brokers in washington koane had paid a fortune to a new york designer to project the image of pure wealth and prestige it worked clientscurrent and prospectivewere awed by marble and glass the moment they stepped off the private elevator they were in the midst of power and they were certainly paying for it with gant though the tables were turned it was the lobbyist who would be handing over the money and he preferred a more lowkey meeting place but gant insisted and some nine weeks after the senators death and more important at least to koane and varrick almost seven weeks after the fda yanked krayoxx they introduced themselves and settled around a small conference table at the far end of koanes personal office since he was not interested in impressing a client and he found this particular task distasteful koane didnt waste time i have a source who tells me the family will settle for five million without a lawsuit he said gant frowned a quick sharp grimace as if a hemorrhoid had twitched we can negotiate he said a throwaway line that meant nothing hed flown in from boise to negotiate and nothing more but i think five is on the low side whats on the high side koane asked my client doesnt have a lot of money gant said sadly as you know the senator devoted his life to public service and sacrificed a lot his estate is only half a million but the family has needs maxwell is a big name out in idaho and the family would like to maintain a certain lifestyle one of koanes specialties was the shakedown and he found it somewhat amusing to be on the other end of one the family consisted of a widow a very nice lowkey woman of sixty whose tastes were not expensive a fortyyearold daughter who was married to a boise pediatrician and maxed out creditwise on all fronts a thirtyfiveyearold daughter who taught school for a year and a thirtyoneyearold son who was the problem kirk maxwell jr had been battling drugs and alcohol since he was fifteen and he was not winning koane had his research and he knew more about the family than gant why dont you suggest a figure he said i mentioned five now its your turn your client is losing about twenty million a day in revenue because krayoxx is no longer on the market gant said smartly as if dealing in inside information hed cleverly gathered its more like eighteen but lets not nitpick twenty has a nice ring to it koane glared over his reading glasses his jaw dropped slightly in this business nothing surprised him and he was faking it now twenty million bucks he repeated as if dumbfounded gant gritted his teeth and nodded koane recovered quickly and said let me get this straight senator maxwell was here for thirty years and during that time he received at least million from big pharma and its related pacs much of it from the pockets of varrick and its executives and he also took about million from folks like the national tort reform initiative and other groups seeking to severely restrict lawsuits bogus and otherwise he took another million from doctors hospitals banks manufacturers retailers a very long list of goodgovernment groups determined to cap damages limit lawsuits and basically slam the courthouse door on anyone with a claim of injury or death when it came to tort reform and big pharma the dear late senator had a perfect voting record i doubt if you ever supported him occasionally gant said without conviction well we couldnt find any record of any contribution from you or your firm to any of his campaigns face it you guys were on opposite sides of the street okay why is that relevant now its not then why are we discussing it he like every other member of the senate raised a lot of money it was all legal and the money was always spent to get him reelected surely you understand this game mr koane indeed i do so he drops dead and now blames krayoxx are you aware that he had stopped using the drug his last prescription was in october of last year seven months before he succumbed his autopsy revealed significant heart disease congestion blockage none of which was caused by krayoxx you take this case to trial and youll get buried i doubt that mr koane youve never seen me in the courtroom i have not but koane had the research gants largest verdict was million half of which was set aside on appeal his previous years irs listed an adjusted gross of just under chump change compared with the millions koane raked in gant was paying in alimony and a month on a highly mortgaged golf course home that was underwater the maxwell case was without a doubt his ship coming in koane did not know the specific terms of his contingency fee but according to a boise source gant would get percent of a settlement and percent of a jury verdict gant leaned forward on his elbows and said you and i both know this case is not about liability and its not really about damages the only real issue here is how much varrick is willing to pay to keep me from filing a big splashy lawsuit because if i do then we keep the pressure on the fda dont we mr koane k oane excused himself and went into another room reuben massey was waiting in his office at varrick labs nicholas walker was also at the table they were using a speakerphone they want million koane said then braced for the attack but massey received the news without emotion he believed in using his products and had just popped a plazid his companys version of the daily happy pill wow koane he said calmly youre doing a helluva job at the negotiating table old boy start at five now youre up to twenty wed better grab the twenty before you get it up to forty what the hells happening down there nothing but greed reuben they know they have us over a barrel this guy freely admits the lawsuit is not about liability or damages we cant take any more bad press so how much are we willing to pay to make maxwells case go away its that simple i thought you had some great source whispering in your ear to the tune of million i thought so too this is not litigation this is armed robbery yes reuben im afraid so layton nick here have you countered no my authority was five until you say so i cannot go higher walker was smiling as he spoke this is the perfect time to walk away this guy gant is already counting his money several million he thinks i know the species and theyre very predictable lets send him back to idaho with empty pockets he wont know what hit him neither will the family koane tell him your limit is five and the ceo is out of the country well have to meet and discuss all of this which could take a few days warn him though that if he fires off a lawsuit then all settlement talk goes away he wont do that koane said i think youre right i think hes counting his money i like it massey said but it would be nice to wrap this up go to seven layton but thats all b ack in his office koane settled into his chair and said my authority is seven i cant go higher today and i cant get the ceo i think hes traveling in asia probably on a plane seven is a long way from twenty gant replied with a frown youre not getting twenty i spoke with inhouse counsel whos also on the board then well see you in court gant said zipping up a thin briefcase he hadnt used thats a pretty lame threat mr gant no jury in the country will give you million for a death that was caused by heart disease completely unrelated to our drug and the way we litigate a trial is three years away thats a long time to sit and think about million gant abruptly stood and said thank you for your time mr koane ill see myself out when you leave mr gant our offer of million comes off the table you go home with zero gant stutterstepped slightly then regained his stride see you in court he said tightlipped and left through the door t wo hours later gant called on his cell seemed the maxwell family had reconsidered came to its senses at the prodding of their trusted lawyer of course and well million sounded pretty damn good after all layton koane carefully walked him through each issue at stake and gant was happily on board with all of it after the call koane relayed the news to reuben massey i doubt if he ever talked to the family koane said i think he assured them of million said what the hell and rolled the dice with twenty and is a happy boy going home with a settlement of million hell be a hero and weve dodged a bullet the first one to miss in a long time massey said chapter in federal court david filed a lawsuit alleging all manner of fair labor violations by a shady drainage contractor called cicero pipe the job was a large watertreatment plant on the south side of which the defendant had a million piece the plaintiffs were three undocumented workers from burma and two from mexico the violations covered many more workers but most refused to join the lawsuit there was too much fear of coming forward according to davids research the department of labor dol and the us immigration and customs enforcement ice had reached an uneasy truce regarding the mistreatment of illegal immigrants the steadfast principle of unhindered access to justice overrode slightly the countrys need to regulate immigration therefore an undocumented worker courageous enough to fight a crooked employer would not be subjected to scrutiny by ice at least not while engaged in the labor dispute david explained this repeatedly to the workers and the burmese with soe khaings prodding eventually found the nerve to file suit others from mexico and guatemala were too frightened by the idea of risking what little money they were being paid one of the burmese workers estimated there were at least thirty men all of them thought to be undocumented being paid a week in cash for eighty hours or more of hard labor the potential damages were impressive the minimum wage was and federal law also required for any hour over forty per week for eighty hours each worker was due per week or more than he was being paid though exact dates were hard to pin down davids best guess was that the current scam by cicero pipe had been under way for at least thirty weeks the law allowed liquidated damages of twice the unpaid wages so each of his five clients was entitled to about the law also allowed the judge to impose court costs and attorneys fees on a defendant found liable oscar reluctantly agreed to allow david to file the lawsuit wally could not be found he was burning up the streets looking for large people three days after the lawsuit was filed an anonymous caller threatened to cut davids throat if the lawsuit was not dismissed immediately david reported the call to the police oscar advised him to purchase a handgun and keep it in his briefcase david refused the following day an anonymous letter threatened his life and named his palsoscar finley wally figg even rochelle gibson t he thug walked briskly along preston as if hurrying home at such a late hour it was just after am the late july air still thick and warm male white age thirty an impressive rap sheet and not much between the ears slung over his shoulder was a cheap gym bag and inside was a twoliter plastic jug of gasoline tightly sealed he took a quick right and darted low onto the narrow porch of the law office all lights were off inside and out preston was asleep even the massage parlor had finally wound down if ac had been awake he might have heard the slight rattle of the doorknob as the thug gently checked to see if someone had forgotten to lock up the lock had not been forgotten ac was asleep in the kitchen oscar though was awake on the sofa in his pajamas under a quilt thinking about how happy hed become since moving out the thug eased along the front porch stepped down and scooted low around the building until he came to the back door his strategy was to get inside and detonate his crude little bomb two liters of gasoline on a wooden floor with curtains and books nearby would gut the old house before a fire crew got there he shook the doorit too was lockedthen quickly jimmied it with a screwdriver it swung open as he took one step inside everything was dark a dog growled then two extremely loud shots rang out the thug screamed and fell off the back steps into a small neglected flower bed oscar stood over him a quick glance revealed a wound just above his right knee dont please the thug begged carefully coldly oscar shot him in the other leg t wo hours later oscar partially dressed now was chatting with two policemen at the table all three were sipping coffee the thug was at the hospital in surgerytwo damaged legs but no chance of dying his name was justin bardall and when he wasnt playing with fire and getting shot he operated a bulldozer for cicero pipe idiots idiots idiots oscar kept saying but he wasnt supposed to get caught said one of the cops laughing at that moment two detectives were in evanston knocking on the door of the man who owned cicero pipe it was the beginning of a long day for him oscar explained that he was going through a divorce and looking for an apartment when he wasnt at a hotel he slept on the office sofa ive owned this place for twentyone years he said he knew one of the cops and had seen the other one around neither had the slightest concern over the shooting it was a clearcut case of protecting ones property though oscars narrative omitted the unnecessary wounding of the second leg in addition to the twoliter bottle of gas the gym bag contained a strip of cotton cloth doused with what appeared to be kerosene and several strips of cardboard it was a modified molotov cocktail but not one to be tossed the police guessed that the cardboard was to be used as kindling it was a laughable effort at arson but then it doesnt take a genius to start a fire while they chatted a television news van parked on the street in front of the office oscar put on his tie and got himself filmed a few hours later during the fourth firm meeting david took the news hard but still insisted he would not carry a gun rochelle kept a cheap pistol in her purse so three of the four were armed reporters were calling the story was growing by the moment remember wally repeated to his colleagues were a boutique firm specializing in krayoxx cases everybody got that yeah yeah oscar chimed in and what about burmese labor law violations that too the meeting broke up when a reporter banged on the front door it was soon evident that no law would be practiced that day at finley amp figg david and oscar talked to the tribune and the suntimes details were being passed along mr bardall was out of surgery locked in his room and not talking to anyone but his lawyer the owner of cicero pipe and two of his superintendents had been arrested and released on bail the general contractor on the watertreatment project was a bluechip firm out of milwaukee and it was promising to investigate matters quickly and thoroughly the job site was shut down no undocumented worker would go near it david finally left before noon quietly informing rochelle he was needed in court somewhere he drove home collected helen who was looking more pregnant by the day and took her to lunch he explained recent eventsthe death threats the thug and his intentions oscar and his defense of the firm and the growing interest from the press he downplayed any danger and assured her the fbi was on top of things are you worried she asked not at all he said unconvincingly but there could be something in the papers tomorrow i ndeed there was big photos of oscar in the metro sections of both the tribune and the suntimes in all fairness to the press how many stories do you get wherein an old lawyer is bunking at his office and shoots an intruder who is carrying a molotov cocktail designed to burn down the building in retaliation for the firms filing of a wage dispute involving undocumented workers who are being abused by a company that years ago had links to organized crime oscar was being portrayed as a fearless gunslinger from the southwest side and by the way one of the countrys leading mass tort specialists in the assault on varrick labs and its dreadful drug krayoxx the tribune ran a smaller photo of david as well as shots of the owner of cicero pipe and his lieutenants as they were being hauled into jail the entire alphabet was rushing infbi dol ice ins osha dhs homeland security ofccp office of federal contract compliance programsand most had something to say to the reporters the job site was shut down for the second day and the prime contractor was screaming finley amp figg was again besieged by reporters investigators krayoxx hopefuls and more than the usual riffraff from the street oscar wally and rochelle kept their weapons close young david remained blissfully naive t wo weeks later justin bardall left the hospital in a wheelchair he and his boss along with one other had been indicted on numerous charges by a federal grand jury and their lawyers were already discussing the possibility of plea bargains his left fibula was shattered and more surgery would be needed but his doctors expected a full recovery with time he had mentioned to his lawyers his boss and the police that the shattering of his left fibula had been unnecessary the shot was taken after hed been wounded and was no longer a threat but he found no sympathy the general reaction could be summed up by a detective who said youre lucky he didnt blow your head off chapter jerry alisandros finally made good on a promise he was extremely busy organizing the settlement negotiations and according to the associate wally spoke to he jerry simply didnt have the time to spend on the phone with the dozens of lawyers he was juggling but in the third week of july he finally sent in the experts the companys name was meaninglessallyance diagnostic group or adg as it preferred to be called as best wally could tell adg was an atlantabased team of medical technicians who did nothing but travel the country running tests on people who were clamoring to profit from jerrys latest mass tort attack as instructed wally rented two thousand square feet in a dingy strip mall a space that had once housed a lowend pet supply store he hired a contractor to erect walls and doors and a cleaning service to fix things up the front windows were covered with brown paper there was no signage he rented a few cheap chairs and tables and a desk and installed a phone and a copier all bills were sent by wally to an assistant in jerrys firm who did nothing but keep the books dealing with the krayoxx litigation when the space was ready adg moved in and went to work its team consisted of three technicians all properly attired in aqua surgical scrubs each had a stethoscope they looked so official that even wally at first figured they were highly skilled and credentialed they were not but they had tested thousands of potential plaintiffs their leader was dr borzov a cardiologist from russia who had made a lot of money diagnosing patientsclients for jerry alisandros and a dozen other trial lawyers around the country dr borzov rarely saw an obese person who wasnt suffering from a significant medical problem that could be pinned on the masstortdrugofthemonth he never testified in courthis accent was too thick and his resume was too thinbut he was worth his weight in gold in the screening rooms david because he was the de facto paralegal for all now nondeath krayoxx clients and wally because he had hustled them all together were both present when adg began its assembly line on schedule three clients arrived at am and were greeted with coffee wally and a cute adg technician in scrubs and white rubber hospital clogs the paperwork took ten minutes and was primarily designed to ensure that the client had indeed taken krayoxx for more than six months the first client was led into another room where adg had installed its own echocardiogram and two other technicians were waiting one explained the procedurewere just taking a digital picture of your heartwhile the other helped the client onto an official heavily fortified hospital bed that adg hauled around the country along with the echocardiogram as they probed the patients chest with the sonar dr borzov entered the room and nodded slightly at the patient his bedside manner was never reassuring but then he had no real patients he wore a fulllength white exam coat had his name stenciled above the left pocket and had his own stethoscope for good measure and effect and when he spoke his accent conveyed a sense of expertise he studied the screen frowned because he always frowned then left the room the assault on krayoxx was fueled by research purporting to show that the drug weakened the seals around the aortic valve thus causing a decrease in mitral valve regurgitation the echocardiogram measured aortic sufficiency and a decrease of percent was excellent news for the lawyers dr borzov reviewed the graphs immediately always eager to find another weakened aortic valve each exam took twenty minutes so they did three per hour about twentyfive each day six days a week wally had leased the space for a month adg billed the zell amp potter finley amp figg litigation account for each exam with the bills going to jerry in florida before that stop adg and dr borzov had been in charleston and buffalo from chicago they were headed to memphis then little rock another adg unit was covering the west coast with a serbian doctor reading the graphs another was harvesting gold in texas the zell amp potter krayoxx web covered forty states seventyfive lawyers and almost clients t o avoid the chaos of the office david hung around the strip mall and chatted with his clients none of whom hed ever met generally speaking they were happy to be there worried about whatever damage the drug had done to their hearts hopeful of some type of recovery overweight and terribly out of shape but pleasant enough black white old young male femaleobesity and high cholesterol ran the gamut every client he spoke to had been thrilled with the drug delighted with its results and was now anxious about finding a replacement gradually david chatted up the adg technicians and learned something of their work though they were fairly closemouthed dr borzov would hardly speak to him after hanging around for three days david could tell that the adg team was not pleased with their testing their exams were producing little evidence of aortic insufficiency but there were a few potential cases on the fourth day the airconditioning system crashed and wallys rented space turned into a sweatshop it was august temperature above ninety and when the landlord refused to return calls the adg crew threatened to leave wally hauled in box fans and ice cream and begged them to stay and finish the screening they plowed on the twentyminute exams becoming fifteen then ten with borzov barely scanning the graphs on the sidewalk while he smoked cigarettes j udge seawright set the hearing for august the last possible date on any judges calendar before the system shut down for summer vacation there were no motions pending no fights brewing all discovery had proceeded with remarkable cooperation varrick labs so far had been unduly forthcoming with documents witnesses and experts nadine karros had filed only a handful of benign motions all of which the judge quickly dispensed with on the plaintiffs side the zell amp potter lawyers had been remarkably efficient with their requests and filings seawright was monitoring the settlement gossip his clerks scoured the financial press and watched the serious bloggers varrick labs had issued no formal statement regarding settlement but it was obvious the company knew how to leak its share price dipped as low as but the buzz about a massive settlement had moved it back to when the two packs of lawyers were in place judge seawright assumed the bench and welcomed everyone he apologized for calling the hearing in augustthe most difficult month of the year for busy peoplebut he felt strongly that the two sides should get together before everyone scattered he quickly went through his discovery checklist to make sure both sides were behaving there were no complaints jerry alisandros and nadine karros were so polite to each other it was almost silly wally sat to jerrys right as if he would be the goto guy in a courtroom brawl behind him and wedged among a group of zell amp potter lawyers were david and oscar since the shooting and the publicity oscar was getting out more enjoying the attention he was also smiling and already considered himself a bachelor changing subjects judge seawright said im hearing a lot of chatter about a settlement one big global settlement as theyre called these days in this business i want to know whats going on as fast as this particular case has come together it is now in a posture to be placed on my trial calendar however if a settlement is likely then why bother can you shed any light on this issue ms karros she stood all eyes on her and took a few elegant steps to the podium your honor as you probably know varrick labs has been involved in a number of complicated lawsuits and the company has its own way of approaching a settlement that involves many plaintiffs i have not been authorized to initiate negotiations in the klopeck case nor have i been authorized by my client to make public statements on the issue of settlement as far as im concerned we are preparing for trial fair enough mr alisandros they exchanged places at the podium and jerry offered up a sappy smile likewise your honor we are preparing for trial in this case however i must say that i as a member of the plaintiffs litigation committee have had several informal and quite preliminary conversations with the company regarding a global settlement i believe ms karros is aware that these conversations are taking place but as she said she has not been authorized to discuss them i dont represent varrick so i am not burdened with such constraints however the company has not requested that i remain silent about our discussions in addition your honor if we reach the point of formal negotiations i doubt that ms karros will be involved i know from prior experience that varrick handles these inhouse do you anticipate formal negotiations asked seawright there was a long pause as many held their breath nadine karros managed to look curious though she had a clear view of the big picture no one else in the courtroom did wallys heart was racing as he tasted the words formal negotiations jerry shifted weight a few times then finally said judge i dont want to get quoted so ill go the safe route and say that im not sure so you and ms karros cannot give me any guidance on the issue of settlement seawright said with a hint of frustration both lawyers shook their heads nadine knew damn well the case wouldnt be settled jerry was almost positive that it would neither though could play his or her hand and truthfully and ethically the judge did not have the right to know their strategies outside the courtroom his job was to referee a fair trial not monitor settlements jerry returned to his seat and judge seawright changed subjects again im looking at october a monday as a trial date i anticipate the trial will last no longer than two weeks a dozen lawyers were instantly looking at their calendars all frowning if you have a conflict it had better be a good one he said mr alisandros jerry stood slowly holding a small leather appointment book well judge that would mean that were going to trial ten months after the lawsuit was filed thats pretty quick dont you think indeed it is mr alisandros eleven months is about my average i dont allow my cases to grow stale whats your conflict no conflict judge but im more concerned with having sufficient time to prepare thats all hogwash discovery is almost complete you have your experts the defendant has its experts god knows both sides have enough legal talent october is sixtyeight days away that should be a piece of cake for a litigator of your reputation mr alisandros what a show thought wally this case and all the others would be settled in a month what about the defense ms karros seawright asked we have some conflicts your honor she said but nothing that we cannot work around very well the case of klopeck versus varrick labs is hereby set for jury trial on october pending a disaster there will be no delays no continuances so dont even bother to ask he tapped his gavel on the bench and said courts adjourned thank you chapter news of the trial date swept through the financial press and was all over the internet the story was spun various ways but in general it looked as though varrick was being frogmarched into a federal courtroom to answer for its multitude of sins reuben massey did not care how the story was told nor did he care what the public thought at that moment to the tort bar it was important to react as if his company was shaken and frightened he understood trial lawyers three days after the hearing in chicago nicholas walker phoned jerry alisandros and suggested they arrange a secret meeting between the company and the biggest tort firms involved with krayoxx the purpose of the meeting would be to throw open the door to fullscale negotiations alisandros jumped at the idea and gravely vowed total silence from the twenty or so years hed been dealing with trial lawyers nicholas knew the meeting would not be a secret because one or more of the lawyers would tip the press the following day a blurb in the wall street journal reported that cymbol varricks principal insurance company had been put on notice by the company that its reserve fund was about to be activated citing an anonymous source the story went on to speculate that the only reason for such an action was to settle its krayoxx mess other leaks followed and the bloggers were soon declaring another victory for consumers since every trial lawyer worth his salt owned his own jet the destination was no problem with new york city deserted in august nicholas walker secured a large meeting room on the fortieth floor of a halfempty midtown hotel many of the trial lawyers were out of the office off somewhere dodging the heat but not a single invitation was declined a large settlement was far more important than a few days of vacation when they convened eight days after judge seawright set the date for the first trial there were the six members of the plaintiffs litigation committee plus another thirty trial lawyers each with thousands of krayoxx cases those as insignificant as wally figg did not even know of the meeting large young men in dark suits guarded the door to the meeting room and checked credentials after a quick breakfast the first morning nicholas walker welcomed everyone as if they were all salesmen for the same company he even cracked a joke and got a laugh but just under the surface there was tension an avalanche of money was about to be unleashed and the lawyers in the room were seasoned brawlers ready for handtohand combat so far there were eleven hundred death cases or in other words eleven hundred cases in which the dead persons estate claimed krayoxx was the cause the medical proof was not exactly ironclad though it was probably sufficient to become a question for a jury going along with their master plan nicholas walker and judy beck spent almost no time discussing the basic issue of liability they presumed as did the horde on the other side that the drug was responsible for eleven hundred deaths and thousands of other injuries after the formalities walker began by saying that varrick would like to nail down the value of each death case assuming that could be done they would then move on to the nondeath cases w ally was on the shore of lake michigan in a small rental a block off the water with his darling deeanna who was a knockout in a bikini and he had just finished some pasta salad when his cell phone chirped he saw the number snatched the phone and said jerry my man whats going on deeanna topless in a nearby lounge chair perked up too she knew that any call from dear jerry could be thrilling jerry explained that he was back in florida after two days in new york secret meeting and all hammering things out with varrick tough bunch just the death cases you know but anyway lots of progress no deal no handshake certainly nothing in writing but it looks as though each death case will be somewhere around million wally hummed along with an occasional smile at deeanna who had inched closer good news jerry nice work lets chat next week whats up she cooed when the call was over nothing really just an update from jerry varrick has filed a bunch of motions and he wants me to take a look no settlement nope all she talked about now was the settlement sure it was his fault for running his big mouth but the woman was obsessed with the settlement she didnt have enough sense to play along as though she couldnt have cared less no she wanted details she wanted money and this was worrying wally he was already thinking of an exit strategy just like his new hero oscar ditch the women before the money arrives sixteen million dollars seventeen percent of which would flow into the coffers of finley amp figg a total of million of which wally would take percent he was a millionaire he crawled onto an air mattress and floated across the pool he closed his eyes and tried not to grin soon deeanna was next to him floating on the water still topless touching him occasionally to make sure he still needed her they had been together for many months now and wally was finally getting bored he was finding it more difficult to keep up with her constant demands for sex he was after all fortysix ten years older than deeanna though her actual birth date was a moving target the day and month had been nailed down but the year kept inching forward he was tired and needed a break and he was also concerned about her fascination with his krayoxx money it would be in his best interests to ditch her now do the breakup routine one he knew well and get her out of his life and away from the money this would not be easy and would take some time such a strategy would work well for oscar too paula finley had hired an obnoxious divorce lawyer named stamm and he was banging the war drums during their first phone chat stamm expressed surprise at how little money oscar cleared from his law practice and went on to imply that money was being hidden he probed into the murky world of fees paid in cash but he got nothing from wally who knew that territory well stamm mentioned the krayoxx litigation but got stiffarmed by wallys wellrehearsed denials that oscar was involved well it looks suspicious stamm had said mr finley is willing to walk away with nothing but his car and clothes after thirty years of marriage oh no wally had protested it makes perfect sense if you really got to know paula finley your client they bickered for a while as divorce lawyers do then promised to talk later as bad as wally wanted the money he decided to delay the actual receipt of the cash for several months do the paperwork now or in the next few weeks keep it under wraps in court then get rid of the women f or what was supposed to be the slowest month of the year august was proving to be quite productive on august helen zinc gave birth to an eightpound girl emma and for a couple of days her parents acted as though they had produced the first baby in history mother and child were in perfect health and when they arrived home all four grandparents were waiting along with two dozen friends david took a week off and found it impossible to stay out of the little pink nursery he was called back into action by an angry federal judge one who evidently did not believe in vacations and was rumored to work ninety hours a week her name was sally archer or sudden sal as she had been aptly nicknamed she was young and brash extremely bright and in the process of driving her staff into the ground sudden sal ruled quickly and wanted every lawsuit settled the day after it was filed davids labor case had been assigned to archer who had minced no words in voicing her low opinion of cicero pipe and its sleazy practices under pressure from multiple arms of the federal government and sudden sal as well the prime contractor convinced its sub cicero pipe to clean up its labor mess and legal problems and get on with its portion of the watertreatment plant the criminal charges against the wouldbe arsonist justin bardall and others at the company would take months to untangle but the wageandhour dispute could and would be wrapped up quickly six weeks after filing the lawsuit david hammered out a settlement that was hard for him to believe cicero pipe agreed to pay to each of his five clients the lump sum of in addition the company would pay each to another three dozen undocumented workers most mexican and guatemalan who had been paid a week for at least eighty hours because of the notoriety of the case said notoriety being greatly enhanced by oscars vigorous defense of his own property and the ensuing arrest of the wealthy owner of cicero pipe the hearing before sudden sal attracted some reporters judge archer began by recapping the lawsuit and in doing so guaranteed she would be quoted by describing cicero pipes abuses as slave labor she lashed out at the company rebuked its lawyers who were actually pretty nice guys in davids opinion and in general grandstanded for thirty minutes as the reporters scribbled away mr zinc are you satisfied with this settlement her honor inquired the agreement was in writing the deal had been cut a week earlier the only remaining issue was attorneys fees yes your honor david said quietly the three lawyers for cicero pipe hunkered down almost afraid to look up i see that you have submitted a request for attorneys fees sudden sal observed as she looked at some paperwork fiftyeight hours i would say in light of what you have accomplished and the money youve obtained for all these workers that your time has been well spent thank you your honor david said he was standing at his table what is your hourly rate mr zinc well your honor i have been anticipating that question and the truth is that i really dont have an hourly rate my clients cant afford to pay by the hour judge archer nodded in the past year have you billed anyone by the hour oh sure until last december i was a senior associate at rogan rothberg the judge laughed into her microphone and said oh boy talk about experts at the hourly rate what were you worth back then mr zinc david shifted uncomfortably and shrugged judge the last time i worked on the clock the client was billed an hour then youre worth an hour sudden sal scribbled for a few seconds then announced lets round it off to any objections mr lattimore the defendants chief counsel stood and paused and pondered what to say objecting would do no good because the judge was clearly in the other camp his client was getting clobbered so badly anyway what was another and if lattimore expressed misgivings about the fees he knew that sudden sal would hit him with a quick well then mr lattimore whats your hourly rate sounds reasonable lattimore said good i want all funds exchanged within thirty days courts adjourned outside the courtroom david spent time with three reporters patiently answering their questions when he was finished he drove to the apartment of soe and lwin where he met with his three burmese clients and broke the news that they would soon receive checks for each the message wasnt clear in translation and soe repeated himself several times to convince the men they laughed and thought it was all a joke but david refused to laugh along when reality set in two of the three began crying the third was too shocked david tried to make the point that they had earned the money with their sweat and labor but this too did not translate well david was in no hurry he had been away from his new daughter for all of six hours a record but she wasnt going anywhere he sipped tea from a tiny cup and chatted with his clients glowing in his first major victory he had taken a case that most lawyers would refuse his clients had bravely stepped out from the shadows of illegal immigration to confront a wrong and david had coaxed them into it three little guys a million miles from home abused by a big company with plenty of big friends nothing between them and more abuse except a young attorney and a court of law justice with its flaws and ambiguities had prevailed in a magnificent way driving to the office alone david was filled with immense pride and a sense of accomplishment he hoped to have many great wins in the future but this one would always be special never in five years with the big firm had he ever felt so proud of being a lawyer it was late and the office was deserted wally was on vacation checking in occasionally with the latest krayoxx update oscar was awol for a few days not even rochelle knew where hed gone david checked his phone messages and mail puttered around his desk for a few minutes then got bored with it as he locked the front door a police car pulled to a stop in front of the building friends of oscars keeping an eye on the place david waved at the two officers and headed home chapter fresh from a long labor day weekend wally wrote to his client iris klopeck dear iris as you know our trial is set for next month october to be exact but this is not something to worry about i spent most of last month negotiating with the attorneys at varrick and we have arrived at a very favorable settlement the company is in the process of offering a sum in the neighborhood of million for the wrongful death of your husband percy this offer is not official but we expect to receive it in writing within the next fifteen days i know this is considerably more than the million i promised but nonetheless i need your approval to accept this offer when it is formally put on the table im quite proud of our little boutique firm we are like david battling goliath but right now were winning please sign the attached form authorizing the settlement and mail it back sincerely wallis t figg attorney and counseloratlaw he sent similar letters to the other seven clients in his wonderful little class of death cases and when he finished he kicked back in his swivel rocker placed his shoeless feet on his desk and once again contemplated the money his dreams were interrupted though when rochelle buzzed in with a curt that woman is on the phone please talk to her shes driving me crazy okay wally snapped and stared at the phone deeanna was not going away quietly during the drive home from lake michigan he had picked a fight with her and managed to escalate it to the level of some serious namecalling in the heat of the battle he had announced that they were through and for two tranquil days thereafter they did not speak then she showed up at his apartment drunk and he relented and allowed her to sleep on the sofa she was apologetic even pitiful and managed to offer some manner of sexual adventure every five minutes wally had declined so far now she was calling at all hours and had even appeared at the office several times but wally was determined it had become clear to him that his krayoxx money wouldnt last three months with deeanna in the picture he picked up the phone and offered a brusque hello she was already crying t he windy gloomy monday would long be remembered at zell amp potter as the labor day massacre no holiday was being observedthey were professionals not laborers not that it mattered holidays were often ignored as were weekends the building was open early and by am the halls were buzzing with lawyers eagerly pursuing a variety of defective drugs and the companies that made them occasionally though a pursuit yielded nothing a chase went nowhere a well was dry the first blow landed at am when dr julian smitzer the firms director of medical research insisted on seeing jerry alisandros who really didnt have the time but couldnt say no especially when the matter was described by his secretary as urgent dr smitzer had completed an illustrious career as a cardiologist and researcher at mayo clinic in rochester minnesota and with an ailing wife headed for the sunshine of south florida after a few months he was bored by chance he met jerry alisandros one meeting led to another and for the past five years dr smitzer had supervised the law firms medical research at an annual salary of million it was a natural fit because he had spent most of his career writing about the evils of big pharma in a law firm full of hyperaggressive lawyers dr smitzer was a revered figure no one questioned his research or his opinions and his work was far more valuable than what he was paid we have a problem with krayoxx he said not long after hed taken a seat in jerrys grand office after a deep painful breath jerry said im listening weve spent the past six months analyzing the mcfadden research and i am now of the opinion that it is flawed there is no credible statistical evidence that the consumers of the drug have a higher risk of stroke and heart attack frankly mcfadden fudged his results hes an excellent doctor and researcher but he obviously became convinced the drug was dangerous then tweaked his findings to fit his conclusions the people who take this drug have many other problemsobesity diabetes hypertension atherosclerosis to name a few many are in terrible health and elevated cholesterol can be expected typically they take a handful of pills several times a day krayoxx being just one and so far it has been impossible to determine the effects of the combinations of all these drugs statistically there might and i emphasize that word be a slight increased chance for a heart attack or stroke by krayoxx users but then again there may not be mcfadden studied three thousand subjects over a twoyear perioda small pool in my opinionand found only a percent higher chance of stroke and heart attack ive read the report julian many times jerry said interrupting i practically memorized it before we jumped into this litigation you jumped in too fast jerry theres nothing wrong with this drug ive spoken with mcfadden at length you know how heavily he was criticized when the report came out hes taken the heat and now hes backing off the drug what yes mcfadden admitted to me last week that he should have included more subjects hes also concerned with the fact that he did not spend the time studying the effects of the combinations of multiple drugs he is planning to reverse himself and try to salvage his reputation jerry was pinching the bridge of his nose as if he might crush it no no no he kept mumbling smitzer pressed on yes yes and his repair work will be forthcoming when roughly ninety days and it gets worse weve studied thoroughly the effects of the drug on the aortic valve as you know the palo alto study seemed to link the leakage in the valve to a deterioration caused by the drug this now looks doubtful highly so why are you telling me this now julian because the research takes time and we are just now learning a few things what does dr bannister say well for starters he says hes not willing to testify jerry rubbed his temples and stood glaring at his friend he walked to a window and looked out at nothing since dr smitzer was on the firms payroll he was precluded from testifying in any zell amp potter litigation either in discovery or at trial an important part of his job was maintaining a network of expert witnesseshired guns willing to take the stand for huge fees dr bannister was a professional testifier with a thick resume and a fondness for mixing it up with hotshot lawyers in big trials the fact that he was now backing down seemed fatal t he second blow landed an hour later with jerry already on the ropes and bleeding a young partner named carlton arrived with a thick report and some grim news things are not going well jerry he began i know carlton was supervising the screening of thousands of potential clients and his thick report was filled with terrible numbers were not seeing the damage jerry ten thousand exams so far and the results are not impressive maybe percent have some loss of aortic pressure but nothing to get excited about were seeing all sorts of heart disease hypertension clogged arteries and the like but nothing we can link to the drug ten million bucks on screenings and we have nothing jerry said thumbs on temples eyes closed at least ten million and yes we have nothing i hate to say this jerry but this drug looks harmless i think were drilling a dry hole here id say we cut and run i didnt ask for advice no you didnt carlton left the office and closed the door jerry locked it and went to a sofa where he stretched out and stared at the ceiling he had been there beforecaught with a drug that wasnt quite as bad as he had claimed it to be there was still a chance varrick was a step or two behind perhaps the company didnt know what jerry now knew with all the settlement buzz its share price had moved steadily up closing the friday before at maybe just maybe the company could be bluffed into an even quicker settlement he had seen it before a company with plenty of cash and a ton of bad press wants the lawsuits and lawyers to simply go away as the minutes passed he managed to relax he couldnt think of all the wally figgs out therethey were big boys who had made their own decisions to file suit and he couldnt think of all the clients who were expecting a sizable check and soon nor was he too concerned with saving facehe was obscenely rich and the money had long since toughened his skin what jerry was really thinking about was the next drug the one after krayoxx t he third blow and the knockout punch arrived in a scheduled pm phone conference with another member of the plaintiffs litigation committee plc rodney berman was a flamboyant new orleans trial lawyer who had made and lost several fortunes gambling with juries thanks to an oil spill in the gulf he was currently in the money and had managed to piece together even more krayoxx clients than zell amp potter were up shit creek he began pleasantly its been a bad day rodney so go ahead and make it worse inside scoop from a very confidential and very wellpaid i might add spook who has laid eyes on a preliminary report headed for the new england journal of medicine next month researchers at harvard and cleveland clinic will declare that our beloved krayoxx is as healthy as wheat germ and causes no problems whatsoever no increased risk of heart attack or stroke no damage to the aortic valve nothing and these boys have resumes that make our guys look like witch doctors my experts are running for the hills my lawyers are hiding under their desks according to one of our lobbyists the fda is considering putting the drug back on the market varrick is dropping cash all over washington what else do you want to hear jerry i think ive heard enough im looking for a bridge i can see one from my office rodney said somehow managing a laugh its beautiful spanning the mississippi and just waiting on me the rodney berman memorial bridge theyd find me in the gulf one day covered in crude oil four hours later all six of the plc members were linked into a conference call jerry organized from his office after he summarized the grim news of the day berman delivered his version each of the six took a turn and there was not a single piece of good news the litigation was crumbling on all fronts on all theories from coast to coast there was a lengthy debate over how much varrick knew at the moment and the general feeling was that they the lawyers were far ahead of the company but that would change quickly they agreed to stop the screening immediately jerry volunteered to contact nicholas walker at varrick and attempt to speed up settlement talks each of the six agreed to begin buying huge chunks of varrick common stock in an effort to drive up the price it was a public corporation after all and its share price meant everything if varrick believed a settlement would soothe wall street it might decide to get rid of its krayoxx mess however harmless the drug might be the conference call lasted two hours and ended with a tone that was slightly more optimistic than when it began they would continue pushing hard for a few more days maintain their poker faces play the game and hope for a miracle but under no circumstances would they continue spending money on their own krayoxx mess it was over they would cut their losses and move on to the next battle almost nothing was said about the klopeck trial six weeks away chapter two days later jerry alisandros made a seemingly routine phone call to nicholas walker at varrick labs they went through the weather and some football then jerry got around to business im in your neck of the woods next week nick and id like to stop by for a meeting if youre in and have the time maybe walker said cautiously our numbers are coming together nicely and weve made progress at least on the death cases ive spent hours with the plc and were ready to enter into a formal settlement agreement round one of course lets get the big cases out of the way and then slog through the small ones thats our plan jerry walker said in full agreement and jerry finally managed to breathe im taking heat from reuben massey to get this stuff out of the way he chewed me for breakfast this morning and i was planning to call you massey has instructed me to get down there with our inhouse team and our florida firms and hammer out a settlement along the same lines as what we have already discussed i suggest we meet in fort lauderdale a week from today sign the agreement present it to the judge and move on the nondeath cases will take longer but lets get the big ones closed agreed agreed you have no idea jerry thought a great idea nick ill set it up down here but i insist that all six plc members be in the room i can arrange that no problem and can we get a magistrate or someone from the judges office to be present im not leaving there until we have a deal in writing and approved by the court excellent idea nick jerry was grinning like an idiot lets get it done after the call jerry checked the market varrick was trading at and the only plausible reason for its uptick was the good spin about the settlement t he phone conversation had been recorded by a company specializing in truth and deception it was a firm zell amp potter used frequently to secretly record conversations in an effort to determine the level of veracity on the other end thirty minutes after jerry hung up two experts entered his office with some graphs and charts they had camped out in a small conference room down the hall with their staff and machines they had measured the stress of both voices and had easily determined that both men were lying jerrys lies had been planned of course in an effort to prompt walker walkers voicestress analysis showed a high level of deception when he spoke of reuben massey and the companys desire to get rid of the litigation he was telling the truth but when he spoke of the big plans for a settlement summit next week in fort lauderdale he was clearly being deceptive jerry gave the impression of taking the news in stride such evidence was never admissible in court because it was so wildly unreliable he had often asked himself why he even bothered with voicestress analysis but after using it for years he almost believed it anything to give him a slight edge such recordings were highly unethical anyway and even illegal in some states so it was easy to bury the information for most of the past fifteen years he had kept varrick on the run with one lawsuit after another and in doing so he had learned much about the company its research was always better than that of the plaintiffs it hired spies and invested heavily in corporate espionage reuben massey loved hardball and usually found a way to win the war even after losing most of the battles alone in his office jerry typed an entry into his private daily log krayoxx is evaporating before my eyes just spoke with n walker who plans to be here next week to sign a deal chance he doesnt show i ris klopeck shared wallys letter with several friends and family members and the imminent arrival of million was already causing problems clint her deadbeat son who routinely went days without offering her as much as a rude grunt or two was suddenly showing all manner of affection he was cleaning his room washing dishes running errands for his dear mother and chattering away nonstop his favorite topic being his desire for a new car iriss brother fresh from his second stint in prison for stealing motorcycles was painting her house with no charge for the labor and dropping hints about his longtime dream of owning a used motorcycle business he knew of one on the market for only a steal he said at which her son whispered behind his back he should know a steal when he sees one percys wretched sister bertha was letting it be known that she was entitled to a chunk of the money because she was blood iris loathed the woman as had percy and iris had already reminded bertha that she had not attended percys funeral bertha was now claiming she had been hospitalized on that day prove it iris said and so they bickered o n the day adam grand received his letter from wally he was hustling around the allyoucaneat pizza house when his boss barked at him for no apparent reason adam the assistant manager returned the favor and a nasty row ensued when the shouting and cursing ended adam either quit or was fired and for several minutes both men argued over the exact nature of adams departure not that it matteredhe was gone and that didnt matter to adam either because he was about to be rich m illie marino had the good sense to show her letter to no one she read it several times before the words began to sink in and she felt a twinge of guilt for doubting wallys ability he still failed to inspire confidence and she was still angry over her late husband chesters will and estate but those issues were now of fading importance chesters son lyle would be entitled to his portion and for that reason he had been monitoring the litigation if he knew how close they were to pay dirt he might become a nuisance so millie put the letter under lock and key and told no one o n september five weeks after being shot in both legs justin bardall filed a lawsuit against oscar individually and finley amp figg as a partnership he alleged oscar used excessive force in the shooting and in particular deliberately fired the third shot into the left leg after bardall was seriously wounded and no longer posed a threat the lawsuit demanded million in actual damages and million in punitive damages for oscars malicious conduct the lawyer who filed the case goodloe stamm was the same lawyer hired by paula finley to handle her divorce evidently at some point stamm tracked down bardall and convinced him to sue in spite of his criminal activities and the fact that he was about to spend time in prison for attempted arson the divorce was proving to be more contentious than wally or oscar had expected especially in light of the fact that oscar was basically walking away with nothing but his car and clothes stamm kept chirping about the big krayoxx money and smelled a conspiracy to hide it oscar was furious over the million lawsuit and blamed everything on david had it not been for the wage case filed against cicero pipe he and bardall would have never met wally managed to broker a truce and the yelling stopped he contacted their insurance company and insisted it provide a defense and coverage with the big settlement so close it was much easier to make peace to smile even to joke about the image of that little thug bardall limping into court and trying to convince a jury he an incompetent arsonist should be made rich because he failed to burn down a law office chapter the email was prefaced with the standard warnings of confidentiality and protected with encryption codes it was written by jerry alisandros and sent to about eighty lawyers one of whom was wally figg it read i regret to inform you that tomorrows settlement conference has been canceled by varrick labs this morning i had a lengthy phone conversation with nicholas walker chief inhouse counsel for varrick during which i was advised that the company has decided to temporarily postpone settlement negotiations their strategy has changed somewhat especially in light of the fact that the klopeck trial is scheduled to begin in chicago in four weeks varrick now thinks its wise to sort of test the waters with an initial trial see how the facts play out determine liability and roll the dice with a real jury while this is not unusual i had some very harsh words for mr walker and his companys rather abrupt change of plans i suggested they had negotiated in bad faith and so on but there is little to be gained by arguing at this point since we did not quite reach the point of agreeing on the specifics of a settlement there is nothing to enforce it looks as though all eyes will be on the courtroom in chicago ill keep you posted ja wally printed the emailit weighed a tonwalked it into oscars office and placed it on his desk then he fell into a leather chair and almost began weeping oscar read it slowly the wrinkles across his forehead growing thicker with each sentence he was breathing through his mouth heavily rochelle buzzed in with a call for oscar but he did not respond they heard her heavy footsteps as she walked to his office door tapped it and when neither lawyer responded she peeked inside and said mr finley its judge wilson oscar shook his head and said i cant talk now ill call him back she closed the door minutes passed then david knocked on the door came inside looked at the two partners and knew the world was coming to an end oscar handed him the email which he read as he paced in front of the bookshelves theres more david said what do you mean theres more wally asked his voice weak and dry i was just online looking at a discovery filing when i saw the notice that a motion had been filed not twenty minutes ago jerry alisandros on behalf of zell amp potter filed a motion to withdraw as counsel in the klopeck case wallys entire body slumped a good six inches oscar grunted as if trying to say something david himself pale and stunned continued i called my contact at zell amp potter guy named worley and he tells me off the record that its a full retreat the expertsour expertshave all collapsed on the drug and no one is willing to testify the mcfadden report wont stand up in court varrick has known this for some time and has been stringing out the settlement talks so they could yank the rug out right before the klopeck trial worley says the zell amp potter partners are at war but alisandros gets the last word he isnt coming to chicago because he doesnt want such a notorious loss on his great record with no experts the case is hopeless worley says theres a good chance that there was nothing wrong with the drug to begin with i knew these cases were a bad idea oscar said oh shut up wally hissed david sat in a wooden chair as far from the two partners as possible oscar had both elbows on his desk with his head between his forearms as if in a vice as if a lethal migraine were forming wallys eyes were closed and his head twitched because they seemed unable to speak david felt compelled to attempt conversation can he withdraw this close to trial he asked fully aware that his two partners knew virtually nothing about the rules of federal court procedure thats up to the judge wally said what are they going to do with all their cases he asked david they have thousands tens of thousands worley thinks that everybody will just sit tight and see what happens here with klopeck if we win then i guess varrick will resume settlement talks if we lose i guess the krayoxx cases are worthless the idea of winning seemed quite remote minutes passed with no words the only sounds were the labored breathing of three bewildered men the distant sound of an ambulance approached on beech street but none of the three reacted finally wally sat erect or tried to and said well have to ask the court for a continuance for additional time and well probably want to oppose this motion to withdraw oscar managed to dislodge his head he glared at wally as if he could shoot him too what you need to do is call your buddy jerry and find out what the hells going on he cant run away with the trial this close tell him well file an ethics complaint tell him well leak it to the pressthe great jerry alisandros afraid to come to chicago tell him anything wally but he has to come try this case god knows we cant do it if theres nothing wrong with the drug why even think about going to trial david asked its a bad drug wally said and we can find an expert wholl say so for some reason im having trouble believing you oscar said david stood and headed for the door i suggest we go to our rooms think about the situation and reconvene here in an hour wally said good idea and staggered to his feet he got to his office to his phone and began calling alisandros not surprisingly the great man was unavailable wally began sending him emailslong scorching messages filled with threats and invective david scoured the blogsfinancial mass tort legal watchdogsand found confirmation that varrick had called off settlement talks its share price was down for the third day in a row b y late afternoon the firm had filed a motion for a continuance and a response to jerrys motion to withdraw virtually all the work was done by david because wally had fled the office and oscar was not functioning well david had briefed rochelle on the disaster and her first concern was wallys drinking hed been sober for almost a year but she had witnessed his earlier relapses the following day in an unusually prompt move nadine karros filed a response in opposition to the request for more time and in a move that was easily predictable she had no problem with zell amp potter making an exit a long trial against a pro like jerry alisandros would be a tremendous challenge but nadine was confident she could make quick work of either finley or figg or both the following day in a response that was almost dizzying in its speed judge seawright denied the request for additional time the trial had been set for october and it would go on he had cleared his calendar for two weeks and it would be unfair to other litigants to change the schedule mr figg had filed the lawsuit with as much noise as possible and hed had ample time to prepare for trial welcome to the rocket docket judge seawright had harsh words for jerry alisandros but in the end granted his motion to withdraw procedurally such a motion was almost always granted the judge noted that the client iris klopeck would still have adequate legal representation after the departure of mr alisandros the word adequate could have been debated but the judge took the high ground and did not comment on the complete lack of federal trial experience by mr figg mr finley and mr zinc the only remaining option was for wally to file a motion to dismiss the klopeck case along with the other seven his fortune was slipping away and he was close to a nervous breakdown but as painful as a dismissal would be he could not imagine the horror of walking into seawrights courtroom practically alone with the unbearable weight of thousands of krayoxx victims on his back and pursuing a case that even the great trial lawyers were now dodging no sir he along with what appeared to be everyone else whod stepped into the pit was scrambling to get out of it oscar was adamant that the clients should first be notified david was of the opinion that wally should obtain their consent before he killed their cases wally halfheartedly agreed with both but he could not bring himself to inform his clients that he was dismissing their cases only days after hed sent his jolly letters virtually promising million each he was already working on his lies he planned to tell iris then the rest of them that varrick had successfully managed to get the cases kicked out of federal court and that he and the other lawyers were considering refiling them in state court and this would take time and so on wally needed to burn some clock let a few months go by stall procrastinate lie blame the delays on big bad varrick laboratories let the dust settle let the dreams of quick money fade away after a year or so he would conjure up some more lies and with the passage of time all would be forgotten he typed the motion himself and when it was finished he stared at it for a long time on his desktop finally with his door locked and his shoes off wally punched the send button and said farewell to his fortune he needed a drink he needed oblivion alone broker than ever his dreams dashed his pile of debts higher wally finally cracked and started crying chapter not so fast said ms karros her prompt and sharply worded response to what wally thought was a routine motion to dismiss was startling she began by declaring that her client insisted upon a trial she went into great detail describing the torrent of bad press varrick labs had endured for over a yearmuch of it created and fanned by the plaintiffs barand she attached to her motion a binder three inches thick and filled with press clippings from around the country every story was driven by some loudmouthed lawyer including wally flaying varrick over krayoxx and screaming for millions it was now grossly unfair to allow these same lawyers to cut and run without a word of apology to the company her client really didnt want an apology it wanted justice it demanded a fair trial before a jury varrick labs didnt start this fight but it certainly planned to finish it along with her response she included her own motion one that had never been seen around the offices of finley amp figg its titlerule motion for sanctionswas frightening its language was enough to send wally back to rehab david back to rogan rothberg and oscar into an early unfunded retirement ms karros argued quite persuasively that if the court granted the plaintiffs motion to dismiss the case then the filing of the case was purely frivolous in the first place the fact that the plaintiff now wanted to dismiss was a clear sign the case had no merit and should never have been filed however it was filed some nine months earlier and the defendant varrick had no alternative but to vigorously defend itself therefore under the sanctions provision of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure the defendant was entitled to be reimbursed for the costs of fighting back so far and ms karros was blunt about the fact that the meter was still running at full throttle varrick labs had spent approximately million defending itself with at least half of that attributable to the klopeck case a huge sum no doubt but she was quick to point out that the plaintiff had demanded million when the lawsuit was filed and given the nature of mass tort litigation with all the elements of a stampede it was and still is imperative that varrick labs successfully defend the first trial at all costs the law does not require a party to select the cheapest law firm or look for a bargain with so much at stake varrick labs wisely chose a law firm with a long history of success in the courtroom she went on for pages giving details of other frivolous cases in which federal judges had thrown the book at the less than scrupulous lawyers who filed all this junk including two from the sacred courtroom of the honorable harry l seawright rule provides that sanctions if granted by the court are to be borne equally by the lawyers and their client hey iris guess what you owe half of million david mumbled to himself hoping to find a bit of humor in another depressing day he read it first and by the time he finished he was sweating around the neck nadine karros and her small army at rogan rothberg had cranked it out in less than fortyeight hours and david could visualize the young grunts pulling allnighters and sleeping at their desks when wally read it he quietly left the office and was not seen for the rest of the day when oscar read it he shuffled to a small sofa in his locked office eased off his shoes and stretched out his eyes covered with an arm after a few minutes he not only appeared to be dead he was actually praying for the end b art shaw was a lawyer who specialized in suing other lawyers for malpractice this little niche in the crowded market had earned him the reputation among the bar as a pariah he had few friends in the profession but he had always considered that to be a good thing he was smart talented and aggressive just the man varrick needed for a job that appeared to be a bit shady but was actually well within ethical guidelines after a series of phone conversations with judy beck nick walkers cohort in the legal department at varrick shaw agreed to the terms of a confidential representation his retainer was and his hourly rate was any fees earned from the potential malpractice cases would be kept by shaw his first call was to iris klopeck who with a month to go before trial was drifting in and out of a state that vaguely resembled emotional stability she wanted no part of a conversation with another lawyer a stranger but did admit she wished she had never met that other one after she abruptly hung up shaw waited an hour and tried again after a cautious hello shaw plunged in are you aware that your attorney is trying to dismiss your case he asked when she couldnt respond immediately he continued ms klopeck my name is bart shaw im a lawyer and i represent people who get screwed by their own lawyers legal malpractice its all i do and your lawyer wally figg is trying to weasel out of your case i think you may have a lawsuit against him he has malpractice insurance coverage and you might be entitled to recover some money ive heard that somewhere before she said softly it was shaws game and he talked nonstop for the next ten minutes he described the motion to dismiss and wallys efforts to unload not just her case but seven others as well when she finally spoke she said but he promised me a million dollars he promised oh yes thats highly unethical but then i doubt if mr figg worries too much about ethics hes pretty sleazy she observed how exactly did he promise you a million dollars right here at the kitchen table first time i laid eyes on him then he put it in writing he what you have it in writing got a letter from figg a week or so ago said they were about to agree on a million settlement which was a lot more than the million he had promised got the letter right here what happened to the settlement whats your name again shaw kept her on the phone for an hour and both were exhausted when the conversation was over millie marino was next and unmedicated she grasped the issues much more quickly than poor iris she knew nothing about the collapse of the settlement plan or the dismissal nor had she spoken with wally in several weeks as with iris shaw convinced her to hold off contacting wally right away it was more important for shaw to do so at the right moment millie was thoroughly bewildered by the conversation and the turn of events and said she needed some time to gather her thoughts adam grand needed no such time he began cursing wally immediately how could the little worm try to dismiss the case without telling him last he heard they were about to settle for million hell yes grand was ready to go after figg how much malpractice insurance coverage does he have he asked the standard policy is million but there are many variations shaw explained well know soon enough t he fifth firm meeting took place after dark on a thursday night and rochelle skipped it she could not handle more bad news and there was nothing she could do to help the miserable situation the letter from bart shaw had arrived that afternoon and was now lying in the center of the table after explaining that he was in consultation with six of your clients who were involved in the krayoxx litigation including ms iris klopeck he went on to clearly state that he had not been retained by any of the six not yet they were waiting to see what happened next with their cases however he shaw was gravely concerned with finley amp figgs efforts to unload the cases and without notifying the clients such behavior breached all manner of professional conduct in stiff but lucid language he lectured the firm on a variety of topics its ethical duty to diligently protect its clients interests its duty to keep the clients informed of all developments the unethical payment of referral fees to clients the outright guarantee of a favorable outcome in order to induce a client to sign up and on and on he sternly warned them that further lapses in their conduct would lead to unpleasant litigation oscar and wally who had survived numerous charges of unethical behavior were not as bothered by the allegations as they were terrified of the letters overall message to wit the firm would be immediately sued for malpractice if the cases were dismissed david was upset over every word in shaws letter they sat around the table all three subdued and thoroughly defeated there was no cursing or shouting david knew the fighting had already taken place when he was away from the office there was no way out if the klopeck lawsuit was dismissed ms karros would castrate them with her demand for sanctions and old seawright would go right along with it the firm could face millions in fines on top of that this shark shaw would pile on with a malpractice claim and drag them through the mud for the next two years if they withdrew their motion to dismiss they would be staring at a trial date that was now only twentyfive days away while wally doodled on a legal pad as if he were heavily medicated oscar did most of the talking so either we get rid of these cases and face financial ruin or we march into federal court three weeks from monday with a case that no lawyer in his right mind would try before a jury a case with no liability no experts no decent facts a client whos crazy half the time and stoned the other half a client whose dead husband weighed pounds and basically ate himself to death a veritable platoon of highly paid and very skilled lawyers on the other side with an unlimited budget and experts from the finest hospitals in the country a judge who strongly favors the other side a judge who doesnt like us at all because he thinks were inexperienced and incompetent and well what else what am i leaving out here david we have no cash for litigation expenses david said but only to complete the checklist right helluva job wally as you used to say all the time these mass tort cases are a gold mine come on oscar wally pleaded softly give me a break i take full responsibility its all my fault flog me with a bullwhip whatever but allow me to suggest we limit our discussions to something that might be productive okay oscar sure whats your plan dazzle us some more wally we have no choice but to go fight wally said his voice still hoarse his delivery slow we try to piece together some proof we go to court and fight like hell and when we lose we can tell our clients and this scumbag shaw that we fought the good fight in every lawsuit somebody wins somebody loses sure well get our butts kicked but at this point id rather walk out of the courtroom with my head up than deal with sanctions and malpractice claims have you ever faced a jury in federal court wally oscar asked no have you no oscar said and looked at david have you david no thats what i thought the three stooges bumbling into the courtroom with the lovely iris klopeck and no clue about what to do next you mentioned piecing together some proof care to enlighten us wally wally glared at him for a moment then said we try to find a couple of experts a cardiologist and maybe a pharmacologist there are a lot of experts out there wholl say anything for a fee we pay them put them on the witness stand hope like hell they survive theres no way theyll survive because they would have to be bogus in the first place right but at least were trying oscar at least were putting up a fight how much do these quacks cost wally looked at david who said i caught up with dr borzov this afternoon the guy who was here screening our clients hes back home in atlanta now that the screening has come to a sudden halt he said he would consider testifying in the klopeck case for a fee of uh i think he said his accent is pretty thick seventyfive thousand oscar repeated and you cant even understand him hes russian and his english is not too refined which may work to our advantage in a trial because we might want the jury to be thoroughly confused im sorry youre losing me well you gotta figure that nadine karros will batter the guy on crossexamination if the jury understands how lame he is then our case is weakened but if the jury isnt sure because they cannot understand him then maybe just maybe the damage is lessened and they taught you this at harvard i really dont remember what they taught me at harvard so how did you become an expert on trial practice im not an expert but i am reading a lot and watching perry mason reruns sweet little emma is not sleeping well and im roaming around at night i feel better wally said with some luck we can find a bogus pharmacologist for or so there will be a few more expenses but rogan has not put up much of a fight and now we know why oscar said they want a trial and fast they want justice they want a quick clear verdict that they can take and broadcast around the world you guys fell for their trap wally varrick started talking settlement and the mass tort boys started buying new jets they strung you along until the first trial was only a month away then they pulled the rug your close friends at zell amp potter hit the back door and here we are with nothing but financial ruin weve had this conversation oscar wally said firmly a thirtysecond timeout was observed as things settled down somewhat wally calmly said this building is worth and debt free lets go to the bank put up the building for a line of credit cap it at and go search for experts i was expecting this oscar said why should we throw good money after bad come on oscar you know more about litigation than i do which isnt much but youre right about that its not enough to simply walk into court start the trial pick a jury then duck for cover when nadine starts firing cannons at us we wont even get to the trial if we dont find a couple of experts that in itself is malpractice david tried to help you can bet this guy shaw will be in the courtroom watching us right said wally and if we dont at least try to put on a case seawright might consider it frivolous and hit us with sanctions as crazy as it seems spending some money might save us a bundle down the road oscar exhaled and clasped his hands behind his head this is insanity complete insanity wally and david agreed w ally withdrew his motion to dismiss his cases and sent copies to bart shaw for good measure nadine karros withdrew her response and rule motion for sanctions when judge seawright signed both orders the boutique firm of finley amp figg breathed easier for the moment the three lawyers were not in her gun sights after reviewing the firms financials the bank was reluctant to make the loan even with the office building free and clear unknown to helen david signed a personal guaranty for the line of credit as did his two partners with now available the firm kicked into high gear which was made complicated by the fact that none of the three was clear on what needed to be done judge seawright and his clerks reviewed the file daily and with growing concern on monday october all lawyers were summoned to chambers for an informal update session his honor began the meeting by stating unequivocally that the trial would begin in two weeks and nothing could change this both sides claimed to be ready for trial have you retained experts he asked wally yes sir and when do you think you might share this information with the court and with the other side you are months past due on this you know yes your honor but weve had a few unexpected events in our timeline wally said beautifully like a real smartass whos your cardiologist nadine karros fired from the other side of the table dr igor borzov wally shot back confidently as if borzov were known as the greatest heart expert in the world nadine did not flinch nor did she smile when can he be here for a deposition the judge asked whenever wally said no problem the truth was that borzov was having a difficult time making a decision about walking into a buzz saw even for we wont be deposing dr borzov ms karros said quite dismissively in other words i know hes a quack dont care what he says in a depo because i will annihilate him in front of the jury she made this decision on the spot with no need to confer with her minions or ponder things for twentyfour hours her iciness was indeed chilling do you have a pharmacologist she asked we do wally lied dr herbert threadgill wally had actually spoken to this guy but no agreement had been reached david got his name from his pal worley at zell amp potter who described threadgill as a nut job wholl say anything for a buck but it was proving not to be that easy threadgill was asking for to compensate for some of the humiliation he would undoubtedly face in open court we dont need his deposition either she said with a slight flip of the hand that conveyed a thousand words hell be dog meat too w hen the meeting ended david insisted that oscar and wally follow him to a courtroom on the fourteenth floor of the dirksen building according to the federal courts web site an important trial was getting started it was a civil case involving the death of a seventeenyearold high school senior whod been killed instantly when a tractortrailer rig blew through a red light and hit the kid broadside the rig was owned by an outofstate company thus the federal jurisdiction since no one at finley amp figg had ever tried a case in federal court david felt strongly that they should at least watch one chapter five days before the trial judge seawright reconvened the lawyers in his courtroom for the final pretrial conference the three stooges looked remarkably put together and professional thanks to davids efforts he had insisted they wear dark suits white shirts ties that were anything but flashy and black shoes for oscar this had not been a serious problem since he had always dressed the part of a lawyer albeit one from the streets for david it was second nature because he had a closet full of expensive suits from his days at rogan rothberg for wally though it had been more of a challenge david found a mens store with moderately priced clothing and he had actually gone with wally to make selections and supervise the fitting wally had bitched and bickered throughout the ordeal and he nearly bolted when the final tally came to eventually he put it on a credit card and he and david both held their breath when the clerk processed it the charges cleared and they hurried away with bags of shirts ties and one pair of black wing tips on the other side of the courtroom nadine karros in prada was surrounded by half a dozen of her attack dogs all spiffed up in zegna and armani suits and looking like ads from glossy magazines as was his custom judge seawright had not released the list of prospective jurors the other judges released their lists weeks before trial and this invariably set in motion a frenzied investigation by highly paid jury consultants for both sides the bigger the case the more money was spent probing into the backgrounds of the jury pool judge seawright detested these shadowy maneuverings years earlier in one of his cases there had been allegations of improper contact by investigators prospective jurors had complained of being watched followed photographed and even approached by smoothtalking strangers who knew too much about them judge seawright called the meeting to order and his clerk handed one list to oscar and another to nadine karros there were sixty names all of which had been prescreened by the judges staff to eliminate any juror who was taking or had ever taken krayoxx or any other cholesterol medication had a family member relative or friend who was taking or had ever taken krayoxx had ever been represented by a lawyer remotely connected to the case had ever been involved in a lawsuit involving a drug or product alleged to be defective had read a newspaper or magazine article about krayoxx and the litigation surrounding it the fourpage questionnaire went on to cover other areas that might disqualify a prospective juror in the next five days rogan rothberg would spend delving into the backgrounds of the jury pool once the trial started they would have three highly paid consultants scattered around the courtroom observing the jury as it reacted to the testimony finley amp figgs consultant cost and was brought on board only after another firm fight she and her associates would do their best to check backgrounds and profile the model juror and she would observe the selection process her name was consuelo and she quickly realized that she had never worked with such inexperienced attorneys it had been determined through an unpleasant and often testy process that oscar would take the role of lead counsel and do most of the footwork in the courtroom wally would observe offer advice take notes and do whatever the secondincommand was supposed to do though none of them were certain what this would entail david would be in charge of the research a monumental task since this was the first federal trial for all three and everything had to be researched through the course of numerous arduous strategy sessions around the table david had learned that oscars last jury trial had been in state court eight years earlier a relatively simple whorantheredlight car accident that he had lost wallys record was even more modesta slipandfall case against a walmart in which the jury deliberated fifteen minutes before finding for the store and an almost forgotten car wreck up in wilmette that had also ended badly when oscar and wally locked horns over strategy they had turned to david because he was the only one there his votes had been crucial a fact that disturbed him greatly after the lists were handed over judge seawright delivered a stern lecture about getting close to the jury pool he explained that when the prospective jurors arrived monday morning he would grill them on the subject of improper contact did they feel as if someone had been prying into their lives their backgrounds had they been followed photographed any violations and he would be a very unhappy judge moving on he said no daubert challenges have been filed so its safe to say that neither side wishes to challenge the others experts am i correct neither oscar nor wally was aware of the daubert rule which had been around for years daubert allowed each side to challenge the admissibility of the others expert testimony it was standard procedure in federal cases and was followed in about half of the states david had stumbled across it ten days earlier when he was watching a trial down the hall after some quick research he realized that nadine karros could probably exclude their experts before the trial even started the fact that she had not requested a daubert hearing meant only one thingshe wanted their experts on the stand so she could castigate them before the jury after david explained the rule to his partners the three made the decision not to file daubert challenges against the experts for varrick their reason was as simple as nadines but on the reverse side her experts were so experienced credentialed and qualified that a daubert challenge would be fruitless thats correct your honor she replied thats correct oscar said unusual but then im not looking for any extra work the judge shuffled some papers and whispered to a clerk i see no pending motions nothing left to do but start the trial the jurors will be here at monday morning and we will begin promptly at am anything else nothing from the lawyers very well i commend both sides on an efficient discovery process and unusual cooperation i intend to oversee a fair and speedy trial courts adjourned the finley amp figg team quickly gathered its files and papers and left the courtroom on the way out david tried to imagine what the place would look like in five days with sixty prospective and nervous jurors moles from other mass tort law firms on hand for a bloodletting reporters stock analysts jury consultants trying to blend in smug corporate honchos from varrick and the usual courthouse observers the knot in his stomach made breathing difficult just survive it he kept telling himself youre only thirtytwo years old this will not be the end of your career in the hallway he suggested they split up and spend a few hours watching other trials but oscar and wally just wanted to leave so david did what hed been doing for the past two weeks he eased into a tense courtroom and took a seat three rows behind the lawyers the more he watched the more fascinated he became with the art of a trial chapter in the matter of klopeck v varrick labs the first crisis was the failure of the plaintiff to show up for court when informed of this in chambers judge seawright was less than pleased wally tried to explain that iris had been rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night complaining of shortness of breath hyperventilation hives and one or two other afflictions three hours earlier as the finley amp figg lawyers worked frantically around the table in a predawn session a call came on wallys cell it was bart shaw the malpractice lawyer who was threatening to sue if the krayoxx cases were mishandled apparently iriss son clint had found a lawyers phone number and called to say his mother was in the ambulance and headed for the hospital she would not be able to attend the trial clint had called the wrong lawyer and shaw was just passing along the news gee thanks asshole wally had said as he punched the disconnect when did you first learn that she was taken to the hospital judge seawright was now asking a few hours ago judge we were at the office preparing and her lawyer called her lawyer i thought you were her lawyer david and oscar wanted to slide under the table wallys brain was already fried and he had taken two sedatives he looked upward at the ceiling and tried to think of a quick way out of this blunder yes well you see judge its complicated but shes at the hospital ill go see her during the lunch break across the table nadine karros maintained a look of casual concern she knew everything about bart shaws bullying of finley amp figg in fact she and her associates had located shaw and recommended him to nicholas walker and judy beck you do that mr figg seawright said sternly and i want to see some report from her doctors i suppose if shes unable to testify then well be forced to use her deposition yes sir jury selection should move right along i anticipate seating the jury by late this afternoon so youre first up in the morning mr figg ideally the plaintiff begins its case by taking the stand and talking about the dearly departed it was certainly thoughtful of judge seawright to tell them how to try their case wally thought but his tone was condescending ill talk to her doctors wally said again thats the best i can do anything else all the lawyers shook their heads then left the chambers they filed into the courtroom which had filled up nicely in the past fifteen minutes to the left behind the plaintiffs counsel table a bailiff was herding the sixty jurors into the long padded benches to the right several groups of spectators were milling about waiting whispering seated near the back together were millie marino adam grand and agnes schmidt three of finley amp figgs other victims present out of curiosity and perhaps looking for answers since their guaranteed million jackpots had suddenly vanished they were with bart shaw the vulture the pariah the lowest scum to be found in the legal profession two rows in front of them sat goodloe stamm the divorce lawyer hired by paula finley stamm had already heard the gossip and knew the serious trial lawyers had jumped ship still he was curious about the case and even hopeful finley amp figg could pull off a miracle and generate some money for his client judge seawright called things to order and thanked the jurors for their patriotic duty he gave a thirtyword summary of the case then introduced the lawyers and the courtroom personnel who would take part in the trialthe court reporter the bailiffs the clerks he explained the absence of iris klopeck and introduced nicholas walker the corporate representative for varrick laboratories after thirty years on the bench harry seawright knew a thing or two about selecting juries the most important element at least in his opinion was to keep the lawyers as quiet as possible he had his own list of questions one tweaked over the years and allowed the lawyers to submit inquiries to him but he did the bulk of the talking the extensive screening questionnaire streamlined the process it had already eliminated jurors who were over sixtyfive blind or suffering from a disability that would affect their service and those who had served in the past twelve months it had flagged those who claimed to know something about the case or the lawyers or the drug as the judge went through his questions an airline pilot stood and asked to be excused because of his schedule this prompted a surprisingly harsh lecture from judge seawright about civic duty when the pilot sat down adequately scorched no one else dared to claim they were too busy to serve a young mother with a downs child was excused in the previous two weeks david had talked to at least a dozen lawyers who had tried cases before seawright every judge has his quirks especially federal ones because they are appointed for life and their actions are seldom questioned every lawyer had told david to just lie low during jury selection the old man will do a thorough job for you they said over and over when the pool was down to fifty judge seawright picked twelve names at random they were directed by a bailiff to the jury box where they filled the comfortable chairs every lawyer was scribbling away the jury consultants were on the edges of their seats practically gawking at the first twelve the great debate had been whats the model juror for this case on the plaintiffs side the lawyers preferred heavy people with habits as slovenly as the klopecks preferably folks battling high cholesterol and other lifestyleinflicted health problems across the aisle the defense lawyers preferred lean hard youthful bodies with little patience and sympathy for the obese and afflicted in the first batch there was the inevitable mix though only a couple appeared to spend much time in the gym judge seawright zeroed in on number because she had admitted reading several articles about the drug however it became clear that she was openminded and could be fair number s father was a doctor and she grew up in a house where lawsuit was a dirty word number had once filed a lawsuit over a bad roofing job and this was discussed to the point of forcing yawns but the judge plowed ahead with his endless questions when he finished he invited the plaintiff to quiz the prospective jurors but only on topics that had not been covered oscar walked to the podium which had been turned to face the jury box he offered a warm smile and said good morning to the jurors i have just a couple of questions he said softly as if he had done this many times since the eventful day david zinc had stumbled literally into the offices of finley amp figg wally had said on numerous occasions that oscar was not easily intimidated perhaps it was his rough childhood his days as a tough street cop or his long career representing freakedout spouses and injured workers or maybe it was just his pugnacious irish composition but whatever the mix oscar finley had a very thick skin perhaps too it was the valium but when oscar chatted with the twelve potential jurors he managed to hide the jitters and nerves and outright fear and convey an air of calm and confidence he asked a few benign questions solicited a few feeble responses then sat down the firm had taken a first baby step in court without a disaster and david relaxed a little he was comforted by the fact that he was third down the linenot that he had much confidence in the two in front of himbut at least they were on the firing line and he was partially hidden back in the trenches he refused to glance over at the gang from rogan rothberg and they seemed genuinely unconcerned about him this was game day and they were the players they knew they would win david and his partners were going through the motions stuck with a case that no one wanted and dreaming of the end nadine karros addressed the potential jurors and introduced herself there were five men and seven women in the jury box the men ages twentythree to sixtythree sized her up and approved david concentrated on the womens faces it was helens theory that the women would have mixed and complicated feelings about nadine karros first and most important there would be pride that a woman was not only in charge but as they would soon realize also the best lawyer in the courtroom for some though the pride would soon yield to envy how could one woman be so beautiful stylish thin yet intelligent and successful in a mans world the first impressions were generally good judging from the faces of the women the men were all in nadines questions were more involved she talked about lawsuits the culture of litigation in our society and the routine news of outrageous verdicts did this ever bother any of the jurors for a few yes and so she probed deeper number s husband was a union electrician generally a safe bet for any plaintiff suing a large corporation and nadine seemed to take a special interest in her the finley amp figg lawyers watched nadine carefully her striking appearance would probably be the only highlight of the trial for them and even that would get old after two hours judge seawright ordered a thirtyminute recess so the lawyers could compare notes meet with their consultants and start making selections each side could assert that any juror should be excluded for good cause for example if a juror claimed to be biased for some reason or had once been represented by one of the law firms or claimed to hate varrick then the juror would be excused for good cause beyond that each side had three peremptory challenges that could be used to exclude a juror for any reason or no reason after thirty minutes both sides requested more time and judge seawright adjourned the proceedings until pm i assume you will check on your client mr figg he said wally assured him that he would outside the courtroom oscar and wally quickly decided that david would be sent to find iris and determine if she was able and willing to testify first thing tuesday morning according to rochelle who had spent the morning haggling on the phone with hospital receptionists iris had been taken to the emergency room at christ medical center when david arrived there at noon he learned that she had left an hour earlier he raced away in the direction of her home near midway airport and he and rochelle called her home number every ten minutes there was no answer the same monstrous orange cat was curled up at the front door one sleepy eye watching david as he cautiously approached along the sidewalk he remembered the barbecue grill on the front porch he remembered the aluminum foil covering the windows he had made this same walk ten months earlier the day after his escape from rogan rothberg following wally and wondering if hed lost his mind he now asked himself that again but there was little time for navelgazing he banged on the front door and waited for the cat to either move or attack who is it came a male voice david zinc your lawyer is that you clint it was clint opened the door and said what are you doing here im here because your mother is not in court were in the process of picking a jury and there is a federal judge whos somewhat upset because iris skipped court this morning clint waved him in iris was laid up on the sofa under a stained and tattered quilt eyes closed a beached whale the coffee table next to her was covered in gossip magazines an empty pizza box empty bottles of diet soda and three jars of prescription drugs how is she david whispered though he had a general idea clint shook his head gravely not good he said as if she would die any minute david backed into a dirty chair covered in orange cat fur he had no time to waste and despised being there anyway iris can you hear me he said at full volume yes she answered without opening her eyes listen the trial is under way and the judge really needs to know if you plan to show up tomorrow we need you to testify and tell the jury about percy its sort of your job as the representative of his estate and spokesman for the family you know she grunted and exhaled a painful racket that came from deep in her lungs didnt want this lawsuit she said her words slurred that creep figg came here and talked me into it promised me a million dollars she managed to open her right eye and attempted to look at david you came with him now i remember i was just sitting here minding my own business and figg promised me all that money her right eye closed david pressed on you saw a doctor this morning at the hospital what did he say whats your condition you name it mainly nerves i cant go to court might kill me the obvious finally occurred to david their case if it could still be called that would be damaged even more if iris made an appearance before the jury the rules of procedure allowed that in the event a witness cannot testify for some reasondeath sickness imprisonmentthe deposition could be edited and presented to the jury as weak as her depo was nothing could be as bad as iris live and in person whats your doctors name david asked which one i dont know pick one the one you saw this morning at the hospital i didnt see one this morning got tired of waiting at the emergency room and so clint brought me home thats about five times in the past month clint said with an edge not so she fired back she does it all the time clint explained to david shell walk to the kitchen claim shes tired and short of breath next thing you know shes on the phone calling im pretty sick of it myself its always me who has to drive to the damn hospital and haul her back here well well iris said both eyes open glazed but angry he was a lot nicer when all that money was on the way couldnt have been sweeter now look at him beating up his poor sick momma just stop calling clint said are you going to testify tomorrow david asked firmly no i cant i cant leave this house otherwise my nerves will melt down it wont do any good will it clint asked the lawsuit is a loser that other lawyer shaw says you guys have messed up the case so bad cant nobody win it david was about to return fire when he realized that clint was right the lawsuit was a loser thanks to finley amp figg the klopecks were now in federal court with a case that was hopeless and he along with his partners was simply going through the motions and looking forward to the end david said goodbye and left as quickly as possible clint followed him outside and as they walked to the street he said look if you need me ill come to court and speak for the family if an appearance by iris was the last thing their case needed a cameo by clint was certainly next to last let me think about it david said but only to be nice the jury would get more than enough of the klopecks through iriss video deposition any chance were gonna get some money clint asked were fighting clint theres always a chance but no guarantees sure would be nice a t the jury was selected seated sworn and sent home with instructions to return at the following morning of the twelve there were seven women five men eight whites three blacks and one hispanic though the jury consultants felt as if race would not be a factor one woman was moderately obese the rest were in reasonably good shape their ages ranged from twentyfive to sixtyone all had finished high school and three had college degrees the finley amp figg lawyers piled into davids suv and headed back to the office they were exhausted but oddly satisfied they had gone toetotoe with the power of corporate america and so far had not crumbled under the pressure of course the trial hadnt really started no witness had been sworn no evidence had been offered the worst was yet to come but for the moment they were still in the game david gave a detailed account of his visit to see iris and all three agreed she should be kept away from the courtroom their first task of the evening was to somehow obtain a letter from a doctor that would satisfy seawright there was much to be done that evening they bought a pizza and took it to the office chapter mondays brief respite from the fear of annihilation was long forgotten by tuesday morning by the time the boutique team walked into the courtroom the pressure was back in spades this was the real beginning of the trial and a heavy tension filled the air just get through it david repeated each time his stomach turned flips judge seawright offered an abrupt good morning welcomed his jury then explained or tried to explain the absence of ms iris klopeck widow and personal representative of percy klopeck when he finished he said at this time each party will make an opening statement nothing you are about to hear is evidence rather its what the lawyers think they will prove during this trial i caution you to take it lightly you may proceed mr finley for the plaintiff oscar stood and walked to the podium with his yellow legal pad he placed it on the podium smiled at the jurors looked at his notes smiled again at the jurors then oddly stopped smiling several awkward seconds passed as if oscar had lost his train of thought and could think of nothing to say he wiped his forehead with the palm of his hand and fell forward he ricocheted off the podium and landed hard on the carpeted floor still groaning and grimacing as if in enormous pain there was a wild scramble as wally and david sprinted for him as did two uniformed bailiffs and a couple of the rogan rothberg attorneys several of the jurors stood as if they wanted to help in some way judge seawright was yelling call call then is there a doctor here no one claimed to be a doctor one of the bailiffs took charge and it wasnt long before it was clear that oscar had not merely fainted in the chaos and as a crowd hovered over oscar someone said hes barely breathing there was more scurrying about more calls for help a paramedic assigned to the courthouse arrived within minutes and knelt over oscar wally stood and backed away and found himself near the jury box without thinking and in an incredibly stupid effort at humor he looked at the jurors pointed to his fallen partner and said in a voice that was heard by many words that would be repeated by other lawyers for years to come oh the wonders of krayoxx your honor please nadine karros shrieked several of the jurors found it funny others did not judge seawright said mr figg get away from the jury wally scampered away he and david waited across the courtroom the jury was removed and sent back to the jury room courts in recess for an hour seawright said he walked down from the bench and waited near the podium wally eased over and said sorry about that judge silence a team of paramedics arrived with a stretcher oscar was strapped down and wheeled out of the courtroom he did not appear to be conscious he had a pulse but it was dangerously low as the lawyers and spectators mingled about uncertain as to what they should be doing david whispered to wally any history of heart trouble wally shook his head nothing hes always been lean and healthy seems like his father may have died young from something oscar never talked about his family though a bailiff approached and said the judge wants to see the lawyers in chambers f earing that he was on the hot seat wally decided he had nothing to lose he went into judge seawrights chambers with an attitude judge i need to get to the hospital just a moment mr figg nadine was standing and not happy she said in her best courtroom voice your honor based solely on the improper comments made by mr figg directly to the jurors we have no choice but to move for a mistrial mr figg his honor demanded in a tone that clearly conveyed the message that a mistrial was only minutes perhaps seconds away wally was standing too and could think of no response david instinctively said how is the jury prejudiced mr finley did not take the drug sure it was a stupid comment made in the chaos of the moment but there is no prejudice i disagree your honor nadine shot back several of the jurors thought it was funny and were actually on the verge of laughing calling it stupid is an understatement it was clearly an improper and very prejudicial comment a mistrial would mean a delay something that the plaintiffs team needed hell they were willing to delay it for a decade motion granted his honor announced i declare a mistrial now what wally had fallen into a chair and looked pale david said the first thing that came to his mind well judge we obviously need more time how about a continuance or something like that ms karros judge this is certainly a unique situation i suggest we wait twentyfour hours and monitor mr finleys condition i think its fair to point out that mr figg filed this lawsuit and was lead counsel until just a few days ago im sure he could try this case as well as his senior partner good point judge seawright agreed mr zinc i think it best if you and mr figg hustle on down to the hospital and check on mr finley keep me posted by email with copies to ms karros will do judge o scar suffered acute myocardial infarction he was stable and expected to survive but the early scans revealed substantial blockage in three coronary arteries david and wally spent a miserable day in the icu waiting room at the hospital killing time talking trial strategy emailing judge seawright eating food from a machine and walking the halls out of boredom wally was certain that neither paula finley nor their daughter keely was at the hospital oscar had moved out three months earlier and was already seeing someone else on the sly of course there were rumors that paula had also found someone new at any rate the marriage was happily over with though the divorce had a ways to go at a nurse led them to oscars bed for a brief hello he was awake thoroughly covered with tubes and monitors and breathing on his own great opening statement wally said and got a weak smile in return they were not about to mention the mistrial after a few awkward efforts at conversation they realized oscar was too fatigued to chat so they said goodbye and left on the way out a nurse informed them that surgery was scheduled for the following morning at the following morning david wally and rochelle surrounded oscars bed for a final round of wellwishing before he went to the or when a nurse asked them to leave they went to the cafeteria for a hearty breakfast of watery eggs and cold bacon what happens to the trial rochelle asked david gnawed a piece of bacon and eventually replied not sure but i have a hunch we wont be getting much of a continuance wally was stirring his coffee and observing two young nurses and it looks like were both getting promotions ill have the lead and youre getting moved to the second chair so the show goes on rochelle asked oh yes david said we have very little control over whats happening now varrick is calling the shots the company wants a trial because the company wants vindication a huge victory headlines proof that its wonderful drug is not so bad after all and most important the judge is clearly on their side another bite of bacon so they have the facts the money the experts the legal talent and the judge what do we have she asked both lawyers thought about that for a while then both began shaking their heads nothing we have nothing i guess we have iris wally finally said and got a laugh lovely iris and shes gonna testify in front of the jury no one of her doctors emailed a letter saying she is physically unable to testify in court david said thank god for that wally said after an hour of killing time the three voted unanimously to return to the office and try to pursue something productive david and wally had a dozen things to do for the trial a nurse called at with the welcome news that oscar was out of surgery and doing well he could not see visitors for twentyfour hours which was also well received david emailed the latest update to judge seawrights clerk and fifteen minutes later got a reply requiring all lawyers to be in his chambers at pm p lease give my regards to mr finley his honor said indifferently as soon as the lawyers were seated david and wally on one side and nadine and four of her henchmen on the other thanks judge wally said but only because a response was required our new plan is as follows seawright said without breaking stride there are thirtyfour jurors left in the pool i will summon them back friday morning october three days from today and we will select a new jury next monday october we will start the retrial any comments or concerns oh lots of them wally wanted to say but where should i begin nothing from the lawyers the judge continued i realize this does not give the plaintiffs lawyers much time to regroup but im convinced that mr figg will do as well as mr finley frankly neither has any experience in federal court substituting one for the other will not damage the plaintiffs case in any way we are ready for trial wally said loudly but only to retaliate and defend himself good now mr figg i will not tolerate any more of your ridiculous comments in court regardless of whether the jury is present i apologize your honor wally said with a phoniness that was obvious and your apology is accepted however i am levying a fine of against you and your firm for such reckless and unprofessional behavior in my courtroom and ill do it again if you step out of line thats a bit steep wally blurted so the hemorrhaging continues david thought to himself seventyfive thousand to dr borzov to dr herbert threadgill their expert pharmacologist to dr kanya meade their expert economist to consuelo their jury consultant throw in another to get all the experts to chicago feed them put them up in nice hotels and iris klopeck and her dead husband were costing finley amp figg at least now thanks to wallys big mouth they had just lost another bear in mind david kept telling himself this was supposedly cheap money being thrown up as a defense otherwise they would be sued for malpractice and face some rather terrifying sanctions for filing such a frivolous case in effect they were burning serious cash to make their frivolous case appear less frivolous such maneuverings had never been mentioned during law school at harvard nor had he ever heard of such insanity during his five years at rogan rothberg on the subject of sanctions ms karros took charge and said your honor this is a rule motion we are filing at this time copies were slid across the table as she continued we are requesting sanctions on the grounds that mr figgs reckless actions in court yesterday caused a mistrial resulting in unnecessary expense to our client why should varrick labs pay for the plaintiffs unprofessional behavior wally shot back because varrick has a book value of billion my net worth is substantially less humorous but no laughs judge seawright read the motion carefully and when david and wally realized this they began reading too after ten minutes of silence the judge said your response mr figg wally tossed his copy of the motion onto the table as if it were filthy you know judge i cant help the fact that these guys charge a zillion dollars an hour they are obscenely expensive but that should not be my problem if varrick wants to burn its cash then it certainly has plenty to burn but dont get me in the middle of it you miss the point mr figg nadine replied we wouldnt be doing the extra work if not for you and the mistrial you created but come on do you people really think youre that valuable depends on the outcome of the trial mr figg when you filed this lawsuit you asked for what a hundred million or so dont criticize my client for putting up a vigorous defense with good legal talent so let me get this straight during this trial if you and your client do something to sort of string things along you know drag out the trial god forbid make a mistake anything like that then i can file a quick motion for sanctions and collect some money am i right about this judge no that would be a frivolous motion subject to rule of course it would wally said with a belly laugh you guys make a great tag team watch it mr figg judge seawright growled knock it off david whispered a few seconds of silence followed as wally settled down finally the judge said i agree that the mistrial could have been avoided and that it has caused additional expense however i think is somewhat on the excessive end sanctions are in order but not to that extent ten thousand dollars is a more reasonable sum it is so ordered wally exhaledanother shot to the gut davids next thought was to try to speed things along so the meeting could come to a merciful end finley amp figg couldnt afford much more he offered a lame judge we need to get back to the hospital adjourned until friday morning chapter the second jury was comprised of seven men and five women of the twelve half were white three were black two were asian one was hispanic it was slightly more bluecollar and slightly heavier as a whole two of the men were uncomfortably obese nadine karros had decided to use her peremptory challenges to exclude fatties instead of minorities but she had been overwhelmed by the sheer abundance of girth consuelo was convinced that this jury was far more to their liking than the first monday morning as wally stood and made his way to the podium david held his breath he was on deck and another heart attack would force him into the lineup against overwhelming competition he was pulling mightily for the junior partner though wally had lost a few pounds frolicking with deeanna he was still pudgy and unkempt as far as heart attacks go he appeared to be a much likelier candidate than oscar come on wally you can do it give em hell and please dont collapse he did not he did a passable job of outlining their case against varrick labs the thirdlargest drugmaker in the world a mammoth corporation based in new jersey a company with a long deplorable history of littering the market with bad drugs objection by ms karros sustained from the bench but wally was careful and with good reason when a stray word or two can cost you upward of you tiptoe lightly around anything youre not sure of he repeatedly referred to the medicine not as krayoxx but rather as this bad drug he rambled at times but for the most part stayed on script when he finished thirty minutes after he started david was breathing again and whispered nice job nadine karros wasted no time in defending her client and its product she began with a lengthy detailed but quite interesting list of all the fabulous drugs varrick labs had brought to the market over the past fifty years drugs that every american knew and trusted and some that most had never heard of drugs that we give to our children drugs we consume with confidence every day drugs synonymous with good health drugs that prolong lives kill infections prevent diseases and so on from sore throats and headaches to cholera outbreaks and aids epidemics varrick labs had been on the front lines for decades and the world was a better safer and healthier place because of it by the time she finished with act one many of those in the courtroom would have taken a bullet for varrick switching gears she dwelled on the drug at hand krayoxx a drug so effective that it was prescribed by doctorsyour doctorsmore than any other cholesterol drug in the world she detailed the extensive research that had gone into developing krayoxx somehow she made clinical trials sound interesting study after study had proven the drug to be not only effective but safe her client had spent billion and eight years researching and developing krayoxx and it stood proudly behind this wonderful product without staring david watched the faces of the jurors all twelve followed every word all twelve were becoming believers david himself was being persuaded she talked about the experts she would call to testify eminent scholars and researchers from such places as mayo clinic cleveland clinic and harvard medical school these men and women had spent years studying krayoxx and knew it far better than the lightweights the plaintiff would present wrapping up she was confident that when all the proof had been heard they the jurors would have no trouble understanding and believing there was absolutely nothing wrong with krayoxx and they would retire and reach a quick verdict for her client varrick laboratories david watched the seven men as she walked away all fourteen eyes followed her closely he glanced at his watchfiftyeight minutesand the time had flown two large screens were erected by technicians and as they worked judge seawright explained to the jury they were about to watch the deposition of the plaintiff ms iris klopeck who could not attend due to health reasons her deposition had been taken and recorded by video on march in a hotel in downtown chicago the judge assured the jury this was not unusual and should not influence their opinion in any way the lights were dimmed and suddenly there was iris much larger than life frowning at the camera frozen clueless stoned the depo had been heavily edited to remove what was objectionable and the squabbles between the lawyers after breezing through all the background material iris got to the topic of percy his role as a father his work history his habits his death exhibits were offered and flashed onto the screen a photo of iris and percy splashing in the water with little clint both parents already morbidly obese another photo of percy at the grill with friends around all preparing to devour bratwurst and burgers on july another of him sitting in a rocker with that orange cat in his laprocking it seemed was his only exercise the images soon ran together and formed a picture of percy that was accurate but not pretty hed been a very large man who ate too much never broke a sweat was a slob died too young with the cause of death fairly obvious at times iris became emotional at times she was practically incoherent the video did little to arouse sympathy but as her trial team knew so well it was a much better presentation than having her there in person edited it ran for eightyseven minutes and everyone in the courtroom was relieved when it was over when the lights came on judge seawright declared it was time for lunch and they would reconvene at pm without a word wally vanished with the crowd he and david had planned to have a quick sandwich in the building and plot strategy but david gave up after fifteen minutes and left to eat alone in the cafe on the second floor of the building oscar was out of the hospital and convalescing in wallys apartment rochelle checked on him twice a daystill no sign of his wife or daughter david called him with a brief update on the start of the trial and put a positive spin on things oscar feigned interest but it was obvious he was happy to be where he was a t pm the courtroom came to order the bloodletting was about to begin and wally seemed remarkably at ease call your next witness the judge said and wally reached for his notepad this will be ugly he whispered and david caught the unmistakable odor of freshly consumed beer dr igor borzov was led to the witness stand where the bailiff presented a bible to help with the swearing in borzov looked at the bible and began shaking his head he refused to touch it judge seawright asked if there was a problem and borzov said something about being an atheist no bible he said i dont believe it david watched in horror come on you quack for a fee the least you can do is play along after an awkward delay judge seawright told the bailiff to lose the bible borzov raised his right hand and swore to tell the truth but by then the jury had already been lost working from a carefully worded script wally led him through the rituals of qualifying an expert educationcollege and med school in moscow traininga residency in cardiology in kiev a couple of hospitals in moscow experiencea brief stint on staff at a community hospital in fargo north dakota and private practice in toronto and nashville the night before wally and david had rehearsed with him for hours and they had pleaded with him to speak as slowly and clearly as possible in the privacy of their office borzov was somewhat comprehensible on center stage though and in a tense courtroom borzov forgot their pleas and delivered his rapidfire responses in an accent so thick it barely resembled english twice the court reporter called timeout for clarification court reporters are brilliant in their ability to digest mumblings speech impediments accents slang and technical vocabulary the fact that she couldnt follow borzov was devastating the third time she interrupted judge seawright said i cant understand him either do you have an interpreter mr figg thanks judge several of the jurors were amused by the question wally and david had actually discussed the hiring of a russian interpreter but that discussion had been part of a broader plan to forget borzov forget any expert forget all witnesses as a whole and simply not show up for the trial after a few more questions wally said we tender dr igor borzov as an expert witness in the field of cardiology judge seawright looked at the defense table and said ms karros she stood and with a wicked smile replied we have no objections in other words well help feed him all the rope he needs wally asked dr borzov if he had reviewed the medical records of percy klopeck he replied with a clear yes for half an hour they discussed percys dismal medical history then began the tedious process of admitting the records into evidence it would have taken hours if not for the remarkable cooperation of the defense ms karros could have objected to a lot of the material but she wanted everything laid out for the jurors by the time the fourinchthick file was admitted several of them were struggling to stay awake the testimony improved dramatically with the aid of a greatly enlarged diagram of a human heart it was presented on a large screen and dr borzov was given wide latitude in describing it for the jury walking back and forth in front of the screen and with the aid of a pointing stick he did a decent job of describing the valves chambers and arteries when he said something that no one understood wally helpfully repeated it for the benefit of the others wally knew this would be the easy portion of his testimony and he took his time the good doctor seemed to know his stuff but then any secondyear med student was well versed in this material when the tutorial was finally finished borzov returned to the witness stand two months before he died in his sleep percy had undergone his annual physical complete with ekg and echocardiogram thus providing dr borzov with something to talk about wally handed him the echo report and the two spent fifteen minutes discussing the basics of an echocardiogram percys showed a marked decrease in the regurgitation of blood from the left ventricle chamber david took a deep breath as lawyer and witness waded into the minefield of technical medical jargon it was a disaster from the very beginning krayoxx supposedly damaged the mitral valve in such a way that it impeded the flow of blood as it was being pumped out of the heart in an attempt to explain this borzov used the term left ventricle ejection fraction when asked to clarify this for the jury borzov said the ejection fraction is actually the ventricular volume at enddiastole minus endsystole the ventricle volume and that divided by the total volume times one hundred is the ejection fraction such language was incomprehensible to laymen when delivered in slow precise english out of dr borzovs mouth it was nothing but gibberish and sadly comical nadine karros rose and said your honor please judge seawright shook his head as if hed been slapped and said come on mr figg three of the jurors were glaring at david as if he had insulted them a couple were suppressing chuckles treading water wally asked his witness to speak slowly clearly and if possible in easier language they plodded along borzov trying his best wally repeating virtually everything he said until some clarity was achieved but not much and not nearly enough borzov discussed the grading of mitral insufficiency the regurgitation of the left atrial area and the level of severity of the mitral regurgitation long after the jury gave up wally asked a series of questions about the interpretation of the echocardiogram and it prompted this response if the ventricle was totally symmetrical and had no discrepancies in the wall motion or geometry it would be a prolate ellipsoid just defines flat end and pointed end and gentle curve an ellipsoid fraction so the ventricle would contract down would still be a prolate ellipsoid but all walls would move except the plane of mitral valve the court reporter raised her hand and blurted im sorry your honor but im not getting this judge seawrights eyes closed his head was down as if he too had given up and just wanted borzov to finish and get out of the courtroom fifteenminute recess he mumbled w ally and david sat silent before two untouched cups of coffee in the small cafe it was monday afternoon and both felt as though theyd spent a month in seawrights courtroom neither wanted to see it again while david was stunned by borzovs thoroughly discreditable performance he was also thinking about wallys drinking he wasnt drunk and didnt appear under the influence but any return to the bottle for an alcoholic was troubling he wanted to quiz him to see if he was okay but the place and time seemed inappropriate why bring up such a dreadful subject under such miserable circumstances wally stared at a spot on the floor motionless off in another world i dont think the jury is with us david said offhandedly no effort at humor but wally smiled and said the jury hates us and i dont blame them we wont make it past summary judgment as soon as we finish our case seawright will throw us out of court so a quick end cant blame him for that a quick and merciful end wally said still staring at the floor what will it mean for the other issues like sanctions and malpractice who knows i think the malpractice cases will go away you cant get sued just because you lose a case at trial sanctions though could be another story i can see varrick going for our jugulars claiming the case had no merit david finally took a sip of coffee wally said i keep thinking about jerry alisandros id like to catch him in an alley and beat him senseless with a baseball bat now thats a pleasant thought wed better go lets finish with borzov and get him out of here f or the next hour the courtroom suffered through the tortuous process of watching the video of percys echocardiogram while dr borzov attempted to describe what they were seeing with the lights dimmed several of the jurors began to nod off when the video ended borzov returned to the witness chair how much longer mr figg the judge asked five minutes proceed even the flimsiest of cases require certain magical language wally wanted to slip it in quickly while the jury was comatose and just maybe the defense was ready to go home now dr borzov do you have an opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the cause of the death of mr percy klopeck i do david was watching nadine karros who with little effort could have excluded any and all expert opinions from borzov on numerous grounds she seemed to have no interest in doing so and what is that opinion wally asked my opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty is that mr klopeck died of acute myocardial infarction or heart attack borzov offered this opinion slowly his english much clearer and do you have an opinion as to the cause of his heart attack my opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty is that the heart attack was caused by an enlarged left ventricle chamber and do you have an opinion as to what caused the enlargement of the left ventricle chamber my opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty is that the enlargement was caused by the ingestion of the cholesterol drug krayoxx at least four of the jurors were shaking their heads two others looked as though they wanted to stand and yell obscenities at borzov at pm the witness was finally excused and the jury sent home adjourned until nine oclock in the morning judge seawright said riding back to the office wally fell asleep in the passengers seat stuck in traffic david checked his cell phone then went online to check the market varricks stock had jumped from to news of the companys imminent victory was spreading fast chapter during her first two months on earth little emma had yet to sleep through the night down by eight she was usually up by eleven for a quick snack and a clean diaper a lengthy session of floor walking and chair rocking knocked her out by midnight but by am she was hungry again at first helen gamely clung to the plan of breastfeeding but after six weeks she was exhausted and introduced the bottle emmas father was not sleeping much either and they usually had a quiet chat during the predawn meals while momma stayed under the covers tuesday around am david gently placed her back in the crib turned off the light and eased from the room he went to the kitchen made coffee and as it brewed he went online to check the news weather and law blogs one blog in particular had followed the krayoxx litigation and the klopeck trial and david was tempted to ignore it but he could not the headline read mauling in courtroom the blogger known as the hung juror obviously had too much time on his hands or perhaps he was one of the rogan rothberg grunts he wrote for those with a morbid sense of curiosity hustle on over to courtroom in the dirksen federal building today for round two of the worlds first and probably only krayoxx trial for those of you who cannot attend its like watching a train wreck in slow motion and a helluva lot of fun to boot yesterday opening day the jurors and spectators were treated to the gruesome sight of the widow iris klopeck testifying by video supposedly she cannot attend the trial for medical reasons though one of my spies saw her shopping for groceries yesterday at the dominicks on pulaski road click here for photos this gal is one heavy woman and when her face hit the screen yesterday it was quite a shock at first she seemed well rather stoned but as the deposition wore on the drugs seemed to wear off she even managed a few tears when talking about her beloved percy who died at fortyeight years and pounds iris wants the jury to give her a truckload of cash and she tried her best to evoke sympathy didnt work most of the jurors were thinking the same thing i was thinkingif you people werent so big you wouldnt have so many health problems her dream team now minus its leader who had a heart attack of his own last week when he came facetoface with a real jury has made only one brilliant move so far and that was to keep iris out of the courtroom and away from the jury no more brilliance is expected from these two lightweights their second witness was their star expert a certified quack from russia who has so far after fifteen years in this country failed to master the most rudimentary elements of the english language his name is igor and when igor speaks no one listens igor could easily have been bounced by the defense on the grounds that he is unqualifiedhis deficiencies are too numerous to mentionbut it seems as though the defense has adopted a strategy of allowing the plaintiffs lawyers all the room they need to prove they have no case whatsoever the defense wants igor on the standhe helps their side enough david closed his laptop and went for the coffee he showered and dressed quietly kissed helen goodbye peeked in on emma then headed out when he turned onto preston he noticed the lights were on at finley amp figg it was and wally was hard at work good thought david maybe the junior partner had discovered some new theory they could spring on nadine karros and harry seawright and reduce some of the humiliation but wallys car was not parked behind the building the rear door was unlocked as was the front ac was prowling around the first floor agitated wally was not in his office he was not to be found david locked the doors and went to his office upstairs followed by ac there were no messages on his desk no emails he called wallys cell and got voice mail strange but then wallys routine often varied however neither he nor oscar had ever left the office unlocked and the lights on david tried to review some materials but couldnt concentrate his nerves were edgy because of the trial and now there was a nagging sense that something else was wrong he walked downstairs and had a quick look around wallys office the wastebasket next to his credenza was empty david hated to do it but he pulled open a few drawers and found nothing of interest in the kitchen next to the narrow fridge there was a tall round wastebasket where the coffee grounds were dumped along with food containers and empty bottles and cans david removed the white plastic liner opened it wide and found what he was afraid he might find to one side lying on top of a yogurt container was an empty pint bottle of smirnoff vodka david removed it rinsed it in the sink while he washed his hands and took it upstairs where he sat it on his desk and stared at it for a long time wally had a few beers during lunch then spent part of the night at the office drinking vodka and at some point decided to leave evidently he was drunk because he left the lights on and the doors unlocked they had agreed to meet at am for coffee and a work session by david was worried he called rochelle and asked if she had heard from wally no is something wrong she asked as if a bad phone call about wally was never unexpected no just looking for him thats all youll be in at eight right im leaving the apartment now ill run by and check on oscar then come to the office david wanted to call oscar but could not bring himself to do so his triple bypass had been six days earlier and david was not about to upset him he paced the floor fed ac and tried wallys cell again nothing rochelle arrived promptly at eight with the news that oscar was doing okay and had not seen wally he didnt come home last night she said david pulled the empty pint bottle out of his back pants pocket and said i found this in the kitchen wastebasket wally got drunk last night here and left the doors unlocked and the lights on when he left rochelle stared at the bottle and wanted to cry she had nursed wally through his previous battles and she had cheered him on through his rehabs she had held his hand prayed for him cried for him and celebrated with him as he joyfully counted the days of sobriety one year two weeks and two days and now they were looking at an empty bottle i guess the pressure got to him david said when he falls he falls hard david and each one is worse than the last david set the bottle on the table but he was so proud of being sober he said i cant believe this what he really couldnt believe was that the dream team or the three stooges was down to its last man standing and though his partners were woefully lacking in trial experience they were seasoned veterans compared with him you think hell show up in court david asked no she did not but rochelle didnt have the heart to be blunt probably so you need to get on the road i t was a long drive downtown david called helen and broke the news she was as bewildered as her husband and offered the opinion that the judge would have no choice but to postpone the proceedings david liked the sound of that and by the time he parked he was convinced that if wally didnt show he could prevail upon judge seawright to grant a continuance in all fairness losing the two lead lawyers in a case was surely grounds for either a mistrial or a postponement wally was not in the courtroom david sat alone at counsel table as the rogan rothberg team filed in and the spectators took their seats at david eased over to a bailiff and said he needed to see judge seawright and it was urgent follow me the bailiff said judge seawright had just put on his black robe when david entered his chambers skipping the greetings david said judge we have a problem mr figg is awol hes not here and i dont think hell show up the judge exhaled in frustration and continued to slowly zip up his robe you dont know where he is no sir judge seawright looked at the bailiff and said go fetch ms karros when nadine arrived alone she and david sat with the judge at the end of his long conference table david told them all that he knew and pulled no punches about wallys history with alcohol they were sympathetic and uncertain about what this meant for the trial david confessed that he felt thoroughly unprepared and inadequate to handle whatever was left to be done but at the same time he could not imagine the firm attempting to try the case again lets face it he said holding nothing back we dont have much of a case and we knew that when we started weve pushed this thing about as far as we can and weve done so only to avoid sanctions and malpractice suits you want a continuance the judge asked yes i think its only fair under the circumstances nadine said my client will resist any effort to delay matters and im certain it will push hard to finish this trial judge seawright said im not sure a continuance will work if mr figg is back on the booze and drinking so much he fails to show up for court it might take some time to get him detoxed again and ready for action i am not inclined to consider a continuance david could not argue with this logic judge i have no idea what to do out there ive never tried a case before i have not detected a great deal of experience on the part of mr figg you can certainly perform at his level there was a long pause as the three contemplated their rather unique dilemma finally nadine said i have a deal if you will finish the trial i will convince my client to forget rule sanctions judge seawright chimed in quickly mr zinc if you will finish the trial i guarantee there will be no sanctions against you or your client great but what about the malpractice claims nadine said nothing but the judge replied i doubt youll be in trouble there im not aware of a successful malpractice action against a lawyer who simply lost a trial nor am i nadine added theres a winner and a loser in every trial of course david thought and it must be nice to win every time lets do this the judge said well stand in recess todayill send the jury homeand you do your best to find mr figg if by chance he shows up tomorrow well continue as if nothing happened and i will not punish him for today if you dont find him or if hes unable to continue then well resume the proceedings at nine in the morning you do your best and ill help you as much as i possibly can well finish the trial and that will be the end of it what about an appeal nadine asked losing the two lead lawyers might make a convincing argument for a new trial david managed a smile and said i promise you there will be no appeal not that im involved in this case could very well bankrupt our little firm we borrowed money to litigate this far i cant imagine my partners wasting another moment fooling with an appeal if they were to somehow win one then they would be forced to come back here and try the case again thats the last thing they want all right so we have a deal the judge asked as far as im concerned we do replied nadine mr zinc david had no choice continue alone and he would save the firm from the threat of sanctions and probably malpractice as well his only other option would be to demand a continuance and when that was denied refuse to participate in the trial sure its a deal h e took his time driving back to the office he continually reminded himself that he was only thirtytwo that this would not ruin his career as a lawyer somehow he would survive the next three days a year from now it would almost be forgotten still no sign of wally david locked himself in his office and spent the rest of the day reading transcripts of other trials poring over the depositions from other cases studying the rules of procedure and evidence and fighting the urge to throw up over dinner he poked at his food as he replayed everything for helen how many attorneys are on the other side she asked i dont know too many to count at least six with another row of paralegals packed behind them and youll be alone at your table thats the scenario she chewed on a bite of pasta then said does anyone check the credentials of the paralegals i dont think so why just thinking maybe i should be a paralegal for the next few days ive always wanted to watch a trial david laughed for the first time in hours come on helen im not sure i want you or anyone else to witness the slaughter what would the judge say if i showed up with a briefcase and a legal pad and started taking notes at this point i think judge seawright would cut me a lot of slack i can get my sister to keep emma david laughed again but the idea was gaining momentum what was there to lose it could well be the first and last trial of his career as a litigator why not have a little fun i like it he said did you say there are seven men on the jury yes short skirt or long not too short chapter the hung juror blogged on a brief day in the klopeckkrayoxx trial as the dream team had trouble getting itself together word on the street is that the lead lawyer the honorable wallis t figg failed to answer the bell and his rookie sidekick was sent to look for him figg wasnt seen in the courtroom just before am judge seawright sent the jury home with instructions to return this morning repeated calls to the finley amp figg office went straight to voice mail none returned by the staff if the firm does indeed have a staff wonder if figg is on a bender fair question in light of the fact that hes had at least two duis in the past twelve years the last one a year ago my records show that figg has been married and divorced four times i tracked down wife number and she recalled that wallys always battled the bottle when contacted at her home yesterday the plaintiff iris klopeck who is still allegedly too sick to come to court replied im not surprised when told that her lawyer had failed to show then she hung up noted legal malpractice lawyer bart shaw has been seen sneaking around the courtroomrumor is that shaw might pick up the pieces of the krayoxx mess and go after finley amp figg for botching the cases so far the klopeck case has not been botched in theory the jury has not decided stay tuned david scanned other blogs as he ate a granola bar at his desk and waited for wally though he really didnt expect him no one had heard a wordoscar rochelle deeanna a couple of lawyer buddies from his former poker club oscar had called a pal at the police station for an informal inquiry though neither he nor david suspected foul play according to rochelle wally once disappeared for a week without a peep then called oscar from a motel in green bay pickled david was getting a lot of wally the drunk stories and he found them odd because he had known only the sober wally rochelle arrived early and climbed the stairs something she rarely did she was concerned about david and offered to help in any way he thanked her and began packing files in his briefcase she fed ac got her yogurt and was arranging her desk when she looked at her emails david she yelled it was from wally dated october am sent from his iphone rg hey im alive dont call the police and dont pay the ransom wf thank heavens rochelle said hes okay he doesnt say hes okay he just says hes alive i suppose thats a good thing what does he mean by ransom she wondered probably his effort to be funny haha david called wallys cell phone three times as he drove downtown his voice mail was full i n a room filled with somber men in dark suits a beautiful woman attracts far more attention than she would by simply walking down a busy street nadine karros had used her looks like a weapon as she had risen to the top of the elite courtroom advocates in the chicago area on wednesday she had some competition finley amp figgs new paralegal arrived at and as planned went straight to ms karros and introduced herself as helen hancock maiden name one of the parttime paralegals at finley amp figg then she introduced herself to several of the other defense lawyers causing all of them to stop whatever they were working on stand awkwardly shake hands smile and be nice at five feet eight inches and wearing fourinch heels helen was a few inches taller than nadine and she looked down on some of the others as well with her hazel eyes and chic designer frames not to mention the slender figure and skirt six inches above the knees helen succeeded in slightly disrupting the pregame rituals if only for a moment the spectators almost all men looked her over her husband who was ignoring all of this pointed to a chair behind his and said in a lawyerly fashion get me those files then in a lower voice he said you look spectacular but dont smile at me yes boss she said unfastening a briefcase one of several in his collection thanks for coming an hour earlier from his desk david had emailed judge seawright and nadine karros with the news that mr figg had been heard from but would not be in court they did not know where he was or when they might actually see him for all david knew wally could be back in green bay in a motel comatose and pickled though he kept this to himself dr igor borzov was reintroduced to the proceedings and took the stand with the look of a leper about to be stoned judge seawright said you may crossexamine ms karros she walked to the podium in another killer outfita lavender knit dress that fit snug and did an outstanding job of showcasing her shapely and quite firm backside and a thick brown leather belt that was pulled tight to announce yes im in a size she began by offering the expert a lovely smile and asking him to speak slowly because she had trouble understanding on monday borzov mumbled incoherently in return with so many obvious targets it was impossible to predict where she might attack first david had been unable to prepare borzov not that he wanted to spend another minute with the man dr borzov when was the last time you treated a patient of your own he had to think for a moment and eventually said about ten year this led to a series of questions about what exactly he had been doing for the past ten years he had not been seeing patients nor teaching nor researching nor doing all the things one would expect a doctor to do finally when she had excluded virtually everything she asked isnt it true dr borzov that for the past ten years you have worked exclusively for various trial lawyers borzov squirmed a bit he wasnt so sure about that nadine was she had the facts all gleaned from a deposition given by borzov in another case one year earlier armed with the details she took him by the hand and led him down the path of destruction year by year she went through the lawsuits the screenings the drugs and the lawyers and when she finished an hour later it was clear to everyone in the courtroom that igor borzov was nothing but a rubberstamper for the mass tort bar on her legal pad the paralegal slipped david a note where did you find this guy david wrote back impressive huh and his fee is only paid by whom you dont want to know evidently the hot seat affected his diction or perhaps borzov did not wish to be understood at any rate he became increasingly more difficult to understand nadine kept her cool so much so that david seriously doubted if she ever lost it he was watching a master and he was taking notes not to help resuscitate his witness but on effective crossexamination techniques the jurors could not have cared less they were gone checked out already waiting for the next witness nadine sensed this and began culling her list of problem areas at am judge seawright needed a potty break and called a twentyminute recess when the jury left the courtroom borzov approached david and asked how much longer i have no idea david replied the doctor was sweating and breathing heavy his armpits were wet too bad david wanted to say at least youre getting paid during the recess nadine karros and her team made the tactical decision to stay away from a replaying of percys echocardiogram with borzov bloodied and on the ropes the echo might allow him to regain some footing since he could once again lose the jury with medical jargon after the recess when borzov slowly returned to the witness chair she began chipping away at his education with a heavy emphasis on the differences between med school here and med school in russia she went through a list of courses and lectures standard here but unheardof over there she knew the answer to every question she asked and borzov by now knew this he became increasingly more hesitant to give a response directly knowing that any discrepancy however slight would be pounced upon dissected and slung back at him she hammered away at his training and managed to trip him a few times by noon the jurors those still watching the mayhem had the clear impression of a doctor they wouldnt trust to prescribe lip balm why had he never written any papers he claimed there had been some in russia but was forced to admit they had not been translated why had he never taught or joined a faculty the classroom bored him he tried to explain though it was painful to imagine borzov attempting to communicate with a group of students during lunch david and his paralegal hustled out of the building and went to a deli around the corner helen was fascinated by the proceedings but still stunned by dr borzovs pathetic showing just for the record she said over a spring salad if we ever reach the point of a divorce im hiring nadine oh really well then ill be forced to hire wally figg if i can keep him sober youre toast forget the divorce baby youre too cute and you have great potential as a courtroom paralegal helen grew serious and said look i realize you have a lot on your mind right now but you must be thinking about the future you cant stay at finley amp figg what if oscar cant come back what if wally cant kick the booze and assuming they can why would you want to stay there i dont know i havent had much time to think about it he had shielded her from the twin nightmares of the rule sanctions and the potential malpractice cases and he had decided not to tell her about the line of credit he had guaranteed along with the two partners leaving the firm in the near future was not likely lets talk about it later he said im sorry its just that i think you can do so much better thats all thank you dear whatyoure not impressed with my courtroom skills youre brilliant but i suspect one big trial might be enough for you by the way nadine karros doesnt do divorces then that settles it i guess ill just tough it out a t borzov tottered to the witness stand for the last time and nadine began her final assault since he was a cardiologist who didnt treat patients it was safe to assume he never treated percy klopeck true plus mr klopeck had been dead a long time before borzov was hired as an expert but surely he had consulted the doctors who did treat him no borzov admitted he had not feigning disbelief she began hammering away at this incredible oversight his responses grew slower his voice weaker his russian thicker until finally at borzov pulled a white handkerchief from a coat pocket and began waving it such drama was not contemplated by the wise folks who wrote the rules of federal trial procedure and david was uncertain about what he should do he stood and said your honor i think this witness has had enough dr borzov are you okay judge seawright asked the answer was obvious the witness shook his head no nothing further your honor ms karros announced and left the podium another impressive annihilation under her belt any redirect mr zinc the judge asked the last thing david wanted to do was to try to revive a dead witness no sir he said quickly dr borzov youre excused he staggered away with the aid of a bailiff richer but with another black mark on his resume judge seawright recessed court until d r herbert threadgill was a pharmacologist of dubious reputation he like borzov was spending the waning days of his career living the easy life away from the rigors of real medicine doing nothing but testifying for lawyers who needed his notoriously pliant opinions to fit their version of the facts the paths of both professional testifiers crossed occasionally and they knew each other well threadgill had been reluctant to sign on for the klopeck case for three reasons the facts were lousy the case was weak and he had no desire to face nadine karros in a courtroom he had finally said yes for only one reason plus expenses for only a few hours of work during the recess he saw dr borzov outside the courtroom and was appalled at his appearance dont do it borzov said as he shuffled toward the elevators threadgill hurried to the mens room splashed some water in his face and decided to flee screw the case screw the lawyers they were not major players anyway he had been paid in full and if they threatened to sue he might consider returning a portion of his fee or not he would be on an airplane in an hour in three hours he would be having a drink with his wife on the patio he wasnt committing a crime he was under no subpoena if necessary he would never return to chicago at pm david returned to the judges chambers and said well judge looks like weve lost another one i cant find dr threadgill and he wont answer his phone when did you last speak to him during lunch he was all set or at least he said so do you have another witness one who is here and has not gotten lost yes sir my economist dr kanya meade then put her on and well see if the lost sheep somehow find their way home percy klopeck worked for twentytwo years as a dispatcher for a freight company it was a sedentary job and percy did nothing to break the monotony of sitting in a chair for eight straight hours nonunion he was earning a year when he died and could have reasonably expected to work for seventeen more years dr kanya meade was a young economist at the university of chicago and she moonlighted occasionally as a consultant to pick up a few bucks in the klopeck case the math was straightforward a year for seventeen years plus anticipated annual increases based on the historical trend plus a retirement based on a fifteenyear life expectancy beyond the age of sixtyfive at percent of his highest salary in summary dr meade testified that percys death had cost his family million since he had died peacefully in his sleep there would be no claim for pain and suffering on crossexamination ms karros took exception to the numbers of percys life expectancy since he had died at fortyeight and early deaths were common among his male blood relatives it was unrealistic to suggest that he would have lived to age eighty nadine was careful though not to spend much time debating damages to do so would lend credence to the numbers the klopecks were not due a penny and she would not give the impression she was worried about the alleged damages when dr meade finished at judge seawright adjourned court until nine the following morning chapter after a hard day in court helen was in no mood to cook she picked up emma at her sisters home in evanston thanked her sister profusely and promised to debrief later and raced away to the nearest fastfood restaurant emma who slept in moving vehicles much better than in her own crib dozed peacefully as helen inched along in the drivethru she ordered more burgers and fries than usual because she and david were both hungry it was raining and the lateoctober days were growing shorter helen drove to the khaings apartment near rogers park and by the time she arrived david was there the plan was to have a quick dinner and hustle home for an early bedtimeemma of course holding the key to that david had no more witnesses to present for the plaintiff and he was not sure what to expect from nadine karros in the pretrial order the defense had listed twentyseven expert witnesses and david had read every one of their reports only nadine karros knew how many to call to the stand and in what order there was little for david to do but sit listen object occasionally pass notes to his comely paralegal and try to give the impression he knew what was going on according to a friend from law school a litigator in a washington firm there was an excellent chance the defense would move for summary judgment convince seawright that the plaintiff had failed to provide even the bare bones of a proper case and win outright without presenting a single witness it could be over tomorrow he said as he sat in traffic in washington and david did the same in chicago since thuya had been released from the hospital five months earlier the zincs had missed only a few of their wednesday night fastfood dinners the arrival of emma had briefly interrupted things but before long they were packing her along for the visits a ritual had clearly been established as helen approached the apartment building with the baby lwin and zaw mother and grandmother bolted from the door and raced to see the baby inside lynn and erin thuyas two older sisters sat side by side on the sofa waiting eagerly to get their hands on emma helen would place her gently in one of the laps and the girls and their mother and grandmother would chatter and squeal and act as if they had never before seen an infant they gently passed her around back and forth with great care this would go on for a long time while the men were starving thuya watched it from his high chair and seemed amused each week david and helen hoped to see some tiny sign of improvement in his condition and each week they were disappointed as his doctors predicted progress was highly unlikely the damage was after all permanent david sat by him rubbed his head as always and handed him a french fry he chatted with soe and lu as the women formed a gaggle around the baby eventually they made their way to the table where they were delighted to learn that david and helen would be eating with them they usually avoided burgers and fries but not tonight david explained that they were a bit rushed and would not have time to take thuya out for a drive halfway through a cheeseburger davids cell phone vibrated in his coat pocket he looked at it jumped to his feet whispered its wally to helen and stepped outside the front door where are you wally in a weak dying voice the reply came im drunk david so drunk thats what we figured where are you you gotta help me david theres no one else oscar wont talk to me sure wally you know ill help but where are you at the office ill be there in fortyfive minutes h e was on the sofa next to the table snoring ac nearby watching him with great suspicion it was wednesday night and david assumed correctly that wallys last shower had been bright and early monday morning the day the retrial commenced six days after oscars dramatic collapse and six days after wallys legendary mistrial no shower no shave no change of clotheshe was wearing the same navy suit and white shirt as when david had last seen him the tie was missing the shirt was heavily stained there was a slight tear on the right leg of his trousers dried mud caked the soles of his new black wing tips david tapped his shoulder and called his name nothing his face was red and puffy but there were no bruises cuts or scrapes perhaps he had not been brawling in bars david wanted to know where he had been but then he didnt wally was safe there would be time for questions later one being howd you get here his car was nowhere in sight which was somewhat of a relief maybe drunk as he was wally had the presence of mind not to drive on the other hand his car could have been wrecked stolen or repossessed david punched him on the biceps and yelled from six inches away wallys heavy breathing paused for a second then continued ac was whining so david let him out for a pee and made a pot of coffee he sent a text to helen drunk as a skunk but alive not sure whats next he called rochelle and passed along the news a call to oscars cell went straight to voice mail wally rallied an hour later and took a cup of coffee thanks david he said over and over then have you called lisa and who might lisa be my wife you need to call her david that sonofabitch oscar wont talk to me david decided to play along to see where the chatter might go i did call lisa you did what did she say said you guys got a divorce years ago that sounds just like her he was staring at his feet glassyeyed unable or unwilling to make eye contact she said she still loves you though david said just for the fun of it wally started crying the way drunks do when they cry over nothing and everything david felt a little lousy but a lot more amused im sorry wally said wiping his face with a forearm im so sorry david thank you oscar wont talk to me you know laid up in my apartment hiding from his wife cleaning out my refrigerator i came home had the door locked and chained we had a big fight neighbors called the police i barely got away running away from my own apartment now what kinda deal is that when did this happen i dont know an hour ago maybe not real sharp on times and days right now for some reason thank you david youre welcome look wally we need to put together a plan sounds like your apartment is offlimits if you want to sleep here tonight and sober up ill pull up a chair and keep you company ac and i will get you through this i need help david aint just a matter of sobering up okay but getting sober will be an important first step wally suddenly burst into laughter he threw his head back and laughed as loud as humanly possible he shook squealed gyrated coughed lost his breath wiped his cheeks and when he couldnt laugh anymore he sat and chuckled for several minutes when things were under control he glanced at david and laughed again got something youd like to share wally working hard to suppress more laughter he said i just thought of the first time you came here remember i remember some of it ive never seen anybody drunker all day in a bar right yep fallingdown drunk then you took a swing at that prickhead gholston across the street almost hit him too thats what ive heard i looked at oscar he looked at me we said this guy has potential a pause as he drifted away for a moment you threw up twice now whos drunk and whos sober were gonna get you sober wally his body was no longer shaking and he was silent for a long time do you ever wonder what you got yourself into here david you had it all big firm big salary life in the lawyers fast lane i have no regrets wally david said for the most part it was a true statement another long pause and wally cradled his coffee cup with both hands and stared into it whats gonna happen to me david im fortysix years old broker than ever humiliated a drunk who cant stay away from the sauce a washedup street lawyer who thought he could play in the big leagues now is not the time to ponder the future wally what you need is a good detox get all the alcohol out of your system then you can make decisions i dont want to be like oscar hes seventeen years older than me and in seventeen years i dont want to be here doing the same shit we do every day you know david thank you youre welcome do you wanna be here in seventeen years i really havent thought about it im just trying to get through this trial what trial he didnt appear to be joking or pretending so david let it pass you went through rehab a year ago didnt you wally he grimaced as he struggled to remember his last rehab whats today today is wednesday october wally began nodding yes october of last year in for thirty days a great time where was the rehab oh harbor house just north of waukegan my favorite its right on the lake beautiful i guess we should call patrick he was reaching for his wallet and whos patrick my counselor wally said handing over a business card harbor housewhere a new life begins patrick hale team leader you can call patrick any time of the day its part of his job david left a message on patricks voice mail said he was a friend of wally figgs and it was important that they speak soon moments later davids cell vibrated it was patrick truly sorry to hear the bad news about wally but ready to help immediately dont let him out of your sight patrick said please bring him in now ill meet you at the house in an hour lets go big boy david said grabbing wally by the arm he stood found his balance and they walked arm in arm out of the building to davids suv by the time they accelerated onto i north wally was snoring again w ith the help of his gps david found harbor house an hour after they left the office it was a small private treatment facility tucked away in the woods just north of waukegan illinois david was unable to rouse wally so he left him and went inside where patrick hale was waiting in the reception room patrick sent two whiterobed orderlies with a stretcher out to fetch wally and five minutes later they wheeled him in still unconscious david followed patrick to a small office where paperwork was waiting how many times has he been here david asked in an effort to make conversation he seems to know the place well im afraid thats confidential at least on our end his warm smile had vanished when he closed the office door sorry patrick was looking at some papers on a clipboard we have a slight problem with wallys account mr zinc and im not sure what to do about it you see when wally checked out a year ago his insurance would pay only a day for his treatment here because of our exceptional treatment and results and facilities and staff we charge a day wally left here owing slightly less than hes made a few payments but his balance is still at i am not responsible for his medical bills or his treatment for alcoholism i have nothing to do with his insurance well then we will not be able to keep him you cant make money charging a day lets not get into that mr zinc we charge what we charge we have sixty beds and none are empty wallys fortysix years old why does he need someone to cosign normally he wouldnt but hes not good at paying his bills and that was before krayoxx david thought to himself you should see his balance sheet now how long do you plan to keep him this time david asked his insurance will cover thirty days so its thirty days regardless of how much progress is made with your patient its all driven by the insurance company right thats the reality of it that sucks what if a patient needs more time i have a friend from high school who crashed and burned on cocaine did the thirtyday gig a few times never stuck it finally took a hard year in a lockeddown facility to get him clean and committed we can all tell stories mr zinc im sure you can david threw up his hands okay mr hale whats the deal you and i both know hes not leaving here tonight because hell hurt himself we can forgive the pastdue account but we will require someone to cosign for the uninsured portion going forward and thats a day not a penny more correct david yanked out his wallet removed a credit card and tossed it on the desk heres my american express im good for ten days max ill come get him in ten days and then ill think of something else to do patrick quickly scribbled down the credit card info and handed back the card he needs more than ten days of course he does hes proven that thirty is not enough most alcoholics require three or four efforts if they are in fact ultimately successful ten days mr hale i dont have much money and practicing law with wally is proving to be less than profitable i dont know what you do here but do it faster ill be back in ten days a s he approached the intersection of the tristate tollway a dashboard warning light flashed red he was almost out of gas for the past three days he had never once checked his fuel gauge the truck stop was crowded grungy in need of a renovation there was a diner on one side and a convenience store on the other david filled his tank paid by credit card and went inside to buy a soft drink there was only one cashier and a line of waiting customers so he took his time found a diet coke and a bag of peanuts and was headed to the front of the store when he stopped dead cold the rack was crammed with cheap halloween toys gadgets and trinkets in the middle at eye level was a clear plastic container with brightly colored nasty teeth he grabbed it and went straight for the fine print on the label made in china imported by gunderson toys louisville kentucky he collected all four packets evidence of course but he also wanted to yank the crap off the market before another kid got sick the cashier gave him a weird look as she rang up his purchases he paid in cash and hustled back to his suv he pulled away from the pumps and parked under a bright overhanging light near the wheelers using his iphone he googled gunderson toys the company was forty years old and had once been privately owned four years earlier it had been purchased by sonesta games inc the thirdlargest toy company in america he had a file on sonesta chapter r euben massey arrived after dark on a varrick gulfstream g he landed at midway airport and was immediately scooped up by an entourage that sped away in black cadillac escalades thirty minutes later he entered the trust tower and was whisked high into the sky to the st floor where rogan rothberg kept an elegant private dining room that was used by only the most senior partners and their most important clients nicholas walker and judy beck were waiting along with nadine karros and marvin macklow the managing partner of the law firm a waiter wearing a white tux brought cocktails as everyone was properly introduced and became comfortable with each other reuben had been wanting to meet and examine nadine karros for many months he was not disappointed she turned on the charm and after the first cocktail reuben was thoroughly smitten he ran the ladies hard and was always on the prowl and well you never know what might happen with a new acquaintance however according to the scouting report she was happily married and her only diversion was working in the ten months nick walker had known nadine he had seen nothing less than a complete devotion to professionalism its not going to work he said to his boss back at the home office per reubens preference dinner was a lobster salad with pasta shells he sat next to nadine and hung on her every word he went heavy on the praise for her handling of the case and the trial he along with everyone around the table was anxiously awaiting a momentous verdict were here to have a conversation nick said after the dessert plates were removed and the door closed but first i would like nadine to tell us whats up next in the courtroom without hesitation she began her summary we are presuming the plaintiff has no more witnesses if the pharmacologist were to appear in the morning he would be allowed to testify but according to our sources dr threadgill is still hiding at home in cincinnati so the plaintiff should rest its case at am at that point we have a choice first and obvious is to move for summary judgment judge seawright allows this to be done both orally and in writing well do both at the same time if we choose to go that route in my opinion which is shared by my trial team there is an excellent chance judge seawright will grant our motion immediately the plaintiff has failed to establish even the most basic elements of a case and everyone including the plaintiffs lawyer knows this judge seawright has never liked this case and frankly i get the impression he cant wait to toss it whats his history with summary judgment motions made after the plaintiff rests reuben asked in the past twenty years hes granted more than any other federal judge in chicago and the state of illinois he has zero patience with cases that cannot reach even the lowest standard of proof but i want a verdict reuben said then we will forget summary judgment and start putting on witnesses we have a lot youve paid for them and they will be unimpeachable but i have a strong feeling that this jury is fed up absolutely said nick walker who had been in the courtroom for every word i suspect theyve already started their deliberations in spite of judge seawrights admonitions judy beck added our consultants feel strongly that we should finish the case as soon as possible definitely before the weekend the verdict is all but in reuben smiled at nadine and said so counselor whats your advice for me a win is a win summary judgment is a slam dunk if it goes to the jury theres always the risk of a freak accident i would take the easy way out but then i understand theres more in play here than a ruling by a judge how many cases do you try each year six is the average i cant prepare for more than that regardless of staff and you havent lost in how many years eleven sixtyfour wins in a row but whos counting this tired line drew laughs far louder than it deserved but everyone needed the humor have you ever felt this confident about a trial and a jury reuben asked she took a sip of wine and thought for a moment then shook her head not that i remember if we go all the way to the verdict what are our chances of winning everyone watched her as she took another tiny sip a lawyer is not supposed to make these predictions mr massey but youre not a typical lawyer ms karros ninetyfive percent ninetynine nick walker said with a laugh reuben took a gulp of his third scotch smacked his lips and said i want a verdict i want the jury to deliberate briefly and walk back into that courtroom with a verdict for varrick laboratories to me a verdict is repudiation its revenge retribution its a lot more than victory ill take the verdict and splash it all over the world our pr people and ad agencies are ready and itching to go koane our man in washington assures me that a verdict will break the logjam at the fda and get a reversal our lawyers from coast to coast are convinced a verdict will even further frighten the tort boys and send them running for the hills i want a verdict nadine can you deliver it as i said reuben im percent sure then that settles it no summary judgment lets bury these bastards chapter at exactly on thursday morning a bailiff called the court to order and all rose for the entrance of his honor when the jury was in place he said abruptly continue mr zinc david rose and said your honor the plaintiff rests judge seawright was not at all surprised lost some more witnesses mr zinc no sir weve simply run out of them very well a motion ms karros no your honor we are ready to proceed i suspected that call your first witness david suspected it too he had allowed himself to believe that the trial would end abruptly that morning but it was obvious nadine and her client smelled blood from there on he would have little to do but listen and watch a real courtroom lawyer the defense calls dr jesse kindorf david glanced at the jurors and saw several smiles they were about to meet a celebrity jesse kindorf was a former surgeon general of the united states he held the position for six years and was brilliantly controversial he castigated tobacco companies on a daily basis he held large press conferences in which he exposed the fat and caloric content of popular fast foods he released scathing condemnations against some of the most trusted names in corporate america consumer product companies that were flatout guilty of producing and marketing mass quantities of highly processed foods at various times during his tenure he was on the warpath fighting butter cheese eggs red meat sugar soft drinks and alcohol but his most famous brouhaha occurred when he suggested a ban on coffee he thoroughly enjoyed the spotlight and with his good looks athletic build and quick wit he became the most famous surgeon general in history the fact that he had crossed the street and was now testifying on behalf of a major corporation was a clear signal to the jurors that he believed in the drug and he was a cardiologist from chicago he took the stand and flashed a smile at the jury his jury nadine began the arduous process of going through his credentials in order to have him qualified as an expert david quickly jumped to his feet and said your honor we are happy to stipulate that dr kindorf is an expert in the field of cardiology nadine turned smiled and said thank you judge seawright growled thank you mr zinc the gist of dr kindorfs testimony was that he had prescribed krayoxx to thousands of his patients over the past few years with no side effects whatsoever the drug worked beautifully for about percent of his patients the drug dramatically lowered cholesterol his ninetyoneyearold mother was on krayoxx or was until it was pulled by the fda the paralegal scribbled a note on her legal pad and handed it to her boss wonder how much theyre paying him david scribbled back as if they were discussing a major flaw in the testimony a lot nadine karros and dr kindorf worked their way through a flawless round of batting practice she served up the fat pitches he knocked them out of the park the jury wanted to cheer them on when judge seawright asked any crossexamination mr zinc david rose and politely said no your honor to curry favor with the blacks on the jury nadine called a dr thurston a dapper distinguished black gentleman with a gray beard and finely tailored suit dr thurston was also from chicago and was the senior physician in a group of thirtyfive cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons in his spare time he taught at the university of chicago school of medicine to move things along david did not question his credentials dr thurston and his group had prescribed krayoxx to tens of thousands of their patients over the past six years with spectacular results and no side effects the drug in his opinion was perfectly safe indeed he and his colleagues viewed it as a miracle drug its presence was sorely missed and yes he planned to immediately resume prescribing it when it reappeared on the market most dramatically dr thurston revealed to the jury that he had taken krayoxx himself for four years to get the attention of the hispanic lady on the jury the defense called dr roberta seccero cardiologist and researcher at mayo clinic in rochester minnesota david gave the green light on credentials and dr seccero to no ones surprise sang like a bird on a spring morning her patients were mostly women and the drug did everything but make them lose weight there was no statistical evidence that those taking krayoxx were likelier to suffer heart attacks or strokes than those who didnt take it she and her colleagues had researched this at length and there was no doubt in her twentyfive years as a cardiologist she had never seen a safer and more effective medication the rainbow was completed when ms karros called to the stand a young korean doctor from san francisco who oddly enough looked remarkably similar to juror number dr pang enthusiastically endorsed the drug and expressed dismay at its removal from the market he had given it to hundreds of patients with outstanding results david had no questions for dr pang either he was not about to bicker with any of these renowned doctors what was he supposed to doargue medicine with some of the best doctors in the business no sir he stayed in his chair and kept one eye on his watch which was moving rather slowly there was no doubt that had there been a juror of lithuanian descent nadine would have pulled another expert from her magic hat one with a lithuanian surname and immaculate credentials the fifth witness was the chief cardiologist at the feinberg school of medicine northwestern university her name was dr parkin and her testimony was a little different she had been hired to do a thorough analysis of percy klopecks medical history she had reviewed his records from the age of twelve and those of his siblings and parents to the extent they were available and she also had taken recorded statements from his friends and coworkers those willing to cooperate at the time of his death percy was taking prinzide and levatol for hypertension insulin for adultonset diabetes bexnin for arthritis plavix as a blood thinner colestid for atherosclerosis and krayoxx for high cholesterol his happy pill of choice was xanax which he either bummed off friends stole from iris or bought online and he used it daily to battle the stress of life with that woman according to one of his coworkers he occasionally used fedamin an overthecounter appetite suppressant that was supposed to make him eat less but seemed to backfire he had smoked for twenty years but managed to stop at the age of fortyone with the aid of nicotrex a nicotinelaced chewing gum that was known to be highly addictive he chewed it nonstop going through at least three packages a day according to blood work a year before he died percys liver was showing a decreasing level of function he loved gin and according to credit card records subpoenaed by ms karros purchased at least three fifths a week from bilbos spirits on stanton avenue five blocks from his home he often felt bad in the morning complained of headaches and kept at least two large bottles of ibuprofen close by on his cluttered work desk when dr parkin finished her lengthy narrative about percys habits and health it seemed patently unfair to blame his death on just one drug since there had been no autopsyiris had been too upset to even think about itthere was no positive indication that he died of a heart attack his death could have been caused by the allencompassing respiratory failure wally and oscar had discussed having the body exhumed to get a clearer picture of what killed him but iris flew into a rage plus the exhumation autopsy and reburial would have cost almost and oscar flatly refused to spend the money in dr parkins opinion percy klopeck had died young because he was genetically predisposed to an early death one made even more probable because of his lifestyle she also offered the opinion that it was impossible to predict the cumulative effect of the astonishing barrage of his medications poor percy thought david he lived a short uneventful life and died peacefully in his sleep with no clue whatsoever that his habits and ailments would one day be dissected so thoroughly by strangers in open court her testimony was devastating and there was not a single part of it that david wanted to revisit on crossexamination at judge seawright adjourned until pm david and helen hustled from the courthouse and enjoyed a nice long lunch david ordered a bottle of white wine and helen who rarely drank enjoyed a glass they toasted percy may he rest in peace i n davids novice opinion nadine and the defense stumbled slightly with the afternoons first witness he was dr litchfield a cardiologist and cardiovascular surgeon from the worldrenowned cleveland clinic where he saw patients taught and researched he had the tedious task of walking the jurors through percys last echocardiogram the same video that had knocked them out in the hands of igor borzov sensing that another viewing of that footage would not be well received nadine stepped on the gas and opted for a scaleddown version of the testimony bottom linethere was no reduced regurgitation of blood from the mitral valve the left ventricle was not enlarged if the patient did indeed die of a heart attack its cause could not be determined bottom lineborzov was a fool david had a quick vision of wally lying peacefully in a comfortable bed wearing a gown or pajamas or whatever harbor house distributed sober now tranquil due to a sedative maybe reading or just gazing at lake michigan his thoughts a million miles away from the carnage in courtroom yet it was all his fault in the months hed spent racing around chicago visiting lowend funeral parlors passing out brochures in gyms and fastfood joints he had never not once paused to study the physiology and pharmacology of krayoxx and its alleged damage to heart valves he had simply and eagerly assumed the drug was bad and egged on by smart guys like jerry alisandros and other tort stars had joined the parade and begun counting his money resting now in rehab was he even thinking about the trial about the case getting dumped on david while he and oscar were laid up licking their wounds no david decided wally was not worrying about the trial wally had bigger issuessobriety bankruptcy a job his firm the next witness was a professor and medical researcher from harvard who had studied krayoxx and written a definitive article in the new england journal of medicine david managed to get a slight chuckle when he did not question the professors resume he said your honor if he went to harvard im sure his credentials are outstanding he must be brilliant fortunately the jurors had not been informed that david was a graduate of the harvard school of law otherwise the wisecrack could have backfired harvard grads who talked about being harvard grads were not generally well regarded in chicago pretty stupid read the note from the paralegal david did not respond it was almost pm and he just wanted to leave the professor droned on about his research methods not a single juror was paying attention most appeared braindead thoroughly numbed by this futile exercise in civic responsibility if this is what made a democracy strong then god help us david wondered if they were already discussing the case each morning and each afternoon judge seawright gave the same lecture about improper contact the prohibition against reading about the case in the newspapers or online and the need to refrain from chatting about the case until all evidence had been presented there were plenty of studies on the behavior of juries the dynamics of group decision making and so on and most found that jurors couldnt wait to begin gossiping about the lawyers the witnesses even the judge they tended to pair off to buddy up to separate into cliques and camps and begin their considerations prematurely seldom though did they do so as an entire group more often they hid their little private sessions from each other david tuned out his fellow harvard alum and flipped a few pages of his legal pad he resumed work on a rough draft of his letter dear soandso i represent the family of thuya khaing the fiveyearold son of two burmese immigrants who are in this country legally from november until may of this year thuya was a patient in the lakeshore childrens hospital here in chicago he had ingested a nearlethal amount of lead and on several occasions was kept alive by a respirator according to his doctors and i have included with this letter a summary of their statements thuya now suffers brain damage that is permanent and severe he is not expected to live but a few more years however there is a chance he could survive up to twenty years the source of the lead swallowed by thuya is a toy made in china and imported by your division gunderson toys it is a halloween novelty called nasty teeth according to dr biff sandroni a toxicologist youve probably heard of the fake teeth and fangs are coated with various colors of bright paint and loaded with lead i have attached a copy of dr sandronis report for your reading pleasure i have also enclosed a copy of a lawsuit i will soon file against sonesta games in federal court here in chicago in the very near future if you would like to discuss crossexamination mr zinc judge seawright interrupted again david stood quickly and said no your honor very well it is now we will adjourn until nine in the morning with the same instructions to the jury w ally was in a wheelchair dressed in a white cotton bathrobe with cheap canvas slippers barely covering his chubby feet an orderly rolled him into the visiting room where david was waiting standing at a large window staring into the darkness of lake michigan the orderly left and they were alone why are you in a wheelchair david asked as he dropped onto a leather sofa im sedated wally replied slowly and softly theyll give me some pills for a couple of days to uh sorta soothe things along if i try to walk i might fall crack my skull or something twentyfour hours off a threeday binge and he still looked rough his eyes were red and puffy his face sad and defeated he needed a haircut are you curious about the trial wally hesitation as this was processed then ive thought about it yes youve thought about it thats awfully nice of you we should finish tomorrow we being me on our side of the room with no one but my lovely wife whos pretending to be a paralegal and is already tired of watching her husband get his ass kicked and what seems like an evergrowing mob of dark suits on the other side all hovering around the lovely nadine karros who believe me wally is even better than advertised the judge wouldnt continue the case why should he wally continue to when and why what exactly would we have done with another say thirty or sixty days go out and hire a real trial lawyer to try the case lets hear that conversation thats it sir well promise you and half of our cut to walk into that courtroom with a lousy set of facts an unsympathetic client a judge whos even more unsympathetic against an extremely talented defense team with unlimited cash and talent representing a large and powerful corporate defendant who would you pitch that to wally you seem angry david no wally its not anger its just the need to rant to bitch to blow off some steam then go right ahead i asked for a continuance and i think seawright would have considered it but why no one could say when you might be able to come back oscar probably never we agreed to go forward and get it over with im sorry david so am i i feel like such a fool sitting there with no case no clue no weapons nothing to fight with its so frustrating wally lowered his chin to his chest as if he might start sobbing instead he began mumbling im sorry so sorry okay look wally im sorry too i didnt come here to beat you up okay i came to check on you im worried about you so are rochelle and oscar youre sick and we want to help when wally looked up his eyes were wet and as he spoke his lip quivered i cant keep doing this david i thought i had it whipped i swear i did one year two weeks two days then something happened we were in court monday morning i was nervous as hell terrified really and i was overcome with this vicious desire for a drink i remember thinking you know a couple of drinks will do the trick two quick beers and ill settle down alcohol is such a liar such a monster as soon as we broke for lunch i scooted out of the building and found a little cafe with a beer sign in the window i got a table ordered a sandwich drank three beers and wow it tasted so good and felt even better back in the courtroom i remember thinking you know i can do this i can drink and its no problem i got it whipped you know no problem now look at me back in rehab and scared shitless wheres your car wally he thought about it for a long time and finally gave up i have no idea i blacked out so many times dont worry about it ill find the car wally wiped his cheeks with the back of his hand then wiped his nose with a sleeve im sorry david i thought we had a chance we never had a chance wally theres nothing wrong with the drug we joined a stampede that was going nowhere and we didnt realize it until it was too late but the trials not over is it the trials over but the lawyers are still at it the jury gets the final word tomorrow nothing was said for several minutes wallys eyes cleared but he had trouble looking at david finally he said softly thanks for coming david thanks for taking care of me and oscar and rochelle i hope you wont be leaving us lets not talk about that now you get good and detoxed ill check you out next week then well have another firm meeting and make some decisions id like that another firm meeting chapter emma had a rough night and both parents walked the floor in alternating onehour shifts when helen handed her off at and headed back to bed she announced her career as a paralegal was mercifully over she had enjoyed the lunches but little else and besides she had a sick baby to deal with david managed to quiet emma with a bottle and as he fed her went online varricks stock had closed at a share thursday afternoon its steady rise throughout the week was even more evidence that the klopeck trial was going badly for the plaintiff though no additional evidence was really needed out of his usual morbid curiosity david checked in with the hung juror who wrote in what has to be the most lopsided trial in the history of us jurisprudence things continue to go from bad to worse for the estate of the late and now much maligned percy klopeck as varrick labs defense team continues to steamroll over the hapless and grossly incompetent lawyer for klopeck one almost feels sorry for the underdog almost but not quite the question that screams to be answered is how did this dog of a case manage to get into court stay in court and stumble its way to the jury talk about an obscene waste of time money and talent talent that is for the defense talent is sorely lacking on the other side of the courtroom where the clueless david zinc has adopted the unique strategy of simply trying to become invisible he has yet to crossexamine a witness he has yet to make an objection he has yet to make a single move to help his case he just sits there for hours pretending to take notes swapping little messages with his new paralegal a hot thing in a short skirt brought in to show some leg and try to divert attention from the fact that the plaintiff has no case and the lawyer is incompetent unknown to the jury the new paralegal is actually helen zinc wife of the idiot sitting in front of her this bimbo is not a paralegal and has no training or experience in the courtroom so she fits in nicely with the clowns from finley amp figg her presence is obviously a clever ploy to catch the eye of the male jurors and counterbalance the overwhelming presence of nadine karros who is perhaps the most effective courtroom advocate this hung juror has ever watched lets hope this dog is put to sleep today and maybe judge seawright has the guts to grant sanctions for such a frivolous case david flinched so hard he squeezed emma who momentarily stopped working the bottle he closed his laptop and cursed himself for looking at the blog never again he vowed not for the first time w ith the verdict solidly in hand nadine karros decided to push a bit harder her first witness friday morning was dr mark ulander varricks senior vice president and director of research working from a script they quickly laid the groundwork ulander had three graduate degrees and had spent the past twentytwo years supervising varricks vast development of myriad drugs krayoxx was his proudest achievement the company had spent over billion bringing it to market his team of thirty scientists had labored for eight years to perfect the drug to make certain it worked to lower cholesterol to take no chances with its safety and to gain fda approval he detailed the rigid testing procedures used and not just for krayoxx but for all varricks fine products the companys reputation was on the line with every drug it developed and the varrick reputation for excellence pervaded every aspect of his research with nadines skillful direction dr ulander painted an impressive picture of a diligent effort to produce the perfect drug krayoxx with nothing to lose david decided to roll the dice and join the action he began his crossexamination with dr ulander lets talk about all of those clinical trials you just mentioned the fact that david was at the podium seemed to catch the jurors off guard though it was only they were ready to deliberate and go home where did the clinical trials take place david asked for krayoxx no for baby aspirin of course for krayoxx sorry of course lets see well the clinical trials were extensive as i said got that dr ulander the question is rather simple where were the clinical trials yes well the initial trials were done with a test group of highcholesterol subjects in nicaragua and mongolia keep going where else kenya and cambodia did varrick spend billion developing krayoxx to reap dividends in mongolia and kenya i cant answer that mr zinc im not involved in marketing fair enough how many clinical trials were conducted here in the united states none how many varrick drugs are in clinical trials as of today nadine karros rose and said objection your honor on the grounds of irrelevance other drugs are not at issue here judge seawright paused and scratched his chin overruled lets see where this is going david wasnt sure where it was going but he had just won a tiny victory over ms karros emboldened he pressed on you may answer the question dr ulander how many varrick drugs are in clinical trials today approximately twenty i could name them all if given a moment or two twenty sounds good lets save some time how much money will varrick spend this year on clinical trials for all of its drugs in development roughly billion last year what percentage of varricks gross sales came from foreign markets dr ulander shrugged and looked perplexed well id have to check the financial statements youre a vice president of the company arent you and you have been for the past sixteen years right thats true david picked up a thin binder flipped a page and said this is last years financial report and it plainly states that percent of varricks gross sales were in the us market have you seen this of course ms karros stood and said objection your honor my clients financial records are not at issue here overruled your clients financial records are a matter of public record another tiny victory and for the second time david got a taste of courtroom excitement does percent sound right dr ulander if you say so im not saying so sir its right here in the published report okay so its percent thank you of the twenty drugs youre testing today how many of their clinical trials are being conducted in the united states the witness gritted his teeth clenched his jaw and said none none david repeated dramatically and looked at the jury several of the faces were engaged he paused a few seconds then continued so varrick derives percent of its income in this country yet it tests its drugs in such places as nicaragua cambodia and mongolia why is that dr ulander its very simple mr zinc the regulatory environment in this country stifles the research and development of new drugs devices and procedures thats great so youre blaming the government for your routine practice of testing drugs on people in faraway places ms karros was back on her feet objection your honor thats mischaracterization of what the witness said overruled the jury heard what the witness said continue mr zinc thank you your honor you may answer the question dr ulander im sorry what was the question is it your testimony that the reason your company runs its clinical trials in other countries is that there is too much regulation in this country yes thats the reason isnt it true that varrick tests its drugs in developing countries because it can avoid the threat of litigation if things go badly not at all isnt it true that varrick tests its drugs in developing countries because there is virtually no regulation no thats not true isnt it true that varrick tests its drugs in developing countries because its much easier to find human guinea pigs who need a few bucks there was a scramble over davids left shoulder as the defense horde reacted ms karros sprang to her feet and said firmly objection your honor judge seawright who was leaning forward on his elbows calmly said state your objection for the first time all week nadine struggled for words well first i object to this line of questioning on the grounds of irrelevance what my client does with other drugs is not relevant to this case ive already overruled that objection ms karros and so i object to counsels use of the term human guinea pigs the term was clearly objectionable but it was also commonly used and seemed to fit the situation judge seawright thought about it for a while as everyone stared at him david glanced at the jury and saw some amused faces overruled continue mr zinc were you supervising all of varricks research in dr ulander replied yes as ive said that has been my role for the past twentytwo years thank you now in did varrick run clinical trials for a drug called amoxitrol ulander shot a look of panic at the defense table where several of the varrick lawyers were sporting their own looks of panic ms karros jumped up again and forcefully announced objection your honor that drug is not in question here its history is totally irrelevant mr zinc your honor that drug has an ugly history and i dont blame varrick for trying to keep it quiet why should we talk about other drugs mr zinc well judge it seems to me as if this witness has placed the companys reputation into issue he testified for sixtyfour minutes and spent most of his time trying to convince the jury that his company places great importance on safe testing procedures why cant i explore this it seems quite relevant to me and i think the jury would find it interesting to which nadine quickly replied your honor this trial is about a drug called krayoxx nothing more anything else is a fishing expedition but as mr zinc correctly pointed out you placed the companys reputation into issue ms karros you werent required to do this but that door is now open objection overruled continue mr zinc the door was indeed open and varricks history was fair game david wasnt certain how it had happened but he was thrilled nonetheless his selfdoubt was gone the gnawing fear had disappeared he was on his feet all alone against the big boys and he was scoring points it was showtime i asked about amoxitrol dr ulander surely you remember it i do with a bit of flair david waved his arm at the jury and said well tell the jury about that drug what was it intended to do ulander sank a few inches in the witness chair and again looked at the defense table for help grudgingly he began talking but in very short sentences amoxitrol was developed as an abortion pill to help him along david asked an abortion pill that could be taken up to one month after conception sort of an expanded version of the morningafter pill right doctor something like that was that a yes or a no yes the pill would basically dissolve the fetus and its remains would eventually be flushed out with other bodily waste is that correct doctor in a simplified form yes that is what the drug was supposed to do with at least seven catholics on the jury david didnt have to glance over to see how this was being received did you conduct clinical trials for amoxitrol we did and where did these trials take place africa where in africa ulander rolled his eyes and grimaced i cant uh you know i would have to check that david walked slowly to his table riffled through some papers and extracted a binder he opened it flipped pages as he walked back to the podium and asked as though he were reading from the report in what three african countries did varrick conduct clinical trials for its abortion pill amoxitrol uganda for sure i just cant do uganda botswana and somalia sound right david asked yes how many african women were used in the study do you have the answer there mr zinc does the number four hundred sound right doctor it does and how much money did varrick pay to each pregnant african woman to abort her pregnancy with one of your pills do you have the answer there mr zinc does per fetus sound right dr ulander i guess dont guess doctor i have the report right here david flipped a page took his time let the pathetic amount of the bounty rattle around the courtroom nadine karros rose again and said your honor i object the report mr zinc is using is not in evidence i have not seen it david snapped oh im sure shes seen it your honor im sure all the big shots at varrick have seen it what report are you using there mr zinc the judge asked its an investigation done by the world health organization in their scientists tracked the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies and the way they use human guinea pigs in poor countries to test drugs they hope to market in rich countries the judge held up both hands and said thats enough you cant use the report if its not in evidence im not offering it as evidence your honor im using it to impeach this witness and question the fine reputation of this wonderful company by now david felt no restraint in choosing his words what was there to lose judge seawright frowned and scratched his chin some more obviously uncertain ms karros he said hes picking facts from a report thats not in evidence a report the jury will not see unless he can somehow get it admitted into evidence she said still composed but clearly agitated heres what we are going to do mr zinc you can use the report for impeachment purposes only but the information must be conveyed in a manner that is exact straightforward and not the least bit slanted to suit your purposes understand sure judge would you like a copy of the report that would be helpful david walked to his table picked up two more binders and as he sort of strutted around the courtroom he said i have an extra copy for varrick though im sure theyve already seen it probably buried in a vault thats enough of the extraneous comments mr zinc his honor barked david said sorry he handed a copy to the judge and then tossed one on the table in front of nadine karros back at the podium he looked at his notes then glared at dr ulander now doctor back to amoxitrol when varrick was testing the drug was your company concerned with the ages of these young pregnant african women for a few seconds ulander was unable to speak he finally mumbled im sure we were great so how young was too young dr ulander what were varricks guidelines on age the subjects were required to be at least eighteen years old have you ever seen this report doctor ulander again looked desperately at nadine karros who along with the rest of her squad was cowering and making eye contact with no one finally he uttered an unconvincing no juror number a fiftyoneyearold black male made a hissing sound that was meant to be heard and vaguely sounded like the word shit isnt it true doctor that pregnant girls as young as fourteen were given amoxitrol to abort their fetuses page judge last paragraph second column ulander did not respond r euben massey was sitting next to judy beck in the first row defense side as a seasoned veteran of the tort wars he knew it was crucial to maintain a veneer of complete calm and confidence but his heart pounded with anger and he wanted to leap forward and grab nadine karros by the neck how was this happening how had this door been not only cracked but kicked wide open varrick could have easily won on summary judgment and he would be back at his desk safely ensconced at corporate hq relishing the victory and pulling strings to get krayoxx back on the market instead he was watching his cherished company get thrashed by an absolute novice t he novice pressed on now dr ulander did amoxitrol ever make it to the market no had some problems with it didnt you yes what were some of the side effects nausea dizziness headaches fainting but this is common with most emergency contraceptives you failed to mention abdominal bleeding didnt you dr ulander just an oversight im sure there was abdominal bleeding thats why we stopped the testing you stopped it rather quickly didnt you doctor in fact the trials were terminated about ninety days after they began right doctor yes david paused for drama the next question was the most brutal the courtroom was silent now dr ulander from varricks sample of four hundred pregnant women how many died from abdominal bleeding the witness slowly removed his glasses and placed them in his lap he rubbed his eyes glanced at reuben massey then gritted his teeth looked at the jurors and said we were made aware of eleven deaths david hung his head for a moment then took a load of paperwork to his table and swapped it for another stack of papers he had no idea how far he could go at this point but he was not quitting until instructed to do so he returned to the podium arranged things and said now doctor lets talk about some of varricks other drugs that did make it into the marketplace ms karros stood and said same objection your honor same ruling ms karros in that case your honor could we please have a brief recess it was almost am past judge seawrights usual break time of he looked at david and said how much longer mr zinc david held up his legal pad and said gosh judge i dont know i have a long list of bad drugs lets meet in chambers and talk about it fifteenminute recess chapter with three blacks on the jury david made the tactical decision to spend more time in africa with dr ulander during the recess judge seawright decided to allow david to explore the backgrounds of only three additional drugs i want the jury to get this case this afternoon he said ms karros was still objecting hotly at times and the judge was still overruling her objections the jurors were brought in and took their seats dr ulander returned to the witness stand david addressed him now dr ulander do you remember a drug called klervex i do was it made and marketed by your company it was when was it approved by the fda lets see early in i believe is it now on the market it is not when was it taken off the market two years later in june i believe did your company voluntarily recall the drug or was its removal mandated by the fda fda and at the time of its recall your company was facing several thousand lawsuits because of klervex correct correct in laymans terms what kind of drug was this it was for hypertension for patients who suffered from elevated blood pressure were there any unpleasant side effects according to the mass tort lawyers there were well what about the fda it didnt yank the drug because the mass tort lawyers were upset did it david was holding another report and he waved it slightly as he spoke i guess not i didnt ask you to guess doctor youve seen this fda report klervex caused severe even blinding migraine headaches in thousands of patients did it not according to the fda yes do you dispute the fdas findings i do and you supervised the clinical trials of klervex my staff and i supervise the testing of all pharmaceuticals made by our company i thought we had already established that my deepest apologies how many separate clinical trials were conducted during the testing of klervex at least six and where did these take place the beating would not end until the crossexamination was over so ulander plunged ahead four in africa one in romania one in paraguay in africa how many subjects were treated with klervex there were roughly one thousand patients in each trial do you remember what country or countries not precisely cameroon kenya and perhaps nigeria i cant recall the fourth were these four trials conducted simultaneously generally speaking yes over a twelvemonth period in and isnt it true doctor that you and i mean you personally knew almost immediately that there were significant problems with the drug what do you mean by almost immediately david walked to his pile picked up a document and addressed the court your honor i would like to admit into evidence this internal memo sent to dr mark ulander from a certain varrick technician by the name of darlene ainsworth dated may let me see it the judge said nadine stood and said your honor we object on the grounds of relevance and lack of a proper predicate being laid judge seawright scanned the twopage memo he looked at dr ulander and said did you receive this doctor i did david jumped in to help your honor this memo was leaked by a varrick whistleblower to the plaintiffs lawyers in the klervex litigation two years ago its authenticity was established at that time dr ulander knows it well thats enough mr zinc it will be admitted mr zinc plowed on the memo is dated may correct dr ulander correct so some two months after varrick began its clinical trials in africa this memo comes across your desk look at the second page last paragraph would you please read that to the jury dr ulander the witness obviously didnt want to read anything but he adjusted his glasses and began patients have been taking klervex for six weeks forty milligrams twice daily seventytwo percent show decreased blood pressure systolic and diastolic side effects are worrisome patients complain of dizziness nausea vomiting and many approximately percent suffer severe headaches so debilitating it is necessary to stop the drug after comparing notes with other med techs here in nairobi i strongly suggest that all trials be suspended for klervex now dr ulander were the trials suspended no they were not were there similar reports from the field ulander sighed and looked at the defense table helpless i have copies of the other reports dr ulander if they might refresh your memory david offered helpfully yes there were other reports ulander said and this technician darlene ainsworth is she still employed by varrick i dont think so is that a yes or a no doctor no she is not employed isnt it true dr ulander that she was terminated one month after sending you this memo about the horrors of klervex she wasnt terminated by me but she was terminated by varrick wasnt she well im not sure how she left the company she may have resigned david again walked to his table and picked up a thick document he looked at judge seawright and said judge this is dr ulanders deposition from the klervex litigation two years ago may i use it to refresh his memory just answer the question the judge snapped angrily at the witness was this employee terminated by varrick one month after she sent you that memo startled by the rebuke from his honor dr ulanders memory was instantly refreshed and he said yes she was thank you the judge said david looked at the jury as he spoke so in spite of these warnings from the field varrick pushed on and gained fda approval in right dr ulander the drug was approved in and once it was approved varrick aggressively marketed the drug in this country right dr ulander i have nothing to do with marketing but you are on the board right right then all hell broke loose complaining of severe migraines and other side effects at least eight thousand varrick consumers filed lawsuits in right doctor i dont have access to those numbers well lets not nitpick here doctor ill try to wrap this up a bit quicker has your company gone to trial anywhere in this country to defend its drug klervex once and varrick has settled over twentyfive thousand lawsuits for the drug as of last week right doctor nadine was back objection your honor settlements in other cases are not relevant to this one i think mr zinc has stepped over the line ill decide that ms karros but your objection is sustained mr zinc no talk of other settlements thank you your honor now dr ulander do you recall a varrick drug called ruval ulander sighed again and began to study his feet david walked to his table to reshuffle his files and fetch another stack of memos extracted from varricks dirty laundry in short order he established that ruval was supposed to alleviate migraine headaches but it also dramatically increased blood pressure it had been tested on migraine sufferers in africa and india varrick knew of its side effects but tried to bury this information damaging internal company memos were discovered by trial lawyers in the ensuing litigation the fda had eventually recalled the drug varrick was still defending various class actions and not a single case had gone to trial at pm david made the decision to quit he had grilled dr ulander unmercifully for almost three hours with no counterpunch from ms karros and he had scored enough points the jury at first amused by the dirt on varrick now seemed ready to eat lunch deliberate and go home a quick lunch the judge said back here at pm d avid found an empty corner of the cafe on the second floor of the building and was eating a sandwich and looking over his notes when he felt someone approach from behind it was taylor barkley a rogan associate one of the few david had met and occasionally nodded to across the courtroom got a second he said as he slid into a chair sure nice cross nadine makes few mistakes but that was a big one thanks david said chewing barkleys eyes darted around as if they were swapping crucial secrets have you come across a blogger who calls himself the hung juror david nodded and barkley continued our tech guys are very good and theyve tracked him down hes in the courtroom three rows behind you navy sweater white shirt thirty years old balding glasses pretty nerdy looking names aaron deentz used to work for a midrange firm downtown but got whacked in the recession now he blogs and tries to be important cant seem to find a job why are you telling me this he has the right to blog the courtroom is open to the public most of his stuff is harmless but he took a shot at your wife me id deck him just thought youd want to know see you around and with that barkley eased away and was gone a t pm nadine karros stood and announced your honor the defense rests this had been discussed in chambers and was no surprise judge seawright wasted no time and said mr zinc you may address the jury in closing statement david had no desire to address the jury and ask for compassion for his client iris klopeck but it would be extremely awkward for a lawyer who had tried a case from beginning to end to waive final argument he stood at the podium and began by thanking the jurors for their service then he confessed that this was his first trial and frankly he had not planned on doing anything but research however events had conspired to thrust him into this arena and he felt bad for not doing a better job he held up a document and explained that it was the pretrial order sort of an outline for the trial that both sides agree on long before the jury is selected of interest on page was a list of the experts for the defense twentyseven all with the word doctor attached somewhere to their names thankfully the defense did not call all twentyseven but they certainly hired and paid them why would any defendant need so many wellpaid experts perhaps the defendant had something to hide and why would the defendant need so many lawyers david asked waving an arm at the rogan rothberg team his client iris klopeck could not afford such talent the field was not level the game was rigged only the jury could equalize things he spoke less than ten minutes and happily left the podium as he walked back to the table he glanced at the spectators and made eye contact with aaron deentz the hung juror david stared at him for a few seconds then deentz looked away nadine karros argued for thirty minutes and managed to shift the attention back to krayoxx and away from those other unpleasant tests mr zinc had talked about she vigorously defended varrick and reminded the jurors of the many wellknown and trusted drugs the company had given to the world including krayoxx a drug that had survived the week nicely since the plaintiff had failed miserably to prove there was anything wrong with it yes she and varrick may have twentyseven noted experts in their lineup but that was beside the point much more important was the expert proof offered by the plaintiff who filed the lawsuit and had the burden of building a case and had thoroughly failed to do so david watched her performance with great admiration she was smooth and skilled and her trial experience was obvious from the way she moved around spoke chose her words effortlessly looked at the jurors smiled at them and trusted them from their faces there was little doubt they trusted her too david waived his rebuttal argument judge seawright went straight to the reading of the jury instructions the most tedious segment of any trial at the jury was led from the courtroom to begin its deliberations david wanted to get away so he carried a large box of his documents to his suv in the garage as he was riding the elevator back up to the twentythird floor his cell phone vibrated the text message said the jury is ready he smiled and whispered that didnt take long when the courtroom was quiet a bailiff brought in the jury the foreman handed the written verdict to the clerk who gave it to judge seawright who said the verdict appears to be in order it was returned to the foreman who stood and read we the jury find for the defendant varrick laboratories there was no reaction from anyone in the courtroom judge seawright went through his postverdict rituals and released the jurors david had no desire to hang around and suffer through the happy horseshit of nice job tough set of facts better luck next time as soon as the judge tapped his gavel and adjourned court david lifted his heavy briefcase and dashed from the room he beat the crowd and was hustling down the hall when he caught a glimpse of a familiar blue sweater entering a restroom david followed and once inside he scanned the room and saw no one but aaron deentz david washed his hands waited and when deentz finished at the urinal he turned and saw david youre the hung juror right david said and deentz froze unmasked so what deentz said with a sneer david cocked his arm and shot a right cross that landed perfectly on the fleshy left jaw of the hung juror who was too stunned to react he grunted as his jaw popped david followed with a quick left hook that landed on the nose thats for the bimbo you ass david said as deentz fell to the floor david left the restroom and saw a crowd at the far end of the hall he found the stairs and sprinted down to the main lobby he dashed across the street to the garage and was safely locked in his suv before he took a deep breath and said you idiot a fter a circuitous route back to the office david arrived late on friday afternoon to his surprise oscar was sitting at the table having a soft drink with rochelle he looked thin and pale but he had a smile and said he was feeling okay his doctor had cleared him to spend no more than two hours a day at the office and he claimed he was eager to get back to work david gave a highly condensed version of the trial he mimicked the russian accent of dr borzov and this drew laughter all jokes were on finley amp figg after all so why not laugh at themselves when he described his frantic efforts to find dr threadgill they laughed some more they could not believe that helen had been drafted into service when he described the faces of the jurors during iriss video rochelle wiped her eyes with a tissue and in spite of my brilliant performance the jury reached its verdict in only seventeen minutes when the humor was gone they talked about wally their fallen comrade they talked about the bills the line of credit their bleak future oscar suggested they forget about it until monday morning well figure out something he said david and rochelle were startled at how thoughtful and kind he had become perhaps the heart attack and surgery had softened him up and provided a glimpse of his own mortality the old oscar would have been cussing figg and griping about the firms imminent financial ruin but the new one seemed oddly optimistic about their situation after an hour of the most pleasant conversation david had experienced around the office he said he needed to go his paralegal was waiting with dinner and wanted to know about the trial chapter over the weekend david puttered around the house ran errands for helen pushed emma through the neighborhood in her stroller washed and shined both vehicles and kept an eye on the online buzz about the trial and varricks great victory there had been a small story in saturdays suntimes and not a word in the tribune the online publications though were busy with the aftershocks varricks public relations machinery was in full swing and the verdict was being described as a major vindication of krayoxx ceo reuben massey was quoted everywhere touting the drug condemning the mass tort bar promising to crush those ambulance chasers in any courtroom they dared to enter praising the wisdom of the chicago jurors and clamoring for more laws to protect innocent corporations from such frivolous lawsuits jerry alisandros was unavailable for comment indeed there were no comments from any of the lawyers suing varrick labs for the first time in recent history the entire tort bar has gone silent observed one reporter the call came at on sunday afternoon dr biff sandroni had received the samples of nasty teeth by fedex on friday morning about the time david was grilling dr ulander on the stand dr sandroni had promised to test the samples immediately theyre all the same david all coated with the same leadbased paint highly toxic your lawsuit is a cinch open and shut the best ive ever seen when can you finish the report ill email it tomorrow thanks biff good luck an hour later david and helen loaded emma into her car seat and set off for waukegan the purpose of the trip was to check on wally but there was the added benefit of having the baby finally go to sleep after four days of sobriety wally looked rested and was eager to leave harbor house david recapped the trial and not wanting to repeat himself and not entirely in the mood for humor omitted the parts that oscar and rochelle had found so funny friday afternoon wally apologized repeatedly until david asked him to stop its over wally we have to move on they talked about ways to unload their krayoxx clients and the problems this might create it really didnt matter how complicated things becametheir decision was final they were finished with krayoxx and varrick i dont need to stay here any longer wally said they were alone at the end of the hallway helen had stayed behind in the car with the sleeping baby what does your counselor say im getting tired of the guy look david i fell off the wagon because of the pressure thats all i consider myself sober right now im already counting the days ill jump back into aa and hope and pray i wont fall off again hear me david i dont like being a drunk we got our work cut out for us and i gotta stay sober with his portion of the meter ticking at a day david wanted wally out as soon as possible but he was not convinced a tenday detox would work ill talk to the counselorwhats his name patrick hale hes really beating me up this time maybe thats what you need wally come on david get me outta here weve dug a hole for ourselves and its just you and me this time im not so sure oscar will be much help left unsaid was the fact that oscar had been the great skeptic about krayoxx and mass torts in general the deep hole in which they now found themselves had been dug by wallis t figg they talked about oscar for a while his divorce his health his new girlfriend who was not really that new according to wally though david did not press for details as he left wally pleaded again get me outta here david we have too much work to do david hugged him goodbye and left the visitors room the work wally kept referring to was little more than the imposing task of getting rid of four hundred or so dissatisfied clients mopping up the remains of the klopeck trial grappling with a lot of unpaid bills and laboring away in a building now burdened with a mortgage in the past month the firms other clients had been neglected many to the point of hiring other lawyers and the daily inquiries from prospective clients had declined dramatically david had thought of leaving of opening his own shop or looking at other smaller firms if he walked away he would of course take the thuya khaing case with him oscar and wally would never know about it if the case eventually paid off david could write a check to finley amp figg for his share of the mortgage on the building but these thoughts were bothersome he had run away from one firm and never looked back if he ran away from the second one he would always have regrets in reality david knew he could not leave finley amp figg with the two partners ailing and a swarm of unhappy clients and creditors pounding on the door t he phones rang constantly monday morning rochelle answered a few times then announced its all those krayoxx people asking about their cases unplug it david said and the racket stopped the old oscar was making a comeback he was in his office door tightly closed shoving paperwork around his desk by am david had composed a letter to be mailed to the four hundred or so clients who only thought they had a lawsuit it read dear last week our firm tried the first lawsuit against varrick labs for its drug krayoxx the trial did not go as planned and was not successful the jury ruled in favor of varrick with all the evidence now presented it is clear that additional litigation against the company would be illadvised for that reason we are withdrawing as your counsel feel free to consult with another attorney for what its worth varrick presented convincing proof that krayoxx does not damage the heart valves or any other part of the body sincerely david zinc attorney and counseloratlaw when rochelles printer began spitting out the letters david went upstairs to prepare for another fight in federal court which on that monday morning was the last place he wanted to go he had a rough draft of a lawsuit to be filed against sonesta games and a rough draft of a letter he planned to send to the companys chief inhouse counsel he polished and tweaked both as he waited on sandronis report varricks stock opened at on monday morning its highest value in over two years david scanned the financial sites and blogs and they were still buzzing with speculation about the future of krayoxx litigation since david had no role in that future he was losing interest fast he searched the nearimpenetrable web site of cook countycourtscriminalwarrants amp affidavits and found no record of a complaint for assault filed by one aaron deentz on saturday the hung juror had blogged about the ending of the klopeck trial but did not mention getting punched out in the mens restroom on the twentythird floor of the dirksen federal building oscar had a friend who had a friend who worked in warrants amp affidavits and this friend was supposedly on the lookout for a filing by deentz you really decked him oscar had asked with genuine admiration yes a stupid thing to do dont worry its just simple assault i got friends when sandronis report arrived david read it carefully and almost salivated at its conclusion the levels of lead in the paint used in coating the nasty teeth toys are of toxic levels any child or person using this product in the exact manner in which it was designed to be used to wit insertion into the mouth over the real teeth would face the grave risks of ingesting quantities of leadbased paint for good measure dr sandroni added in thirty years of testing products for sources of poisoning primarily lead poisoning i have never seen a product so grossly and negligently designed and produced david copied the sixpage report and placed it in a binder with color photos of the original set of nasty teeth used by thuya and photos of the samples david had purchased the week before he added a copy of the lawsuit and a medical summary prepared by thuyas doctors in a pleasant but straightforward letter to a mr dylan kott chief inhouse counsel for sonesta games david offered to discuss the matter before filing suit however this offer was good for fourteen days only the family had suffered greatly continued to suffer and was entitled to immediate relief when he left for lunch he took the binder and shipped it to sonesta games by fedex overnight priority no one else at the firm knew what he was doing for contact information in the letter he used his home address and cell phone oscar was leaving as david returned and his chauffeur was a tiny little woman of dubious ethnicity at first david thought she was thai then she appeared more hispanic regardless she was pleasant to chat with on the front sidewalk she was at least twenty years younger than oscar and during the brief conversation david got the clear impression that the two had known each other for some time oscar who looked quite frail after an easy morning at the office slowly folded himself into the passengers seat of her little honda and away they went who is that david asked rochelle as he closed the front door i just met her myself some weird name i didnt get either she told me shes known oscar for three years wallys skirt chasing is wellknown im kinda surprised about oscar are you rochelle smiled and said david when it comes to love and sex nothing surprises me she held out a pink phone message slip while were on the subject you might want to call this guy who is it goodloe stamm paula finleys divorce lawyer i dont know a thing about divorce law rochelle rochelle gave an exaggerated look around the room around the offices and said theyre all gone i guess youd better learn fast stamm began with a sappy too bad about the verdict but i really wasnt surprised nor was i david said tersely what can i do for you well first of all hows mr finley oscars fine his heart attack was only two weeks ago today he actually came to the office this morning for a few hours and hes making steady progress i suppose youre calling to ask about the krayoxx litigation and hoping there might still be a chance of some fees coming our way the answer unfortunately for us for our clients and for mrs finley as well is that there is no prospect of making a dime off these cases we are not going to appeal the klopeck verdict we are in the process of notifying all of our krayoxx clients that we are withdrawing as counsel we hocked the office to finance the trial which cost us about in cash the senior partner is recovering from a heart attack and bypass surgery the junior partner has taken a leave of absence the firm is now being run by me and one secretary who by the way knows a lot more about the law than i do in case youre curious about mr finleys assets let me assure you that he has never been broker than he is right now as i understand his offer to your client he is willing to give her the house all the furnishings her car half the cash in the bank which was less than in return for a simple uncontested divorce he just wants out mr stamm i suggest you and your client take this offer before he changes his mind stamm digested this and finally said well i appreciate your candor good heres some more on behalf of your felonious client justin bardall youve filed a lawsuit against oscar finley for that unfortunate shooting incident as i read the file your client is headed back to prison for attempted arson as i mentioned mr finley is quite broke his insurance company is refusing coverage because it deems his actions intentional as opposed to negligent so with no insurance coverage and no personal assets mr finley is judgmentproof you cannot squeeze a nickel out of him your lawsuit is worthless what about the office building heavily mortgaged look mr stamm you cannot get a verdict because your client is a twiceconvicted felon who was caught in the act of trying to commit a crime extremely lousy jury appeal but if you got lucky and got a verdict mr finley would file for bankruptcy the next day you cant touch him you understand i get the picture we have nothing and we are hiding nothing please have a chat with mrs finley and mr bardall and explain this to them i would love to close these files as soon as possible okay okay ill see what i can do chapter a week passed with no word from sonesta games david watched the calendar and the clock he fought the urge to dream of a quick settlement and he dreaded the idea of filing a lawsuit in federal court against a large corporation that treacherous road had just been traveled at times he felt like the old wallylost in dreams of easy money the firm slowly returned to a routine that somewhat resembled the old days rochelle arrived at each morning and enjoyed her quiet time with ac david was next then wally whose car had been towed during the drinking spree and was not damaged oscar rolled in around ten delivered to the front door by his girlfriend a charming lady who managed to impress even rochelle at some point each morning wally faced each of his colleagues and said day of sobriety then day and so on he received congratulations and encouragement and was once again proud of himself he found an aa meeting almost every night somewhere in the city the phones were still ringing with calls from disgruntled krayoxx clients all of whom rochelle routed to wally and david the exclients were generally subdued even pitiful as opposed to belligerent they had been expecting moneywhat happened the lawyers were apologetic and tended to blame things on some mysterious federal jury that had ruled in favor of the drug the lawyers were also quick to point out that it had been proven in court that krayoxx was safe in other words your lawsuit is gone but your heart is much healthier than you thought similar conversations were being repeated across the country as dozens of highflying lawyers backtracked from the drug a lawyer in phoenix filed a motion to dismiss four lawsuits involving clients allegedly killed by krayoxx his motion met a rule response straight from the nadine karros playbook varrick labs demanded sanctions for the filing of the frivolous cases and provided detailed billing and expense records to prove it had spent over million defending the lawsuits with the mass tort lawyers in retreat it soon became apparent that varrick was in hot pursuit the wars over rule sanctions would rage for months ten days after the verdict the fda lifted its recall of krayoxx and varrick flooded the market reuben massey would quickly restock his cash reserves and his first priority was to pound away at the mass tort bar over its mistreatment of his beloved drug e leven days after the verdict and still no word from aaron deentz the hung juror had taken a break from his blog without an explanation david had two thoughts about a prosecution for simple assault first if deentz filed charges he would run the risk of blowing his cover like many bloggers he relished his anonymity and the freedom it allowed to say virtually anything the fact that david knew who he was and called him out right before he punched him had to be unsettling if deentz pressed charges he would be forced to appear in court and admit to being the hung juror if he was really out of work and looking for a job his blogging might haunt him in the past two years he had said terrible things about judges lawyers and law firms on the other hand he had been on the receiving end of two solid punches david had not felt bones breaking but there had to be damage if only temporary since deentz was a lawyer he would probably insist on getting his day in court and his revenge david had yet to tell helen about the assault he knew she would react with disfavor and she would worry about an arrest and prosecution his plan was to tell her only if deentz filed charges in other words he would tell her later maybe then he had another idea there was only one aaron deentz in the phone book and late one afternoon david dialed his number aaron deentz please david said speaking who is this david zinc here mr deentz and im calling to apologize for my actions after the jurys verdict i was upset angry and i acted rashly a pause then you broke my jaw at first there was a flash of macho pride in the fact that he could throw a punch with such ferocity but all bravado vanished when david thought about a civil lawsuit for personal injuries again i apologize and i certainly did not intend to break anything or cause bodily harm deentzs next response was most revealing he asked how did you learn my identity so he was afraid of being exposed david fudged a little by saying i have a cousin whos a geek took him twentyfour hours you shouldnt post at the same time each day sorry about the jaw im willing to cover your medical expenses he made this offer because he was compelled to but he flinched at the thought of another outlay of cash are you trying to offer a deal zinc sure ill cover your medicals and you agree not to press charges or pursue damages youre worried about an assault charge not really if i have to defend myself for the assault ill make sure the judge sees some of your comments and i doubt hell be impressed judges despise blogs like yours judge seawright followed it daily and was furious thought it might affect the case if any of the jurors stumbled across it his clerks were trying to learn the identity of the hung juror david was spinning this wild fiction on the fly but it had a legitimate ring to it have you told anyone deentz asked david couldnt tell if he was timid scared or just dealing with a broken jaw not a soul i lost my insurance when i lost my job the medicals are as of now the wires are in for a month after that i dont know i made my offer david said do we have a deal a long pause then yes i guess theres one other thing mr deentz okay what is it you called my wife a bimbo yes i uh shouldnt have done that your wife is very attractive she is and shes a very smart lady my apologies and mine w allys first posttrial victory was the successful completion of oscars divorce settlement with little in the way of assets and both parties desperately wanting out the agreement was actually quite simple if any legal document could ever be considered simple when oscar and wally signed their names just below paula finley and goodloe stamm oscar stared at the signatures for a long time and did not attempt to suppress a smile wally filed the agreement in circuit court and an appearance date was set for midjanuary oscar insisted on a celebratory bottle of champagne nonalcoholic of course and the firm met at the table for an unofficial meeting late in the day since all four knew the scoreday of sobrietywally was toasted along with the newest bachelor on the block oscar finley it was thursday november and though the little boutique firm was facing a mountain of debt with few clients they seemed determined to enjoy the moment wounded and humiliated they were still standing and showing signs of life just as he drained his glass davids cell phone vibrated he excused himself and went upstairs d ylan kott introduced himself as the senior vp and chief counsel for sonesta games a position he had held for many years he was calling from the companys headquarters in san jacinto california he thanked david for his letter its tone and reasonableness and assured him the package had been studied by the companys top brass and frankly there was deep concern up there he too was concerned and said wed like to get together mr zinc facetoface and the purpose of the meeting would be to david asked discuss ways to avoid litigation and to avoid negative publicity certainly we are a toy company mr zinc our image is very important to us when and where we have a distribution center and office in des plaines your neck of the woods could you meet us there monday morning yes but only if youre serious about a settlement if you plan to walk in with some lowball scheme then forget it ill take my chances with a jury please mr zinc its too early to start with the threats i assure you we recognize the gravity of this situation sadly weve been here before i can explain it all on monday fair enough has a legal representative been appointed by the court for this child yes his father would it be possible to have both parents on hand monday morning im sure they can be there why carl laporte our ceo would like to meet them and on behalf of our company offer an apology chapter the facility was one in a long row of modern warehouses that covered acres and seemed to stretch endlessly west from des plaines and the chicago suburbs thanks to his gps david found it with no trouble and at monday morning he escorted soe and lwin khaing through the front door of a redbrick office complex stuck to the side of a massive warehouse they were immediately led through a hallway and into a conference room where coffee pastries and juice were offered they declined davids stomach was flipping and his nerves were on edge the khaings were thoroughly overwhelmed three welldressed corporate types entered the room dylan kott chief counsel carl laporte ceo and wyatt vitelli chief financial officer rapid introductions were made and then carl laporte asked everyone to have a seat and did his best to reduce the tension more offers were made of coffee juice and pastries no thanks when it soon became apparent that the khaings were too intimidated to converse laporte grew somber and said to the parents well first things first i know you have a very sick boy and he is not likely to improve much i have a fouryearold grandson my only grandchild and i cannot imagine what you are going through on behalf of my company sonesta games i take full responsibility for what has happened to your son we did not make the product this nasty teeth toy but we own the smaller company that did import it from china since its our company it is our responsibility any questions lwin and soe shook their heads slowly david watched in amazement in a trial these comments by carl laporte would be fair game an apology by the company would be admissible into evidence and carry great weight with the jury the fact that he was accepting responsibility and doing it without hesitation was important for two reasons first the company was sincere and second the case was not going to trial the presence of the ceo cfo and top lawyer was a clear sign that they had brought their checkbook laporte continued nothing i can say will bring back your little boy all i can do is say im sorry and promise you that our company will do all that we can to help you thank you soe said as lwin wiped her eyes after a long pause during which laporte watched their faces with great sympathy he said mr zinc i suggest the parents wait in another room down the hall while we discuss matters agreed david said an assistant suddenly materialized and led the khaings away when the door was closed again laporte said a couple of suggestions lets take off our coats and try to relax we could be here for some time any objection to using first names mr zinc not at all good were a california company and our culture leans to the informal all coats were removed and ties loosened carl continued how would you like to proceed david you called the meeting right so a little background might be helpful first as im sure you know were the thirdlargest toy company in america sales last year of just over billion behind mattel and hasbro david said politely ive read all your annual reports and a ton of other stuff i know your products history financials key personnel divisions and longterm corporate strategy i know who insures your company but of course the limits of liability are not disclosed im happy to sit here and chat as long as you guys would like to i have nothing else planned for the day and my clients have taken off from work but to move things along i suggest we get down to business carl smiled and looked at dylan kott and wyatt vitelli sure were all busy carl said youve done your homework david so tell us what you have in mind david slid across exhibit and began this is a summary of brain damage verdicts over the past ten years kids only number is a million verdict in new jersey last year for a sixyearold who ingested lead by chewing on a plastic action figure the case is on appeal look at number a million verdict in minnesota that was upheld on appeal last year my father sits on the minnesota supreme court and is fairly conservative when it comes to upholding large verdicts he voted to affirm that one as did the rest of the court unanimous it was another leadpoisoning casea kid and his toy number involves a nineyearold girl who nearly drowned when her foot got caught in the drain of a brandnew swimming pool at a country club in springfield illinois jury deliberated less than an hour and awarded the family million on page look at number a tenyearold boy was hit with a piece of metal flung from a commercial bush hog with no chain guards severe brain damage the case was tried in federal court in chicago and the jury awarded million in actual damages and million in punitive damages the punitive award was cut to million on appeal i dont need to go through every case and im sure you guys are familiar with this territory it should be obvious david that we would like to avoid a trial and jury i understand but my point is that this case has tremendous jury appeal after the jurors spend three days looking at thuya khaing strapped into his high chair they might bring back a verdict larger than any of these that potential should be factored into our negotiations got it what is your demand carl asked well a settlement should include several areas of compensation some relatively easy to tally others not so easy lets start with the financial burden on the family to care for the child as of now theyre spending about a month on food medications and diapers not much money but a lot more than the family can afford the boy needs a parttime nurse and a fulltime rehab specialist to at least attempt to retrain muscles and reprogram the brain whats his life expectancy asked wyatt vitelli no one knows its a moving target i didnt put it in my report because one doctor says a year or two off the record and another one says he could live to be an adult ive talked to all the doctors and no one thinks its smart to predict how long he might live ive spent some time with him during the past six months and ive noticed a slight improvement in some functions very slight i think we should negotiate as if he has twenty years left all three men nodded quick to agree its obvious that his parents do not earn a lot of money they live in a small cheap apartment with two older daughters the family needs a home with plenty of space and a bedroom outfitted for thuyas special needs nothing elaboratethese are simple people but they have dreams at this point david slid across three copies of exhibit which were quickly snatched off the table david took a deep breath and plowed forward this is our settlement proposal first you see the specific damages number covers the expenses i mentioned plus a parttime nurse at a year plus the mothers lost salary of a year because she would like to quit work and stay home with the boy ive also added the cost of a new car so they can take him to and from rehab on a daily basis ive rounded it off to a year for twenty years for a total of million you can buy an annuity at todays rates for million rehab is a gray area because im not sure how long it would continue as of today it runs about a year assuming twenty years the annuity will cost you next is the issue of a new home in a nice neighborhood with good schools the next item deals with the lakeshore childrens hospital their care saved his life and was free at least to the family but i think the expenses should be paid back the hospital was reluctant to give me an estimate but there it is david was at million and none of the three executives had removed a pen from a pocket there were no frowns no head shaking nothing to indicate they thought hed lost his mind moving on to the nonspecifics ive listed the kids loss of enjoyment of life and the emotional distress of the family i know these are vague areas but they are compensable damages under illinois law i suggest the sum of million david folded his hands together and waited on a response no one seemed surprised a tidy sum of million carl laporte said what about attorneys fees dylan kott asked gee almost forgot about those david said and everyone smiled my fee is not taken from what the family gets its extra thirty percent on top of what youre looking at there or million thats a nice payday dylan said david almost mentioned the millions each of the three had earned the previous year in salary and stock options but let it pass i would like to think i could keep it all but that will not be the case six and a half million dollars carl said as he laid down his copy of the report and stretched his arms you guys seem intent on doing whats right david said plus you dont want bad publicity just like you dont want to roll the dice with an unsympathetic jury our image is very important carl said we dont pollute rivers or make cheap handguns or deny insurance claims or bilk the government on bad contracts we make toys for kids its just that simple if we get the reputation for harming children were dead can i ask where you found these products dylan asked david told the story of soe khaing purchasing the first set of nasty teeth a year earlier and of his search high and low in greater chicago for similar packages carl described the companys efforts to track them down too and admitted that sonesta games had settled two other similar cases within the past eighteen months they were cautiously hopeful that all leadpainted samples had been removed from the market and destroyed but not certain they were at war with several factories in china and had moved most of their production to other countries the purchase of gunderson toys had been a costly blunder other stories followed as if both sides needed a break to think about the settlement proposal on the table after an hour they asked david to step outside so they could huddle in private d avid drank a cup of coffee with his clients and after fifteen minutes the same assistant asked him to return to the conference room she closed the door behind him and david was ready to cut the deal or walk away when they were situated and poised carl laporte said we were prepared to write a check for million and put this matter to rest david but youre asking for a lot more than that we will not accept million because the case is worth twice that much our number is million take it or leave it ill file the lawsuit tomorrow a lawsuit will take years can your clients afford to wait dylan asked some of our federal judges use this local rule nicknamed the rocket docket and believe me it works i can have this case before a jury in a year the last case was far more complicated and it went to trial ten months after it was filed yes my clients can survive until the jury brings back the verdict you didnt win that case did you carl asked with his eyebrows arched as if he knew everything about the klopeck trial no i did not but i learned a lot i had a lousy set of facts this time i own the facts by the time the jury hears everything million will seem like a bargain well offer million david swallowed hard glared at carl laporte and said youre not hearing me carl its million now or a lot more a year from now youre turning down million for these poor burmese immigrants i just turned it down and im not negotiating your company is well insured the million is not coming off your bottom line maybe but the insurance premiums are not cheap im not haggling carl deal or no deal carl took a deep breath and exchanged looks with dylan kott and wyatt vitelli then he shrugged smiled surrendered and offered a hand a deal david grabbed his hand and shook it firmly on the condition that this is extremely confidential carl said of course dylan said ill get our guys in legal to prepare an agreement not necessary david said as he reached into his briefcase he pulled out a file removed four copies of a document and passed them around this is a settlement agreement that covers everything its pretty straightforward and includes all manner of language about confidentiality i work for a tiny law firm but it has some complicated problems its in my best interests to keep this quiet you had a settlement agreement prepared at million carl asked you got it not a penny less thats what this case is worth dylan said this settlement has to be approved by the court right yes ive already established a guardianship for the kid his father is his legal representative the court must approve the settlement and over the years it will supervise the money im required to prepare an annual accounting and meet with the judge once a year but the file can be sealed to ensure secrecy they reviewed the agreement then carl laporte signed it on behalf of his company david signed it then soe and lwin were brought into the room david explained the terms of the settlement to them and they signed under his name carl apologized again and wished them well they were shellshocked overcome with emotion and unable to speak as they were leaving the building dylan kott asked david if he could have a moment to discuss a matter the khaings moved on and waited by davids suv dylan deftly slid a white unmarked envelope into davids hand as he said you didnt get this from me okay david placed it inside his coat pocket what is it a list of other products mainly toys with histories of lead poisoning most were made in china but there are some from mexico vietnam and pakistan made somewhere else but imported here by us companies i see and might these companies be your competitors you got it thanks good luck chapter finley amp figgs last firm meeting took place late that afternoon at davids insistence they waited until rochelle was gone oscar was exhausted and cranky a good sign his girlfriend and driver had been sent away at pm and david promised to drive his senior partner home after the meeting this must be important wally said as david locked the front door indeed it is he said taking a seat at the table you guys remember that leadpoisoning case i mentioned back a few months ago there were vague recollections but so much had happened since then well david said smugly there has been an interesting development do tell wally said already anticipating something pleasant david went through a lengthy narrative of his activities on behalf of the khaings he placed a set of nasty teeth on the table as he slowly spun his story toward its delightful climax this morning i met with the ceo and other top executives from the company and we reached a settlement by this time wally and oscar were hanging on every word and exchanging nervous glances when david said the attorneys fees are million both closed their eyes and lowered their heads as if in prayer david paused as he retrieved copies of a document for each of them this is a proposed partnership agreement for the new law firm of finley figg amp zinc oscar and wally held the document but neither looked at its language they simply gawked at david both mouths open both men too stunned to speak david continued an equal partnership a threeway split of the bottom line with a monthly draw based on net revenue for each month you guys keep the building in your names you may want to look at the third paragraph on the second page neither flipped a page just tell us oscar said okay theres some pretty clear language about certain activities the new firm will not engage in it will not pay bribes or referral fees to policemen tow truck drivers rescue personnel or anyone else for case referrals it will not advertise on bus stop benches bingo cards or any other cheap publication in fact all advertising must be approved by the marketing committee which at least for the first year will consist solely of me in other words fellas the firm will no longer chase ambulances whats the fun of that wally asked david smiled politely but kept going ive heard talk about advertising on billboards and television that too is prohibited before the firm signs up a new client the three of us must agree to take the case in summary the firm will adhere to the highest standards of professional conduct any fees in cash will go straight to the books which will now be kept by a competent cpa in effect gentlemen the new firm will operate like a real law firm this agreement is good for one year and if either of you fails to comply with it then the partnership will dissolve and ill find work elsewhere back to the attorneys fees wally said im not sure you finished that part of the discussion if we can agree on the rules of the new partnership then i suggest we use the fees from the khaing settlement to pay off the bank and clean up the krayoxx mess including the in sanctions levied during the trial thats about rochelle gets a bonus of that leaves million for the lawyers which i think we should divide equally wally closed his eyes oscar grunted then slowly got to his feet and walked to the front door where he looked through the window finally he said you dont have to do this david i agree wally said though without much conviction this is your case weve done nothing i understand david said but i look at it like this i would never have found this case had i not been here its that simple a year ago i was working at a job i hated by chance i stumbled into this place met you guys and then i got lucky and found this case excellent point wally said and oscar was quick to agree oscar walked back to the table and slowly settled into his chair he looked at wally and said what about my divorce no problem we have a signed settlement agreement your wife is not entitled to any fees earned after she signed it the divorce will be final in january thats the way i see it oscar said me too added david things were silent for a long time then ac rose from his pillow and began a low growl the distant whine of an ambulance siren came into range and grew louder wally glanced longingly at the window beside rochelles desk dont even think about it david said sorry force of habit wally replied oscar began chuckling and soon all three were laughing epilogue bart shaw closed his files and dropped his malpractice threats against finley amp figg he collected almost from varrick for his successful efforts to torment the firm and force it to trial in the klopeck matter adam grand filed an ethics complaint with the state bar association but it eventually fizzled five other clients of the nondeath variety did the same with the same results nadine karros made good on her promise not to seek sanctions for the filing of frivolous lawsuits but varrick mounted an aggressive and sometimes successful campaign in other courts to collect money from plaintiffs firms jerry alisandros was hit with a huge fine in southern florida when it became obvious he had no plans to pursue his krayoxx litigation thuya khaing suffered a series of violent seizures and died three days after christmas in lakeshore childrens hospital david and helen along with wally oscar and rochelle attended the small burial service also in attendance were carl laporte and dylan kott who with davids help managed to have a quiet word with soe and lwin carl offered his heartfelt condolences and again took full responsibility on behalf of his company under the terms of davids settlement agreement all sums were vested and would be paid as promised oscars divorce became final in late january by then he was living with his new girlfriend in a new apartment and had never been happier wally remained sober and was even volunteering to help with other lawyers battling addictions justin bardall was sentenced to one year in prison for attempting to torch the law office he appeared in court in a wheelchair and was required by the judge to acknowledge the presence of oscar wally and david bardall had cooperated with the prosecutors for a light sentence the judge who had spent the first twenty years of his career practicing law on the streets of southwest chicago and had a low opinion of thugs who conspired to burn law offices did not show compassion for justins bosses the owner of cicero pipe was sentenced to five years in prison and his construction superintendent got four david successfully won a dismissal of bardalls lawsuit against oscar and the firm not surprisingly the new partnership did not survive after his heart surgery and divorce oscar lost steam and spent fewer hours at the office he had some money in the bank and was drawing a pension from social security and his housemate made a comfortable living as a masseuse he had actually met her next door after six months under the new agreement he began dropping hints about retiring wally was still smarting from his krayoxx adventure and had lost his zeal to hustle new cases he too had a new girlfriend a slightly older woman with a nice balance sheet as he described it also it was painfully obvious at least to david that neither partner had the desire nor talent to put together big cases and take them to trial if necessary he honestly couldnt imagine walking into another courtroom with those two his radar was on high alert and he saw the warning signs immediately he began planning his exit eleven months after emma arrived helen gave birth to twin boys that momentous occasion prompted david to plan a new future he leased office space not far from their home in lincoln park carefully choosing a fourthfloor suite with a view to the south he could see the magnificent skyline of downtown with the trust tower squarely in the center of it the view never failed to motivate him when things were in place he informed oscar and wally that he planned to leave when the agreement expired at the end of twelve months the parting was difficult and sad but not unexpected it prompted oscar to announce his retirement wally seemed relieved too he and oscar decided on the spot to sell the building and close shop by the time all three shook hands and wished each other good luck wally was planning a getaway to alaska david got the dog and he also got rochelle though the two had been in secret talks for a month he would never consider hiring her away from the firm but suddenly she was a free agent with a higher salary and more benefits she was given the title of office manager and happily moved into the new digs of david e zinc attorneyatlaw the new firm specialized in product liability law when david settled two more leadpoisoning cases it was clear to him and rochelle and their expanding staff that the practice was about to become quite lucrative most of his work was in federal court and as business boomed he found himself downtown more and more when possible he stopped by abners for a laugh and a quick luncha sandwich and a diet soda on two occasions he had a pearl harbor with miss spence who though pushing ninetyseven still knocked back three of the syrupy concoctions every day david could choke down only one and afterward he took the train back to the office and enjoyed a nap on his new sofa
