the wine of angels phil rickman prologue old winters frost and hoary hair with garlands crowned thomas traherne poems of felicity twelfth night twisty old devil looked as if it held a grudge in every scabby branch and if you touched it thered be sharp pointy bits like thorns and it wouldnt give you any fruit on principle wassail or no wassail because left to rot apple trees they grows resentful merrilys grandad had told her that once when she was a little girl frightening her because you always thought of apples as cheerful and wholesome oaks could be gnarled and forbidding pines scraggy and cruel but apple trees were essentially goodnatured werent they all the same every evening for weeks afterwards merrily would go down to the orchard and wish the trees a wary goodnight assuring them they could always count on being looked after as long as she was around this was merrilys problem always felt responsible perhaps to get grandad watkinss point you had to see a tree as old as this one on a night this cold the orchard glittering grimly in bilious lamplight merrily shivered like a little rabbit inside her tired old fake barbour stamping her boots on the stonehard earth in the clearing thered be about thirty of them strangers now but people shed have to get to know very well if she decided to go for it they didnt look overfriendly at the moment all hunched up in a handrubbing steambreathing circle like tramps around a brazier except there wasnt a brazier just this frosted naked apple tree the biggest one remaining in an orchard left to rot for years but no ordinary apple tree according to mrs caroline cassidy of the famous cassidys country kitchen this was the apple tree man the very spirit of the orchard so now we all know merrily turned away and sighed and the sigh recorded itself on the frigid air as a tiny white cloud uncle ted whod excused himself because of a cold thought it might be an interesting experience for her to observe a crosssection of the parish go undercover armed with teds wordportraits of the major players all of them at least occasional churchgoers but wasnt this ritual just a bit barbaric miss lucy devenish muttered more loudly than she needed to utterly barbaric isnt seemly isnt local isnt right actually pagan had been the word merrily had in mind but barbaric would do according to uncle ted miss devenish had been muttering about this for most of the past week been along to a meeting of the parish council to demand they get it stopped which of course was beyond the powers of the parish council to do even if theyd wanted to offend councillor powell who owned the orchard shed also have known better than to petition the vicar lesson one uncle ted said keep your nose out where you can isnt traditional to the area miss devenish said and so it cant be right do you see my point she wore a big widebrimmed hat and a camelhair poncho looked like an old red indian scout talked like a headmistress delightful old girl uncle ted had said may however be some sort of witch dont be tempted to get too close but miss devenish was talking to her well picturesque though merrily said feebly in a christmas card sort of way some folk were holding up hurricane lamps throwing oily light on frosty bark bringing up a dull lustre on the barrels of the shotguns which were not very christmas card seven of them carried by local farmers and landowners and patrons of the cassidy restaurant who happened to be countrysports enthusiasts or clayshooters lesson seventeen where bloodsports are concerned sit on the fence and hope for the best oh hell said lucy devenish here it comes smiling a troublemakers smile at the arrival of the organizer mr terrence not terry if you dont mind cassidy long herringbonetweed overcoat russianstyle furry hat learnedlooking in halfglasses right are we all here good good mr cassidy positioned himself under a lamp on a stick but do we all know why were here like a teacher addressing an infants class according to uncle ted whod lived here most of his adult life the secret of being accepted in the village was to keep your head well down for two years minimum but the cassidys clearly werent keepingyourheaddown people while her husband was lecturing the poor primitive yokels about the importance of their traditions mrs caroline cassidy all kittedout for skiing in the alps was arranging plastic beermugs on a wooden picnic table beside the frostrimed cask of cider occasionally flicking a glance towards miss devenish who was trouble through the hoary trees behind her merrily could see the village lights yellow amber and red behind drawn curtains very cosy but strangely far away by day you would have seen the church through the naked trees at night the orchard was a separate place and so people we revive a very ancient custom mr cassidy had a high nasal voice like the wind down a drainpipe he reminded them that next may would see the start of the first ledwardine festival a summerlong smorgasbord of music poetry drama houses and gardens open to the public guided tours a major exhibition of our heritage lucy devenish snorted mr cassidy raised his voice and as fine local cider was that heritage we intend that it should be revived pause for gasps that didnt come nice enough idea merrily thought but it was never going to be any more than a gimmick the cider trade in herefordshire was pretty well sewn up most growers in these parts selling their apples in bulk to bulmers or dunkertons anyway most of the orchards hereabouts had been grubbed up during the great victorian ciderslump we shall be recommending local cider at our own restaurant the black swan will also i trust promote it but of course the creation of this venerable beverage depends upon obtaining a significant crop of the famous pharisees red as grown for centuries in this very orchard by cassidy extended an arm like a varietyshow compere the powell family everybody stared across at garrod farmer and county councillor and his son lloyd and grandad edgar was it gripping the stock of the family shotgun with fingers like knotty little roots and staring directly at merrily but not seeing her she was sure he wasnt here at all wasnt old edgar everybody else merely didnt want to be here because of course it was pointless it was artificial it had been put on mainly for the press who hadnt bothered to turn up and it was so bloody cold merrily pulled up the hood of her fake barbour this wasnt the right attitude was it she should be cheerful hearty joining in but this this facsimile of rural life as it was thought to have been lived this traditional gathering involving for the most part incomers while the members of the old yeoman families sat at home watching the late movies with cans of lager and the remains of a tandoori well this also left her cold lucy devenish was breathing like a bull over a gate as mr cassidy explained how the powells had graciously agreed to let them have last years crop for the festival cider however as the apple harvest in recent years has been somewhat limited my everresourceful wife proposed that we might resort to the timehonoured method of arousing the ah temporarily dormant fecundity of the orchard pompous arsehole miss devenish growled the happy tradition of wassailing mr cassidy looking as happy as the night and his thin pale face would allow dates back presumably to pagan times it being necessary to petition the gods in good time for spring i am not myself particularly moved to call upon the services of those ancient deities but i do believe that the good wishes of neighbours symbolically expressed here tonight will have a strongly beneficial effect on this oncesupreme orchard and on the festival and indeed on the fortunes of our village do you know how long theyve lived here miss devenish muttered one and a half years our village gerronwithit a small wiry man in a flat cap and a muffler bit down on his cigarette gomer parry merrily remembered former diggerdriver and contractor frost had turned his little round glasses into communion wafers all bloody hot air gomer mumbled his plump wife pink earmuffs nudged him in the ribs merrily glimpsed a smirk on the taut patrician face of james bulldavies of upper hall he was passing a chromium flask to a blonde woman next to him very much next to him she had a swig and giggled as she helped him stow the flask inside his sheepskin bomberjacket hungrily kneading his chest through his sweater hence the smirk merrily pretended not to notice lesson five dont offend anyone called bulldavies the church would be rubble but for them with all this talk of paganism cassidy was saying its a pity we dont at present have a parish priest to balance things up but im assured a number of candidates for the living are being interviewed and indeed the word is that one of them may even be in the village tonight oh no merrily shrank behind a lesser apple tree i dont think i should say any more than that good and so without further ado i call upon james and his colleagues to check their cartridges or whatever they need to do and let the wassailing one moment miss lucy devenish had swept back her poncho like a veteran warrior from the dark ages and marched into the centre of the clearing you really dont know what the hell youre doing do you this has always been a peaceful place a place of seclusion it is also virtually adjacent to the churchyard and is itself a burial place miss devenish and there is absolutely no way at all that you can justify these frightful guns miss devenish weve been into all this before and ill prove that ill prove it to you because you see i have with me miss devenish paused dramatically and held up the large book shed been concealing under her poncho mrs leather ella leather the folklore of herefordshire published this mr cassidy rose up in the lamplight is inexcusable now according to mrs leather the custom of wassailing on twelfth night involved lighting fires in the fields usually wheatfields not apple orchards for obvious reasons but i shall let that pass and there is no mention at all of the use of firearms a few people started murmuring miss devenish glared defiantly at cassidy in the lamplight clasping the old book to her chest now just a minute mrs caroline cassidy had appeared behind an impatient frown terrence torch she had a large book as well mr cassidy directed the flashlight beam as his wife riffled through the pages ok right caroline trilled collected folk customs of the british isles page one hundred and five i quote it was customary for such members of the local yeomanry as possessed guns to assemble around the largest tree in the orchard referred to as the apple tree man and to discharge their weapons into its topmost branches in the belief that this would drive away evil spirits and stimulate fertility there where demanded miss devenish ive just told you collected folk customs of the british isles by c alfred churchman i mean where abouts in the british isles is this nonsense supposed to have been enacted in the west of england of course are we not precisely miss devenish tilted her head under its enormous cowboy hat may one ask oh this is utterly nonsensical mrs cassidy getting increasingly shrill everyone knew what wed agreed what wed agreed my dear mrs cassidy if we had to do this some of us might have preferred an innocent singalong over the wassail cup as distinct from a remake of the gunfight at the ok corral oh a singalong mrs cassidy threw up her hands appealing to the crowd how very spectacular certainly less insulting to the poor trees now are you going to tell us where this dubious business with guns was last recorded or not mrs cassidy looked sulky and brushed at her designer skijacket devonshire but i dont see that it matters well you wouldnt would you now look here ladies james bulldavies had stepped forward now shotgun casually broken over an arm look mindful as one must be of old customs it really is awfully cold why dont we proceed with the aspect were all agreed on and pour out this excellent cider fore the damn stuff freezes over discuss it over a drink is what im suggesting recognizing the semimilitary tone of the old squirearchy even the cassidys shut up bulldavies bent over the cask and started filling the plastic tumblers himself merrily smelled the cider sour and musty she wondered where theyd got it from she found herself glancing at old edgar powell his face like an old tobacco pouch and his eyes wide open still looking her way he wasnt here tonight old edgar wasnt here at all perhaps wherever he was that was a better place to be tonight of course we all know what all this is about miss devenish told her in a very loud whisper these awful people these cassidys they think the powells could be terribly quaint and oldfashioned with their ancient cider press and their old recipe and they just want to turn them into a tourist sideshow and garrod powells going along with it to keep the peace and just in case theres a few quid to be made without too much work and is that so bad for the village bad miss devenish snorted the cassidysll just turn honest cider into some horrible fizz in champagne bottles and sell it for a quite ridiculous price in their ghastly restaurant to awful people like themselves when i was a gel the farm labourers still used to receive gallons of pharisee red as part of their wages it was the peoples drink do you see my grandad used to say it was just a way of keeping them grossly underpaid and too drunk to notice said merrily your grandad miss devenish observing her shrewdly from under that hat possibly putting two and two together are you local my dear sort of my grandfather had a farm about six miles away mansell lacy jolly good who was your grandfather charlie watkins didnt know him personally but there are many watkinses in the area my god miss devenish was gazing over merrilys left shoulder just look at that little whore with bulldavies shell have his cock out in a minute huh alison kinnersley a destroyer i suspect merrily risked a glance bulldavies was talking to some of the other guys with guns alison kinnersley was standing behind him keeping her hands warm in his trouser pockets that poor boy james bulldavies good heavens no kinnersleys boyfriend former boyfriend not the bull the bulls can look after themselves trouble is they want to look after everyone else but it goes wrong never trust the bulls my dear remember that remember poor will sorry ok listen everybody james bulldavies had disentangled himself from alison he reached up snapped a lump of brittle dead branch from the apple tree man and banged it on the cider cask like a chairmans gavel were going to do it had a brief chat with the chaps here seven of us brought shotguns along and if were talking about old traditions well i rather suspect there must be one about it being bad luck to take ones weapon home without loosing orf a single shot miss devenish apologies but were going to do it miss devenish stiffened as the shotgun men gathered in a semicircle around the tree shuffling cartridges from their pockets something we have to sing or something is there terrence boomed bulldavies i have it here james its a sort of chant if you say it after me ok orf you go then stand back everybody well back there was silence everyone waiting miss devenish said loudly well ive done all i can if you wish to disturb the dead go ahead her voice still rang in the hard air as she turned away bulldavies shrugged as he accepted the folklore book cleared his throat and began to read hail to thee old apple tree hail to thee old apple tree the shooters chanted gruffly selfconscious and let thy branches fruitful be and let thy branches going to cause offence miss devenish had a prominent hooked nose it twitched cant anyone see that deep offence merrily shook her head tired of all this it wasnt as if they were going to shoot any animals just blast a few pounds of shot into the air through branches that were probably mostly already dead why did he have to break off that branch showing his contempt you see for the tree and all that dwells there well said merrily theres nothing dwelling in there now is there miss devenish pulled the wide brim of her hat down over her ears as the gunmen chanted armsful hatsful cartsful of apples huzzah huzzah huzzah and shouldered their shotguns merrily thought unnerved for a second of a firing squad as miss devenish turned away and the night went whump whump whump whumpumpump and the air was full of cordite farts merrily was aware of a fine spray on her face probably particles of ice from the shocked branches but it felt warm like the poor old apple tree man was weeping when the shooting stopped there was a touch of anticlimax obviously the book didnt say what you did afterwards er well done chaps james bulldavies said halfheartedly a few villagers clapped in a desultory sort of way caroline cassidy came out from behind a tree and sniffed we havent got a single picture of this have we as for the bbc i shall write and complain merrily was aware of a silence growing in the clearing the sort of silence that was like a balloon being blown up and up and up until the halfscream halfretch from only yards away was more penetrating than any bang and it came as caroline cassidys features went as flaccid as a rubber clownmask lips sagging eyes staring and she cried whats that on your face in the middle of the scream it had come from alison kinnersley merrily had put a hand to her face and felt wetness and now she held up her hand to the light and it was smeared dark red i say look get get back the voice of james bulldavies pitched schoolboyhigh bloody nora gomer parry said hoarsely merrily saw black drips on garrod powells capshaded cheeks a smear around lloyds mouth like badly applied lipstick spots on gomers glasses blotches on his wifes earmuffs hanging around her neck like headphones caroline cassidy teetered back in her thighboots making an ugly snuffling noise and merrily saw the worst and went stiff with the shock between the powells at the foot of the stricken old tree what looked like a milk churn in an overcoat was pumping out dark fluid black milk a scarf of cold tightened around merrilys throat whats the matter terrence cassidys cultured tones rising ludicrously out of the clearing like something out of noel coward whats happened i dont understand for heavens sake all we wanted to gomer parry looked up at cassidy through his red glasses and spat out his cigarette somebody better call the police i reckon merrily had found a handkerchief and was numbly wiping the blood from her face unable to pull her gaze away from the horror inside the collar of edgars overcoat knowing that most of his head would be in the tree hanging like some garish leftover christmas bauble amid tinselly frosted twigs she crumpled the handkerchief her face was still wet it felt like some horrific baptism and hearing miss devenish whispering i knew it i knew it she knew she would have to look up into the tree part one can closed eyes even in the darkest night see through their lids and be informd with sight thomas traherne poems of felicity third floor merrily had a recurring dream shed read somewhere that it was really quite a common dream with obvious symbolism by recurring well shed have it maybe once every few months or the gaps might be even longer nowadays there was a period not long before sean died when it came almost nightly or even in that intense and suffocating period twice or three times the same night shed close her eyes and the dream would be waiting there like an empty train by a deserted platform sometimes it was merely puzzling sometimes it seemed to open up exciting possibilities occasionally it was very frightening and she awoke shredded with dread what happened she was in a house not always the same house but it was her own house and shed lived there quite some time without realizing or sometimes shed just forgotten shed gone on living there possibly for years without registering that the house had a third floor it was clear that shed lived quite comfortably in this house which was often bright and pleasant and that she must have passed the extra staircase thousands of times either unaware of it or because there was simply no reason to go up there in the dream however she had to go up with varying amounts of anticipation or cold dread because something up there had made its presence known to her shed nearly always awaken before she made it to the top of the stairs either disappointed or trembling with relief just occasionally before her eyes opened she would glimpse a gloomy airless landing with a row of grey doors in reality if you excluded flats she had never lived in a threestorey house now however jesus merrily said we cant live in this yes i suppose it is big uncle ted conceded didnt think about that never a problem for alf hayden six kids endless grandchildren it was big all right seventeenth century timberframed black and white seven bedrooms absolutely bloody huge if there was just the two of you very quaint but also unexpectedly depressingly grotty nothing seemed to have altered since about the s of course its church policy these days to flog off these draughty old vicarages uncle ted said replace them with nice modern boxes worth a lot of money your old black and whites well not this one at present not in the state its in after thirtyodd years of alf and betty there was quaint merrily thought and there was horribly oldfashioned like the steelgrey fourbar electric fire blocking up the inglenook like a kitchen the size of a small abattoir with no real cupboards but endless open shelves and all the pipes coiled under the sink like a nest of cobras besides ted said we havent got any nice modern boxes to spare three applications for housing estatesve been turned down in as many years not in keeping he frowned conservations a fine idea but not when it turns a nice old village into an enclave of the elite in his habitual cardigan and slippers ted clowes two years retired didnt look at all like a lawyer any more his face had gone ruddy like a farmers and his body had thickened he looked as seasoned and solid as one of the oak pillars holding up the vicarage walls as senior church warden ted had made himself responsible for getting the vicarage into some kind of shape negotiating with builders and plumbers and decorators but well into april the work had hardly begun it looked as though merrily was going to have to spend the first month of her ministry in a bedandbreakfast she was relieved in a way a place this size it was ridiculous and an unoccupied third floor full of dust and echoes she stood on the firstfloor landing miserably looking up all these staircases yeah jane said thoughtfully this puts a whole new perspective on the entire scenario it does merrily watched warily as the kid took off up the stairs to the third storey shed been sulking on and off for three days shed quite enjoyed the two years in birmingham while merrily was at college loved the time in liverpool when merrily was a curate bigcity woman now on the way here shed said that if cheltenham was an old peoples home rural herefordshire looked like premature burial yes jane paused halfway up looking around you like this at least weve cleared all those rooms now ted said alf and betty were generous enough to leave us a quarter of a centurys worth of junk yellowing newspapers with pictures of the first moonlanding jane had a forefinger placed pensively on her chin far more rooms than youd need mum right mmm yes even for all your bible classes and parish meetings and visiting evangelists from nigeria ye es unless of course theyre travelling with their extended families so this whole storey is in effect going spare conceivably her daughter was starting to operate like a slick barrister the barrister merrily might have become had it not been for gods unexpected little blessing would she still eventually have wound up in the church if jane hadnt come along dont look at me like that mum all im saying is i could have a kind of group of rooms up here like a suite because because if you think about it those back stairs come off a separate entrance a third door right ted chuckled he knew all about daughters right merrily said and so it would be kind of my own entrance it would be in fact like my own flat oh i see the third door with its own illuminated bell and a card under perspex flat one ms jane watkins she was fifteen and youd pay the heating bills for this er suite would you oh god jane glared down over the oak banister here we go mrs bloody negative or maybe you could sublet a couple of rooms jane scowled and flounced off along the short passage oak floorboards creaked a door rattled open that empty sound could be a doublebluff merrily said her daughter pacing bare boards overhead probably working out where to put her stereo speakers for optimum sound the picture shes feeding me is that shes going to be so bored here shell have to invite half the young farmers club over for wild parties all these rural romeos popping pills on the back stairs ted laughed young farmers arent pillpopping yet well none that i know of pressure job now though diminishing returns ec on your back quotas for this quotas for that a hundred forms to fill in mad cow disease suicide figures are already sorry bad memories what oh i seem to remember saying if you want an informal picture of village life why not pop along to this wassailing thing not quite what i had in mind awfully sorry merrily she looked through the landing window down into a small square rose garden where the pink and orange of the soil seemed more exotic than the flowers over a hedge lay the churchyard with its cosy sandstone graves oddly that awful public death hadnt given her a single nightmare in her memory it was all too surreal as though violent death had been an optional climax to the wassailing and as the oldest shooter in the pack edgar powell had felt obliged to take it you know standing in that orchard covered with that poor old blokes blood that was when i decided to go for it i clearly remember thinking that nothing so immediate and so utterly shocking ever happened quite that close to me in liverpool that maybe in some ways this village could actually be the sharp end i thought am i going to wash off his blood and walk away it always affects you more in the country ted came to stand beside her at the window everything that happens because you know everybody everybody and youll find as minister that youre regarded as more of a a key person births and deaths you really have to be there even if nobody from the familys been to a church service since the war thats fair enough far as im concerned belonging to the church doesnt have to involve coming to services and youll find that hills and meadows are far more claustrophobic than housing estates you see somebody coming across a twelveacre field towards you you cant dodge into a bus shelter fine ted raised a dubious eyebrow and everybody gossips he said for instance theyll all tell you edgar powelld been handling that shotgun since for ever making it suicide what it looks like but they havent got a motive money worries no more than the average farmer isolation hardly not living on the edge of the village depression hard to say perhaps hed just had enough or perhaps he simply wanted to ruin the cassidys olde english soiree been a spiteful old bugger in his time you are kidding arent you anyway garrod powells insisting it was an accident came to consult me about it hell be telling the coroner the old chap was simply going soft in the head cant blame him who wants a family suicide i suggested he have a word with young asprey get something medical but it could even be an open verdict whats that mean exactly uncle ted merrily turned to find jane sitting on the top stair elbows on knees chin cupped in her hands means they cant be entirely sure what happened jane ted said wish id been there merrily rolled her eyes having made a point of leaving jane at her mothers when shed come to do her bit of undercover surveillance prior to applying or not for the post the kid wouldve given them away in no time do you get many suicides in the village jane asked not with audienceparticipation ted said dryly merrily was thinking halfguiltily how shed scrubbed and scrubbed at her face that night and had to throw away the old fake barbour they stayed the night at the black swan sharing a room on the third floor as it happened but it was different in a hotel the black swan like all the major buildings in ledwardine with the obvious exception of the vicarage had been sensitively modernized the room was ancient but luxurious jane was asleep about thirty seconds after sliding into her bed jane could slip into untroubled sleep anywhere shed accepted her fathers death with an equanimity that was almost worrying a blip sean had lived in the fast lane and that was precisely where he died bang gone sadder about the girl in the car with him she could have been jane in a few years time or merrily herself ten years or so earlier too many thoughts crowding in merrily upended the pillow behind her leaned into it and lit the last cigarette of the day through the deep oaksunk window the crooked picturebook roofs of the village snuggled into a soft and woolly pale night sky perfect too perfect perhaps if you actually lived here with roses round the door what was there left to dream of how are things financially now ted had asked in the lounge bar after dinner jane had mooched off into the untypically warm april evening to check out the village and the local totty shed added provocatively oh merrily drank some lager we get by seans debts werent as awesome as wed been led to believe and a few of the debtors seem less eager to collect than they were at first i think it was meeting me in the dog collar it was like you know dangling a sprig of garlic in front of dracula im glad i met them i dont feel so bad about it now i know what kind of semicriminal creeps they are jesus what am i saying semi i wont ask but i did think he was being a little overambitious setting up on his own why didnt you both come to me for some advice you know sean knew anyway i blame myself if i hadnt got pregnant instead of a degree it was going to be superlawyer and loisthing defending the poor serving the cause of real justice zap pow but there you go he was on his own and with the responsibility of a kid and everything he was floundering and he got a little careless about the clients he took on its a slippery slope i wasnt aware of the way things were going too busy being mummy you blame yourself for letting him get you pregnant ted raised helpless eyes to the ceiling blame yourself for anything wont you merrily dangerous that in a vicar priestincharge only a matter of time now alf hayden he never accepted the blame for anything act of god providence his favourite words had us tearing our hair but you cant get rid of a vicar can you once theyre in theyre in and thats that not any more my contracts for five years red tape ted said dont worry about it please uncle ted dont do anything anything else youre not feeling manipulated are you of course not well maybe a little as if having a woman priest in the family wasnt enough her mother from the safety of suburban cheltenham had been out of her mind when merrily had gone as a curate to innercity liverpool all concrete and drugs and domestic violence running youth clubs and refuges for prozzies and rent boys terrific jane had thought cathartic merrily had found while her mother was putting out feelers good old ted had come up with the goods inside a year the vicar of ledwardine was retiring beautiful ledwardine only an hour or sos drive from cheltenham and ted was not only senior church warden but used to be the bishops solicitor no stringpulling of course shed only get the job if she was considered up to it and the other candidates were weak which at less than fifteen grand a year they almost certainly would be youve had a stressful time ted said hed never asked her why shed abandoned the law for the church it was evidently taken for granted that this was some kind of reaction against sean going bent but you do feel right about this place now i think so and listen dont imagine ill be giving you an easy time ha alf was always far too apathetic to sustain a decent dispute what did you have in mind well you need toilets in that church for a start i dont care if it is grade one listed with five stars a lot of people wont come to a place where theyre scared of being taken short especially on winter mornings shouldnt be too much of a problem if you can raise the money im also into more streamlined services no streamlineds not the word exactly shorter and more intense fewer hymns less meaningless ritual i mean we wont be kicking people out afterwards therell be tea and biscuits and all that though i wont ask for the espresso machine until ive been around for a while what about the prayer book oh strictly book of common prayer and no happyclappy well not much anyway not for the grownups ted clowes twisted his brandy glass around as if contemplating something i shouldnt really be saying this but a few people were a little wary about you at first big parish for for for a woman well yes he looked uncomfortable but there were other considerations its a mightily useful church you see big and with quite remarkable acoustics best concert hall for a good many miles so i gather and no shortage of people who recognize its qualities people whove moved into the area dermot child the composer and earlymusic expert and your organist of course and richard coffey the playwright he lives here well some of the time with his young friend an actor not one youd have heard of and the cassidys are very er cultured well thats just the core of it but there are lesser figures and acolytes and followers and you have to take notice of these people because they bring bodies and money into the church into the diocese and a certain cultural cachet cant be cynical about this sort of thing merrily has the church ever been perhaps not and most of us realize the church needs a kick up the backside and if its delivered by a more prettily shod foot fair enough alf was always a bit of an old woman time for a young one but naturally we have our traditionalists people who may have tried to block the way ah merrily said would it help if i knew who they were ted didnt hesitate well james bulldavies hes the only one counts for anything funny sort of chap james career army officer then his marriage breaks up and his father dies quite unexpectedly from some sort of embolism following a routine op james has to give up his career come back and take over the estate catapulted into the situation really what situations that weight of tradition i suppose had to sell land and property to cover death duties and what have you in addition to whatever it cost him to pay sarah off left him with upper hall and the burden of tradition soldier mentality you see taken on the role of the squire in a way his father never did feels its his function to stop the slide of country values keep the modern world at arms length i see merrily said and that includes whats her name alison oh well nobody knows what goes on there power of the flesh im afraid anyway women in the boudoir thats one thing women in the pulpit of the church housing the bones of ones ancestors is something else entirely merrily slowly shook her head it isnt you my dear ted assured her its the principle the tradition however to his chagrin hes found that in what was once a little world where the squire was a demigod there are now other influential parties notably the affluent articulate incomers most of whom were rather keen on the idea of a lady cleric question of image you see image somebody said that they tolerated alf of course fat scruffy old cove not very ambitious not terribly bright always a bit of eggyolk on the old cassock but what the parish needs at this stage of the villages development is someone more sophisticated more attuned to the ah is zeitgeist the word im looking for theyd prefer a woman priest because its cool and stateoftheart jesus not merely a woman ted shuffled about a bit i mean when they saw you at the wassailing and somebody put two and two together what oh merrily dont make me spell it out youre young and you rather as someone said rather smoulder in black oh no oh hell who said that not going to say told you i shouldnt have said anything bloody hell ted merrily awoke just as it was growing light above the timbered gables a wooded hill had formed she was brightening with the sky what had been outrageous last night seemed quite funny now smoulder whod said that and where hopefully not at the bishops palace things really had changed hadnt they used to be schoolgirls falling for the new curate merrily smiled feeling younger than she had in quite a while she looked across at jane who was still asleep hey what the hell if she wanted to set up some kind of apartment under the eaves why not the kid had given up enough these past years two changes of school becoming singleparented coping with a mother who spent whole nights fuming about some of the crap they threw at you in theological college and for merrily she glanced at the thickbeamed ceiling it would take away the irrational background stress connected with an empty third storey she went to the window which was set into a wall divided into irregular white rectangles by huge varicose veins of tudor oak jane who was into fine art these days said those white areas were just crying out for something interesting with acrylics oh dear merrily gazed out over the innsign across to the intimate market square with the squat crablike oaklegged shelter they called the market hall or cross overhung with shapeshifting black and white houses every crooked beam and truss preserved and presented with pride the village wore its past like a row of glittering horsebrasses over an inglenook fireplace defined by its past shaped by invaders the norman church with saxon origins at the end of a roman road the cramped cobbled alleyway where the gutters had once overflowed with pigblood and piss now a bijou arcade soon to be scented with fountains of flowers from a score of hanging baskets for the new invaders the cassidys of this world were here not to pillage or desecrate or change but only to preserve preserve preserve and wallow preserve and wallow merrily looked down into the stillshadowed street saw dr kent asprey heartthrob gp and fitnessfreak leading his jogging party of sweating matrons past the new tourist information office saw gomer parry the retired diggerdriver kick a stone into the road and stand on the kerb hands rammed deep into his pockets cigarette jammed between his lips he looked aimless what after all was there to do in this village but stand and stare appreciate absorb be enriched ideal her mother had said after what youve been through you need somewhere quiet with no stress and no drug addicts and homeless people to make you feel guilty somewhere you can sit back a bit and take stock merrily knelt before the window to pray she thought no need for homeless people to make me feel guilty according to dream analysts the one about the realization of a third storey was an indication of a whole new area of yourself which remained unexplored a higher consciousness dear god merrily whispered her palms together angled on the rising sun from behind her she heard the squeak of janes bed as the kid sat up oh shit her daughter muttered sleepy and cross do you really have to do that in here blackeyed dog lol planned his suicide with all the precision missing from his life he drew curtains across the small leaded windows facing the lane and the orchard the curtains were cheap and thin but they took away the brightness of the morning and also meant that alison would not be able to look through the windows for his body on the turntable lol placed his third alreadyworn copy of nick drakes first album five leaves left the lush arrangements the soft and ghostly vocals of a man with only five years to live all his adult life hed identified with nick drake even though nick had been taller and posher and dead by his own hand since the album hissed and clicked into time has told me veined through with richard thompsons serene guitar lol went outside to check on the milk with the bright mornings the milkman had been arriving earlier of late so the bottle was already on the step ok he went back for another bottle from the fridge yesterdays unopened and set it down next to the new one then he shut the door and went to explain to ethel kneeling down on the carpet looking into the unmoving greengold eyes im going to have to shut you in it wont be for long dont want you looking for me ok ethel looked unconvinced licked red mud from a paw she was technically a stray or maybe dumped hed heard this piteous mewling two nights running in the middle of january and finally found this thing in the hedge about five inches long and not much thicker than a piece of black hosepipe at first alison had not been pleased displaying that hard edge he used to think would eventually wear away in the country but on the morning she left she said she was glad lol had ethel something for him to feel responsible for lol went into the kitchen and didnt put the toaster on the smell of hot toast was one of the great scents of life it would be hard to die with the smell of hot toast in the air he didnt switch on the radio either he didnt rake out the woodstove he sat down at the table facing the pot of womens institute plum jam he pulled off the rubber band and the parchment top smelling the sweetness you shouldve told me he said to the jam meaning he should have realized this was the last of the three pots alison had brought back from the womens institute the day after she brought it shed told him herself and hed just broken down into tears here at this table with the shock hed always been naive as a kid as a songwriter but naivety was something you were supposed to grow out of like spots at the time the idea of alison joining all the farmers wives at the wi had seemed ok a little bizarre but also kind of quaint and homely it showed that coming here had really worked it made him want to become part of the community too a bellringer or something keep chickens grow tomatoes for the chutney alison would learn to make at the wi just off to the wi it had been a while before hed realized that all those times shed said she was off to the wi and returned a few hours later with a pot of jam shed really been with james bulldavies in the big bed at the big farmhouse called upper hall how had it begun he didnt know everyone else in the village seemed to know the new woman in the life of the squire of upper hall that was bound to be a talking point but there was nobody whod have told lol he was a stranger even to all the village newcomers lucy devenish might have broken it to him but he hadnt known her then in those long hazy days of trying to get vegetables to grow and watching alisons easy smile slowly stiffen in her beautiful face lols chin dropped into the crumbs on the kitchen table all he wanted was to know why he closed his eyes and saw alison riding as she did almost every day down the bridleway from upper hall along the edge of the orchard and out into blackberry lane just before the cottage gate she was on her chestnut stallion alison knew a lot about horses and rode this one with something like contempt it looked muscular and spectacularly masculine a thoroughbred beast she could make a gesture out of being able to handle with no particular effort like bulldavies himself who was the horses owner but would never lol was sure be alisons hed kept watching out for her convinced shed come back for several weeks hed really thought she would then hed thought that one day she would at least dismount lead the horse to the door explain what had happened between them but the morning ride always ended with an apparently casual glance towards the cottage to see the smoke from the chimney signs of life signs of lols survival before alison and the stallion turned both heads high back into the bridleway today there would be no smoke you all right mate lols eyes had shuddered open when the knock came at the front door oh he didnt know how long he must have been staring at the postman sorry do i have to sign for it no i just couldnt get it through the letter box could i oh lol said right sorry thanks very much your milks come oh ill come back for it thanks cheers said the postman lol carried the parcel into the kitchen laid it down on the table ethel jumped on it whiskers twitching the parcel was about fifteen inches square and an inch thick it was postmarked wiltshire his name was on the front typed on a label did he know anybody in wiltshire lol lifted the cat to the floor and slit the brown paper with the butter knife inside under some stiff cardboard was an lp record nick drake time of no reply lol stared at it he didnt understand he was afraid to touch it this was the posthumous album the one with blackeyed dog the bleak and eerie little song of depression and impending death the one where nick said he was feeling old and he wanted to go home he was twentyfive years old at barely twentysix hed taken one antidepressant too many and his mother had found him lying dead across his single bed lol began to shake out of the speakers from slightly happier days nick sang way to blue what kind of omen was this he looked up at the curtained window facing the orchard suddenly had the overpowering feeling that posh languid nick was standing out there among the trees waiting for him a bass player hed once met said hed been to this party at someones flat and nick drake six months before he died had been there and had stood leaning in a corner next to a candle for two and a half hours spoken to nobody and then slipped silently away like a ghost there was a letter with the album neat and official and wordprocessed and signed dennis clarke oh lol sat down oh yeah it was in fact his own album the one hed left with dennis when he went into the hospital dear lol i found this record when gill and i were sorting everything out for the move sorry ive been meaning to send it for months to be honest gill kept putting me off saying it might make you depressed again but now we know youre over it and settled with a nice lady well here it is as you can see were in chippenham now where i am a partner in a new accountancy firm a couple of us decided to break away from the old outfit and set up on our own and i think its paying off gill and i have got three kids now and we live in a fourbedroomed neogeorgian villa extremely suburban i do think about the old days quite a lot how things might have been disastrous probably on reflection im always glad it ended when it did we still get our royalties dont we anyway the real reason im writing is that i had a visit yesterday evening from karl lol let the letter fall to the table he didnt want to read any more and he didnt need to did he karl was over karl was gone karl was in if you remember he was in seattle managing a band and doing very well however it seems they split quite suddenly musical differences of course and karl was left with quite a few pieces to pick up anyway hes back in this country now because this is now where the future is he says i was a bit thrown when he went on to say he was convinced we were part of that future i never read the music papers these days dont have the time or to be quite honest the interest however according to karl the first two albums are now considered seminal that is they have been discovered by a couple of the major bands one of them might have been the verve no less who list them among their influences and sales are picking up again expect to see this reflected in the next royalties or ill want to know why needless to say id be happy to see those albums get the recognition they never really had in their day with whatever resulting remuneration might be forthcoming but ive been out of the business for a considerable time now and thats what i told karl when he said we should be thinking seriously about reforming the band look i said i shall be fortyfive next year i have lost most of my hair i have got three kids to support and i am very happy to be a chartered accountant in a nice part of the country also i have had a periodic problem with my elbow and have not lifted a drumstick in about three years well he didnt push too hard because lets face it he can manage without me i never wrote a song i wasnt even a very good drummer its you he needs not only the major talent in the band but nearly ten years younger than the rest of us and so less likely to seem like an old fart i dont know how you feel about this i did wonder with you being in a stable relationship now and perhaps better able to hold your own with karl whether you might not be ready for something like this however when he asked me where you were living now i decided on caution i said look lols had his problems you had better go easy i think he got the message naturally i said i didnt know where you were living now and i rang that guy chris in a and r at tmm and warned them not to give your address to him either but somebodys bound to leak it and thats why im writing i would have phoned but i find you are exdirectory anyway i thought i had better let you know karl has changed well a little all the same gill didnt take to him and was not at all happy when he took out what i would swear is the same tin and rolled himself a joint which as you can imagine is not exactly the drug of choice in our part of chippenham let me know if you hear anything give my best wishes to alison is it we were both so delighted to hear things are working out for you at last on a personal level and once again sorry for keeping the album so long with very best wishes dennis clark dear old dennis clarke methodical playitsafe dennis if you work it out for yourselves lads youll see that if we do these two gigs in banbury well be twentyseven pounds better off than if we go up to sheffield taking into consideration at least three little chef meals eleven gallons of petrol and tyrewear dear old stupid bloody dennis put it behind you lol its not the end of the world make a new start in a couple of years youll be laughing about it lol slumped into the old blue armchair nick drake sang cello song calm upperclass english accent and yet the blackeyed dog had been at nick drakes door as sure as the hellhound had pursued robert johnson the poor bluesman over half a century ago both of them dead before the age of twentyseven the thought of the hellhound who was karl windling back on his trail made lols mouth go dry he thought where will i go the days were growing longer living in the country you could really feel the earth turning and it made you dizzy he would do it hed go now in the springtime when the sun was beginning to linger over the village with its ancient black and white cottages and inns its old and mellowed church its narrow brown river in a similar village not two hours drive from here sometime in the night nick drake had opened his door to the blackeyed dog now out there in the orchard nick was waiting for lol local history actually jane thought it was excellent living at the pub even though they had to share a bedroom her at one end knocking off her homework mum at the other agonizing over a sermon even though you had to be up and into the bathroom pretty early to avoid having to watch mum saying oh my god her morning prayers you tried not to be embarrassed you really did try but a grown woman who actually wasnt badlooking for her age down on her knees under the window whispering sweet nothings to some invisible old bloke in the sky what a psychologist would have said how a counsellor would have put it was that jane was actually jealous of god this singleparent only child ok a semiorphan and heres her widowed mother taking up with another guy and this time its much more intense this time its the big guy the real thing this was what a psychologist would say and was in fact more or less what a counsellor had said the counsellor forced on her by mums bloody theological college the time she ran away as they insisted on putting it or took a night off as she tried to explain it to them anyway the night off had involved putting on some serious makeup and going to a pub and getting chatted up by a computer salesman from edgbaston before being spotted by one of the prissy bloody trainee vicars who fancied mum and took great pleasure in grassing up the delinquent daughter jesus how ironic all right whats on your mind flower mum plonked two diet cokes on the pub table the one near the toilets that was always the last to be taken except of course when good old humble mum was around oh jane said you know i mean nothing really as such as such mum nodded solemnly just wondering if i can put up with that bloody school for another two years before i wind up doing drugs and selfmutilation third new school in as many years though frankly when youd done it once it got easier the kids were always more curious about you than you were about them everybody wanted to hang out with the new girl and the teachers would give you the benefit of the doubt for months before proclaiming you public enemy number one mmm mum said is it that particular school or just any school desperate enough to take you jane wrinkled her nose i just sometimes think im too old for it too old for school older than everybody else my age anyway do you really have to wear that thing in here saturday lunchtime with the posteaster tourist season starting up the bar was pretty full being seen lunching with your mother was one thing sharing a table with the vicar was something else yes i really think i do mum patted her ridiculous collar with something jane was horribly afraid could be pride she lowered her eyes hell even a real dog collar would look better one of those with colouredglass jewels or brass spikes people of mums generation apparently used to wear them quite a lot during the punk era she remembered dad telling her once that mum as a teenager had been a sort of punk not exactly the full safetypinthroughthenose bit but certainly cropped hair and black lipstick dad talking in a way that suggested hed been quite turned on by it pretty revolting really and the music was embarrassingly awful going undercover was never a good idea mum said not in the parish it only leads to embarrassment later possibly meaning the guy whod tried to pick her up in this very bar and had turned out to be head of english at janes new school the smarmball who could be teaching her alevel next year which him being married to the girls pe teacher jane would not hesitate to use to stitch him up if the oily git should give her any hassle it was ok staying at the pub because you learned things about people things you might not find out for ages if you were banged up in the vicarage like that tvplaywright guy richard coffey moving this youngish actor into his house on a fairly permanent basis the actor was called stefan alder and was really succulent totty apart from being gay of course or maybe he just hadnt met the right woman so yeah it was good at the black swan swinging off the school bus and strolling coolly into the bar on the other hand there was the question of her apartment mustnt let that one slide so how long before they finish dealfing the rectory thats what i was about to tell you mum was taking delivery of a couple of ploughmanswifhcheddar from the waitress dont do it jane pleaded silently please dont say fucking grace i meant to say last night mum speared a piece of celery thank christ for that the rewirings complete theyve nearly finished work on the kitchen and yesterday apparently they took out that huge electric fire which is so old it breaks every known regulation according to uncle ted alf hayden must have been getting divine protection to have avoided being fried anyway the bottom line is we could be in by next weekend good yeah could be ok give her the whole of the summer holidays to get things together apartmentwise she had in mind this kind of mondrian effect for the main room you could paint the squares inside the timbers in different colours ingenious huh it was uncle ted of course whod fixed it for them to stay on at the black swan persuading the diocese to fork out for the woolhope suite a bedroom bathroom and small sitting room with a decentsized tv it was still offseason so roland the proprietor had been amenable to the kind of deal that people like uncle ted prided themselves on making uncle ted was widowed and seemed to have an arrangement with a widowed lady in church street ledwardine was really quite liberal and sophisticated perhaps the country had always been like that to janes horror the local paper had been along to get a picture of her and mum outside the pub mum had insisted on wearing the clerical clobber and the photographer had made them both sit on the pub steps smiling like idiots b and b vicar holds the fort it said yuk mums only objection was to the word vicar priestincharge was the correct term it was a temporary thing apparently there was going to be this big reorganization and mum could wind up with about four extra churches making her a kind of flying minister that was when theyd give her the official title meantime it was just the one church which should have been a piece of cake would have been to anyone but mum who seemed determined to become some kind of spiritual doormat people cornering her in the pub all the time emergency meetings of the church council articles to write for the parish magazine dear friends yuk four trips to hereford to see parishioners in hospital and three funerals inside a fortnight megadepressing or what well obviously youd get used to that be like planting bulbs after a while except if you were mum you felt obliged to spend most of a day and a night quizzing relatives and neighbours about what kind of person the prospective interee was prior to being dead its a life jane you cant just dismiss a life with a handful of cliches and a couple of jam scones in the village hall she wasnt even getting bloody overtime and she was starting to look seriously knackered ah merrily might one perhaps have a word jane looked up from her lunch yeah she thought the word is tosser sure mum said take a pew thank you mr cassidy of cassidys country kitchen naff twee or what parked his tight arse in pristine stonewashed jeans on the edge of a stool he held a glass of white wine he smiled indulgently down and how are you jane getting by we really must arrange for you to meet colette his snotty daughter who went to the cathedral school in hereford you saw her posing around the square in the evenings sixteen nearly and sultry jane kept her distance super she said got a problem terrence mum said briskly mrs fixit why didnt she just tell him to sod off until shed finished her lunch no no cassidy said airily its simply are you doing anything special tonight is she ever depends which part of the night really terrence mum hates to miss homicide life on the street the vicar frowned at her daughter mr cassidy smiled thinly everything about him was thin which told you all you needed to know about his bloody awful restaurant this would be about eight he said its an impromptu meeting of the festival committee am i on the festival committee mum wondered well alf hayden wasnt but we rather thought you should have a say especially as we were hoping this year to make more use of the church itself in other than musical areas to be specific drama oh im sure its seen plenty of that in its time quite in fact its about that you see richards over from london for the weekend richard coffey with his boyfriend shut up jane mum said as you may have heard cassidy said richard has agreed to write a short play especially for the festival to illustrate a lesser known aspect of local history gosh mum said theres prestigious we originally had in mind something social perhaps showing how the trade in highquality cider was almost irrevocably damaged in the eighteenth century by the growing fashion for french wines yeah you could invite the euromp jane jane retired behind a smirk however said cassidy richards apparently become fascinated by the story of wil williams which i suppose also has a social aspect in its way mmm mum said obviously its not something the village nowadays is particularly proud of no mum said quite although i suppose it has its tourist possibilities in a lurid sort of way point is richards drawn certain conclusions which appear to have quite excited him the case itself is not well documented as you know probably some sort of kangaroo court but this of course gives richard considerable artistic licence right mum nodded and as hes even talking about bringing in some professional actors which would be wonderful especially if the play went on to london be rather super wouldnt it premiered in ledwardine church and then conquers the capital mum nodded again her eyes had acquired a guarded look id have to talk to the bishop of course and er richards going to be revealing his plans at tonights meeting is he we hope so eight oclock you said at the village hall we normally meet in the restaurant but saturday is our busy night youll be there well all right you havent met richard have you weve seen him in the bar though jane said with his b look forward to it terrence mum laid her knife and fork neatly down the middle of her halffull plate another aborted lunch you could get quite worried about mum sometimes she wasnt getting any younger past the age when you should be eating like a supermodel splendid cassidy wove off through the crush holding up his wine like some sort of sacrament jane grinned i thought you didnt mum tossed her bag on her bed how the hell should i be expected to know who wil williams was ive been too busy to even think about local history never mind youve got hours yet no i havent ive got to meet gomer parry at four the digger man wasnt for him and the gardening club the churchyardd be some kind of nature reserve what a great idea dont start mum flopped back on the bed covered her eyes the sun blared in through the old leaded window and turned her into a tableau the exhausted saint and its saturday afternoon so the libraries are closed in hereford and leominster mum this is ridiculous nobody expects you to know absolutely everything yes they do thats the whole point jane im the bloody priestincharge im supposed to have done my homework i suppose i could go round and see whos that old bloke who does the allouryesterdays bit for the parish mag god no i heard him in the post office once great queue of people and he was on about how you could send a threepiece suite through the post for less than a shilling in youd be lucky to get away in time for the meeting look ok ill find out who he was mum took her hands away from her eyes how dont look at me like ive never done anything for you ever i mean properly no ill make it all up of course properly and ill keep you out of it ill say its for a school project where will you go ledwardine lore but thats miss devenish mum sat up oh no you said properly youll just get the miss devenish version which may not and anyway yes mum did one of her heavy sighs shed had this thing about miss devenish ever since the great powell suicide the old girl had made a scene about this wassailing scenario being all wrong and no good would come of it and bang no good came of it spooky yeah right jane was never going to forgive herself for missing all that of course that was in her ledwardine denial period she was over that now mum look thats the only shop in the village where you can get real local history books were going to have to get one sometime all right just pop in and grab a book i wont know which one its in will i you cant stand there in a shop that size going through all the indexes ill have to ask her about it jane sat on a corner of the bed searching out her mothers eyes people said they had the same eyes dark and curious got you she said you dont like me going in there do you because people say shes a bit of an old witch daughter of the priestincharge mustnt be seen consorting with satanic forces right thats cobblers jane however until weve got our feet under the table were going to have to tread carefully walk on a few eggshells is that a mixed metaphor no spot on actually in an accidental sort of way so how do you want to play it do you want me to find out who wil williams was or do you want to busk it with coffey and cassidy hey you think stefan might be there tonight i have no idea can i come absolutely not god forbid neither will you hang around the bar you can stay up here and watch tv its saturday night look flower well have a home in a week or so we can start shipping all your clothes and your albums and books and stuff over from cheltenham yeah she supposed there had been cultural withdrawal symptoms from the music especially weeks since shed lain on a bed with her eyes closed in a room full of radiohead you wont have to be bored any more mum said well be settled for the first time in years you think so actually i dont know i dont really know what im doing mum sighed sod it flower she said wearily i suppose i could consult ted but ive been bothering him too much lately go on go and ask miss devenish who on earth wil williams is straight shooter this frenzied slam slam slam flat of a hand on the door panels someone whod given up with the bell given up with the knocker lol flailed out of unconsciousness mustve fallen asleep did that so easily now in the daytime result of spending evenings dozing in front of the stove staggering miserably to bed and lying awake until it was light yet there was something different about today wasnt there now the door handle was being rattled the letterflap pushed in and out his name being screamed oh my god the black cat sailed from his knees he rolled out of the chair alison shes here go carefully go slowly you only get one chance be cool yeah im fine i just needed to talk to you no weeping no pleading just the truth because i cant believe it was some fastflowering infatuation did this to us nor a sudden realization that he was what youd always wanted i cant believe you saw him in his tweeds and his gumboots and you thought thats what i need to give my life direction a genuine oldstyle landowner in a damp old sevenbedroomed farmhouse with cowshit on the lino and laurence are you there laurence close to the door lol sagged it was not alison no indeed he opened up and there she was under the big hat elbows making batwings out of the poncho you dismal tripehound what the fuck are you playing at striding into the living room flinging back curtains do you know what time it is he looked at the travel alarm on the mantelpiece it said this had to be wrong maybe it had stopped christ six hours lol looked sheepishly into lucys hot glaring face i fell asleep he remembered that this was saturday afternoon hed promised to mind her shop the nick drake album was still revolving on the turntable the needle grinding it up it would be ruined now like everything he touched dont know what happened luce it was just like i got up this morning then like fell asleep in the chair just completely youre lying she was advancing on him like a big policewoman come on hand them over huh pills she held out a big pink palm dont fart about with me laurence im not in the mood pills want to see what they are i havent got any pills he spread his hands honestly people with a background like yours lucy said always have pills oh god he was far too ashamed to explain doesnt everything go pearshaped what you mean by that her eyes nailgunned him to the wall two days milk outside all the curtains drawn i wont ask you again how many did you take lucy lol said would i leave a little cat to starve she loomed over him answer my question damn you or ill box your bloody ears he stood back both hands up i didnt take any no pills all right the milk the curtains see i was lying awake all night im thinking you know youve got to get your shit together you cant be a little wimp all your life youve got to talk to her and that i mean that isnt easy i cant go up to her in the street im not ready to do that why cant you simply phone her up because either he answers and i hang up or she answers and she hangs up she doesnt want to talk to me but she likes to know im all right that i havent done anything really stupid like what she really wants is for me to move out but in the meantime she rides past the house every couple of mornings presumably hoping shell see a for sale sign but failing that some reassurance that i havent set fire to the place cut my wrists in the bath you know how thoughtful lucy said i find that comforting that shes worried she might have driven you to take your own life ah lucy took off her hat tossed it on the chair one begins to see you really are a sick twisted little person arent you laurence he said nothing a silly charade this was a silly stupid charade you wanted her to think youd done it you drew the curtains made it seem as if you hadnt collected the milk for two days put on some mournful record and then what she sees youre alive and falls into your arms we just talk lol said finally we talk see i tried calling to her she wont get off the horse she just turns around trots away you run after her she pshaw lucy said she was the only person hed ever encountered who actually said this if attempted suicide is a cry for help laurence this is at best a feeble squeak mmm he nodded miserably laurence lucy held his eyes like a hypnotist youre letting me bully you you arent even putting up a fight against an old woman with no business interfering in your affairs we cant have that can we can we laurence no he said humbly and she threw up her arms aaagh you can have what the hell you like you clown its your life my god but those hospital shrinks have a lot to answer for keep em drugged up to the eyeballs and then send em out like zombies actually i was a bit like that before i went in lucy shook her head come on she said have a pee splash some water on your face and then well go through the window he saw her moped parked behind his muddied astra in the short drive all right lol said she let him push the moped down blackberry lane across the square and into the mews enclosing ledwardine lore lucy insisted she needed somebody to look after the shop occasionally when was she to do her own shopping otherwise used to be a girl came in two afternoons a week but shed had a baby and left the area everythings priced lucy told lol unlocking the door and if its not you can always make one up she was doing this to bring him out bring him into the village he hated coming into ledwardine on his own they still smirked at him in shops been smirking at him for months hed thought it was because he was such an obvious townie and maybe he should grow sideburns below his ears buy a rusty pickup truck not realizing they all knew what he didnt that the entire bloody village knew and you wont have to face any of the locals she said identifying his fears gathering them up only tourists on a saturday he relaxed lucys tiny overcrowded shop had in it the essence of what he liked about this place what hed miss when he sold the cottage and cleared out the red soil and the long wooded hills and the twisted houses with old bones of blackened oak and the apples why were apples so cheerful and wholesome while the orchard was so oppressive bad for you lucy was saying wrong type of woman entirely not that she wont be bad for him but thats his lookout and hes stronger than you are thanks i never dress things up womans a destroyer what you need is a preserver we had something lol said i know im naive i know i dont see things but you dont set up a home with someone in a new place unless you feel theres something worth having lucy shook her head at his shortsightedness lol thought of the day hed come home to find bulldaviess big land rover outside the cottage filled up to the canvas with alisons stuff how cool shed been how matteroffact about it sitting him down at the kitchen table and telling him simply and concisely apologizing in an almost formal way kissing him calmly like she was just going off to london or somewhere for the day if youd seen her at that twelfth night debacle lucy said you wouldnt be so damned charitable where were you on twelfth night anyway oxford with a bloke id done some lyrics for a cruel woman and yet curiously shallow horseriding pointtopoint driving around in muddy land rovers racing up the sweeping drive being lady of the manor youre making her sound starryeyed lol said shes not no indeed shes cunning manipulative knows how to use her looks and the bulls a malemenopausal stooge whos known only two kinds of women garrisontown whores and countyset heifers shes got his balls in the palm of her hand and shes not going to let go and if you think a passing concern that little laurence might top himself is any sign she may come back when she tires of the bulls body then my boy youre even less bright than you look thanks im a straight shooter laurence you were just a stepping stone to the mansion on the hill poor james poor james lol sat down on the stool behind the counter hes got the mansion on the hill even if it is crumbling around him now hes got the girl too no strings yeah poor old james im sorry its just that i knew his father or at least i knew patricia young who i suppose was one of the old mans alisons family tradition huh a tradition in most old country families i say one of the old mans alisons but she wasnt at all like that patricia was bright but a little naive like you stablegirl at the hall who hadnt realized that part of a stablegirls job was to lie down in the hay with her breeches off as required for john bulldavies lucy frowned she took a paperback book down from a shelf laid it on the counter dissolute old bastard john bulldavies slave to the flesh and let everything else slip through his fingers money land public esteem if he hadnt died when he did theredve been nothing left for james perhaps that would have been no bad thing boy seemed to have been on the straight and narrow in the army now hes been forced to pick up the pieces and seems unfortunately to have slipped further into the family mould than id have expected what happened to the stablegirl i warned her to get out and she did she left im sure he must have found a replacement or two or three before he died time that family faded out of the picture i say turn upper hall into a nursing home and thats coming from an old conservationist no i hope your alison takes him for everything hes got forces him to sell up and move away it isnt healthy for him here because james has some sort of conscience but thats not your problem he no longer understood what she was on about she looked down at him pushed towards him the paperback book shed taken down i shall be back by fivethirty she said read this between customers if you dont get any customers youll be able to read the lot lol picked up the book a penguin classic thomas traherne selected poems and prose this is the man you need lucy said sitting there playing your mournful wistful records do you no damn good at all its spring let traherne into your life open your heart to the eternal lol had heard of the guy seventeenthcentury visionary poet born in hereford lived in credenhill about seven miles from here where he was he was a priest wasnt he vicar rector of credenhill i know what youre thinking but trahernes spirituality and your parents socalled christianity are poles apart thats the whole point of this you never enjoy the world aright till the sea itselffloweth in your veins till you are clothed with the heavens and crown d with the stars that was him you have to learn to open up let the world flow into you again go into the village on your own and go in smiling thats what traherne did happiest man in the county discovered felicity his great realization was that god wants us to enjoy life and nature that if we dont were throwing it all back in his face traherne walked the fields and was truly happy maybe hed just discovered magic mushrooms lol said lucy snorted pulled down her big hat and left him to it buds the truth of it was that from that first solo stroll around the village jane had been looking for an excuse to go into ledwardine lore shed been up to it several times but you could see through the window that the place was too small to browse around and escape without buying something maybe that was why so few local people seemed to go in made more sense than all this stuff about miss devenish being weird like weirdness was something new in the countryside emerging from the lustrous oakiness of the black swan jane skipped down the five steps to the cobbles these were mainly new cobbles the original ones being so worn away by horses hoofs that theyd apparently been considered too dangerous smart ladies en route to cassidys country kitchen might fracture their stiletto heels the alleyway was just yards from the bottom of the steps it was tres bijou the most terminally bijou part of the village all bulging walls and lampbrackets in the days when the black swan was a coaching inn it was probably a mews with stables now the stables and an attached barn had become cassidys country kitchen with its deli and its restaurant specializing in game and salmon and things served in nouvellecuisinesize portions at silly prices jane thought shed have preferred it in the old days when the best you could expect was a nosebag full of oats there were a few early tourists about also the famous colette cassidy shrugged into the country kitchen doorway looking like a highclass hooker in a short white dress she raised an eyebrow at jane but didnt smile jane in jeans and an old blue pulp tshirt breezed past with a noncommittal hi ledwardine lore was at the very end of the mews crunched into a corner by the flatulent spread of the country kitchen the sign over the window was uptilted so that lore was almost pointing at the twisted chimney if it had been horizontal theyd never have squeezed all the letters in as she pushed open the door jane could have sworn she heard an amused snort from colette and was disgusted with herself for blushing inside the shop there was more standing room than you found in a phone box but not a lot more jane felt suddenly nervous like when you went into a fortunetellers tent and it was just you and her when she closed the door behind her this smell went straight to the back of her throat not the usual horrible incense but a piercing fruity scent she looked around and at first it seemed like just the usual tourist bricabrac pottery ornaments and those little stainedglass panels you put over your windows cellophanecovered jugs of potpourri and gift packs of local wine and books janes eyes went in search of history and found the usual paperbacks herefordshire curiosities herefordshire castles the folklore of herefordshire the old straight track the old golden land plus dozens of other books about apples apples for growing apples for health identifying apples books of applelegends applecustoms superstitions games even a book of poems called ripest apples and then she saw that most of the tourist stuff was appleshaped and applecoloured the pottery was little apple jugs and mugs the potpourri was orchardscented which accounted for the pervading smell the stainedglass panels featured eve and what looked like an oversized coxs orange pippin the local wine was in fact cider twin green bottles labelled bittersweet and bittersharp there were also rosy apples in small oil paintings crudely framed russet apples glazed on kitchen tiles wax apples appleshaped notepads and address books and naff fluffy apples like the dice people hung in their cars dangling in bunches from the ceiling beams and clinging to the fluffy apples and the jugs and the mugs and the frames of the paintings were scores of what looked like butterflies but on closer inspection proved to be fairies jane said in surprise they were tiny and delicate with little matchstick bodies and wings of soft red and yellow and green apple colours lucy makes them two pounds each or three for a fiver oh she jumped she hadnt seen him behind the counter well until he stood up you couldnt see anything at all behind the counter because of a pile of big green and red appleshaped candles promising to give your living room an exquisite orchard ambience he peered out between the candles he had long hair tied up in a ponytail and small brassrimmed tinted glasses he didnt seem very tall sorry jane said it didnt look as if there was anybody here just apples pickyourown he plucked a fairy from a candle wick spend over ten quid we throw one of these in for nothing theyre very lucky apparently i didnt really come in for a fairy i was looking for a book on local history right he said uncertainly well theyre around they are around you just have to keep moving things until you find what youre after she turned to look around and everything started to rustle and jingle im scared to touch anything you never know what you might bring down he smiled indicating a small sign in a wooden frame between the candles on the counter it said lovely to look at delightful to hold but if you break it dont worry its my own bloody fault for daring to run a business in such a grotty little hovel cool jane said impressed lucys got a bit of a thing about these really precious gift shops that have all this delicate stuff in precarious places then make you pay through the nose when you dislodge one with your elbow you said local history how local very local try up there he didnt seem to want to come out from behind the counter a roswellstyle alien face stared impassively from his black sweatshirt she reached up to a stack of volumes between stone bookends featuring a sort of gothic rottweiler with an apple in its mouth there he said that one pulling down a softbacked book she knocked over a stack of greeting cards displaying appley watercolours chaos here but he didnt come round the counter to help her pick them up its ok ill do it later the book she held was not very thick the black and white villages a short history jane flicked through it it seemed to be mainly photographs im trying to find some information about a guy called wil williams ah he said mmm right you know who i mean you wont find much in there so where would i find something he shrugged difficult this is my only hope i need it school essay well his accent wasnt local but there was an accent there a vaguely rural one its difficult you keep on saying that what was it with this guy he seemed harmless but he was definitely weird almost like he was scared of her problem is he said lucys not happy about the way the storys been handled doesnt think theyve got it right lucy has very definite ideas about things youll just get the miss devenish version yeah ok mum look jane said i dont need anything in any great depth i mean just who was wil williams i thought you were doing a school essay on him i her mind went fuzzy he smiled took off his glasses he wasnt as young as shed first thought that is he had a young face but there were deep little lines around his eyes hed be more like mums age really pity he was the vicar oh really when in the seventeenth century about something like that im not sure whether they actually called them vicars in those days but that was what he was see lucyd give you the whole bit but she takes saturday afternoons off when she can i dont know that much about it keep meaning to find out but at the end of the day i dont really think theres much known for certain its like one of those murky areas of history all kinds of atrocities in those days werent there atrocities but he was the minister of this church he didnt reply he seemed suddenly to have forgotten she was here he was staring through the window into the mews where colette cassidy still stood in her doorway and a bearded man was strolling by the man looked at colettes legs this church jane said you mean the village church excuse me oh shit the shop guy folded his fingers together and squeezed hard it was difficult to be sure in this light but jane thought hed gone pale he looked at her look you on your own well she felt uncomfortable found herself backing instinctively towards the door what i mean youre not with that bloke out there what the bearded man was standing in the middle of the mews about fifteen feet away he wore jeans and a denim shirt and those dark glasses that went all the way round he had his hands in his pockets and was gazing at the shop window he seemed a quite ordinary touristtype perhaps waiting for his wife why would you think i should know him ive never even seen him before the shop man had his glasses back on he didnt look cool any more he sort of jittered he bit his lip yeah right ok do me a favour er jane jane he shook his head in a wry youhavetolaugh kind of way then the hunted look was back jane could i ask you to mind the store right said little gomer parry through his cigarette that bit thats all yours vicar see shed given up correcting people when they called her vicar you couldnt really have people calling you priestincharge anyway could you gomer was pointing to a small meadow about two acres merrily reckoned sloping gently from one end of the churchyard down to the river now what we done the past couple o years gomer said is we mowed im end of july roundabout then we sells the bales to powell we could sell the ole grass standing let powell cut it isself but bein as how i got the gear wheres the point in loppin off the profits plus gomer parry agricultural and plant hire we does a tidy job and what do you charge gomer aye well gomer parry said bloody retired ent i cant charge nothing no more see as minnie his wife of four years never neglected to remind people gomer parry plant hire in the literal sense was no more which merrily reckoned accounted for gomers general air of depression but the running costs she said the maintenance of all that machinery ah does it good to get the ole things up and turnin all it is now is just a gomer struggled to cough up the contemptible word hobby she felt sorry for him apparently minnie had refused to marry him unless he promised to pass on the operational side of the business to his nephew nev and move these twenty miles back over the english border but as he kept on telling you he was only sixtyeight what was sixtyeight in the age of power steering could it really be that minnie hadnt realized that plant hire was part of his name part of who he was mabbe you could mention me to the ole feller sometime gomer said in passing like old oh right merrily nodded im sure he does notice these things all respect see but the way i sees it its a better thing all round if im out yere getting to grips with gods good earth than inside that ole church throwing everybody off key with my deplorable bloody singing mmm merrily said dubiously well er maybe go into that argument in more detail sometime i never argues with the clergy gomer said putting the lid on that one now your ditches as i kept pointin out to the reverend hayden them ditches is in a mess ent been cleared in my time back yere which is four years come october and theres all kinds o shit down there gomer led merrily along a crooked avenue of eighteenthcentury graves to where the churchyard met the powell orchard it was a raised circular churchyard partly bordered by a bramblecovered ditch about four feet deep get rid o this lot no big problem vicar however wise not to widen the ditch this side on account some of these ole gravesve slipped and slid a bit over the centuries like and you goes into that bit o bank you never quite knows whats gonner tumble out you get my meaning oh merrily imagined ancient bones rattling into the shovel of gomers jcb as for the other side well who knows vicar who knows who knows what she hitched up her cassock to bend down and peer into the ditch a rich musty smell rose up she looked across to the other side the nearest apple tree was a good twenty yards away further into the tangly orchard she was sure she recognized the twisted boughs of the apple tree man and couldnt suppress a shudder gomer followed her gaze they wont do that again vicar the wassailing no i suppose not funny thing though you wanner see the buds on im now on the merrily looked at gomer those ridiculous little round glasses and the oftenunlit cigarette like a babys dummy made it hard to take him seriously gonner be ablaze with blossom in a week or two that ole bugger youdve sworn hed given up makes you think dont it she was chilled i think id rather not think what did you mean just now when you said who knows about the other side of the ditch ah well you gotter ask yourself why the ole orchards still there see rod powell he ent a man to keep a worthless bit o scrub without theres a reason for it well a cider apples no use for nothin but cider specially them stunted little buggers and the powells ent made but their own in half a century rest of the farms beef and gomer growled battery chickens merrily who also disapproved of battery chickens kept quiet so you gotter ask yourself vicar whys he keep that ole orchard sentiment before the word was out merrily felt embarrassed superstition gomer tapped his nose them as dont believe superstition counts for much in the countryside no more ent never lived yere powells put in a bunch of new trees down the bottom end to please that cassidy but edgar wouldnt grub up this bit nor even scrat around too much in there on account of he knows and all his family knows that theres gomer paused took off his flat cap wild white hair erected itself the first unhallowed ground merrily thought she understood but she wasnt sure you dig up decently buried bones see well thats one thing you just puts em straight back but any bones the other side o that ditch now dont get me wrong vicar im not saying i goes for this ole toffee im just telling you the kind of superstition youll encounter if you sticks around these parts but the bones tother side thems the ones you dont wanner be diggin up you get my meaning on the other side of a curtain behind the counter was an iron spiral staircase leading up into what seemed like complete darkness apparently a loft without a window jane stuck her head through the curtain ok lol hes gone you sure the voice was hollow with jane was amazed and thrilled actual real fear it made her think again about the little crunch before the man had left jane yeah honest im certain gave him two minutes then i went to the end of the mews and he was talking to colette cassidy then he was getting into this pretty smart yellow sports car toyota he didnt see you following him not a chance his face appeared at the top of the spiral blinking from the dark full of suspicion and yeah anxiety definitely that the lines around his eyes deeper you know the cassidy girl only by sight he came down that means youre local he looked dismayed i am now jane said for my sins she was still feeling rather electrified this could be the most utterly bloody brilliant place shed ever lived best of all she felt in control shed saved this man from god knows what he owed her one so what exactly are we looking at here jane said loftily drugs huh he slumped back on the stool behind the counter shaking his head he looked drained as though hed spent the last few minutes on the lavatory pretty heavy listen putting on her cynical smile i might be local now mr robinson but ive been around like youre into that guy for some amount you cant afford and he wants his money what are we talking coke smack what jane said es whizz huh you can tell me oh god it was probably the last thing he felt like but he started to laugh who the hell are you dont change the subject my general feeling is that wasnt a very nice guy underneath all the charm and the florida tan and the really white teeth i can sense these things he buy anything he said he was looking for an old friend he described you puny little guy long hair glasses he said hed been to your house and asked around and somebody said theyd seen you with miss devenish and this is her shop so and you said i said i didnt know anybody called robinson which was true i said i couldnt think who he meant so hes like oh well he mightve changed got fatter lost his hair and im saying well in that case he could be any one of a dozen people thank you like i dont think he believed me that you werent here he said in this kind of knowing way that if i should just happen to come across you tell you hed be back and he kept like looking at the curtain as if he was wondering whether to thrust me aside and go in and drag you out god this was fun if not so much for mr robinson he say when hed be back nnnn what was his attitude like i said charming lovely white teeth capped i suppose he imports the stuff does he look mr robinson pulled hair out of his glasses he may be into drugs i wouldnt know we are not business associates hes what he said he was an old friend sort of if you think im that dumb jane said loftily youre spending too much time with the fairies hes just hard to get rid of you mustve had friends like that thats all it was no drugs sorry oh alarm doubled back across his face you say he talked to the cassidy girl briefly like he was asking her the way or something look seriously jane you listening if you see him again keep out of his way yeah will you promise me that jane you want me to come and tell you if i see him again no just stay out of his way tell colette too no dont itd just get her interested leave it please forget it happened fatal instruction bit bloody oneway this if you ask me jane said suppose i give you the dirt on wil williams oh sure jane said change the subject its one l by the way lol said if you didnt know wil the welsh way all right then jane said wil williams one l and it better be good it wasnt that good for him but i expect youll find it good its spooky here have a notebook to write it down lol reached up flipped one from a rack behind him a quick nervous thing as though he was giving his hands something to do to stop them shaking he laid the notebook on the counter it had an apple on the front ill pay for it jane said primly and what should i do about this opening her left hand over the counter a tiny fairy looked up stricken from her palm its applestreaked gossamer wings in shreds its matchstick spine snapped your old friend knocked it off its perch crunched it under his shoe on his way out pretended not to notice but i think he did both lols hands were behind his back now he bit his lip after the lady vicar had gone gomer parry was down the ditch dragging some of the brambles away sizing up the job when the shadow fell across him what dyou think of her gomer the hooked nose under the hat like some old eagle she was the vicar ers all right lucy nice little girl dont throw the ole feller in your face the whole time nice little girl pshaw you know what im asking gomer is she strong er gonner need tbe lucy shes a woman never thought to hear that comin from you because you dont know what i mean do you gomer tried to climb out of the ditch slipped back and she offered him a hand and pulled him out easy as this hydraulic winch he used to have what did you talk about when you were looking out to the orchard ah watching them was she this an that gomer said number of buds in the apple tree man kind of thing the apple tree man face near black against the light heaven save us theres no such damn thing as the apple tree man not here thats somersetshire lore ours is a different tradition altogether you should know that no apple tree man no guns well pardon me gomer said for bein just a humble planthire operative its important gomer these clowns move in with their twisted interpretations and we wake up one day and were living in a different place a fantasy village its what happens when you get too much change too quickly this was a terribly poor place when i was a child miserable farm wages children still in rags now its damn near the richest village in the county looks beautifully authentic but its a sham and do they care the locals whats left of them do they hell moneys money gomer said winding her up see where this was heading shops doin well plenty jobs for plumbers builders carpenters the ole rural craftsmen why should they care its false wealth you know that cider was ledwardines wealth and it dried up long ago but hang on yere lucy if this mr cassidys out to revive it in his dilettante touristy fashion gomer studied her shed never been what youd call pretty but there was a time when she couldve had her pick of men and from what hed heard shed picked a fair few in her time and thrown them back a bit more outofbreath than they mightve reckoned on but time passed well he fished out his ciggy i wouldnt know what that means dillywhatever me bein just an illeducated planthire man like but it do strike me lucy as youre bein a bit of a wosname in the manger cause you dint think of it yourself you dont wannit to work same with the festival you feels what the word sidelined lucy devenish blinked and brought a hand to her face and for one terrible moment gomer feared she had a tear coming but she used the hand to straighten her hat what i feel gomer she said especially when i stand on this side of the churchyard is a certain fear for your nice little girl cold in the house of god merrily walked softly into the darkening church still hesitant still unsure do you know what i couldnt do her mother had said a couple of years ago i couldnt go into one of those old churches alone at night spooky anybody could be in there tramps rapists thats another reason why it isnt a job for a woman in my view least of my problems merrily thought still halfafraid that she would be met by a chill of hostility a cavernous yawn of disapproval it had all been too easy so far respectable congregations all right curiosity novelty value sermons which seemed to write themselves even in the hotel room at midnight no dark looks in the street no suspicious stares and not even inducted yet apart from reducing the number of hymns she hadnt even started on what she planned although she didnt to be honest know what form it was going to take yet it still didnt feel quite real this was the problem staying in a hotel even when you had to drive into hereford at night to use the launderette created this illusion of a holiday perhaps when they moved into the vicarage reality would set in she wasnt looking forward to that the vicarage was too big to be a home it scared her far more than the church it was a dull evening now the stained glass fading to opaque her hand slid over the stone up to the light switches even the air in here was temperate the brassbracketed lamps came on in the soft amber the walls themselves glistened with antiquity yet not in an austere forbidding way the stones were mellow and softly encrusted like country honey the evening visit had become a kind of ritual her trainers pattered on the flagged floor of the nave her footsteps made no echoes the acoustics as alf had said were warm and tight walking on bones several of the flags were memorial stones dating back three four centuries francis mott d john jenkyn whose dates were worn away into the sandstone like the lower half of the indented skull in the centre of jenkyns flag they didnt dress it up in those days couldnt be more different from the last place in liverpool a warehouse scuffed kicked about a city church of smutted brick with no graveyard only rusty railings the building couldnt have been less important it was what you did there what you brought to it this church was important medieval grade one listed beautiful beyond price even to people with no faith and it felt friendly even to a woman it enfolded you hey dont knock it merrily faced the altar through the roodscreen out of which row upon row of apple shapes were carved closed her eyes and saw a deep dark velvety blue feeling at once guilty about this habitual need for reassurance mum that you merrilys eyes opened in here janes head appeared round the door hair as dark as the oak youre not doing anything private like what for heavens sake you know like doing the rounds locking up merrily stood with hands on hips getting a bit fed up with this attitude the kid treating god like a stepfather was it always going to be like this until she left home and old mum in the dog collar became a figure of affectionate amusement got him mum well dont leave him on the mat who are we talking about wil wil williams oh one l he was welsh anything wrong with that in the seventeenth century a lot wrong with him jane said in the seventeenth century though i dont think it wouldve worried me well thats wonderful merrily said glumly thats all we need isnt it they sat side by side in the front pew theres no evidence he was jane picked at the thick varnish on the prayerbook ledge not what youd call real evidence i mean people were always getting stitched up in those days but not vicars believe me theres very little history of this kind of thing inside the anglican church very little of interest has ever gone on inside the anglican church jane grinned still they havent had you very long yet have they ha merrily looked up at the norman arch so plain so curiously modernlooking all right why hadnt we heard about this jane why isnt it a celebrated case like salem massachusetts because he was only one bloke i suppose besides it never came to a trial according to lol lol guy in the shop very nervous you make everyone nervous where was miss devenish day off look its all straight up jane pulled a little notepad from her jacket date that makes it after the reformation right restoration whatever after cromwell was that charles the seconds time guy in the curly wig anyway in rural areas they were still very reactionary and always on the lookout for witches to persecute poor old wil put himself well in the frame meaning ill tell it in sequence so i get it right hed been vicar a couple of years ok got the job possibly on the recommendation of the rector of credenhill the poet guy thomas traherne yeah they were mates went for long nature rambles together lol reckons discussing ethics and stuff only then traherne gets a new job near london and when he leaves theres nobody to stick up for little wil and somebody like dropped him in it bigtime merrily smiled janes style of historical narration wasnt exactly textbook but it did confer a certain immediacy see from what i can make out wil williams was serious serious totty like really greatlooking in a poetic ethereal unworldly sort of way strawberryblond unblemished lovely smile women swooning in the aisle kind of scenario merrily frowned youre not embellishing this by any chance because if you drop me in it at this meeting swear to god and its significant because this could be one reason he wasnt all that popular with the men i mean the macho hunting types who ran things lol reckons parsons in those days were expected to ride with the hunt drink too much port get gout sure go on jane turned over a page in her notebook following the lines with a forefinger shed never quite outgrown that very superstitious times ok so when you get reports of strange phenomena i mean you know sounds like complete rubbish total crap today but people didnt take too much convincing back then everything was an omen you only had to start a rumour and theyd all be screaming for blood what sort of phenomena im coming to it most of it was centred on the orchard just over the wall powells orchard mum you shivered i didnt you bloody did and now youve lied in the house of god merrily growled it gets cold in the house of god after a while just shut up and get on with it jane peered at her notes something about hogs oh yeah the orchard belonged to the church back then they produced quite a lot of cider in those days apparently and the vicars stipend included what he could make out of it which was expected to be about fifty hogsheads of cider every year is that a lot i have no idea what happened in the orchard lights jane said lights and music parish barbecue strains of eerie music in the night janes voice dropped to a sepulchral whisper which wasnt actually all that funny in the vast lamplit church fiddle music like for dancing little glowing bobbing lights among the apple trees wil williams dancing with demons i see one guy actually did see or claimed to lol couldnt remember his name but he was a local miller or tanner one of these quaint rustic professions one dark night he was coming back from the pub probably well pissed and he strayed from the track and wound up in the orchard or was kind of lured towards the lights and the music couldnt help himself whats that noise mum bats probably vampire bats dont try it on jane ive got approximately an hour before the meeting what happened to the miller private screening of the seventeenthcentury equivalent of a dirty video wil williams stark naked dancing around an unearthly light with these silvery shapely demons or sprites as he called them how very tawdry obviously gave the miller a hell of a hardon jane sorry sorry god no naturally the miller claimed to have been shocked and terrified and he spread it all round the village and word reached the sheriff of hereford and the bishop of hereford and eventually a bunch of them went round to the vicarage all official our vicarage presumably its old enough isnt it so all these sanctimonious gits arrive on wils doorstep to ask for an explanation or arrest him for devilworship or whatever the charge was but there was no answer when they knocked on the door so they came here merrily didnt move resisted the urge to look around it was only a story it was all in the past and yet she was apprehensive she didnt want there to have been some sort of thomas a becket death scene at the altar the honeyed stones stained with innocent blood some setpiece slaughter shed have to try not to think about when she arrived to take communion on drab winter mornings somebody kicked open the door jane said this time merrily did look towards the main oak door imagining the group of pofaced guardians of the law striding righteously past the font bearded men with swords halfdrawn but the church was empty jane whispered wil williams wasnt here merrily sighed the kid really knew how to spin out a story he was outside jane said in the orchard all dressed up for them in his full vestments and things he was expecting them presumably jane said this is the suspense bit is it you could say that jane gave half a smile he was hanging from an apple tree oh god in his richest vestments jane said dreamily poor wil dangling there all aglow on a bright sunny morning jane nodded to signify the end and closed the notebook with a snap raising her gaze to the vaulted ceiling so that the amber lights were reflected in her big dark eyes terrific merrily blacked out a flashimage of the halfhead of old edgar powell hanging like a leftover christmas bauble on the apple tree man i hate that bloody orchard funny thing though gomer parry had said you wanner see the buds on im now so the orchard used to belong to the church although it was not of course holy ground and yet close the first unhallowed ground gomer had called it suicides were invariably buried in unhallowed ground he knew theyd be coming for him jane said and he couldnt face it the trial the abuse and everything poor sensitive soul he was only about twentyfive obviously terrence cassidy had said its not something the village nowadays is particularly proud of although i suppose it has its tourist possibilities in a lurid sort of way so they buried him where he died in the orchard with only an apple tree to mark his grave and as apple trees dont live very long nobody knows where it is now merrily recalled what gomer had had to say about the reasons the powells had never grubbed up their unproductive orchard the bones tother side thems the ones you dont wanner be diggin up you get my meaning unless you were a distinguished playwright for whom no bones could be buried too deep she watched janes gaze travelling around the church with a new interest the first time in fact that the kid had displayed any interest it would have a history now a mystery a romance in that ageblackened pulpit had stood the doomed wil williams serious totty with the sunlight in his strawberryblond hair heavy stuff huh jane said well satisfied nothing unhealthy about this wil williams was as remote and unreachable as the lead singer of some boy band in sugar magazine merrily remembered the stage when she would fall in love with the ludicrous heroes of fantasy novels princes with magic swords it was a phase a safe phase which wouldnt last long not long enough real boys real men would be in the picture all too soon sure merrily said heavy stuff and felt a pang of impending loss the sandstone walls still had an oldgold glaze in the lamplight but when she stood up she was sensing an end to the honeymoon period well she said thanks flower dirty video i beg your pardon terrence cassidy said irritated old cider dermot child the musician thumped the table thats what we should call it i dont understand the entire event the festival old ciderrrrrr resonates everything dermot child said seemed to resonate he was a plump friar of a man who without being obviously irish scottish or welsh indeed his accent was closer to oxford vibrated with an emotional fervour you could only describe as celtic merrily quite liked him in the absence of the parish secretary who was also the treasurer of the womens institute as distinct from the womens group formed by newcomers and was attending some sort of wi convention shed agreed to take the minutes of this hastily called meeting she wrote down old cider explain shall i mr chairman child leaned over onto an elbow making a determined fist as if prepared to armwrestle cassidy into submission please do cassidy said resignation soaked in acid it was after all his festival merrily thought his idea his concept eccentrics like child should content themselves with being occasionally amusing merrily smiled child caught her eye winked outside a small motorcycle was being expertly skidded on the cinders under the open window councillor garrod powell moved swiftly to the door give it a rest kirk they heard him shout mildly else be round to see your dad boy it was getting rather dim in the village hall screened from the sunset by two huge oaks on the way back to his chair councillor powell lifted a hand over the panel of metal switches to the left of the tai chi group noticeboard leave it a moment would you rod child said powell tall and trim and oddly dignified shrugged and went back to his seat between cassidy and a moodylooking james bulldavies it begins with crying the mare said child youd know all about that rod they used to do that on your farm sure to powell said uncertainly harvest custom theyd leave the last of the corn standing separating it out into four bundles sticking up like legs the mare you see then theyd tie these together at the top to make a single sheaf step a few paces back and hurl their hooks and sickles at it to try and cut off the ears of corn sounds rather pointless to me observed terrence cassidy apparently failing to recall his role as principal organizer of the infamous twelfth night event in which shotguns were discharged into an apple tree dermot child ignored him be interesting to arrange a contest in one of the fields see how many chaps can still do it somehow merrily couldnt quite imagine lloyd and garrod powell plus sundry seasonal labourers abandoning the combine harvester to waste a valuable daylight hour attempting to shave a sheaf with tossed sickles however child said this was really a preamble on this and other occasions the ritual would invariably conclude with mugs of cider all round now this would be preceded by all the chaps gathering into a circle and intoning abruptly he pushed back his chair stood up filled his lungs and with his fingertips pressed into the tabletop bellowed in a lugubrious bass auld ciderrrrrrrrrrrrr rolling and dragging out the word on a single note in a deep rumbling drone a herefordshire mantra merrily was startled how eerily primeval it seemed in the purply gloom you felt that if several of them were doing it the walls would start to peel and crumble no one spoke again until child sat down aye rod powell said then into the silence i remember he moved to the switches again and bluish fluorescent tubes began to flicker merrily recalled as the lights revealed the sickly sixties pinkbrick interior of ledwardines only real architectural embarrassment what gomer parry had said about even the mercenary powells being far from immune from superstition dermot child was patting his chest dont know about the rest of you but i find that absolutely thrilling bunch of working men using their lungs and their throats to make contact with the earth itself setting up this marvellously powerful vibration ciderrrrr the very roots of music sort of vibration we need for this festival said james bulldavies thats what youre saying bulldavies was wearing a tan gilet over a checked shirt with a cravat until you actually lived in a place like this merrily thought the idea of there still being a kind of uniform for local squires would strike you as a joke but it was a fact that people like james did not wear jeans they did not wear tshirts and they would never under any circumstances be seen in a baseball cap even the right way round you know child leaned across the table youd be absolutely perfect for it james your voice has the timbre cassidy scowled but said nothing probably not caring to emphasize his own reedy lack of timbre merrily wanted to giggle james bulldavies caught her eye and looked away at once merrily stifled a sigh how long would it take for this guy to come to terms with a woman priest answer he never would it wasnt the thing im planning you see child announced a new choral work for which this will be the focus old cider im looking for voices local voices i want to work with the voices i want the composition to arise from those voices from the earth the red earth of ledwardine any thoughts rod we did have a male voice choir mr child some years back folded through lack of support a few of the ole boys still around though sure to be child beamed vicar i could put the word around the church choir merrily said see if we can get a few volunteers good girl child reached over and patted her hand lingering perhaps a little too long on her fingers so whats the committees view on using old cider as the name of the festival terry terrence cassidy said tightly well we obviously cant make a decision tonight who says we cant look i suggest you submit a paper on the proposal and well circulate it before the next meeting hell fire boomed bulldavies only a question of a bloody title i propose chairman that we take a vote on whether to decide it here and now in fact not to prolong the issue i formally propose the ledwardine festival be known hereafter as the old cider festival seconded child said quickly now just a minute terrence cassidys thin face was flushed what this means is that the entire festival would effectively be promoting your as yet unwritten choral work or my choral work for heavens sake child threw up his arms would be supporting the concept of the festival proposition on the table gentlemen bulldavies made a grimace of a smile and ah lady chairman my understanding of the rules of the committee game is that what you do next is ask if there are any amendments cassidy folded his arms obstinately i think we should wait until richard coffey arrives his plays going to be the thing that gets us national publicity and he might chap knew it was eight pm didnt he bulldavies rumbled cant wait all night move progress all right cassidy very red now very well if thats what you want so be it looking around for an amendment in vain even to merrily the idea sounded simple and unpretentious reflected the identity of the village and would look good on posters why waste time old cider was passed by three votes to one councillor garrod powell as the only official local politician there did what local politicians did best and abstained hostile looks were exchanged oh god merrily thought its going to be that sort of committee she was suddenly depressed was this how alf hayden had started out dutifully attending all the bitchy little meetings wondering how god wanted him to vote wondering after a while if god was really concerned one way or the other village life the cradle of society or just a shallow pond across which jesus surely would never have bothered to walk tyres crunched the cinders under the window richard i imagine cassidy said as if it didnt matter any more as if hed washed his hands of them all merrily had hoped coffey wouldnt show after what jane had told her she needed a bit of time to think about wil williams minister of this parish to she needed to consult a few people if james bulldavies was in a decisionmaking mood tonight she might be pushed into a corner on the issue of whether the local church should be actively involved and allow its premises to be used for the resurrection of a seventeenthcentury minister apparently hounded to death by his own parishioners her first dicey decision sitting directly beneath the no smoking sign merrily ached for a cigarette back at the black swan jane watched national lottery live on tv alone in the tiny halfpanelled residents lounge and almost began to understand why her mother had gone into the church the bloody lottery look at them all whooping and squealing with every number drawn was this what the human race had come to naked lust for money mob greed greed well of course dad had been greedy no getting around that poor bloody stupid dad for nearly two years shed kept a secret picture of the wreckage secret from mum that is mum having tried to shield jane at eleven from the worst of it no local papers had been allowed into the house that week but dads car was such a horrific mess like a screwedup ball of newspaper you could hardly tell it had ever been a car that the picture had made it to a couple of the nationals shed cut it out hid it under her mattress the picture froze her up inside but shed forced herself to bring it out every night before she went to bed and shed stare at it and stare at it knowing he was still in there when the photo was taken like shreds of meat in a burger dadburger with added karen fragments of dad and karen all mixed up intermingled flesh around flesh bone to bone tissue on tissue sinews intertwined more together than they could ever have been in life more intimate than sean barrow had ever been with mum karen had him totally at the end and for ever and ever and it would be convenient to think that this was what had driven mum into the arms of god only it wasnt that easy it had been coming on for quite a while before that the impenetrable paperbacks the long walks the tedium of evensong the voluntary work at the christian youth centre creepy ah here you are a powerful whiff of musk made jane spin round in her chair and there in the doorway was the glamorous ms colette cassidy in her teenagehooker dress glancing at the tv smirking yeah they said you were an intellectual want to come for a drink more than my lifes worth jane said frankly she hadnt been mumless in a bar since the infamous runningaway incident in birmingham since the creepy counselling session i didnt mean here colette said we could go down the ox jane was reluctantly impressed the ox was this tiny seedy pub flickering with gaming machines on the corner of the alleyway leading to the public toilets this was a test wasnt it your mother isnt going to get away from that meeting this side of eleven colette said my old manll see to that gives you a couple of hours at least i dont know jane was thinking fast too fast feeling flustered street cred on the line in a big way here colette tossed back her darkbrown hair like an impatient thoroughbred pony she had this scintillating diamond nosestud could you get away with that at the cathedral school or was it a weekend thing must be a pain to keep taking it in and out worthwhile pain though and if youre worrying about word getting back to the reverend mummy colette said smoothly i think its fair to say that the clientele of the ox arent known for religion especially on the morning after saturday night i suppose you got it colette smiled her sophisticated smile fifteen going on thirtyfive its a bit close to the village hall live dangerously colette said jane stood up no option am i late not actually sounding as if he cared one way or the other the playwright slid his briefcase across the table shed his jacket spidered into a seat a single motion richard coffey was all motion not at all terrence cassidy gathered his papers and his dignity to his chest yes james bulldavies snapped this was unnecessary merrily thought uncalled for but nobody appeared to have heard him the lord of the manor had been eclipsed there was a powerful new energy in the meeting er richard cassidy halfrose id like to introduce our new vicar merrily watkins charming name richard coffey said merrily had never seen him up close before he was she thought almost shocking had the taut muscular body of an ageing balletdancer at the stage where staying fit was becoming painfully obsessive his lean pocked face vibrated with colours and textures divided into pulsing segments like a portrait by lucien freud or francis bacon full of life and personal history a history you would have to conclude even if you hadnt heard the stories of sensual excess she was fascinated and wasnt aware of how long shed been staring at him until the vacuum of silence around them was popped by a discreet chairmans cough mustnt waste time terrence cassidy tapped his pen on the table you all know richard as one of our most celebrated contemporary writers for both the stage and television hes now living part of the time at upper hall lodge and naturally were glad he chose our village as his weekend retreat my feeling now is that it chose me coffey purred diffidently merrily saw james bulldavies gazing at the ceiling envisaged words in a bubble above his head tiresome bloody poofter something like that hed be seeing rather more of coffey than any of them upper hall lodge was of course at the bottom of his drive and used to be occupied by generations of bulldavies gamekeepers cassidy nodded im sure thats true and were all delighted at richards plan to use the ledwardine festival to premiere a major new drama illuminating a rather rather unfortunate episode in our history unfortunate but but fascinating ah at the moment apart from its general theme i know no more than any of you about the project which is why i asked richard along tonight to tell us as much as he feels able to divulge at this stage of the ah creative process thank you mr chairman coffey fluidly opening his briefcase and extracting a file of papers i should however say from the outset that the prospect of staging a complete production with a full cast here in late summer early autumn is not really a viable one but i cassidy fought for balance the rug sliding from under him merrily saw dermot child perk up however calm yourself terrence what i do have in mind will be very much an event in itself a recreation in the original setting which i think could be absolutely electric will not only i believe lay a ghost clear the name of a good man but effectively solve a threehundredyearold mystery oh is that all bulldavies said sourly yes it would upset him having his villages history mined for nuggets of controversy by the celebrated interloper whod turned his onetime gamekeepers lodge into a lessthandiscreet second home had he merrily wondered seen the crystal dungeon richard coffeys controversial tv play about a reclusive earls incestuous relationship with his sister and their persecution by an evil butler coffey didnt even seem to recognize the big tweedy person as the owner of the rundown heap at the top of the drive anyway he said smoothly i propose to outline my idea and then leave you to discuss it amongst yourselves if it bothers any of you im sure one of the other villages no cassidy looked helpless i mean tell us richard tell us wil williams coffey slid on halfglasses spoke with precision a man with nothing to prove and no time to waste on dissent i take it were all conversant with the brief facts merrily was able to nod thank god for jane williams became rector here in the late s we dont know how old he was when he arrived we think late twenties his friend and neighbouring cleric the poet traherne in a letter to his brother philip describes williams as fairhaired youthful in appearance and exuding a kind of perpetual joy traherne james bulldavies was scornful chap never had a bad word for anybody walked around in bloody cloudcuckooland half the time wrote as if he was on something one could argue at some length with you there but this is not the occasion i think no one would deny williams was a man who loved the area and exulted in his ministry bulldavies shrugged impatiently merrily wrote down traherne feeling a bit ignorant traherne had been mentioned briefly at college as a major literary precursor of wordsworth and blake and one of the greatest christian mystical poets but she actually didnt know that much about him or his work fairly reprehensible really considering hed been rector of a parish not ten miles away as i understand it dermot child said it was traherne who more or less secured the ledwardine post for williams then buggered off its never been proved that traherne had a hand in the appointment of williams said coffey although as you say it is a theory certainly the two knew each other before williams came here possibly at oxford you say buggered off traherne certainly appears to have lost touch with williams when he left the area in we know of no correspondence and it seems unlikely that traherne knew of the subsequent persecution perhaps because williams made a point of not telling him not telling him hed been accused of bloody witchcraft child leaned over the table hands clasped together mans life was on the line surely he needed all the support he could get traherne had good contacts by then chaplain to this fellow er sir orlando bridgeman onetime lord keeper of the great seal for charles the second yes traherne could perhaps have helped him had the charges quashed but williams didnt seek trahernes help why i see that question as crucial merrily said tentatively it seems incredible to me that a minister of the church could find himself accused of witchcraft even then i know that was a fairly paranoid period but coffey glanced at her twitched a smile merrily said youre going to say he was fitted up arent you mr coffey absolutely on what basis bulldavies said sullenly well coffey eased from his case a photocopied document lets look at the evidence in september williams was accused of consorting with sprites what do we mean by sprites silence spirits of the dead child offered finally evil spirits i think not coffey said the only specific evidence handed down to us is a statement by one silas monks a tanner the only evidence that remains bulldavies said his eyes were hard who tells us that while returning to his holding from the inn one night he saw williams in the orchard next to the churchyard cavorting under the fruitladen trees with an unspecified number of vague and slender persons whose forms shone palely in the moonlight he paused presumably to allow everyone to draw individual conclusions about this merrily thought of what jane had said about the seventeenthcentury equivalent of a dirty video and a slippery silvery image floated into her mind she felt herself blush well good for him dermot child laughed lightly as if to dispel what merrily sensed was a thickening fog of discomfort around the table but it wasnt was it coffey said on the alleged evidence of this presumably drunken tanner and the resulting rumours wil williams was visited and formally accused of witchcraft by a delegation including a justice of the peace the local schoolmaster and ah a chairs metal legs scraped on the wooden floor james bulldavies stood up eyes reduced to black slits in a big darkened face im leaving ill be in the pub call me back when youve heard enough of this shit james cassidy coming to his feet in a panic bulldavies didnt look back the afterhours social club its like ive walked in on her and shes having sex or something you know im like ooops sorry backing out of the room kind of all gooeyedup inside and then she tries to talk to me about it which makes it worse jane was sweating she drank some more cider to cool herself down the cider was quite sweet and very soft never had it before amazing you could actually taste apples cant handle it she said talk about a cross to bear just embarrasses me to bits it was really dark in the ox dark like a church and hazy so that the red and green and orange lights in the old slotmachines hung in the gloom like the small panes in the corners of stainedglass windows which was what had reminded her brought up the awful image of mum wearing out the knees of her tights colette was unimpressed at least prayings quiet my mother shouts a lot now shouts at my old man shouts at the cleaner and the cook and the waitresses i dont mean bollocking them just being loud asserting herself its one of her new words assertive she went on this course for it kind of menopause training when you start to lose your looks make sure you get on top in bed kind of stuff jane didnt contest the issue everybody knew colettes parents were a firstdivision pain you just have to accept colette said that one way or the other theyre going to embarrass the piss out of you its what theyre for at least yours is youngish and paranoid shes convinced im gonna make the same mistake like get pregnant before im twenty doesnt realize how everythings changed like with condoms her day you had to sneak into chemist shops wearing a false beard or something now theyre hanging on christmas trees anyway im never going to get pregnant nobody with any sense of responsibility these days wants to dump another kid on the heap you should get her to put a condom machine in the church porch colette said thats where it all happens yeah and have them handed out with the prayer books and they both broke up laughing and clutched at each other and jane thought hey this woman is really ok you should never judge people by their parents another one colette stood up you got anymore money jane found the last fiver in her jacket pocket colette was getting the drinks because she looked the older at least twentyfive although she was only a few months older than jane coming up to sixteen and able to do it legally be no fun any more she reckoned woman of the world and one day jane leaned back against the scratched oak settle which was kind of like a pew feeling pretty dreamy actually but aware that some of the guys at the bar were sneaking little glances at her even if one of them was this oozing gumboil dean wall a year over her at the high school dean and his mates played threecardbrag on the bus big men when theyd sidled over once tonight colette had taken no crap at all told them to piss off back to their homework and theyd slunk off laughing although you could tell they were really feeling stupid one of them said something to colette now as she turned away from the bar with the drinks white dress rucked up to her thighs and she turned and raised a contemptuous middle finger and the boy laughed but he was blushing too under the sweat virgins colette put down their ciders got virgin written all over them except for the ones whove done it with sheep thats not really true is it jane drank some cider i mean you hear all these jokes of course its true this is the country you only have to look at that dean wall his eyes all wide apart even looks like a sheep maybe his mother was a sheep jane looked over at dean wall and his eyes were actually quite a long way apart and also his upper lip seemed to overhang the other one like a sheeps did she spluttered over her drink couldnt remember how many theyd had must be the fourth good job it was only sweet cider she mopped her mouth and then the table with her handkerchief the table seemed quite a long way below her and wobbling and she kept missing the puddles she remembered something important hey what did that bloke say to you this afternoon what bloke in the sports car oh yeah right not bad was he bit old he just said was it too late to get some lunch and i said it was and he said maybe hed come back for dinner would i be there the way guys do what were you doing with little lol oh just like checking out the shop weird sad lols megasad lucy doesnt need anybody to look after the shop on a saturday shes just trying to bring him out introduce him into the community gives him nice poetry to read huh like with mental patients they dont lock them away any more they let them out on the streets the way there used to be village idiots youre saying hes mental sort of he had a breakdown actually he used to be a sort of pop star way back well very minor i mean like tiny pop star like he was in this band and he wrote songs for other people like what i dont know do i its way back im not interested i only listen to dance music whyd he have a breakdown i dont know he lost his girlfriend but im not sure whether that was before or after or maybe the reason she walked out on him they never looked right together she was taller than lol for a start and then she left him for oh in fact for him colette nodded towards a big guy in a tweed jacket with leather patches and khakicoloured trousers jane recognized him at once course she did why it was it was jesus what was up with her james colette said the anachronism hey anachronism not bad after six glasses six what bulldavies hes this kind of throwback family used to be lords of the manor they say hes got a seventeeninch what maybe it was seven oh shit hes on the bloody festival committee isnt he jane blinked blankly means theyre out jane yes got it committeemeeting over reverend mumsie on the loose god wazza time where was the clock didnt seem to have one at the ox hadnt been here that long had they then again it seemed like hours days oh shit this is the problem when you have to share a suite with your mother cant sneak in cant sneak out wed berrer go finish your drink first you paid for it jane didnt really feel like it but at least it was only cider and went down quite easily trouble was that when she stood up she couldnt well couldnt stay up sank back into the settle and didnt want to move again all the little red and green and orange lights dancing like the fairies on wires in ledwardine lore oh no colette said i cant believe it wassup over the other side of the bar she saw dean wall and his mates nudging each other in a kind of soupy haze colette wore a big icecream grin you are completely pissed im not you cant get pished on cider i cant believe it you poor little sod come on janey well make a discreet exit just like hold on to my arm jane raised herself up again and colette threw a surprisingly capable arm around her waist she was already a good mate colette you needed a good mate in a new place dont look at jimmy bull jane dont look at anybody and for christs sake dont throw up on me silence hung over the four of them for quite a while the festival chairman the musician the councillor the new vicar well garrod powell said slowly if he wasnt a witch what was he he looked genuinely puzzled richard coffey opened out his hands i shall let you deliberate at your leisure suspect im overdue for an early night country air rather hits one after a couple of weeks in town id ask you of course to keep the details to yourselves until were ready for the publicity of course thank you for coming richard cassidys face was glazed ill call you tomorrow if i may make it monday of course well dermot child said when they heard coffeys tyres spinning brusquely on the gravel its quite funny really is it cassidy said weakly covering his eyes with the fingers of both hands is it funny dermot i dont think it is i think its going to cause a lot of trouble i think its going to split the village and i dont see what we can do about it james bulldavies had not returned perhaps merrily thought that was as well he could of course be right she said hesitantly about wil williams it makes a lot of sense it makes perfect sense dermot said but it doesnt make it into a happier story with which to climax the festival and put ledwardine on the national tourism map i suppose it might become more of a a sort of shrine to a certain kind of martyr if you see what i mean and how would the church take that vicar merrily shrugged uncertainly these days no problem i suppose its politically correct plus it removes the ancient stain of satanism or whatever just just councillor garrod powell beat a small agitated tattoo on the tabletop just let me get this absolutely right what our friend mr coffey is suggesting is that he uses the church for a performance featuring his companion mr stephen stefan alder rod cassidy said through his fingers alder as williams will appear in the pulpit before a capacity congregation to formally defend himself against the charges of witchcraft levelled by his parishioners the delegation of local bigwigs will lay out the various charges one by one dermot child said witnesses will be called including the drunken tanner silas monk monks and williams will reject all the accusations of consorting with sprites giving the simple explanation that although he is a fully committed christian and renounces the devil and all his works he is also a homosexual said councillor powell his voice was flat thats right is it child sighed with mischievous pleasure yes it is rod councillor powell thought about this for nearly half a minute before he said so what this plays gonner be implying is that the people of our village thats our ancestors our ancestors not mr coffeys ancestors drove this young man to his death in a frenzy of postrestoration queerbashing child said also i wasnt entirely sure about this but the impression i gathered was that the slender persons shining palely in the moonlight will turn out to have been not necessarily local youths corrupted by williams as much as careful cassidy said sorry did i mean converted not so much having been converted by williams as having conspired together to display their bodies in his churchyard thus tormenting the poor bloke beyond the point of human endurance until he chased them into what is now your orchard rod and what i thought powells face had closed right up i think ive heard enough taking a stand at last from which hed not be swayed of course merrily realized he was a magistrate if it was happening today hed be in that stern delegation of local bigwigs and i would have to say as your elected local government representative that in my view this is a very sick idea gonner rake up stuff as shouldnt be raked up idea being the operative word rod child said coffeys using the williams story to make a political point in the crucible arthur miller employed the salem witch trials as a parable reflecting mccarfhyism coffeys turning wil williams into a gay icon theres really no evidence at all that williams was gay merrilys liberal instincts began to nudge her youd rather he was a devilworshipper dermot child regarded her with a lopsided smile i do believe youre starting to smoulder vicar merrily scowled what i would rather rod powell was on his feet he made quite a distinguished figure the only one of them in a suit and tie is that this whole damn business went away well it wont cassidy said so lets not get it out of proportion at the end of the day were being given the opportunity to present a significant work of art by a distinguished writer with an axe to grind mr chairman rod powell thumped the table an axe to grind well perhaps but isnt that what worthwhile art is all about then let him grind it somewhere else sir not in our church i rather think thats up to the church itself to decide dont you they all turned to merrily hey dont look at me im only the vicar ill have to consult somebody and your conscience mrs watkins rod powells voice was low and quiet but somehow carried all the resonant menace of dermots auld ciderrrrr the village hall went ominously quiet after this until terrence cassidy said gently merrily i rather think you may find at the end of the day that this will be your decision well thank you mr chairman how was she supposed to react come over all spiritual and lofty tell them shed pray for guidance and hope theyd all do the same garrod powell looked distant terrence cassidy anguished dermot child gave his vicar a sympathetic smile but his eyes were bright with anarchic glee er merrily reached for her bag anybody mind if i have a cigarette before colette pushed her out of the pub door jane glanced over her shoulder and saw the slug dean wall and his mates frantically gulping down their lagers shit colette said move you silly cow listen when we get outside we go right got that janes legs felt like somebody elses legs jane you listening to me im not dragging you up the street past all the houses those lowlifesll be trailing after us making smart remarks and itll be all round the village before breakfast and youll never get out at night again legless what leg all the times shed heard the term and never once thought about what it really meant and now she knew less im leglesh it was suddenly the funniest expression shed ever heard jesus wept said colette the spring night air was lovely and warm softly lit by a wroughtiron lamp over the pub entrance and overlooked by crooked black and white gableends the cobbled alley was intimate and storybook romantic ledwardine by night wonderful jane stood there gazing up at the stars feeling suddenly amazingly more absolutely at home than shed felt anywhere theyd ever lived and that was a lot of places another lantern hung across the entrance of the alleyway orangey alluring and she glided towards it not that way right colette tugging her back across the cobbles follow your nose meaning the horrible acidy pong from the public toilets at the end of the alleyway the proximity of the dirtybrick toiletblock spoiled the idyll and the smell killed the atmosphere stone dead obstinately jane turned her back on it why cant we go shut up colettes hand came down over janes mouth with a slap theyre coming out jane was shocked into silence she swallowed feeling unsteady inside colette took the hand away from her mouth and used it to haul her past the cracked gents sign up some steps on which jane stumbled and then it was soft underfoot and suddenly really dark the old bowling green all right colette said we cut across here over to the footpath round by the churchyard out of the church close and were back on the square ingeniush jane said thickly she looked up the sky was brilliant the stars huge and blotchy like van gogh stars actually everything was bigger and blotchier all right cocky voice from just a few yards behind them need any help do we ladies shit colette pulled jane across the grass duck branches grazing her head not a word colette tugged her down behind the trees she fell back into the grass lovely and soft at first closed her eyes and everything turned into a big waltzing fairground ride which wasnt so pleasant so she opened her eyes and sat up feeling kind of damp and clammy and wishing she was in bed in the black swan you all right girls danny gittoes colette hissed into her ear if he knew where we were he wouldnt keep shouting hes not so bad jane recalled a lanky slowmoving character who played the trombone in the school orchestra keep your bloody voice down not so bad sober not so bad on his own bunch of them at closing time you dont get involved bad news i got caught once never again thought you were a woman of the world you do it on your terms jane not theirs never theirs besides if gittoes was mine youd get wall up against the back of the toilets fancy that do you yuk right so shut up come on on your feet theres a path we get to the churchyard were all right you wanner come to a party girls danny gittoes called out further away now colette sniffed very small party i reckon hold on to my arm jane this bits muddy danny gittoes bawled out bring your mother you wanner the ground was harder underfoot theyd found the path danny gittoes was lumbering about a good twentyfive yards behind give er some holy communion i would any day o the bloody week i rest my case colette murmured scumbag scumbag least hes on his own yeah but that worries me a bit jane felt cold now she was glad to see the big black hulk of the church thrusting through the trees and bushes like a liner on a dark ocean stars drifting around the steeple another hundred yards and theyd be out on the square and the only problem then would be slipping quietly into the black swan and looking like shed just been for a meditative stroll best thing before going up to the suite would be to pop into the downstairs ladies slap some cold water on her face although the chances were mum would be too stressed up over tomorrows sermon to notice much wow jane leaned into the rough stones of the church wall she felt like theyd walked miles i think i got cider a bit wrong when she closed her eyes it felt like she was falling through the wall jesus yeah well we all have to learn colette patted her shoulder come on janey sorry jane blinked a few times and straightened up i you know i just becoming aware that colettes hand hadnt left her shoulder in fact it had gone into a grip shit colette said jane turned quickly the sudden motion made her queasy evening girls he was leaning up against the wooden lychgate dean wall the sheepshagger very clever colette said in a bored voice do they call that a pincer movement told em about the party danny gittoes came up behind at the club what you on about dean said oh right the ole afterhours social club the only good light was pooled around one lamp on the corner of the close where it met the square she saw two other boys skirting the light there was nobody else about no cars the olde worlde timewarped magic of ledwardine late at night the two other boys slouched into the close to join danny and dean the four of them forming a rough circle around colette and jane god big boys men really in the same way that colette was a woman so why did jane feel like a little girl wanting to be up in the big safe hotel suite warm in the glow from two bedside lamps mum bent over her sermon pad another figure walked over from the square whats all this then it was lloyd powell the councillors son he was a few years older than the others a working farmer lloyd was goodlooking drove a white american truck and was considered intensely cool by some of the girls at school possibly because he was always so aloof what you got yere dean no problem lloyd you girls all right this lot bothering you like his old man lloyd was an oldfashioned gentleman pretty boring in some ways colette said lazily like he said no problem jane who was starting to feel sick was annoyed with her lloyd powell couldve stopped this let them get home you sure lloyd said yeah said colette the day i cant handle hairballs like this is the day i enter a fucking closed order lloyd shrugged and strolled back to the market place jane suspected there were going to be times when she wished colettes sassquotient was not so far off the local scale still she did her best to sound cool so like wheres the afterhours social club colette cassidy sighed dean wall grinned he really was huge and had big muscles you saw him heaving around great sacks of potatoes and stuff at his fathers farm shop on the edge of the village i think he means the church porch colette said a night in suicide orchard poor merrily like a white woolly terrier dermot child followed her into the lobby of the village hall can i walk you back to the swan merrily unhooked her coat from the peg you can walk with me if youre going that way well yes child held open the metal door for her i thought id have a nightcap merrily locked up the hall double lock big key she had quite a bunch of these things in her bag the vicar seemed to be responsible for the security of half the public buildings in the village maybe she could use a minder but not mr child oh no hed nearly become dermot but he was child again now quite blatantly fancied her but was not necessarily on her side bad combination rod and terry cleared off pretty rapidly vicar wry smile as they crossed the car park true enough rod powell heading for the ox round the corner cassidy striding rapidly up towards the lights of the square and his restaurant to regale caroline with the juicy details of their dilemma a lot to talk about i suppose merrily said oh yes dermot child fairly bounced along his springy white hair flopping one of those volatile characters who thrives on discord was energized by controversy fun to have around but you wouldnt trust him to the end of the street all right plunging her hands down the pockets of her new but even cheaper fake barbour what did you mean poor merrily well he gazed up the dark street into the future going to get the blame arent you for what for whatever you decide yes or no to a witch trial in the church youll be either the trendy radical priest who cares nothing for local sensibilities or just another reactionary who doesnt want to muddy the waters or offend the nobs either way your congregation suffers must be hell being a vicar hang on what makes you all so sure its going to be me who makes the decision oh really dermot child stopped leaned back against the railings of a white georgian village house base of kent asprey the jogging doc you were there when they decided i dont understand well bulldavies buggered off for reasons which will soon become very apparent then rod powell advised you to examine your conscience and finally the appalling cassidy told you very politely and sympathetically that he rather thought it was going to be your decision how firm dyou want it theyve all officially copped out tossed the hot potato into your lap and run like hell when it makes the papers which it surely will itll be vicar bans top writer and if i dont if i dont block it then youll get i dont know vicar backs poof playwright against local protests well not that obviously but you get the idea i see merrily said youre saying that whatever happens im stuffed burden of village life my dear this was some suburban parish in london or birmingham youd have a small flurry of controversy and then it would all be forgotten here well dont be fooled by appearances all right postmodern state of the art the new countryside of rich commuters hitech home business people oak beams and the internet he motioned to a halflit shop window marches media fax photocopying computer supplies illusion surface glitter merrily and only the surface changes underneath the structures as rigid as an old iron bedframe you seem to like it here all the same she knew hed been a music teacher at some london college had links with a small record label specializing in modern choral works suspected hed left at least one exwife somewhere i know my way around vicar may not sound like it but im a local boy we go back three generations not many compared to your powells and your bulldavieses but itll do born here and i suppose ill die here sooner or later as for that big sloppy lump of life in the middle skipping round london paris milan that was just time spent finding out that in the end its really better the hell you know hell he didnt respond there were eight or nine cars parked on the square clustered under a blackstemmed electrified gas lamp the cars included two bmws a jaguar and a range rover people dining at cassidys or the black swan the village centre also quietly lit by uncurtained windows and the stars looked if not exactly smug quite settled in its prosperity when dyou move into the vicarage merrily could be next week terrific mind you big old place they could see on the edge of the church close the end gable of the vicarage and its chimneys rising above most of the others i think id rather have a bungalow merrily said oh no god no that would never do has to be the official residence nice roomy lawn for garden parties vicar all right priestincharge but still an important figure in ledwardine mind you you do need a husband oh really oh yes decent local man solid foundation the wi will have it at the top of their agenda bloody nerve merrily said what is this jane austen like i told you the framework doesnt change what do you expect youre a very lovely young woman oh please anyway im an old widow ah yes theyd stopped at the steps of the black swan which rather got you out of a hole i gather merrily froze dermot child dropped a hand on her shoulder sorry my dear am i being indiscreet merrily gazed across the square towards the vicarage ted clowes is a dead man she said of course it was colette they really wanted the squashy lips the provocative breasts in the white frock colette was the nymph the real thing grown up this was very clear to jane if nothing else was she could smell their sweat and the heat source that brought it out was colette jane was feeling more and more queasy and strangely separated from it all like they were the players and she was merely the audience and she couldnt alter what was happening because she was just well just a kid if she spoke nobody would hear her bring your mother give er some holy communion her stomach felt horribly tight and distended something like liquid gas welled up in her throat and she gulped it back clinging to the church wall the stones felt damp and gritty slimy the sweat smell was a disgusting haze come on one of them said we got a few bottles and marks brought some sweeties oh yeah colette said es this mark said no rubbish mind got em in leominster colette looked at them hands on her whitesheathed hips shoulders against the church wall oh for fucks sake doesnt that just about show the mentality of you seedsuckers like were all going to get hypedup in the church porch and put on our ipods and pretend its a major rave come back when youre older yeah how old you like us to be said the fourth boy whod come along with mark who had the pills old enough that you dont have to hang around with kids any more colette said jane was in awe of her the boys were quiet for a moment she could smell the beer on them through the hot sweat their senses were surely too fuddled for clever repartee maybe theyd slink off spit a few insults from across the street then melt into the night like foxes but then dean wall said all the humour gone think were kids is it danny gittoes put a hand on his arm let it go dean dean shook him off fucked if i will please colette smiled thinly dont use words till you know what they mean dean took a couple of seconds to work this out then he gave out a kind of strangled sob right got someing to prove do you not now dean danny said you blown it i reckon come yere dean moved apelike towards colette come yere you fuckin clever bitch big hands clawing for colettes breasts she sprang back like a cat reared and spat touch me once mucussac and ill tear your balls off wooooh danny gittoes and mark backed off in notquitemock terror but dean didnt it was personal now it had history cathedral fucking school fucking snob not puttin out for the likes of us eh youre just a slag cassidy stand outside your shitty cafe tongue hangin out youre panting for it you are well maybe colette didnt blink but unless youve brought along one of your old mans best carrots like a sack of potatoes falling over dean wall tumbled at colette who was spinning and hissing too fast for him but there were four of them and in a second it had become a soggy blur and although jane thought she heard a distant mans voice shouting whats going on down there there was no sound of footsteps behind the squeals and grunts and so feeling very ill jane went in scratching nails raking the back of a leather jacket nnnnnooooo she screamed aware though before it was half out that it was going to be rather more than a scream that she was being sick boy was she being sick oh oh shit oh you fuckin little cow dean wall was on his feet flailing about dripping he no longer stank of sweat oh you fuckin disgustin little dean had his jacket off and he was shaking it gobbets of vomit flying through the air then he started slapping it against the church wall screeching outrage danny and mark laughing at him from a safe distance im sorry jane gasped wiping her lips on her sleeve mouth full of sourness oh god i then her left hand was snatched her arm jerked savagely out in front of her and she had to start running to avoid falling over all she could hear behind her as she was dragged over something shinscrapingly hard and wooden were curses and oaths and the sound of the leather jacket being slapped repeatedly against the church wall no escape that way you bitches from a distance up yours slimeball colette shrieked triumphant halfway up the steps of the black swan merrily tensed what was that kids i expect in the churchyard happened every night in liverpool you didnt expect it here they dont have many places to go dermot child said there was a plan for a big youth centre a couple of years ago on the derelict bowling green behind the ox an influential lobby of local people ie newcomers managed to get it squashed not in keeping you understand look i think id better pop down to the church and see whats happening merrily look if you were supposed to police the place the bishop wouldve supplied you with a tazer dermot elbowed open the double doors at the top of the steps come and have a drink i dont think i will thanks got a sermon to go over dermot he raised an eyebrow she joined him on the top step pulled the doors closed again what did ted say about my marriage he was unembarrassed not a great deal dont be too hard on ted i think he had your best interests at heart wanted us to know you werent just some newbroom feminist theologian that youd had a bad time been through the mill so what precisely did he say oh he he said your husband was unfaithful that a reconciliation was out of the question that this unfortunately coincided with your decision to apply for theological college when it must have occurred to you that ordination and divorce were still quite some way from being entirely compatible and then just when all seemed lost your husband and his er secretary merrily said as corny as that piled into a viaduct on the m was it very quick apparently no one suffered no except you of course perverse kind of guilt ted was talkative merrily said grimly agonizing over whether youd wished it on him to clear the way for your calling ridiculous of course sean was a lawyer merrily said i was going to be one too a barrister we met at university we were very idealistic we were going to work for people whod been dumped on but couldnt afford proper representation batman and robin in wigs very commendable sure but most young lawyers start out like that it doesnt last certainly didnt for sean he changed his mind became a solicitor joined a practice i didnt care for then went solo as for me i hadnt even finished the first year before he got me pregnant sorry unchristian before i got pregnant you could have resumed though couldnt you something happened to turn you away from the law and er towards the lord ted didnt tell you about that he didnt tell me any of this look lets go in the lounge bar get a couple of single malts and merrily smiled and moved delicately past him through the double doors goodnight dermot jane was aware of sitting in grass in absolute darkness wiping her mouth on a tissue shed found in her jacket her brain about six miles away and still travelling oh god oh god im dying you aint felt nothin yet honeychile colettes smokey tone drifted comfortably out of the blackness at her side you wait till tomorrow where are we jane sat up hey nice one janey men these days are so particular about their clothing i couldnt help it dont spoil it jesus that was so funny you could have been raped those hairballs couldnt summon a decent hardon with a years supply of playboys and a splint well messed about

cold and knobbly come on where are we relax its a good place its powells orchard isnt it orchard apples cider she felt sick and closed her eyes leaning back against the scabby tree trunk never again never never never yeah colette said its the powell orchard jane took a gulp of clean night air whys this a good place why wont they come here they wont come in theyre shit scared janey colette raised her voice scared of old edgar a swish of bushes jane opened her eyes looked up and couldnt see any stars she could make out the shape of colettes white dress now just the dress you see theyre there all right four brave country boys you there slimeball but they wont come any further because her voice rising to a kind of whoop we are under edgar powells tree jane sat up rapidly inched forward on her bottom away from the tree trunk the apple tree man colette said the old king of the orchard i often come here on your own no with the cricket club of course on my own arent you scared you mean of the ghost of edgar powell well actually hey listen all of you listen hes been seen ok he has been seen i heard some people whispering about it in the restaurant old edgar powell the headless farmer all aglow and hovering about nine inches off the ground no stop it jane giggled and shuddered simultaneously youre making that up sort of a grey light around him from his feet to his neck situation is that his mind was going before it happened and he doesnt know why he did it to himself doesnt know hes dead probably so he just walks around the orchard he walks plod plod plod colette jane said shut up would you mind you believe in ghosts janey no does the reverend mummy i dont know but i do know the reverend mummyll be out of her mind with worry if she gets back and im not there so i think we should get moving colette laughed its not funny jane said its her big working day tomorrow up at fivethirty shes going to kill me colette said this grey light its from his feet to his neck did i just say that just his neck no head now where could his head be i know look up look up janey jane looked down she didnt want to think about edgar powell instead she found herself thinking of wil williams poor lush wil coming out here on a lovely spring morning to hang himself oh god a night in suicide orchard goosebumps started forming on her arms colette said slowly you look up into the branches and maybe theres this wizened old face grinning gappy old grin eyes like grey holes most of his chin blown away though in these very branches just over where we are shut up go on have a look sod off just a little glance janey dont be stupid you can look through your fingers if you want i dont want i want to go home i thought you didnt believe in ghosts leave me alone dont go all fractious on me jane this is fun its not jane hugged herself and tried to see the shapes of apple trees or anybody behind one theyre not here at all are they dean wall and gittoes they never followed us theyve gone to get cleaned up i dont know colette said why dont you take a chance on it get up and just walk away and pray they dont grab you jane screamed colette had seized her from behind her arms were very cold go on janey edgar will protect you hell put his old mac around your shoulders squeeze you tight stop it jane felt tears coming look up for me just look up once and then well go ok there now can we you didnt look up i did you didnt janey colette said lightly all right with colettes cold arms around her jane looked up mistress the knocking on the door had lol rolling on to his side on the rug where hed been reading trahernes centuries bringing his knees up like an embryo in the womb he was aware of that and ashamed but he didnt move all the same but what about his breathing if you put your ear right up to the thinly curtained glass youd surely be able to hear the ragged terrified pumping of lols lungs he tried to slow his breathing it nearly threw him into a coughing fit he choked weakly at least you couldnt see much through the curtains hed been outside and tested it out creeping like a burglar through his tangled front garden all you could see was the glow of the lamp and that was ok because people often left lamps on when they were out for security so he could be out could be down the pub drinking with his mates except that if you knew lol youd know he wouldnt have any mates and was too shy to go in a pub on his own full of people he didnt know but they all knew who he was people laughing thump rattle batter he didnt move reciting traherne in his head you never enjoy the world aright till you so love the beauty of enjoying it that you are covetous and earnest to persuade others to enjoy it if he let karl in karl would have a bottle with him maybe two and theyd still be drinking when the sun came up on a new and ominous day and so perfectly hate the abominable corruption of men in despising it that you had rather suffer the flames of hell than willingly be guilty of their error there is so much blindness and ingratitude and damned folly batter batter batter almost frantic someone losing it karl wouldnt do that not at this stage karl stoked his rages slowly with finesse karl laid detonators timed his explosions not karl a cautious relief began to seep like warm oil into lols clenchedup muscles lol for christs sake a womans voice and batter batter crash he stood up shakily shuffling into his sandals in the hall he switched on the bulkhead light on the outside wall before he opened the front door and ethel the cat streaked in between his legs as though shed absorbed some of the agitation radiating from colette cassidy for fucks sake colettes face was full of fury and reminded him of alison except colette was fifteen years old and she was on her own in a skimpy white frock and it was late at night what were you bloody doing lol sorry i fell asleep on the rug is there something wrong she stared at him in despair a bit like the way alison used to stare at him disappointed that he was all there was he found that look under the circumstances almost comforting but he didnt want her here at night he had to get rid of her youve got to help me colette said and it was an instruction not a plea shes going on about little lights in the tree within five minutes merrily was back downstairs edging into the lounge bar peering over heads and into every corner the lowbeamed room was mellow with buttery lamplight and soft laughter welldressed welloff couples relaxing after dinner not many locals except of course for dermot child on his own on a stool at the bar accepting what must be his second scotch from the morose manager roland and brightening visibly when he spotted merrily she went right up to him wasnt going to tell the entire room dermot you havent seen jane is she supposed to be here certainly not shes supposed to be in our suite watching tv perhaps shes just popped out for a walk merrily shook her head we have this agreement that she never goes out alone at night without i know precisely where and when but this is ledwardine merrily thats a pretty stupid thing to say didnt a teenage girl go missing from kingsland last year oh look im sorry im just getting no no dermot put down his glass youre right of course no one can be too careful these days lets go and find her sorry hysterical mother its just that she knows i have to get to bed at a reasonable time on a saturday night shes rarely intentionally thoughtless if you see what well find her he took her left hand in both of his pressed it hold on to that malt for me would you roland ill be closing in twenty minutes mr child you drink it then dermot was on his feet come along merrily steering her into the oakpanelled passageway now have you checked the residents lounge and the public bar and the snooker room shes definitely not in the building cant be far away not into badgerspotting or anything like that i take it hustling her out into the porch nor bats nor owls i dont think down in the square a couple got into a range rover and four youths played drunken football with a beer can on the cobbles dermot said she have a boyfriend no one since we came here been a couple in the past nothing too intense as far as you can ever tell must be a difficult age every age is a difficult age including yours sorry dermot clapped a hand to his head im sorry merrily and please believe me i didnt mean to pry earlier we just want you to be happy here we know how lucky we are to have you old alf i mean hed just been going through the motions for years just being there church is like the royal family needs more to survive these days than just being there needs motion motion from the doubledoorway of the porch merrily was scouring the square please jane dont know about motion sometimes i think im struggling just to stay upright youre doing fine dermot child whispered you have absolutely nothing to worry about and she felt his arm around her waist well keep you on your feet he said she didnt speak she didnt freeze she was the vicar he was the organist he was the best organist in the county the presumptuous little bastard she contemplated moving towards him looking deep into his eyes then bringing up her right knee and turning his balls to paste instead she said whos that dermot and walked steadily out on to the steps dermot followed her but didnt touch her again wouldnt you know it he said james bulldavies walked out of church street on to the square he walked almost delicately like a wading bird long legs rigid neck extended been in the ox dermot said drinks socially in the swan but when hes serious about it hell go to the ox hell stand at a corner of the bar by himself and hell sink one after another cheapest whisky theyve got until his eyes glaze happens two or three times a year he isnt an alcoholic just needs to do it sometimes to keep going keep going he hates it here dermot murmured out of the side of his mouth havent you realized that hates what he is or what he feels he has to be wouldve stayed in the army the old man hadnt keeled over probably be a brigadier by now but like poor bloody prince charles hes got to keep going bulldavies was in the centre of the square looking over the parked cars peering at each one individually like a crazed traffic warden coffeys play brought this on merrily wished james would just go away whatever his problems were they werent as immediate as hers dermot lowered his voice i dont know many details of the williams affair mostly pure legend anyway id guess but id be very surprised if among that longago lynch mob at the vicarage there wasnt a bull or a davies oh god merrily stiffened remember poor never trust the bulls she whispered who says that miss devenish on the night of the wassailing just after she had that row with the cassidys didnt go to that thing couldnt face it too cold what did miss devenish say never trust the bulls remember poor poor wil of course old gypsys warning eh never thought about it from that moment to this i suppose what happened a few minutes later rather womans insane of course he said never forget that oh bonkers and embittered used to write childrens books but nobodyll publish them any more roald dahl she wasnt enjoying himself again trying to work his way up to another arm around the waist shed have to do something couldnt put up with months years of this she could deal with it would deal with it if she could just find jane also feels threatened dermot said mostly by the cassidys because they want her shop to extend their restaurant well partly that and partly because caroline feels the devenish emporiums cheap and tacky and not in keeping with the sophisticated image theyre after every so often theyll make the old girl an offer how she can afford to keep refusing is beyond me because that little shops doing next to nothing thats sad merrily moved as far away from him as she could get without falling off the damned step jane went in there today she she stopped because she didnt want to explain why jane had gone to the shop and also because james bulldavies had kicked over a litterbin fuckers he roared bloody fuckers he slipped and went down on one knee fuckers he said in a normal voice then laughed picking himself up evidently unaware of merrily and dermot child he leaned against the metal lamppost beside the market cross and peered down church street where the lights of a vehicle had appeared the litterbin was still rolling along the cobbles perhaps i should go down and talk to him merrily said this is my job isnt it for what my opinions worth vicar id seriously advise against it he wont be terribly civil even if he recognizes you and he wont thank you for it in the morning the vehicle stopped on the square engine rattling it was an old and muddy blue land rover alison kinnersley jumped down she wore tight jeans and a black shirt her blonde hair shone like a brass helmet in the fake gaslight come on then my lord she stood relaxed legs apart on the cobbles the land rover snorting behind her like the stallion she rode around the village lets go home bulldavies didnt move from his lamppost you whore who told you powell called good old saintly bloody powell thought i saw his head come round the pub door lets go home squire do you demand it bulldavies grinned savagely dyou demand it mistress god merrily thought shes got him locked into some pathetic bronteesque sex play alison seemed to shrug her breasts rather than her shoulders merrily felt dermot child quiver and she shuddered and wanted to be almost anywhere else but she also wanted to find jane and if alison and james didnt take their games home she was going down there anyway do it here hey my slinky slinky whore bulldavies rasped hoarsely shag ourselves senseless on the bloody cobbles give the prissy bastards a show dent someones shiny merc with your lovely arse james youre pretty senseless already alison said coolly youve got ten seconds to get in before i leave you to sleep it off in the gutter whore bulldavies detached himself from the lamppost get in the truck james theres a good boy we have your reputation to look after alison sounding as if she knew they had an audience of which james remained oblivious reputation wassat going to be worth when that scented arsebandit shafts me you tell me mistress you bloody tell me he walked unsteadily towards the land rover mumbling morosely to the cobbles about the little shirtlifting socialist scum squatting at the bottom of the drive with his odious catamite you sold it darling alison said wearily as though theyd gone through all this many times before it isnt yours any more mans a piece of shit whatever do get in jamie the land rover door was slammed the chassis groaned the engine spluttered and gagged and the battered vehicle was reversed illegally into the alley leading to cassidys country kitchen and ledwardine lore well dermot said after a moment i did warn you didnt i the way it would go but merrily wasnt listening she was already stumbling down the steps through the dirty wool of exhaust in the dieselstinking air she could see them bringing jane along church street pious cow and its a really terrifying situation to be in i mean you know what on earth do we do how can we ordinary fallible human beings even contemplate making a decision which we know is going whichever way we turn to offend somebody pause merrily took a step back from the edge of the pulpit she felt awful the light sizzled harshly in the stainedglass windows yellows and reds glaring out florid and sickly something they never told you at college you needed to be fit for this job whats the first thing we usually do we panic of course we just want to run away thats always the first instinct isnt it why me what have i done to get landed with this one you always asked them questions you were conversational about it just having a chat ok im up here youre down there but were all in the same boat really sometimes you found yourself hoping one of them would stand up join in help you out a bit yeah i take your point vicar but the way i see it god knew she could use some help from the punters maybe she should hold a parish referendum wil williams yes or no cowards way out she swallowed her mouth felt like a sandpit it was a warm sunny goodtobealive morning she felt cold in her stomach she hadnt eaten hardly slept but you know in your heart of hearts that running away isnt the answer to anything ever sooner or later youre going to have to face up to it pitching her voice at the rafters she knew what they meant about the warm acoustic shed never needed it more packed house of course well it would be wouldnt it sods law they were all here this morning the twenty or so regulars including councillor garrod powell and his son lloyd both of them sober darksuited expressionless deeply local plus the occasionals a resentfullooking gomer parry with his comfortable wife minnie and miss lucy devenish who according to ted would often walk out if the hymns were tuneless or the sermon insufficiently compelling also the very occasionals like terrence and caroline cassidy sundays such a busy day now lunches and dinners which effectively rules out both services but we do often pop in during the week for a few minutes of quiet time in addition the neverseenherebefores richard coffey in a light brown velvet suit with his wafery friend stefan alder flophaired and sulkyeyed in jeans and the totally unexpectedunderthecircumstances james bulldavies frozenfaced and solitary in the old family pew well merrily leaned over the pulpit hands clasped this ones for you jamie so what do you do the pressures building up youre starting to feel a bit beleaguered two messages had been on the answering machine shed fixed up in the room must have come in while she was out there trying to locate jane terrence cassidy perhaps we could arrange a small chat merrily would you call me councillor garrod powell a word or two might be in order vicar if you can spare the time ill be in church as usual tomorrow bulldavies wasnt looking at her he had his arms folded and his legs stretched out as far as they would go in the confining space between pews he faced the door which led to the belfry just about the last place hed want to go if the inside of his head was in the condition it deserved to be after last night rule one dont give in to pressure rule two collect all the information you can get listen to all the arguments seek out independent people who might have an opinion or a point of view you hadnt thought about try to step back and see it from a different angle dermot child thankfully was out of view from the pulpit hed be smiling to himself on the organstool halfconcealed from the congregation the only one of them who knew just how little time she must have had to put this one together and then merrily said well you know what im going to say next dont you youre thinking what else can she say in her position she focused on miss devenish who fearlessly met her eyes because of what i am im going to tell you theres only one place you can go for help but im also saying it because to me it makes perfect sense you could take your dilemma to the united nations the house of lords the european court of human rights wherever and all youd wind up with is a whole stack of reports and lists of precedents and green papers and white papers bumph in other words take you a couple of months to wade through it and youd be no wiser at all just a whole lot more confused and the decision would still be yours miss devenish smiled the old witch doctors face crinkling the side of the mouth tilting wryly up to the eagle nose so why not put it all on him thats what hes there for the best advice its possible to get and absolutely free go into a quiet place the middle of a field your bathroom or come in here if you like sit down you dont have to kneel or you can walk about if you want to however you feel relaxed but put that question tell him its urgent tell him youd like an answer as quickly as possible merrily gathered her props together bible prayer book clipboard felttip pen and im prepared to guarantee she said crisply that youll get one outside when it was all over nobody mentioned the sermon to most of them it would have been routine stuff but during the ritual shaking of hands by the porch there were discreet approaches from those who ought to know what it was about councillor garrod powell mumbled got my message did you vicar james bulldavies coughed need to talk mrs watkins problem is never know where to find you caroline cassidy darksuited and pearled turned imploring eyes on merrily took both her hands whispered im so so sorry about what happened last night girls of that age we must talk this over as parents soon merrily put them all off explaining that it would be a bit chaotic this week because they were moving at last into the vicarage so if whatever it was could possibly wait shed be delighted to offer them coffee there once she had a table to put the cups on buying time but not from miss devenish thoughtful enough to make sure she was the last to emerge from the church she wore a widebrimmed straw hat and her summer poncho aztec zigzags so what are you doing this afternoon merrily murmured go for a walk shall we mrs watkins whatever suits you two stiles on the edge of the churchyard yes not the orchard one the other one three oclock fine merrily said it would give her a couple of hours for that long meaningful motherdaughter discussion oh and dont bring the child will you miss devenish said from behind her richard coffey honoured merrily with a distant smile and a minimal nod jane looked up i was just a bit tired you bloody well deserve it and the headache and the nausea jane rose abruptly from the corner of the bed staring angrily out of the window at the sunsplashed square did i say i had a headache did i say i felt sick you threw up enough last night i could smell it thats not fair jane merrily said do me the courtesy of not trying to bluff it out it wasnt meant to be like this returning from morning service merrily had made a point of changing out of her cassock dispensing with the collar putting on jeans it was going to be onetoone mother and daughter friends even the long meaningful chat dealing frankly with important practical subjects like i cider a few facts it was unexpectedly cheap went down very easily but was also usually over seven per cent proof which was approximately twice the alcohol content of beer bottom line cider gets you pissed before you know it and like ii colette cassidy a difficult spoiled girl with a weak father and a neurotic mother appeared sophisticated probably been wearing makeup since the age often but it was all superficial according to ted who had a friend who taught at the hereford cathedral school colettes worldliness was not balanced by any great intellect so the message to jane who only yesterday had loftily professed herself more mature than her contemporaries at the high school was dont think you can learn anything from colette cassidy be your own woman and dont get pissed again shed left jane to sleep through the morning undisturbed asking roland the manager to hold off the chambermaid until tomorrow because the poor kid was ill no nothing to worry about just a mild stomach upset and what should have been a shattering hangover so where was the damned hangover christ she needed jane to feel bloody awful for the whole of sunday it was part of the lesson you got drunk you went through hell next day you were chastened timehonoured pattern the great wonderful pang of anger and relief last night when shed discovered what had happened when jane had appeared in church street supported by miss devenish and a smallish longhaired guy she hadnt seen before with the guilty party colette cassidy trailing sullenly behind all right it wasnt convenient it had lost merrily most of a nights sleep but it was one of those things which had to happen one day god her first time with excess alcohol had been much worse it had involved boys and shed been lucky not to anyway calm yourself woman people react differently thats all she turned back to the bed what about some lunch im not hungry jane said tonelessly well fair enough merrily could remember a whole day of hugging the pillow between paracetamols but it wasnt like that was it the kid was lying on her bed quite relaxed almost serene in her white nightdress which she must have changed into this morning because shed gone to bed in that old pulp tshirt cup of tea merrily offered desperately no thanks i might get myself one later jane she sat down again on a corner of the bed im sorry to labour the point but youre sure there were no men no boys with you i told you we got rid of them they didnt follow you they werent around when you lost consciousness oh mother jane closed her eyes your generation thinks everything has to do with sex i had too much to drink i went to sleep you passed out yeah all right but when i woke up i felt well good actually yeah good but nobody touched me they couldnt get near jane looked faintly puzzled then it passed im fine she said im sorry about this but im really ok merrily breathed in counted slowly lips tight one two three four five i have to go out again she said jane stood at the window watching bloody mum cross the bloody square heading towards the bloody church where bloody else the pious cow she walked experimentally around the room she didnt fall down legs felt like her own legs again she felt good she hadnt been bluffing hadnt been taking the piss shed had a good nights sleep she shrugged she had a swift shower towelled her hair and got dressed she still felt fine she padded down the oak staircase and out into the square without thank god meeting anyone who might accuse her of having a drink problem the only problem was she couldnt recall very much of what had happened the last she remembered with any clarity was being on the right track for losing her virginity to bloody dean wall or one of his spotty mates in the church porch colette had got them out of that although she couldnt quite remember how good old colette jane slipped into the cobbled alley cassidys country kitchen was closed after the sunday lunch crowd there was no sign of colette jane wandered down to ledwardine lore which was also closed she stood at the window looking in at all the apple curios it seemed like months since shed gone in there and the very odd but quite nice lol robinson had asked her to mind the store because of the guy he wanted to avoid weird and then there was the story of wil williams whod hanged himself and was buried in the orchard the orchard jane pressed her forehead into the cool glass colettes voice drawling in her head old edgar powell the headless farmer all aglow and hovering about nine inches off the ground oh god yes she remembered running away from the wall gang and then she was lying in some grass under branches and gappy old grin eyes like grey holes these very branches look up janey colette was taunting her just like shed taunted the boys colettes voice harsh and sly sassy superior colette look up and had she had she looked up with colette and then dean wall and danny gittoes and somebody called mark coming out of the bushes to stand around and laugh themselves sick good old colette bollocks feeling really hot and embarrassed now she glared resentfully at the shuttered facade of cassidys country kitchen seriously bloody glad now that colette wasnt there in fact she never never never wanted to see that bitch again she turned and ran out of the alley and into the square and stood there panting confusion giving way to a sense of being horribly stupid and worst of all really really young luckily it was sunday soporific sunday afternoon and nobody to laugh at her humiliation even the black swan closed its bars on sunday afternoons and there were only a couple of cars parked on the square jane stood in the middle of the road at the top of church street staring at her shadow on the cobbles wondering how she could ever have felt at home here the yellow toyota sports car came out of nowhere well in fact out of great barn street which linked church street to the broad to hereford and had to swerve to avoid splattering jane all over the market cross brakes went on a window glided down tired of life are we darlin jane sniffed put on a smile sorry ah she saw a beard enclosing a very white smile its you again it was the man from the shop the man who was not dealing drugs who accidentally crushed fairies and frightened lol yellow toyota of course he said so you dont know anyone called lol robinson huh oh jane said well i do now i just didnt know his name at the time im quite new around here i know who he is now i described him to you sweetheart and it still meant nothing how do you oh never mind would i be chancing my arm if i were to ask you where blackberry lane is its up there see that funny little building in the square just go up the side to the left and its this really narrow little lane youll have to go a lot slower than you did when you came round that corner or youll wind up under a tractor or something thanks the window went up jane watched the car move off she hadnt really wanted to help him but he would have found out anyway she supposed lol lived up there and now hed get a nasty surprise he had a breakdown actually he used to be a sort of pop star way back well very minor i mean like tiny shed forgotten that and colette saying lol was megasad and and and shed seen him again shed been in his arms carried in his arms oh god hed brought her home last night and now shed shopped him to this bastard the reverend mum was right as usual shed got pissed and left a trail of disaster she had a lot of apologizing to do sympathetic magic a wispy breeze plucking at her poncho miss devenish climbed without much effort to the top of the knoll with her back to the sun the big hat pulled down she loomed over merrily like some ancient warrior chieftain youre never alone in the countryside mrs watkins its the most intimate place the poet traherne knew that when he walked out here traherne knew he was inside the mind of god below them nearly a mile away down the long wooded valley the village of ledwardine lay like an antique sundial in an old and luxuriant garden the core of the apple miss devenish said the orb traherne was always talking about orbs and spheres understanding that he was at the very centre of creation suppose hed lived in some filthy city merrily looked down on the lushness of it all or a desert somewhere wouldnt have mattered the man was a natural visionary he instinctively picked up the pattern the design before wordsworth before blake he stood here and he saw merrily sat down on the edge of the green knoll her legs dangling over a minicliff of rich red soil how do you know he stood precisely here i dont miss devenish smiled enigmatically and yet i do he wouldve walked here with his friend williams to see the best view of the village because of the hedges freshly greened you couldnt see the roads you couldnt see the cars and vans and tractors only hear their buzzing so much country merrily mused even inside the village still thank god an organic community in spite of the best efforts of those whod turn it into a museum full of horsebrasses and warming pans and supposedly authentic ceremonies darkness entered miss devenishs voice which belong elsewhere merrily looked towards the church the sandstone steeple stood proud like the gnomon of the sundial but the graves were all hidden by trees and bushes the churchyard more eggshaped than circular was partly enclosed by the orchard which from here had a deceptive density had the church once been entirely surrounded by apple trees indeed the heart mrs watkins and the blood it pumped was cider along the hidden road a heavy lorry rumbled the landscape seemed to tremble and her mind replayed the deepened voice of dermot child auld ciderrrrrrrrrrr yes merrily pulled herself together and talking of cider i cant tell you what happened to the child the old girl scrambled gracelessly down from the top of the knoll and came to sit beside merrily and if i tell you what i think might have happened im afraid our embryonic relationship might well be aborted dont like the sound of that laurence phoned me miss devenish said the cassidy girl had arrived at his door thats lol i do so hate slovenly abbreviations gaz chuck appalling laurence robinson helps me in the shop his is the nearest cottage to that end of the orchard the cassidy girl was somewhat distressed well as close to distress as that madams capable of getting told laurence your daughter had drunk too much and passed out in the orchard the two of them brought her back to the cottage which was where i first saw her she was conscious by then i wonder said miss devenish if she had ever been in the strictest sense unconscious meaning shed apparently been sick before she apparently passed out my distant memories of such things tell me its usually the other way about was she coherent perhaps merrily took a deep breath miss devenish shes fifteen years old she has no father shes had to change schools rather a lot and well shes very intelligent but rather less sophisticated than she thinks she is last night she was with a girl who seems to me to have been been around yes they seem to have been pursued by some boys what im trying to get at is when you found them did you see any suggestion of of hankypanky no mrs watkins i dont think you need worry on that score thank you next question i dont know how much cider she drank but it was enough to knock her over the first time i got drunk not that much older than jane i spent most of the following day wanting to die jane slept like a baby and woke up with absolutely no trace of a hangover so i wondered i mean the word is miss devenish that you know a thing or two about herbal medicines and things i just wanted my assessment of the situation tells me said miss devenish that you wanted her to suffer well merrily averted her eyes lets say i wanted her to regret it well of course said miss devenish youre a christian and christians are reluctant to believe that any significant lesson can be learned without suffering and what are you miss devenish labels the old girl glared at her why should one always have to be a something traherne was a christian but with the perceptions the antennae of a pagan but ill not be drawn into that sort of argument id prefer us to remain on speaking terms you want to know how your daughter could get horribly inebriated on copious draughts of rough cider and come out of it without a kingsize hangover and im trying to give you a possible explanation without offending your religious sensibilities im sorry merrily lay back against the knoll im not some fundamentalist bigot honestly go on what we used to call sympathetic magic youll probably think this whimsical ill try not to all right like cures like if youre drunk on cider what better place to sleep it off than an apple orchard crawl into the centre of the orb and curl up let nature do the rest youre right that is whimsical wouldnt work for everyone the orchards a risky place an entity in itself a sphere and this is a very old orchard so it tells you or rather it tells me something about your daughter im sorry but what does it tell you about my daughter i really dont want us to fall out miss devenish said but you would do well to trust the child wearily lol opened his front door in the brightness of the afternoon the willow tree in the front garden dusted with gold it was almost a relief to see karl windling there on the step in person in his denims beaming through his beard a moment of ridiculous anticlimax no surprise karl would know dennis would have warned lol how the hell are you son im all right lol said tentatively how are you pretty good karl said seriously pretty fucking good and looked it it was nine years since theyd last been facetoface karls beard was evenly clipped like a hairbrush it was probably concealing a double chin hed put on some weight but only the kind of weight you needed to make workout sessions worthwhile he looked fitter in fact than he had fifteen years ago when he used to remind lol of bluto in the old popeye cartoons the difference being course that there was never any real lasting harm in bluto hey this is cute karl stepped back on to the lawn he wasnt actually that big when you saw him only huge in the memory this is picture postcard how long you been here now son a year something like that lol felt numb anaesthetized by the new acceptance that no matter where he went how he lived he was never going to have the balls to control his own life quaint karl fingered the rotting trellis sweet little cottage at the end of a country lane little garden little porch retirement home lovely lol nodded he didnt have to rise to it or hide only let karl see him as he really was a small spent force a loser and then karl would leave him alone but youre writing a bit i hear few lyrics for gary kennedy lol shrugged he sends me tapes you can do better than that son garys long gone still writes good tunes hes gone son washed up karl prodded a cracked plantpot with his desert boot they must be back in fashion look we just enjoying the lovely country air or are you gonna invite me in to meet your lady there is no lady lol said karl grinned in disbelief in the old days one of his more socially dubious pastimes had been poaching women from his friends and colleagues hed screw them once rarely more than that then give them back to varying degrees the friends and colleagues had found this irritating but there was no record of retaliation youre shitting me son you were always so popular with ladies that air of helplessness brings out the universal mothering instinct made us all very very jealous that was then lol said so dennis got it wrong there was somebody lol said she left ah karl peered over lols shoulder into the hall so youre on your own lol stepped back to let karl into the cottage it felt like holding out your wrists for the handcuffs baring your belly for the knife i dont want to fall out with anyone merrily nibbled a stem of grass she was finding miss devenish disturbingly easy to talk to im the new kid on the block trying not to put my foot in it but something tells me im on the edge of a minefield ah said miss devenish methinks the reverend wil williams rears his pretty head perhaps under the present circumstances we ought to avoid words like pretty who told you about it anyone residing within a few hundred yards of cassidys restaurant this morning would have heard the appalling terrence beating his sunken breast but i got the full details from colette as no one else seemed to be talking to her after last night dont agonize about it my dear thats my advice for what its worth its my job to agonize merrily sat up reached for her bag would you mind if i had a cigarette feel free to be human thanks merrily gratefully extracted the silk cut agonizing miss devenish regarded her intently as she lit up the need to agonize thats very interesting i wonder would your predecessor have said the same alfhayden faced with any moral challenge the dreadful hayden would simply erect the screen of buffoonery and vacuous twittering thats sustained the anglican clerical tradition for the past fifty years merrily laughed the smoke softening her up the sun warm on her face and arms youre a cynic miss devenish so perhaps the ordination of women will be the salvation of the church women listen women worry call me lucy listen my advice for what its worth is to let it happen let the awful coffey have his play the face was shaded by the big hat and the eyes were invisible the hands lay placidly where the hem of the poncho met a baggy frock splattered with sunflowers merrily was cautious why do you say that i mean cassidy for one would be glad to hear you say it but good heavens whichever way it goes cassidys screwed isnt he the festival needs coffey for artistic credibility but it needs bulldavies well not for money any more obviously but certainly for the use of land for marquees and car parking and also more importantly because bulldavies is the voice of the county set and those buggers still stick together more than ever in adversity cause offence in that quarter and all kinds of barriers are erected no i shall enjoy watching cassidy squirm may even poke him with the occasional twig under the shadow of the hat the lips twisted with a happy malice merrily sighed so you think the plays going to be valid what the hat came off to reveal a steelgrey plait in a tight coil and a fierce cobalt glare valid i think the whole concept is absolute cock then i dont understand frolicking in the orchard with naked youths utter tosh and yet the poor man was misjudged im sure of that friend of trahernes you see not a poet unfortunately but were his perceptions any less keen for that so what are you saying was williams a witch was traherne a witch of course he wasnt really youre sure of that this was getting silly i wouldnt claim to know much about him but people who do tell me he saw god in everything quite lucy devenish stood up jammed on her hat merrily followed her as she stalked down the footpath across the sloping field towards the village you still havent explained lucy carried on walking with long strides why you think the play should go ahead in the church merrily said out of breath now why for the truth of course nobody cares about truth any more coffey doesnt care he just wants to mangle history for his own purposes cassidy doesnt care he sees the past as a marketing tool bulldavies cares of course but only about his personal heritage his reputation his family have doubtless been distorting the truth for generations but we dont know what the truth is no the old girl stopped they were on low ground now ledwardine had sunk into the trees so that only the steeple was visible like a rocket waiting to be launched but when the ditchwaters are stirred the turds often surface just dont tell me karl said that you dont miss it a pigeon disturbed battered its way out of the hedge and flew up past the open window lol was silent sitting in the blue chair with the cat on his knees being himself a sad person well then karl looked around the room again at the few cheap things in it well im doing what you said lol said desperately not telling you i dont miss it nah youre not being honest with yourself son karl was leaning back in ethel the cats chair with one of the three cans of halffrozen lager lol had found at the back of the fridge he had his tobacco tin on the arm of the chair the tin which had upset dennis clarke because it was not the drug of choice in his part of chippenham as he relaxed another drug california had drifted into karls accent this guy in la right i hadnt been there very long and he was another brit expara bodyguard to the stars now big bucks we get pissed one night im saying so this is living right he gives me a funny look sour he says this is cruisin man living it aint he says you wanna know the last time i was really alive port stanley he says or it mightve been goose green back in the falklands war anyway the last time his senses were really buzzing i didnt believe it but like i say i hadnt been in hollywood very long karl drained the can crushed it with feeling what am i saying son ill tell you his time in the falklands was like our times on the road gigging the buzz right on stage a little pissed high on your own music and the thought of no bollocks listen a year ago i played bass for two nights with a band called apb from santa monica i was older than any of those guys by a good twelve years but it was still there son by christ it was there afterwards afterwards was that what dennis clarkes letter was saying in its cautious accountantly way was that what had really offended the neat suburban mrs gillian clarke karl going on about the good old days of hot nights and tender young flesh lol tried to switch off karls voice summoning traherne your enjoyment of the world is never right till you awake in heaven till you till you look upon the earth no till you look upon the skies the earth and the air as celestial joys tell you i coulda gone on all night incredible left my brains all over the bedroom ceiling yeah lols fingers tightening on ethels scruff ethel purred you never enjoy the world aright till the sea itself floweth in your veins till you are clothed with the heavens and crowned with the stars and and perceive yourself to be the sole heir of the whole world and stayed in hereford last night this morning im in andys browsing through the albums and im not kidding son this was like a mystical experience these two young girls sixteen seventeen black stockings skirts up to here combing the racks obviously not got a bundle to spend pick one up study it put it back have arguments finally they come up with one cd one says look its midprice too guess what it was guess the world the world is a mirror of infinite beauty yet no man sees it it is a temple of majesty yet no manno man regards it it is a region of light and peace it is it is it is the reissue i just wanted to kiss their little feet christ if this wasnt a sign they probably werent even born when we did that album their mothers had safety pins through their nipples and thought we were soft shit now after all these years we are becoming warm our time has come son its all turned around our time has fucking come and i will not be deprived of it by someone whose balls are made of blancmange you follow jane moved a little closer to the open window thanks to lols inactivity in the garden she was sure she wasnt visible from the lane but jesus shed nearly fainted when that pigeon crashed out of the hedge her left leg had gone numb from crouching between the hedge and the window but you couldnt have prised her out of there now just listen to me lol said please i cant do it any more i can write lyrics for other people but i have to have that degree of separation i cant write them for me i cant marry up the tunes i start to imagine being on stage again i start shaking i wasnt any good even then all i ever did was try and be nick drake but he wasnt appreciated then was he plus he was dead anyway now hes a bleedin icon and you could be we could be dont even have to die karl was laughing lol had a distinct memory of karl kicking his guitar over cant you write anything but this wimpy shit whenre your fucking balls gonna drop all im saying karl giving the crushed can an extra squeeze until it was the shape of an apple core is you give it some thought we dont have to go on the road i know how that messed you up i know we had problems problems problems oh jesus he was losing it the cat alarmed jumping off his knee my parents didnt speak to me after that ever again my devout godfearing parents three years later my mum died not having spoken a word to me and my dad at the funeral my dad turned his back listen karl didnt want to hear this shit were looking at real money and were older we know how it works i know how it works ill see you dont get shafted look we do an album first give me six new songs and well recycle some of the old stuff maybe even do a couple of drakes lol was shaking his head so hard his ponytail was banging his nose what you got to lose karl waving a hand around the room at the two old chairs the table the woodstove and the guitar the bitch obviously took you to the cleaners left you with the rubbish and the cat no she only took her clothes and a few other things the rest i just got rid of why you do that lol shook his head how could he explain about traherne the need for simplicity the need to appreciate the real moon the actual stars old people do that karls face was an open sneer when they know they dont have long tidying up unloading all their junk giving away their prized possessions finally having to admit they cant take it with them bad sign when you start tidying up ominous prodding lol like he used to do physically when they couldnt agree about a song or what to do after the gig using the word ominous talking earlier about a sign no coincidence hed remembered that these were always lols words that lol was deeply superstitious little mr ominous they called him you have something in mind son lol shook his head too quickly shit karls eyes lit up youve thought about it havent you hasnt everybody only you only you would say that look karl stood up lol shrank back into his chair ill go all right ill leave you to think about it and ill try not to worry cause if you were gonna do it youdve done it by now kurt cobain fair enough he was mega now hes a legend but drake he did it too soon and you youre just i mean whod notice whod give a shit whod put flowers on your grave a short while later jane crept away wrapped in a clammy confusion of emotions theres something ive been meaning to ask you merrily said as they walked back into the village the footpath fringing the orchard it goes back to you know that night ah lucy devenish said twelfth night what a disturbing introduction that must have been to our little community after it happened when we were all deeply shocked and uncomprehending i heard you whispering i knew it i knew it you have good ears not specially what did you know only that someone was going to die on that particular night i thought it might have been sooner but when autumn turned into winter and it didnt happen i began to suspect it might be something rather extraordinary the orchard had told me you see right merrily said calmly i see of course you dont and who could expect you to ive been close to apples and orchards and particularly that orchard all my life the apples the fruit of herefordshire its colours glow from the earth its spirit shines out of the land and the apples are terribly sensitive the apples know know when someones going to die oh yes i see miss devenish threw her a glance sorry what you have to watch out for merrily is uncharacteristic behaviour unseasonal phenomena several apple trees were overhanging the path although not in a graceful way merrily thought the apple was an ungainly little tree spiky and irregular theyre going to be laden with blossom this year lucy observed that a good sign lucy sniffed implies a big crop but nothings certain about the apple especially this particular species the pharisees red why do they call it that lucy smiled you asked me how i knew there was death in the wind its because last autumn there was blossom out of season ah merrily said an old country omen a bloom on the tree when the apples are ripe i is a sure termination of somebodys life pronounced miss lucy devenish classy piece of rhyming merrily said so there was blossom in the orchard last autumn as late as november lucy said but only on one tree merrily turned away from the orchard annoyed with herself as a minister of god for shuddering before we part my dear yes i want you to know whatever you may have heard about me that i have your best interests close to my heart and if anything disturbs you anything frightens you like what merrily saw that the old girl was no longer smiling oh i think ill wait for your specific questions i dont want to quarrel huh merrily said and dont dismiss the orchard it still surrounds the village part two as in the house i sate alone and desolate i lift mine eye up to the wall and in the silent hall saw nothing mine thomas traherne poems of felicity the feudalist early monday evening uncle ted took them back to the vicarage apart from the new sink and cupboards in the kitchen squarepin sockets everywhere and a black hole where the monster electric fire had been stuffed into the inglenook it wasnt a lot different its still huge merrily said hopelessly dont worry girl ted squeezed her arm youll grow into it in no time you and janell fill this place in no time in fact he beamed the way youve held things together youve already grown a hell of a lot over the past few weeks in everyones estimation thats very nice of you but it was just the honeymoon period nonsense ted chuckled dermot dropped in last night to deplete my scotch he says youre holding your own better than hed imagined your own woman he says thats good bloody dermot bloody ted she wondered what else theyd discussed her delinquent daughter product of a disastrous marriage to a crook she felt the vicarage looming behind her huge and ancient and forbidding like someone elses family seat merrily ted said youll come to love it ive been in some really awful draughty old mausoleums but this place has such a lovely warm enclosing sort of atmosphere that youll simply forget how big it is after a while especially when jane has her own apartment eh jane grinned merrily said well see ted vanished into church street merrily wondering when she would get to meet his widow jane disappeared eagerly into the vicarage merrily was about to follow her somewhat less eagerly when gomer parry appeared in the drive blinking through his glasses unlit cigarette wagging in his teeth for a pensioner gomer had a surprising amount of halfsuppressed energy removals vicar what you got planned erm shed given more thought to how they were going to spread the stuff around to make the vicarage look less like a derelict sixteenthcentury warehouse than the method of actually getting it here only if you ent made arrangements see you dont wanner go botherin with no expensive removals firm when i got a very clean truck entirely at your disposal when you thought about it it was going to be a bit complicated its all around cheltenham you see all over the place some bits in store some at my mothers house some at no problem vicar couple hours round trip piece o pisscake sides which gomer leaned closer taking out his cigarette confidential keeps the ole truck in business know what i mean minnie her says the place looks like a bloody scrapyard i says you never know what youre gonner need in life how many vehicles have you got there gomer oh no moren four now and gwynneth the digger the mind boggled it was only a bungalow with a garden hers given me three months to get em out see but minnies a bit more like you know religious than what i am so i tells her if this yere planthire equipment is in the service of the lord get my point understood bless you gomer look ill pay you in advance gomer backed off outraged all right the petrol at least the petrol diesel whatever how many gallons ten twelve full tank in there already vicar he looked up at the house three floors eh gonner take a bit o manoeuvring about what ill do ill get my nephew nev big lad what day you want us any day but thursday which is nevs day for the cesspits oh and tomorrow inquest tomorrow see inquest edgar powell opened back in january then adjourned took em long enough to get it sorted ole edgarll be compost by now youre a witness gomer oh hell aye me and about half a dozen others probly drag on till flamin teatime specially if its true rods gonner get doc asprey to stand in the box and tell em his dad was halfway round the twist why would rod want him to do that stigma vicar no way do he want his ole man put down as a suicide so if they got evidence of edgar bein three bales short of a full stack its more likely he done it by accident see right she did come to think of it remember alf saying garrod powell was insisting his father hadnt taken his own life and what are you going to tell the coroner gomer pends what they ask me all i can say is what i seen which is not a lot on account my glasses got all bloodied up but before that i do recall as when the others put up their guns edgar he just didnt now make of that what you like i suppose itll be a question of whether he just had a funny turn and got all confused or or he had it all worked out gotter say that dont ring true to me he wasnt no kind of showoff farmers ent as a rule youd think if he wanted to do away with hisself hed do it in the barn yet i dunno he werent daft in any respect ole edgar how bout wednesday that would be brilliant this is above and beyond gomer gomer slipped his cigarette into his grin you dont owe me nothing vicar never think that but there may be one small thing one day just one hows the kiddie now oh god does everybody know hell vicar dont go worryin about that they all knows what that cassidy girls like too promiscuous by half minnie reckons i just hope she means precocious merrily said aye gomer said that was probly it jane stood on the first landing looking up hey listen why dont we just move in like tonight her voice echoing in the emptiness she was still in her school uniform the dark blue blazer the pleated skirt merrily at the foot of the stairs felt a heartpang of love and fear that she wouldnt have been able to explain how can we do that even with gomers help itll be nearly the weekend before we can get all the stuff in and sorted out besides with the diocese paying for the hotel it means we can get everything right for once instead of being in the usual chaos going to be a disaster she was thinking you could get all their stuff beds included into two rooms theyd be rattling around like two peas in a coffee tin weve got sleeping bags mum we could spread them out in the drawing room get the feel of the place go on itd be fun on those flags jane you are joking jane stared down the stairs at her you dont really want to move in at all do you thats stupid merrily said uncomfortably all around her doors above her doors all of them half open to signify empty rooms she wanted to rush from door to door shepherding jane before her banging each one shut and then finally the front door behind them as they ran into the square and the sanctuary of the black swan i can tell by the way you talk about it jane said always going on about how big it is at the swan its kind of temporary like a holiday in here youve got to face what youre taking on like the full burden god the perceptiveness of this kid was frightening come on mum theres no shame in admitting it i just want to do it efficiently i did it remind her of moving from the flat into the fourbedroomed it seemed enormous at the time suburban villa that sean had suddenly acquired at an amazingly modest price from a client somewhere for her to organize decorate somewhere to keep her occupied while i just want it all to be you know right merrily said which right now seemed an impossible dream for a majorleague christian jane said you dont half lie a lot merrily felt her face darken the doorbell saved them both heard you were finally taking up occupancy called to see if i could be of any help no you didnt thats kind merrily said but were just giving the place the onceover we wont be actually moving in for a couple of days yet james bulldavies looked around the empty dusty hall sniffed once like a pointer on a heath hed obviously waited until gomer parry had gone damn shed as good as told him to leave it for a while he was either dense or simply didnt believe his family was obliged to bow to the wishes of anyone in ledwardine interesting sermon of yours yesterday mrs watkins wrote that after the meeting i suppose didnt write it at all merrily said brusquely came off the top of my head more or less sometimes you have to busk it really dont recall hayden busking perhaps he was just better at it than me she said sweetly er i think i can cobble together a mug of tea if you have the time cant do any better than that at the moment he looked down at her with suspicion perhaps wondering if shed heard about him being rolling drunk in the square on saturday night offering to lay his concubine on the cobbles she walked through to the kitchen which had fitted units now but still some of the old formicaed shelves and white tiles she wrinkled her nose not yet her kind of kitchen james bulldavies shuffled awkwardly in the middle of the flagged floor she was clearly not his kind of vicar he didnt know what to do with her he wasnt even happy looking at her preferred the ceiling used to be two rooms this as i recall when i was a boy that section over there used to be a pantry or buttery or something did you come here often someone had left a tiny kettle for the aga merrily filled it over the open sink with all the pipework visible underneath i mean recently only when there was business to deal with parish business dont offend anyone called bulldavies ted had said the church would be rubble but for them strange how things changed from what shed heard upper hall was closer to rubble these days not a great deal left from the old days his divorce presumably had not helped were there children or was that another source of pressure the inheritance factor perhaps after the parish business had been dealt with hed have discussed some of his problems with alf as his priest his padre the way a man like james would never be able to do with a woman because women were mothers or aunts or sisters or you fucked them merrily set the kettle on the stove perhaps she was wrong sorry theres nowhere to sit well have to lean on the aga it occurred to her that this was the first time theyd been alone together the squire and the parsoness he didnt want in his village she hoped jane would stay out james bulldavies propped himself stiffly against one end of the big stoves chromium bar leaving a good two feet between them a woman in a cassock perverse surely or did it secretly turn him on like say the matron at his public school merrily suspected she would never know that sermon she squeezed the warm bar i suppose i was just stalling for time message seemed to be that you were going to lay the whole vexed issue before the almighty let him sort it out if you want to look at it that way yes i suppose thats what im going to do in the end way i look at it he said it has buggerall to do with god question of honour and responsibility meaning your honour my responsibility merrily looked sideways at him but he wouldnt meet her eyes stared across the kitchen his full lips in a kind of pout a surprisingly powerful shaft of evening sunlight brutally exposed his bald patch and put a shine on his tightly shaven jaw hed shaved again before coming here why did you walk out the other night mr davies idve thought youd have wanted to stay and confront the enemy he lowered his gaze to the stained flags perhaps i couldnt trust myself not to smash his smug face in oh i think you could disciplined military chap like you he exhaled a short laugh i mean i can see your point merrily said if hes got to make a statement about the treatment of gay people why use a real character who might not in fact have been its personal its political yes obviously oh i dont mean poopolitics though obviously thats the other chip on his shoulder coffey fell in love if you like with the village the area wanted the keepers lodge bottom of my drive wasnt for sale but it was empty had to dispense with the keepers services year or two ago matter of cash flow but thats the nearest dwelling to upper hall and i wasnt letting it go for peanuts made him pay made him pay and he resents that does he look bulldavies levered himself from the stove he wanted the lodge i wasnt touting never told him he wouldnt have to spend a substantial amount of money on the place oh didnt need that much to make it perfectly habitable of course to turn it into the kind of perfumed brothel he wanted i mean the water supply was perfectly fine nobody has to have a a whirlpool bath merrily tried not to smile his father would probably have said the same about hot water so its a personal vendetta because of what youve cost him thats what youre saying i think its a probability you should consider that hes written a whole play to get back at you hardly a whole play vicar im a bit lost here merrily said i dont even know for sure why this would hurt you so much i know your familys wellembedded in the village but i mean was one of your ancestors seriously involved in the persecution of williams bulldavies didnt answer he looked down at the flagstones and bit his upper lip with his lower teeth which made him look momentarily feral and it was at that moment that dear little jane decided to stroll airily in mum i as if she hadnt been listening outside the door as if shed had no idea there was a visitor oh hello bulldavies looked at the kid and nodded merrily said thinking fast jane if were going to spend the evening here we need to eat why dont you get some money out of my bag and pop over to the chip shop they wont be open yes merrily said grimly they will janes eyes had the mutinous look of one whod been stitched up she shrugged ok then can i have a pickled egg get two when the front door slammed with a vaultlike echo merrily turned and faced the squire i think we have enough time before she gets back for you to tell me what all this is really about the wooden clock in the fishandchip shop window indicated that it wouldnt be open for another quarter of an hour so shed lied again mum lied all the time like vicars had some kind of special dispensation the chip shop was on the corner of old barn lane and the hereford road on the edge of the village and therefore outside the main conservation area which probably explained why it was allowed to exist it was still a dulllooking joint denied the brilliantly greasy illuminated signs you found on chippies in liverpool jane turned away and strolled back towards the village centre wondering if thered be time to nip into the black swan and ditch the uniform circumstances dictated otherwise as she emerged into church street colette cassidy was walking down from the square colette seemed to be studying the texture of the cobbles and neither of them acknowledged the other until they were about to collide hi jane said kind of throwaway hows it going colette wore jeans and a black scoopnecked top under a studded leather jacket but no makeup no nosestud she carried a small brownpaper bag ok jane said i suppose get much hassle bit you they do the motions uh colette proffered the bag i got you this oh she took the bag surprised it felt like a cd you were asking about lol robinson thats his last album reissued well his band from way back one of the guys at school bought one after she read in some magazine how this guy out of radiohead likes them when i saw what it was called i thought youd anyway it was the last copy oh wow this was unexpectedly touching thats amazing i mean thanks it was only midprice colette said dont take it out of the bag or peoplell think were really sad listen im having this kind of a birthday party my sixteenth friday after next just guys from school and one or two marginally cool people and dr samedi this dj whos like really cool dr samedis mojomix heavy voodoo taney sounds excellent jane said wheres it going to be theyre letting me have the restaurant big gesture theyve promised to go out and stay out are they mad well barry the managerll be in charge but hes relatively ok also its got to be invitation only no riffraff no lowlife colette smiled cynically cool jane said if i tell mum its at the country kitchen no problem good colette said listen i mean thanks for not grassing me up about what happened like it was pretty shitty of me all that edgar powell stuff i was feeling moderately pissed off by then with those tossers and everything so like thanks no problem so you gonna tell me huh what happened weird scenes janey i thought youd gone gone where like dead then suddenly opening your eyes rambling about these kind of little lights and then youve like gone again comastuff jane felt strange she looked behind colette and along old barn street there was a couple of women with a pram heading down from the market cross no one else in sight she felt strange like she wasnt here at all colettes eyes flashed oh come on janey dont tell me you dont remember dont shit me i dont what did devenish say then she just brought me back she was just like cool about it i dont even know how she came to be there lol phoned her any crisis he calls lucy shes like his therapist poor little sod he was really shit scared wouldnt go in that big old orchard in the dark without lucy to protect him well he wouldnt go in with me i think hes even scared of me you imagine that jane didnt say anything colette was trying to recapture ground saying lol was scared of her she decided not to tell colette about what shed heard under lols window maybe the person to tell was miss devenish really needed to see the old girl like soon i dont know why the fuck i bothered colette said bitterly on the way back to the chip shop jane took the cd out of its paper bag when she saw what it was called she gasped people dont understand think were simply stuffshirted shits hunting shooting and fishing lording it over the peasants james bulldavies stood up straight and still very much the army officer we merely serve he said we serve our country we serve the countryside wasnt for us the traditional landowners place just wouldnt look the same wouldnt have the same atmosphere the same beauty the same harmony were the stewards the custodians we dont have power we have responsibility it sounded very noble it didnt however sound like the man who liked to call his mistress a slinky whore while she called him my lord unless of course that was all down to alison and her feminine wiles bringing out the feudalist in him im an army man understand the army welloiled machine puts human relations dealing with people into some form of order you know who you are what you are most chaps like me when they come out go on calling themselves colonel as though they still have some sort of authority as though the commoners should salute look in the local phone book colonel this colonel that pointless meaningless affectation no time for it im mr bulldavies now james to chaps i wish id had in the army knock off some of the damn pretentions like terrence cassidy presumably merrily smiled to herself ive no illusions james paced the kitchen wasnt expecting it to happen when it did wasnt expecting the old man to keel over for another twenty years but no getting out of it when the time comes you have to shoulder the responsibility and thats that no arguments and you become someone else in the army youre what you are no complications here no getting away from it youre what your family is what your family was you have a responsibility not only to the living the living people the living countryside but also to the dead you see where im heading mrs watkins merrily stirred the tea in the pot armystrength not too strong civilian now do you know what cassidy said to me came to see me yesterday dithering but james he said this was a long time ago you credit that mans an arsehole shows the state of britain that the rural economys now increasingly reliant on specimens like this bloody caterers his eyes met merrilys for the first time they were pale blue and showed a surprising insecurity im sorry if i speak crudely youre well never minced words with hayden my last parish was in a rundown part of liverpool merrily said the only soldiers were squaddies back from iraq they tended to be the more refined parishioners james barked a laugh i do understand merrily said that three centuries in the history of a rural family like yours is not so very long i said to him jamess lower lip jutted and curled cassidy i said youve been here about two minutes in the past three centuries your family what anyone can trace of it has probably lived in a couple of dozen different houses in god knows how many different towns however many generations it goes back whatever the rights and wrongs of the situation this is my family in my village how could i possibly condone some fatuous little pageant he spat out the word like a pip which seeks to demean and ridicule my heritage yes the local magistrate was thomas bull yes he was one of the party who confronted wil williams yes he was there when they found the body and yes he believed the evidence yes he was convinced williams was in league with the devil and should die for it he was a man of his time homosexuality doesnt come into it and i wont have his memory soiled by some sordid little queer in the name of socalled art and a few dozen visiting trendies paying london prices for fancy fodder at cassidys country bloody kitchen he came up to merrily the stove was hot against her bottom but she didnt move went along with the wassailing fiasco last winter because that was at least an attempt at reinstating a tradition but this festivals in danger of going the wrong way and dragging my village along with it realize theres going to be some change even if i disagree with it recognize that your presence heres part of that change and naturally youre opposed to the ordination of women james backed off a little there are some who say it strengthens the church have my doubts about that but theres nothing i can do now youre here and you at least seem like a reasonable sort of woman head screwed on thank you very much merrily said acidly but you must understand my position mrs watkins where my family stands we have a role that role regardless of how we may feel as individuals is to resist change its what we do we defend and so i opposed your appointment made no secret of it well all right that battles lost its over youre here generally speaking under most circumstances you can now count on my support merrily said nothing so long he said as you remain sensitive to the best interests of this village i see and if merrily prised herself painfully from the aga on some significant and controversial issue we dont agree on what those best interests might be i really dont think said james bulldavies that you would ever be so shortsighted but say there was say there was an issue on which your idea of what was in the best interests of the village was in conflict with what i considered to be morally and spiritually right he sighed you make it hard for me mrs watkins and perhaps for yourself merrily took a deep breath you havent answered my question how would you react in a situation where we found it impossible to work out our differences all right depending on the seriousness of the er matter under discussion i should be obliged to use what influence i have to get you out of the parish like your wretched ancestor did with wil williams merrily didnt say it she didnt say it thank you for your honesty she said he nodded to her and left before she could pour his tea when jane came back with the fish and chips she found her mother whitefaced and furious hands wrapped around the chrome bar of the aga and twisting mum jane stood in the doorway holding the hot paper package what put them in the warming oven mums voice was a small curledup thing well go and get the car car and the sleeping bags if you want were staying the night yeah we bloody are oh what changed your mind something he said were getting our feet under the bloody table were letting the good folk of ledwardine know weve arrived mums hands had stopped twisting on the bar she was very very still now no more shit shed never used that word to jane before no more shit grown women or what trust nobody ok not a very christian maxim but merrily dragged a bulging suitcase through the black swans porch and out on to the steps remembering being in this very spot on saturday night in the frozen moments before the james bulldavies drama when dermot child had so confidently slipped an arm around her waist shortly after explaining to her how cassidy and powell politicians both had nominated her for the role of parish scapegoat stitched up sexually patronized and now openly threatened stuff them all even less christian what was this place doing to her were all rural parishes this stifling jane had already carried down a bag full of toiletries and overnight stuff a few clothes merrily had stopped at reception to leave a message for roland the manager who with the approach of the real tourist season had been mildly indicating that he could use their rooms more profitably as a tourist venue ledwardine was finally taking off just at the moment and for the first time merrily felt like taking off too theyd been in ledwardine over a month and the only resident shed felt entirely relaxed with had been miss devenish of whom the cautious ted clowes had once said delightful old girl may be some sort of witch dont be tempted to get too close plaintive music drifted across the residents car park in the yard behind the inn it was coming from the volvo their onetime family car later spurned by sean for something smaller and faster and as it turned out less resistant to impact the volvo still had the eightspeaker stereo with builtin cdautochanger presented to sean as such items often had been by a client as merrily got in a wispy male voice sang low and breathy over an acoustic wash walked her up and down the garden in the rain i called her name she didnt know it turn it down huh jane isnt it great its like really moving his girlfriends a junkie and he doesnt its ok sounds like whats his name he killed himself nick drake nick drake killed himself we had all his albums when i was a kid courtesy of your uncle jonathan in his morose phase listen i said we wouldnt be back tonight but wed get the rooms cleaned out by tomorrow night so that roland can charge twice as much for them so dont make any other arrangements all right would i no flower merrily said you wouldnt youre my very best friend oh please jane made a vomiting sound you cant be that sad merrily turned on the engine for the first time in days all she had to do was drive out of the yard across the square and about thirty yards down church street to where the vicarage drive was overhung by a weeping birch although she didnt even get out of second gear it felt like driving across some distant frontier into another country a foreign country where no one could be trusted oh i can flower merrily said through the eight speakers on the dashboard the rear parcel shelf and all four doors the same voice sang another song its muted chorus concluding and its always on the sunny days you feel you cant go on jane picked up the cd box from the dash running her finger down the track list as the volvo wobbled over the cobbles the track was called sunny days and it was followed by one called song for nick by nightfall they must have walked all over the vicarage about four times trying to make it seem smaller and failing as merrily always knew they would yeah sure it was a big mistake coming to camp here a futile gesture of defiance from merrily a silly adventure for jane they were both overwhelmed even small houses looked enormous without furniture even small new houses this place without a tv set a microwave even a bookcase full of paperbacks was oppressive with age in the light of naked bulbs the walls looked grey and damp upstairs where wardrobes had stood there were great meshes of cobwebs big as fishermens nets before jane said before it just looked big you know what i mean merrily nodded freshly vacated the house was huge and naked and dead its skeleton of woodwormed oak exposed the shrunken remains of trees killed half a millennium ago embalmed and mummified in the walls how with their minimal furniture their token pots and pans could they possibly get its blood flowing again i wonder if im allowed to take in lodgers merrily said gloomily maybe one of those guys who sit in the middle of hereford with a penny whistle and a dog or four of them jane said all with dogs barking because it was so quiet whether it was the trees all around or whatever you wouldnt know you were near the centre of the village after seans death before shed gone to college shed sold all the fancy new furniture the richlawyer toys this is tragic her mother had said all these nice thingsyou may find you regret it one day when you have a big house again im never going to have a big house again merrily had said very calmly still jane said were seeing it at its very worst it can only get better and better cant it it can flower and it will look lets forget this idea mrs peats coming tomorrow the cleaner why dont we let her have a go at it first come on lets go back to the pub jane hesitated she was standing by the window in the drawing room made mauve by dull twilight through the surrounding trees across the room the inglenook yawned like an open tomb its lintel two feet thick thered been an archaic coaleffect electric fire in there when the haydens were here now it was just blackened stone and you couldnt light a fire because the wide chimney had been sealed off for insulation buy you dinner ok merrily said we could extend to that not in the bar i mean in the restaurant those chipsll be all stuck together by now anyway it was just stone flags underfoot like the ones in the church but without the memorials and carvedout skulls you could spend a years stipend just carpeting the downstairs what do you say flower no jane stamped a foot on the stone we should stay its stupid to be scared of your house are we grown women or what in the end they slept in the bedroom merrily had used that first night at least it had a wooden floor they spread out the red and blue sleeping bags bought for a camping holiday in the lake district a holiday which never happened the summer after sean died it was still cold at night especially in here the sleeping bags were a couple of feet apart up against the wall with the door in it two kids in a haunted house isnt it funny jane said into the darkness how when you finally get to bed on a cold night you always want to go to the loo all in the mind which means im not going with you did i ask you to think of something else merrily said itll go away ok silence odd really a place this old you expected creaks and groans didnt timberframe houses kind of settle down for the night mum mmmm you ever know anybody who committed suicide the kid had always been good at choosing her moments i cant think merrily said nobody close anyway there was edgar powell of course whose inquest was to be concluded tomorrow but she hadnt really known him only seen him in the last hour of the last night of his life go to sleep jane what happened to nick drake merrily sighed i dont know if that was suicide or not you said he killed himself well he died of an overdose of antidepressants so he must have taken them himself whether he actually intended to take an overdose seems to be questionable he was just a sad withdrawn young guy whose career wasnt taking off thats all it was before you were born anyway before you were born another lifetime before jane was born merrily had been almost a child in a few years time jane would be older than merrily had been then was probably already in some ways more mature over the congealed chips shed explained how james bulldavies had made her so angry and jane had said if hes so sensitive to the best interests of the village whats he doing shacking up with that woman what indeed merrily rolled on to her side mum what if dad hadnt been killed would he have gone to jail god almighty dark night of the soul or what i dont know its possible he might just have been struck off wasnt a criminal as such he was just frustrated and he could see people around him making lots of money in unorthodox ways and they became his clients you know all this when did you find out when it was too late to stop him why didnt you leave him then i expect i would have and would you have still got into theological college sure but would you still have been acceptable as a vicar i dont know did you feel sort of soiled because wed benefited from dirty money yeah did that make you all the keener to get into the church to throw yourself into it you make it sound like a canal did you love him even when you found out he was bent you dont stop loving people just like what about when you found out about his affair i dont know i hated him then i suppose i thought i hated him i mean im not jesus am i you forgiven him now i like to think so if he hadnt been killed would you have i dont know would have depended on what he did next if he was sorry yeah if he was sorry jane whats all this about janes thin white arm came out of the sleeping bag i just keep going back over things everything seems not real like a dream i have to keep working out how we got here just in case this is a dream i dont really like it merrily didnt know how to respond is it because i got drunk is it the cider does it go on affecting you for days merrily had to smile no she reached out and took the small cold hand and im afraid this is not a dream janey love is all this anything to do with that record the cd you had in the car whered it come from oh a friend gave it to me right merrily closed her eyes she was determined they werent going to do this again tomorrow shed make a deal with roland for another couple of nights until they had their own beds in here i told you about lol jane said its his old band he was apparently very influenced by nick drake only musically one hopes jane didnt reply merrily opened her eyes and lay on her back gazing through the long window pondering on this lol about whom jane seemed to know a little too much a small yellow light as from a candle or a childs nightlight shone between the thickening trees from a window across the street later much later when she awoke to a tugging on her hand the only light through the window was from a misty quarter moon which turned the room grey damn why cant she hold out till morning merrily squirmed not halfawake out of the warm sleeping bag into the damp air the bedroom door was already ajar and she slid cautiously through the gap she didnt need to do this of course but she knew that jane for all her bravado would not like wandering alone around the not even halfknown rooms of the big empty house outside there was the passage with doors and doors and doors and one must be the bathroom she couldnt remember which only that it was a stark sixties bathroom with a black plastic lavatory seat and cracked tiles everywhere shed left her dressing gown at the black swan and it was predawn cold out here in just a short nightdress bare feet on oak boards across the stairs the landing window was an oblong of flat aluminium jane the house was absolutely still why cant you creak have you no personality jaane which one was the bathroom she opened a door space and silence sucked at her and she shut it quickly a pace along the passage and she lost the moonlight now there was only the faint green spot of a smokealarm on a ceiling beam and the deeper darkness of doorways she put a hand into a recess found a cold doorknob and then drew back jane shouting this time but the passage swallowed it she could almost see the short bright name narrowing like a light down a tunnel vanishing in no time she was aware of a slow panic like a dark train coming and she grabbed the handle and turned it and the door didnt open perhaps this was the bathroom and the kid had locked it jane a sudden yielding and she stumbled the oak door rolling away into the vastness of a long long bedroom empty as an open field and merrily grabbed at the handle and hauled the door closed turning away and finding herself facing another door and she opened that and there was the lavatory with its seat up and caught in a frail moonbeam making an apologetic o as in no no jane no no no no no she fled along the passage all the doors closed and blank she felt shed been out here for hours trying door after door and in that time jane must have finished in the bathroom and gone back to bed so which one was the bedroom which one was the bloody bedroom all the doors were closed and shed surely left the bedroom door open hadnt she but maybe jane had closed it shut her out jane had shut her out jane she screamed and ran wildly from door to door all the same all black oak and all shut and spun round and round and found herself facing stairs where was she now had she gone downstairs had she gone down to the dreadful kitchen or the drawing room with its chimney blocked she couldnt have no these were the other stairs the next stairs oh jesus there were more stairs the extra floor a third and empty floor of doors and doors and doors she stood at the bottom of the stairs and couldnt look up she hugged herself and felt sweat cold on her shoulders she knew of course that she would have to go up there in all her dreams of being in a house and suddenly discovering it had a third storey she had accepted that sooner or later she was going to have to climb those final stairs because of the presence because there was someone up there waiting for her in the best dreams it was herself if she climbed the stairs she would find her true self discover her hidden potential this said the analysts she had read over the years was the true meaning of this dream it was about reaching for the higher dimension or in a spiritual sense carrying the lantern of faith along the dark corridors to the foot of the last stairs at the top of which was the greater light but in the worst dreams the presence at the top of the stairs along the final passage behind the final doors was neither her higher self nor the light of lights for a while after his death it had been sean still greedily grinning through the torn metal through his blood so which one was this the good dream or the bad dream no it wasnt a dream this was the promised reality the culmination she had obeyed her calling given herself up to the holy spirit and moved at last into the house with three floors oh god the tugging on the hand jane no all right so be it merrily relaxed the grip on her cold shoulders let her arms fall to her side she looked up couldnt breathe mum oh my god my god my god my god my god i cant breathe mum her chest was rigid as though there was a tourniquet around it winding tighter and tighter squashing her breasts she rolled over gasping mummy her eyes blinked open and the breath gushed into her and she sat up coughing jane had hold of her shoulders big frightened eyes dark hair fluffed up and haloed by the pinkyorange light of dawn youre back merrily croaked mum i havent been anywhere you went to the bathroom no merrily turned to the door it was closed you were having a dream jane said it couldnt have been a dream i followed you out jane shook her head wryly and skipped to the window oh look you can see the hills you can see right over the houses across the road i bet its brilliant from upstairs on the top floor in my apartment she turned back to merrily and grinned ill go and make some tea merrily closed her eyes when she opened them jane was gone the door slamming behind her merrilys hair felt cold and damp around the numbness of her face and her chest felt like it had been sat on she was exhausted hazey jane of course shed had this kind of nightmare before everybody had the point about dreams was that your reactions were often intensified because you were so helpless apprehension mild fear turned very quickly into terror small disquieting things were sometimes loaded with a bloated menace which gradually deflated when you awoke well usually very occasionally the essence of it remained draped over you like dusty motheaten rags for most of the day merrily knelt under the pinkwashed window hoping to rinse her spirits with prayer but it was mechanical she couldnt find the level it was as though the nightmare had blocked her spiritual pores and something else was blocked what did i see she kept asking herself what did i see when i looked up those stairs and something cold crept up her vertebrae and left behind it a formless drifting dread she stood up and shook herself found a towel and some shampoo in the overnight bag went for a bath but nearly chickened out the sight of the cold tiled bathroom made clammy skin and sweatstiffened hair seem rather less offensive and she had to dismiss sinful images of the warm creamy comforts of the ensuite at the black swan the urge to slip back there for one last glorious soak anyway it was only about fivethirty too early even to get into the swan oh come on are we grown women or what she helped a big spider to freedom and turned on the flaking chromium taps noticing that the oak floorboards had been concealed probably for the past thirty years under wellworn wellcracked black and white lino tiles during alf haydens lengthy tenure the nouveau riche village of ledwardine had managed to leave its vicarage a long way behind you her daughter said looking thoughtful are looking pretty rough theyd bought a loaf last night from the late store and jane was trying to make the aga make toast why dont you just go back to bed what bloody bed merrily leaned over the stove with a cigarette in her mouth wondering if there was somewhere to ignite it evidently there wasnt im quite sure jane said primly that your god wouldnt want you to smoke like a chimney listen flower if you can find the bit in the bible where it says that all right sorry just because i had a decent nights sleep and you didnt thats because youre a child an innocent look i dont suppose if i were to mind your toast you could run upstairs and fetch my zippo from the bathroom jane raised her eyes cynically to the ceiling and trotted off merrily stood resting her forehead on folded arms on the plate rack over the stove stress hell shed only been here a month it hadnt started yet she wasnt even official until the end of the week and people were still not sure where to find her there were communion classes to organize visits to the primary school the senior citizens social club an invitation to address the wi and thered be more much more domestic situations where as shed learned in liverpool a clergyman would never have been approached failing marriages problem kids spiteful invalid mothers who declined to die any one of which would make something like the wil williams controversy seem precious and fatuous she needed to get it all into perspective shed wander over to the church after breakfast when jane had gone to school and she wouldnt come out until she felt purged although it was more than an hour before the school bus was due jane didnt see much point in hanging around an empty house with a grouchy parent besides it was good walking about the village before most people were up and about it sparkled as though the air itself were alive strange and she might see miss devenish the need to see miss devenish was in fact pretty urgent firstly she had to thank her for whatever she did on saturday night secondly there was the question of lol robinson the way that guy karl had been winding him up the talk of suicide and kurt cobain and nick drake and then colette implying that lol was already wound so tight he couldnt go out in the dark without miss devenish to hold his hand karl was obviously the karl windling bass backing vocals mentioned on the back of the cd karl was offering to kickstart lols career again and on the evidence of the album for which lol had written all the songs lol was good lol was brilliant but for some reason he didnt want to go back and it wasnt just a case of playing hard to get he hadnt even wanted to see karl hed been afraid to see karl so why was he in this state why was he hiding himself away in ledwardine why was he alone why had the cool beautiful alison left him for the horrible and grotesquely old james bulldavies money and status probably actually what was even more strange was how someone as sensitive as lol had ever got involved with someone as glossy and superficial as alison it all made jane feel anxious in a rather thrilling way and protective because karl windling was such a bully she tried to feel the state of mind youd have to be in to want to just end your life where you didnt want to do anything else in the world ever again or go anywhere or love anyone or write another sad song she couldnt imagine it she was probably emotionally backward though perhaps in some cases it was just kind of an impulse thing especially if you were already more than a bit unstable she wondered where miss devenish lived no point in going to the shop this early but miss devenish and jane they needed to talk it was going to be another warm day she walked up to the square school books in a canvas airline bag over one shoulder school blazer over the other nearly fortyfive minutes to kill before the bus was due school french and economics and maths then double games she looked up into a tide of flawless blue coming in over a smooth sandbank of early cloud what really was the point of going to sodding school today when there was so much she needed to learn here in the village schoolwork essays and stuff you could always get over that with a bit of effort real life not so easy a snatch of one of lols songs kept coming back to her and its always on the sunny days you feel you cant go on that album was sending her signals she just knew that the girls karl windling had seen in andys records in hereford had been the friends of colettes whod bought the album it was all fated jane watkins was somehow destined to rescue the tragic lol robinson the cobbles glittered in affirmation strange it wasnt a schoolgirl crush of course nothing so immature anyway he was old enough to be her father no this was on an altogether higher level shed known last night when shed first opened the brownpaper bag and seen the name of the band on the front of the cd the band formed by lol robinson over fifteen years ago before she was born or perhaps perhaps exactly at the time she was born some kind of omen it had to be the name so exactly summing up the way she was feeling had been feeling since well saturday night lols old band had been called eerily hazey jane hardly even thinking about what she was doing jane wandered past the market cross and into the cool secretive shade of blackberry lane the trees overhead throbbing and pulsing with spring spring like shed never felt it before a grey van was parked outside the church who could that be the main door was still shut so merrily went round the back with her fat bunch of jailers keys however the small southeast door leading in by the bull chapel was already ajar as she slipped inside there was a vast discordant wail from the organ and she jumped alarmed an organ in an empty church was a spooky sound see dermot childs voice called out its sticking ive tried working it up and down hmm may need replacing you cant keep on bodging these things for ever midlands accent obviously mr gerald watts the organ repair man from bromsgrove ted had mentioned him his phone number was in the book of essential parish contacts and dermot had remarked the other week that the organ would soon need some attention problem is dermot id have to make one to fit can you manage like this for a couple of weeks sounds like i havent got a choice merrily slid into the bull chapel it was separated from the organ by an eighteenthcentury wooden screen so they couldnt see each other she and dermot and mr watts the organ man she stood with her back to the screen didnt want to interrupt them so whats the damage gerry roughly if its over fifty ill need to check it with the vicar sunlight fanned in through the chapels leaded window and pooled in the eyes of thomas bull they were fully open she hadnt really noticed that before it was disturbing abnormal his lids surely should be lowered displaying for eternity the familiar and usually false humility of the wealthy dead all right what ill do dermot if its looking a bit heavy ill send a copy of the estimate to hayden but ill give you a ring first so youll know it isnt hayden any more lord no id forgotten saw her picture in the hereford times looked like a pretty fair swap to me unless it was an unusually flattering photo didnt do her justice gerry didnt do her justice absolute little cracker i tell you its bloody hard to concentrate on your playing sometimes merrily was aware of smiling what in the end could you say must be a new experience for you mr watts said fancying the vicar least i hope it is its a funny thing gerry its a bit like nurses the uniform gives it an added something shes being very traditional i suppose shes a bit insecure and she wears this long supposedly shapeless black cassock only on her its not shapeless at all you get bumps in all the right places and its got about a hundred buttons down the front and you imagine yourself undoing them all very slowly one by one oh god merrilys face began to burn mr watts said what dyou reckon they wear underneath exactly what do they wear underneath you could go mad thinking about it could be nothing couldnt it i mean it could be nothing at all in your dreams in my dreams gerald shes wearing nothing but the bloody dog collar imagine that white collar pink body brown nipples merrily wasnt smiling any more her eyes found the wideopen dead eyes of thomas bull he was clothed in what for those frilly cavalier times must have been a rather severe jacket with a high collar a sword unsheathed was lying by his side thomas was carved out of local stone worn smooth now his eyes wide open to face his god without fear without excuses in the year a quarter of a century after his pivotal role in the hounding of wil williams bulls face was stern but as she watched the angle of the sun created the illusion of a supercilious smirk on the full beardfringed lips mr watts said youll go to hell dermot yes said dermot child and it might even be worth it dont forget your cap they were coming out and there wasnt time for her to reach the door without being seen lols cottage was really rather lonely the last one in the lane before it narrowed into a cart track on each side the powell orchard was starting to shimmer with new blossom jane walked up the path between the front lawn that needed mowing and the fence bordering the orchard and found herself knocking on the whitepainted door around which red and orange early roses grew there was no answer a small black cat watched her from a fence post she peered through the window into the room where lol had talked with karl windling it was so sparsely furnished it gave you the impression the cottage was not really occupied as though someone had dumped a few things there in advance of moving in what if im too late in her mind was an image of lol lying limply across his bed one arm outstretched the fingers just parted from a small brown pill bottle a variation she realized of a famous painting about a dead young poet but oh god she had to stop herself banging on the window when she stepped away from it she could hear faint music from the rear of the cottage there was a small gate hanging from one rusty hinge and the path continued round the back jane carefully lifted open the gate and went halffearfully through in the small back garden were about four apple trees all of them bending away from the cottage as if the garden were trying to join the orchard or the orchard was trying to draw in the garden sunlight was sprinkled through the fragile white blossom and its always on the sunny days you feel you cant go on trembling a little jane went to the back door and was about to knock gently when she became aware of the music again it was behind her now and so not coming from inside the cottage but from the garden itself or the orchard separated from it by the narrow path she knew was a bridleway she wandered among the apple trees and the music came and went in snatches it sounded a little like the music on the album hazey jane far away and melancholy there was another old garden gate leading to the bridleway and the orchard jane drifted towards it the side of the tomb was cold on her face she crouched there in her cassock furious hiding in her own church as dermot child and mr watts walked out the cassock felt soiled as though childs fingers had already been up and down the buttons she wanted to have another bath to scrub herself like shed done once late at night to remove the blood of edgar powell dermots key turned in the lock but she didnt move from behind the tomb in case they came back silence in the chapel only inches between her and tom bulls bones she saw with a twinge of unease that part of the tomb below the feet of the effigy had been repaired as though tom bull had stretched out in death and pushed out a couple of the sandstone bricks to make more room for himself you could feel quite resentful at the way influential local families thought they could buy into paradise with a fancy tomb traherne had a lot to say about that tom bull must have known traherne but traherne had left for london by the time they were laying their accusations at the door of his friend wil williams how did james know about his ancestors role in the persecution and his feelings at the time were there family documents how in fact had the williams story been passed down she was reluctant to ask the old guy who did the all our yesterdays bit for the parish mag he was sentimental and unreliable and hed keep her talking all day and anyway he would never have been given access to the bulldavies family records merrily stood up brushed herself down smug bastards she muttered to tom bull and his absent descendant nothing changes does it well thats true a woman murmured behind her in this family anyway merrily spun round she wore an anklelength skirt the colour of ledwardine soil and possibly the same black cotton shirt shed worn on the square that night open to the gold pendant in the cleft of her breasts she also wore a knowing smile you drop something just a key merrily lied she hadnt heard the porch door open or footsteps sorry have you been here long just this minute walked in she had glazed marilyn monroe lips but the resemblance ended there before the steep regal nose before the slanting dark blue eyes alison kinnersley i dont think weve been formally introduced probably because ive never seen you here before merrily watkins i do come here sometimes alison said to look around and think but never with james her voice dropped into the bulldavies bark not seemly you know merrily raised an eyebrow anyone care about seemly any more twentyfive even fifteen years ago alison kinnersley would have been a scarlet woman today the villagers still gossiped but not many would be scandalized james cares alison said yes merrily walked away from the tomb i expect he would then why she wanted to ask remembering alisons hands inside jamess sheepskin on the night of the wassailing why does he let you flaunt him in public and yet when youre not there behave as if you dont exist poor guy alison moved into merrilys place at the tombside poor guy came home in a bit of a state last night hes convinced youre going to shaft him over that play thats rich he threatened to shaft me alison laughed james is full of shit ok i just thought i should tell you that she looked down dispassionately at the effigy hes gone to hereford today for the powell inquest gone to do his duty and help rod powell convince the coroner his old man didnt top himself hell be gone most of the day and so i the dark blue eyes focused directly on merrily as though this was very important i just got the feeling youd had this horrendous scene with him and you might be feeling intimidated so i thought id tell you he was full of shit and whatever he said you should disregard im relying of course on your discretion as a woman of the cloth merrily didnt know how to react as a woman of the cloth or indeed as a woman i really wouldnt mind seeing that play alison said i think it could be quite interesting there was the faint hint of a rural vowel there quoit interesting which showed she didnt exactly share jamess background ill tell you one thing she touched with a pink ovalled fingernail the sandstone lips of tom bull there was more to this old bastard than james is prepared to admit like what frankly i dont know alisons lips turned down if i knew that she pulled her hand away from the effigy anyway excuse me merrily said im a bit baffled youre jamess mistress alison said softly mistress oldfashioned word oldfashioned guy i had that impression so why would i want to do this to him something like that hmm alison nodded well youve met him youve been exposed to the archaic paternalistic balls im still baffled merrily said well fine alison said lightly thats all right so long as youre not unsettled about it she began to walk away half turned wryly raised a hand and brought the fingers down twice like a bird pecking see you vicar merrily went directly to the black swan she had some pleading to do couldnt face another night in a sleeping bag well im sorry mrs watkins roland said i was only going by your instructions ive got a theatre director and his partner arriving for lunch tomorrow and theyll be taking the woolhope suite until the weekend one more night im so sorry no reflection on you of course but itll require the full works tonight we were allowing for you having all your things out by seven oh and this came for you somebody dropped it through the letterbox a white envelope addressed to the vicar the black swan ok merrily said wearily til go up and get everything sorted out and when jane comes home well get it all moved up in the suite she thought sod it and ran a bath in the creamy bathroom got out of the cassock rolled it into a ball and threw it into a corner so much for tradition as the bath filled up she went to the wardrobe and found a plain black sweater and a charcoalgrey jersey skirt too hot but probably less appealing to the fetishist pity about the cassock it was comfortable like a kaftan but it wasnt coming back after her last luxurious bath merrily lay down on the bed and tore open the letter looked like an invitation a mixed blessing for vicars it was a card a funeral card with a black border it said wil williams was the devils minister let him lie be warned merrily let it fall to the floor she should take it to the police it was a threat wasnt it and what would the police do fingerprint it then fingerprint the entire village she sat up and looked again at the card the message had been printed on a slip of paper which had been pasted inside the black rectangle anyone with access to a computer could have done it and anyone could have access to a computer for a very small fee you could use the one in marches media waste of time some crank on impulse she took the card to the window set light to it with her zippo and let the air take the ashes crank maybe but someone had spent some time on it another indication that something in this wil williams business went very deep in ledwardine alison kinnersley and lucy devenish both thought coffeys play would open up the can of worms and that would be no bad thing but here was proof that bulldavies was clearly not alone in wanting to keep the lid on she shut the window and went back and lay on the bed her whole body shaking with anger and what she suspected after last night was nervous exhaustion like lace this was a secret place an old place to begin with it existed only as warmth and a sensesapping humidity then she was aware of lustrous wet stone walls on every side like some middle eastern dungeon but the atmosphere was dense and dark and syrupy with a soursweet aroma fruitier and earthier than wine a heavy drenching of deepest rural england his face went in and out of focus sweat rippling down his cheeks like wax down a candle his eyes were sly his hands were busy the lower half of him was lost in steam but it was moving squirming she however was lying helplessly still in what felt like damp hay she couldnt move at all her muscles were heavy and sagging like balloons full of water she kept trying to concentrate make out details but her vision was all fuzzy and her selfcontrol just drifted away into the thick cloying musted air she didnt know where this was it might be underground at englands core it was hot enough above her no sun only oaken rafters pickled in centuries of juice hot enough to be hell and his face his mad moist face had split into a wide grin the way a crisp apple splits but it was rotten inside oozing brown pulp and the pips dropped from his stained teeth and behind she saw his fat buttocks rising out of the vapour glossy orbs rosy apples he took in a slow wheezing breath eyes popping in his friars face as his buttocks tensed and she realized with terror tightening inside that he was fully on top of her and she was wearing the tattered remnants of the black cassock ripped down the front and stained with stinking apple pulp and her collar was tightening like a shackle like a stiff white noose white collar he began to gasp pink body brown nipples absolute little cracker there was the squeak and grind of an ancient mechanism the sense of an enormous waiting weight before a lunge and a squeezing and a second of silence like a crack in the universe until accompanied by a long liquid gush dermot child snarled out his enormous voice echoing through caverns of time as her own throat constricted auld ciderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr bastards merrily hurled clothes unfolded into the open suitcase the cassock last but the lid wouldnt close and in a rage she seized the cassock and tore it down the back and threw it into the bin liner with the rubbish look at the time look at the time fourfifteen shed slept for nearly five hours god almighty calm down she sat on a corner of the bed settled her breathing gave herself a good talkingto alf hayden would have chuckled and let it all pass over him child bulldavies and his mistress the funeral card nothing would intrude into alf s placid dreams but would any of it have happened to alf merrily didnt somehow think it would when shed awakened the dreamchilds ghastly orgasmic cry biting into her brain like an alarm clock shed stripped at once in front of the bathroom washbasin throwing angry handfuls of cold tap water at herself and then drinking half a pint of tepid spring water from a plastic bottle and brushing her teeth with a violence that made her gums bleed just calm down janell be getting off the bus in about ten minutes you cant let her see you like this in the bedroom she dressed in the quietly secular black jumper and skirt slotted her clerical collar under her darkbrown curls pink skin brown nipples white stop it before the open window overlooking the mellowed redcobbled village square she knelt to pray pressing her palms flat together sandwiching the heat between them stilling her mind entering the inner temple before whispering into the silence o god i know youre testing me as you will no doubt test all women who dare to don the cloth stop youre sounding resentful youre whingeing she knelt in silence for several minutes waiting for the right tone the right level waiting for the calm but to her anguish her senses began to fill up with the pulpy essence of the foetid cider cellar the organists sweating face sweat and rotting apples how was she ever going to bring herself to talk to that bloody man again you pompous cow hes just a normal guy if youre not responsible for your dreams dermot child certainly isnt sure reluctantly she stood up the odd thing was shed never seen a cider mill at work only the static exhibits at the bulmers museum in hereford shed never smelt the powerful aroma although shed read about it never experienced the moment when the press came down on the clothrolled pulp and the first juice burst out like a bus juddered to a stop on the edge of the square through the open window she heard chattering and laughter janes bus merrily stood the suitcase in the centre of the room together with the bin liner and three cardboard wine boxes from sainsburys to put the rest of the stuff in she dashed into the bathroom started to drag a comb through her tangled hair but it snagged and she gave up and ran out of the woolhope suite down the stairs and into the square to grab hold of jane before she tramped back to an empty vicarage and what have you been doing today mum well i slept most of it actually flower then i had a pornographic dream help the kids on the square were separating slowly school shirts and blouses pulled out of waistbands gestures of slovenly cool no sign of jane one of the older boys spotted merrily and nudged his mate and they smiled slyly and merrily thought jesus is there no end to this when she walked up to them retrieving her breath the tall thin one went gratifyingly red merrily didnt smile at him you seen jane watkins anywhere yeah the other boy said i seen her a few times nicelooking bit like you smothering a giggle with his hand cocky little sod and do you know merrily said patiently where she is hang on the tall one said i never seen her on the bus you see her dean she werent on the bus she werent on the bus this morning neither im pretty sure merrily frowned no honestly dean was overweight and beadyeyed theres six of us gets on at this stop right and shes always there when i gets yere last minute me matter of pride jane wasnt there vicar he grinned in her face swear to god thanks merrily said tightly looks like er bunked off dunnit naughty naughty the square swam before her she couldnt believe it not for one minute whatever she said about school most of it disparaging jane did not bunk off jane had never missed a day except through illness and family tragedy the youth was lying why was he lying to her dean nonchalantly pulled from his schoolbag a can of woodpecker cider ripped off the tab merrily was sure she could smell it sweat and apples she turned away in disgust the kids were separating going off in different directions maybe jane had missed the bus but if she wasnt there this morning merrily went cold she turned round and round the square blurring into the black swan the country kitchen alleyway the late shop church street the vicarage behind its trees not again jane please god not again dont do this to me calm down its broad daylight shes fifteen years old shes smart shes been around shes probably at the vicarage up in her apartment with a tapemeasure ill kill her in his last morose months nick drake aged twentysix would get into his car and drive and drive until he ran out of petrol because he hadnt the confidence to stop at a garage often his father would have to travel about seventy miles to bring him home when he was not out in his car nick would sit with his guitar in his room at his parents home and play the same chord sequence over and over again like some sad mantra there had been a time not so many years ago when all this had made terrifying sense to lol he sat on the chair arm with the dented washburn on his knee his fingers found aminor and then f and then eminor stroking the strings with nails ruined by a winter of collecting and chopping logs for the stove conceding that nicks chordsequence even in those faded days was probably a good deal more complex never could work out his tunings on the table was a letter which had arrived this morning from the record company tmm it was pleased to inform lol robinson that the compilers of a new massmarket collection to be called acoustic echoes would be interested in including his song dandelion dreams from the third and last hazey jane album money for nothing backed by tvadvertising these compilation albums sold by the vanload and also generated new interest in your old records this was the fourth in two years to include one of his songs it was how he lived and it was a living it paid the mortgage on the cottage it put food on lols table and ethels dish it was enough wasnt it he struck the doleful eminor he wanted to write again sure he did but when you lost it you lost it you were supposed to be more inspired when you were unhappy when your woman had gone and left you all alone how come he could just about cobble lyrics together for gary kennedys adequate tunes and that was it the phone rang it would be karl karl had rung twice since the weekend the second time hed said im going to come and see you again ive got some ideas for songs as if lol had never said no way no im not doing it i cant do it got some ideas for songs karl had said voice absolutely bland no hint of menace im going to come and see you again he put down the guitar picked up the phone lol its er its dennis dennis clarke hello lol said relieved how are you doing thanks for the album no er no problem dennis coughed so you saw karl then he came over yeah dennis said right he came back to see me again we had a talk he tell you about this gig he did with this band in america and all the girls afterwards and how he couldve gone on all night despite being twice their age no dennis said gillian was there he told me about how much money we could make if we did another album and were you impressed dennis went quiet lol said was gillian impressed lol ok look i well i said i said yes i said i would would what do another album this time lol went quiet its just a record lol it wont mean touring i mean i can fit it in karl says theyll organize a studio at chipping camden or somewhere so i travel up come home at night gillians gill says she doesnt mind what about your wrist elbow i suppose if i take a couple of painkillers right lol said well good luck ill look out for it no hang on i mean i mean you have to be in the band obviously thats funny dennis because i told karl i wasnt going to do it lol youve got to do it oh i see lol said he kind of threatened you did he what was it plain violence or something gillian doesnt know about i have to say it was the violence used to work with me but that was nearly twenty years ago not now i dont think what he did finally was worse lol listen he says dennis you persuade that little bastard or no no he didnt it was nothing like that lol felt sorry for him he felt sorry for himself too but maybe dennis the safe chippenham accountant was more vulnerable right now dennis if he ever asks ill tell him you did your best lol for christs sake he sensed dennis was near to tears oh come on man you know its you he needs you know he cant write a fucking song to save his life dennis lol was surprised how firm his own voice sounded just tell him to leave me alone tell him not to come near me outside the window there was white blossom on the apple trees why did white blossom depress him so much maybe the memory of white flowers on his mothers coffin his father turning his back on lol at the graveside on a luminously still may afternoon much like this one i wont tell him that dennis said not yet jesus christ its only an album lol just the one vicar she turned impatiently at the vicarage gate oh gomer oh dear im sorry im you got some addresses for me vicar he was wearing a dark suit and a black tie with what had to be a twentyyearold knot sorry in cheltenham figured id set off early like oh of course im really sorry gomer things have been would you mind if i were to call you with the stuff tonight its just whenever you like vicar the ole inquests over and done now oh shed have to ask how did it go death gomer snatched out his cigarette in disgust by misadventure accident then councillor powell must be pleased ah bloody ole whitewash vicar bulldavies he give evidence of how he couldnt get no sense out of edgar all night and how he was a bit worried about the ole feller havin charge of a shotgun and how he wishes hed taken some action when he had the chance well load of ole sheepshit sure tbe scuse my language but you puts a bulldavies in the witness box they all thinks its bloody gospel something botherin you vicar sorry i was just looking out for jane so you think he really did kill himself deliberately ah gomer rubbed at his glasses as though this would clarify things call me a cynic but it was the way they was all tryin to convince the whatshisname the judge coroner aye the way they was all bangin on about edgar not bein his ole self acting confusedlike all day like doc asprey wouldnt trust that young bugger to the end o the yard he says edgar had a bit o trouble comin in the arteries as could give im funny turns well see i could understand rod not wantin his ole feller buried the wrong side o the churchyard we dont actually do that any more gomer i was speaking metaphysically vicar its still the stigma see you dont want a reputation as a suicide family so you could understand rod perjurin his bollocks off but bulldavies big guns vicar big guns course the bulls they been relyin on the powells for generations you think edgar wasnt actually confused i wasnt really taking much notice he werent confused in the ox earlier on is all i can say and he werent drunk neither though hed had a few all paid for by other folk as usual crafty ole bugger edgar powell i been thinkin a lot about this see got plenty bloody time to think nowadays mores the pity and i reckon whether he done isself by accident or deliberate summat put the wind up edgar that night if you gets time to think back on it vicar id be interested in your opinion as an outsider like i think i was just trying to keep warm at the time but perhaps we could discuss it tomorrow over a cup of im delayin you vicar gomer threw up his hands gettin an ole woman see what bloody retirement does for you useless bastard of a thing retirement scuse my language it was only when she was halfway up the vicarage drive that merrily realized jane couldnt possibly be inside because she hadnt yet got a key she looked up in despair at the beautiful old oakframed pile the oldest threestorey house in ledwardine and felt it repelling her the highest smallest windows seemed remote even the trees didnt reach them the unwindowed oak door looked like the door of some old jail she didnt go in jane she hurried around the side of the house under a wooden arch and on to the big square lawn overhung with willow and birch jane she walked right round the house the volvo was still parked under the trees shed had it nicked four times in liverpool and she was always ridiculously grateful to see it why couldnt they have stayed in cosy old liverpool where you only worried about your car getting nicked janes cd case was still on the dash with its photo of four men in a forest clearing watching a blurred girlshape and the words hazey jane merrily smiled no wonder the kid was infatuated tears pricking jane brushing at her eyes she found her face was glazed with sweat she ran back to the gate no schoolkids left on the square now just two women with prams and toddlers it was nearly five oclock oh my god no stop think all right she wasnt on the bus tonight she probably didnt catch it this morning shed made a point of leaving early to take a stroll around the village well ok merrily hadnt questioned that jane was a curious kid liked to get to know places on the other hand ledwardine wasnt a place that took that much getting to know not when youd already lived here for several weeks shed arranged to meet someone a boyfriend merrily thought of the overweight youth slurping his cider please not cider her mouth tightened she strode across the square towards cassidys country kitchen ill kill her oh god please let her be out with that little bitch on some unholy binge lol walked out into the garden white blossom spring always the most depressing time of year all those long empty summer days ahead in winter on your own you could spend whole hours of dwindling daylight chopping logs to stay warm through the evenings blossom all over the orchard even though it began at the bottom of his garden lol had hardly ever been in there it was someone elses property it was also unwelcoming overgrown and gloomy nothing picturesque about neglected apple trees it was alison whod really liked this place alison whod said how much she would love it here watching lol rebuild himself turned to him with that look of longing and then the coy smile with eyes downcast that always worked for the late princess of wales turning lol like the right key in a rusted lock scattered with clusters of tiny flowers the orchard was no longer clawed and sinister but still eerie the old gnarled fingers whitegloved he wondered if it would have made a difference if hed been here with alison at the wassailing on twelfth night the truth was he hadnt wanted to go be among all those strangers partly why hed agreed to go over to oxford to work on the songs with the fading legend gary kennedy lol felt safer with people who were fading thinking alison would go with him but shed said she was sure she had a cold coming on and it was better if she stayed here kept warm thered been no cold but shed kept warm perhaps she and bulldavies had come back to the cottage afterwards to shower away bits of the old man old man powell this made it two suicides if you included the hanged minister wil williams at least two a place to stay out of if you were that way inclined hed been amazed to find himself following colette cassidy into the heart of it last saturday night he hadnt had time to think but he was thinking now thinking hard thinking you have to do this you have to keep fighting back against karl dennis behind him now reluctantly of course dennis was a nice guy karl windling wasnt karl wouldnt give up hed come again to the cottage and when karl had finally exhausted his limited powers of persuasion when he realized there was nothing else to be done nothing to lose nothing to gain he would become destructive his pride would demand it lol walked on becoming increasingly depressed all this blossom promising apples the only harvest last year had been logs from dead and dying trees last winter he and alison had bought a trailerload of apple logs from the powells on the woodburner with the doors open it had perfumed the whole room no logs like apple logs for perfume if traditional christmas cards were scented this was how theyd smell lol had wanted to make love with alison on the rug beside the stove at christmas but it had never happened how shed changed how classy she looked in her darkblue riding gear very pointtopoint classy but not sexy too militaristic when he turned round the cottage had vanished into a tangle of whitedusted trees soon hed reach the socalled apple tree man where he and colette had found jane it would be todays test to get that far on his own to touch the mans scabby bark and then hed turn and go back clouds had gathered and the sky was nearly white with holes of wet sunlight and veins like cheese mould the trees closer packed their blossom exploding around him like a flour bomb whichever way he turned it was the same and even though there was no breeze the whiteness seemed to swirl he felt disoriented but he wouldnt stop a battle against himself he moved on through the warm windless snowstorm when he looked up the blossom and sky absorbed each other and floated down around him like a crinkling shroud he didnt like that looked down at the ground where he saw god help him the girl lying across the path apple blossom around her face like lace whiteout oh hi colette cassidy said without enthusiasm you want to talk to my father merrilys heart plunged the girl shouldnt be here she should be somewhere anywhere forbidden with jane watkins because hes out colette said she had a luscious sulky mouth which seemed to be all there was under heavy midbrown hair she had in abundance what you could only call attitude merrily saw in colette a lot of things shed never seen in jane yet the girl leaned inside the doorway of cassidys country kitchen arms folded long denim legs straight it was a wide doorway built into what had evidently been the bay of a barn colette hardly barred the way but there was a certain type of customer her presence would deter and probably another type it would attract colette wheres jane colette shrugged i should know i hoped you would yeah well i dont colette said sorry through the flower transfers on the high glass doors merrily saw caroline cassidy scurrying across the delicatessen caroline spotted her and changed direction youre sure merrily said i wouldnt lie to you vicar colette gave her a nutrasweet smile as caroline came out tipping a glance at her mother that said at least not like i lie to her merrily caroline wore a kind of milkmaid dress with gingham sleeves only true townies dressed like this weve been dying for you to come hello caroline but i said to terrence for gods sake dont pressure the girl shes far too much on her plate to worry about our little festival throwing her all into a smile of sympathy and true compassion right now it almost helped i was just asking your daughter if shed seen jane carolines face hardened colette no i havent colette levered herself upright i really havent ok i mean like what is this for christs sake just because we went out once and got a tiny bit pissed everybody thinks were on some kind of permanent pub crawl i saw jane for a few minutes last night and i havent seen her since ok colette two coffees go caroline pushed her daughter through the doors turned back to merrily is there a problem here when did you last see her this morning when she left for school oh yes she goes to that comprehensive isnt there a special bus she wasnt on it caroline shook her head with a jingle of earrings teenage girls are so utterly thoughtless shes probably stayed behind to play tennis or something you think so for a moment merrily clutched at it caroline cassidy was perhaps twelve years older she had a very difficult daughter this must have taught her something she took merrily by an arm come and have that coffee youve been very lucky with jane if this is the first time shes done this to you look why dont you ring the school from here theres always someone around these places for hours no it it came down on merrily that according to the ciderswigging youth jane hadnt even taken the bus this morning how long she wondered despairingly were you supposed to wait before you called the police caroline cassidy propelled her inside sat her at one of three empty tables in the deli went back to the door and turned over the laminated closed sign you know teenagers much more than children have a problem moving to a new place shes done it several times merrily said ok she was unhappy about it at first but lately shes been fine more or less is there anyone she knows locally apart from colette nobody she thought of this man lol shed been remiss she ought to have checked him out nobody special look im sorry im probably worrying about nothing but didnt a girl go missing from kingsland or somewhere a few months ago petra good i think petra good but that was back in the winter look merrily and they havent found her have they my dear you wont find many parts of the country where there isnt a girl missing that doesnt mean colette isnt that coffee ready yet merrily said do you know lol robinson caroline sniffed works for her sometimes miss devenish odd little man alison kinnersley james bulldaviess partner she used to live with robinson they bought the timlins cottage in blackberry lane old couple he died she went into a home hadnt been there more than a few months and alisond taken up with james one suspects there could be a drug problem what merrilys fingers tightened on the seat of the rustic wooden chair carolines look was penetrating jane knows him she had one of his records thats all aw look colette dumped two coffees with cartons of cream hes harmless hes just screwed up is all her mother looked up sharply look colette said weve all been round there at first you think like wow a rock musician and youre expecting him to have his own studio and cool people around but hes like like he could be a bank clerk or something one old guitar anyway hes all messed up over alison he wont stay around here or if he does hell like od or something i have to go merrily stood up she was thinking of that album the track called song for nick jane asking her as they lay in their sleeping bags you ever know anybody who committed suicide youve been very kind but what if shes come back to the vicarage or the inn im sorry drink your coffee merrily please colette go to the vicarage go to the black swan ask around and be discreet colette went without a word and caroline gently pressed merrily back into her chair sat down opposite her i can assure you shell leave no stone unturned my daughter is being ultra cooperative at least until after the party sorry party didnt jane tell you shes certainly invited well i there was obviously a whole lot jane hadnt told her merrily drank some coffee although she was starting to feel sick she probably mentioned it and i forgot things have been you know caroline slid a hand over merrilys squeezed it youre taking on too much you really ought to let us help alfred delegated hed learned you see no the party oh dear its her sixteenth people say we must be absolutely mad to let her have it in the restaurant but what i say is better our own premises here in the village than some awful discoclub in hereford weve promised to go out but barry will be in charge our restaurant manager barrys awfully capable merrily was only halflistening she was thinking of suicide mass suicides of oncerational people like the heavens gate thing suicide was contagious god you really thought you knew your own child you thought your generation was going to be different there was going to be nothing you wouldnt be able to talk about that you couldnt iron out between you but every generation there was something new growing in their heads something terrifying terrence has gone to see richard coffey caroline said brightly they were hoping to catch up with you over the weekend richards got some friends down from london a theatre director whose name i ought to know but ive forgotten they were hoping to put their proposals to you for the church maybe it was the church god god had come between them made merrily into a remote figure or even an embarrassment the way jane looked at her when she went to pray shed thought that was just going to be a phase caroline said they want to show you they can present wil in a way that would cause absolutely minimal disruption to normal services and things hasnt richard been to see you yet with his friend one has to say he totes that young man around like a trophy wife i ive been putting people off until we got settled into the vicarage well not settled exactly that could take years but you know in oh my god were supposed to be moving tomorrow well help of course we will everything will be absolutely fine youll see caroline paused eyes narrowing we er we heard james came to see you yes i dont know whats got into that man he was always so enthusiastic about developing the village economy and restoring a degree of selfsufficiency suddenly hes become a positive millstone and terrence is terribly scared that richard will simply turn his back on us and the whole festival will be a disaster its all so worrying you seem to be treading on old corns merrily drank some more coffee most of her mind was out on the square with colette caroline scowled that illustrates precisely what we have to overcome if were going to get this place buzzing the past is over it cant harm us but we can use it do you see were lucky enough to have these wonderful old buildings set in such beautiful countryside and an absolute wealth of traditions but lord we mustnt let them hold us back merrily suspected caroline cassidy had just said something deeply flawed but her anxiety wouldnt let her concentrate there was a tapping on the glass were closed caroline called out then she said oh no pushed her coffee cup aside bloody woman now she really does make you think youre trapped in some ghastly timewarp caroline opened one of the double glass doors is that the vicar i see with you mrs cassidy merrily stood up heart thumping miss devenish was hatless she wore a shapeless dress with a geranium pattern her hair was in two plaits which looked as strong as anchor chains her face was grave ah mrs wafkins yes could i talk to you please in my shop lol was shivering in the dark hunched into a corner of the loft hugging his knees he felt like a priest in a priests hole hunted filtered through a tiny mossedover skylight the only light in here was green it was unearthly it made his fingers look like corpse fingers he shuffled to squeeze himself into shadow although his eyes were fixed on the green skylight the pictures rolling in were all white the warm blizzard of blossom in the orchard the disorientation the whiteout and the girl her features indistinct a corpse under a pale catafalque of blossom oh god the girl the mews was deserted the shops had closed the afternoon clouded over lucy devenish didnt speak until the double doors were between them and the face of caroline cassidy puckered with resentment appalling woman never tell her anything you dont want the entire county to know merrily said lucy unless this is really important could we perhaps talk tomorrow im honestly not thinking too well at the moment but it clearly was important come to the shop lucy devenish took her arm and led her into the mews please from even a few yards away ledwardine lore looked like an oldfashioned fruit shop then you saw that none of the apples in the window were real and small butterfly creatures were all over them merrily experienced a momentary illusion of being outside herself as though nothing at all here was real as though this was an enchanted village in a childs dream it was a moment of strange relief come in merrily the door was unlocked but the shop had closed the lights were out it was dim inside the smell of apples was overwhelming hello mum jane said softly lucy devenish didnt put on the lights as though she didnt want merrily to see jane too clearly the kid was on a stool up against the counter her features were indistinct there was a couple of yards between them so merrily couldnt tell whether she was smiling or serious all around her things shaped like apples mugs candles ornaments pot fruit wax fruit fluffy fruits breath bolted into merrily her anxiety swelled for an instant and then burst like a boil relief but a discoloured relief oh jesus she croaked finally where the hell have you been jane said nothing merrily saw that she was holding an appleshaped mug faintly steaming between her hands as if for warmth lucy devenish shut the door shes been with me she said merrily turned on her angrily for how long oh lucy said all all day i dont understand her vision adjusting to the dimness she saw that jane still wore her school uniform even the blazer even the tie she should have been at school for heavens sake whats going on whats happened to her it was me lucy said quickly i went for my earlymorning walk and im afraid i collapsed in blackberry lane stupid of me i thought the fresh air would make me feel better she had her back to the door her face almost entirely in shadow its its a blood pressure problem one forgets ones age all i can say is thank god for jane i was lying in the hedge when she found me somehow she got me home and then she made me some tea and she insisted on staying with me i kept telling her to leave but she wouldnt of course she missed the bus jane didnt move her hands still clasping the steaming orb of the apple mug i wanted to drive her to school but she said i wasnt fit to drive in my condition a bossy child you could have sent her to find me merrily said cautiously i couldve taken her oh well if im being truthful im sorry jane that was why she didnt want to find you because she said you would only have insisted on taking her to school and she told me she didnt want to have to explain to everybody merrily sighed ive been worried sick when she didnt get off the school bus shes been helping me in the shop we rather lost track of time im so sorry merrily i just wish somebody had told me how are you feeling now miss devenish much better thank you have you seen the doctor that twerp asprey no thank you and indeed merrily id be very grateful if you wouldnt mention this to anybody tell the cassidy woman to mind her own damn business is there anything i can do for you your daughters done everything take her home caroline cassidys gossipgreedy gaze alighted on them as soon as they emerged into the mews oh merrily im so glad perhaps she noticed janes vacant eyes because she backed off a little with a meaningful glance towards the door of ledwardine lore she er she was helping miss devenish merrily said all day no that was a mistake on my part i got a little confused everything got kind of crisscrossed im sorry to have caused such a fuss carolines tilted smile showed she believed not a word and who could blame her jane was silent crossing the market place merrily kept glancing at her sure she was a little pale in curious contrast as it happened to miss lucy devenish whod looked as ripe and ruddy as one of the apples in her damned shop window bloodpressure balls they crossed the square to the church and the vicarage shoulder to shoulder but there was distance between them into the silence came a long low rumble from the church merrily could see through the lychgate that the porch doors were wide open like amplifying hands the sound was like the rising drone of an enormous vacuum cleaner again sang a mans voice come on again fill those lungs dermot child rehearsing his choral work the male voices like mud in the bottom of a deep pond aulllllllld ciderrrrrrrrr jane didnt look up but merrily thought she saw the kid shiver lol came down from the loft he stumbled this is a nightmare lucy perhaps lucys face was gaunt in the gloom if her mother doesnt start to realize a few things soon im going to have to talk to the child in greater depth all the apple colours and the translucence in the wings of the fairies had dulled like a stainedglass window at night the shop seemed heavy around lucy it seemed to be not so much a diversion for her as a symbol of responsibility for the first time it occurred to him that she was probably quite an old woman im sorry he said she was just lying there she was all white at first i thought she was dead when she moved it i just wanted to run away from it but i couldnt you know i couldnt move what was she doing there lucy again laurence lucy said youre living on your own too near the orchard at the wrong time if you have a weakness some things will play to that weakness when youre prepared to tell me what the weakness is we can take it from there im all weakness lol said youre not helping yourself lucys face darkened i cant help you if i dont know the root of the problem can i think about this it seems to me lucy said severely that youve already been thinking about it rather too long the little green orchard it was merrily thought in dismay like still living in a hotel one without any guests or staff a hotel in winter sure this is the lot vicar gomer parry had asked her about three times im afraid it is this is awful she was still thinking after two days of moving things around shed forgotten quite how much furniture shed sold or given away over the past three years what it meant was that they had about enough for a decentsized flat with one living room and a couple of bedrooms gomer parry had done it in one trip bloody sight easier he said than when he and minnie moved in from the radnor valley with all minnies clutter from nearly forty years of marriage to the late frank gomer and his nephew nev took no more than half an hour to get all the stuff in but until such time as the property market improved to a point where the diocese could make a killing on ledwardine vicarage merrily was stuck with it behind the door shed found a letter from the north herefordshire gay and lesbian collective expressing support for richard coffeys brave reappraisal of an historic injustice and urging her to do the right thing she filed it for a future noncommittal reply and returned to practical problems so ok there were two ways they could handle this situation they could scatter the bits and pieces around so that the whole place had the air of somewhere partly movedinto or they could furnish a couple of rooms reasonably well which made it seem as though you were the livein caretakers in some kind of hostel im told theres a couple of reasonable secondhand shops in hereford if we spent say two hundred pounds fairly wisely we might make a bit of a difference yeah jane said whatever it didnt help that the kid was still into the idea of this thirdfloor flat arrangement more into it than ever in fact shed charmed gomer and nev into taking her bed to the top floor into one of the smaller bedrooms while the biggest one up there which she insisted on keeping locked until shed finished painting the walls had her stereo her albums her books merrily felt guilty as well as intimidated acres literally probably of wasted space but my dear virtually all country vicarages are like this caroline cassidy said when she and terrence arrived to assist thats why so many vicars end up having enormous families of course youll marry again one day oh yes you will perhaps i could offer a home to some refugees merrily had said and caroline had looked quite appalled almost as appalled as shed been when she first saw their miserable collection of worthless furniture making merrily scared that they were going to be regarded as a charity case and all kinds of appalling junk would get dumped on them actually shed lied theres quite a bit more over in cheltenham but we wanted to do a bit of decorating first caroline had looked sceptical as in fact she had over the issue of janes disappearance which merrily had tried to gloss over fairly sure she hadnt mentioned to caroline that the kid had failed to catch the bus in the morning shed said jane had simply missed the one home and had to get a lift from a friends father all right then flower what really happened she never seemed to get a chance to ask the question one for a long night in front of a log fire but it was getting too close to summer for log fires and they never seemed to get a full night in together now people knew where to find the vicar the doorbell and the phone rarely stopped which was good in a way it was good to deal with daytoday stuff planning weddings and christenings agonizing over whether to buy new prayer books and putting off decisions on more contentious issues on friday night richard coffey invited her to dinner at the black swan he had with him a man called martin creighton a theatre director and creightons earnest girlfriend mira wickham a set designer i happened to run into the bishop coffey said oh merrily fingered her napkin i wondered if you might hes thrilled of course about our idea for staging wil in the church hes very keen to encourage the wider use of ecclesiastical premises for the church to be the centre of the community again well me too obviously its just well id like to have some time to look into the wil williams story i feel its important we get him right get him right coffeys maplike face pulsed in the candlelight merrily blinked wearily she was too tired for all this if you were doing it in a theatre that would be one thing but in the church where he preached i just think we all have a responsibility to get as close to the truth as we can ah the truth what an adaptable little word that is the truth a truth the literal truth a universal truth where do we begin martin creighton laughed mira wickham smiled i think we have to begin merrily said with whether wil williams really was a witch she took a quick sip of wine and whether he really was gay coffey leaned back he wore a black leather jacket and a white shirt and a sort of chamoisleather bow tie he was not accompanied by stefan alder his partner there was no humour in his smile mrs watkins if you were to substitute the word heterosexual as in whether he was heterosexual you would perhaps appreciate the degree of offence implicit in the line youre taking oh now look obviously i intended no offence at all i have absolutely nothing against woofters queers tilting his head playing with her all im saying mr coffey merrily gripped her napkin is that if were talking about causing offence i know what youre saying i gather youve already had a state visit from a certain descendant of the tyrannical thomas bull who thinks ive developed a grudge against his entire lineage because the bastard capitalized so ruthlessly on my friend stefans desire to live in his lodge something like that merrily admitted all right let me explain something to you im an exhaustive researcher i like to know every minute detail of the background against which i am working correct martin richards compulsion to know is legendary creighton said obsequiously i have read therefore everything extant on the williams case which i have to say is not a tremendous amount its very sparse but perhaps my use of the word extant is a misuse available would be a better word because there are other documents in existence several sources for instance make mention of the journal of thomas bull parts of which have been published the ones relating to the civil war for instance and the siege of hereford bulls interesting to historians because although a supporter of the crown he was in his private life a puritan merrily thought of bulls effigy in the church the rustic simplicity of his clothing now as justice of the peace it was bulls job to initiate a prosecution of williams if he was convinced there was sufficient evidence do you know how this began mrs watkins you mean the chap who saw him dancing with devilish sprites no no before that the poor man was accused by one john rudge a wealthy independent farmer of bringing down a blight on his orchard and destroying his crop of cider apples williams it seems had good reason to be opposed to the ready availability of cider having been assaulted by a drunk who wandered into his church now coffey angled forward the tabletop candles reflected in his eyes we know that as a puritan with if you like a small p thomas bull also was very much opposed to drink and drunkenness and would not allow cider apples to be grown by any of his tenants therefore he might have been expected might he not to take the side of wil williams in his crusade for sobriety merrily nodded slowly instead of which coffey said bull appears to have seized on the accusation with a kind of sorrowful glee this suggests he was already harbouring a certain prejudice against wil williams i suppose it might but how will we ever know only coffey spread his hand delicately by obtaining access to the unpublished journals of thomas bull which our friend james bulldavies keeps no doubt in the deepest of bank vaults so the next time he tries to lean on you mrs watkins i suggest you invite him to resolve the issue by producing them do you have any proof that hes got them id be astonished if he hadnt and given his recent ah cashflow difficulty do you not think he wouldnt have attempted to sell the journals for publication im not suggesting tom bull was any kind of rural pepys but his civil war memoirs are surprisingly erudite be worth a good few thousand i suspect certainly well worth putting on the market unless of course they contained material which in the current climate might be considered highly damaging to the familys reputation all this made a certain sense oh dear merrily said it gets complicated doesnt it so coffey said would you object if martin and mira were to have a look at the church over the weekend of course they already would have done he was just testing her sure merrily said resignedly go ahead the next day jane announced that she was to be manager of ledwardine lore for the afternoon lol robinson who usually conquered his shyness to take care of things while lucy had a halfday off had gone to a place near oxford for a few days to work on some new songs with gary kennedy leaving lucy to feed his cat so the gary kennedy oh mum how unutterably sad the gary kennedy listen when i was your age yeah yeah he was huge personally i find it unbelievable that someone like lol should be reduced to writing lyrics for someone as tragically awful as gary kennedy but there you are merrily watched from the window as jane crossed the square and entered the mews to make sure she really was going to ledwardine lore it was wrong to be so suspicious but she couldnt dispel the feeling that the kid and lucy devenish had come to some kind of arrangement when jane had not emerged from the mews after five minutes merrily went into the hall where alf had left a few books of local interest on a shelf under the cupboard housing the electric meters she pulled out a wellthumbed softcovered book entitled the black and white villages of herefordshire a short history and carried it into the kitchen where theyd temporarily placed two easy chairs and the tv neither of them feeling quite up to the drawing room ok index williams wil p merrily pushed the chair on its castors to a spot sideon to the aga and threw herself down she wasnt going to get much out of this but it would be a start youve been avoiding me colette was standing right in the centre of the mews so no chance of avoiding her this time short red plastic windcheater with probably nothing underneath no i havent you fucking have janey i get sent off to scour the village for the vicars precious child and believe me the reverend mumsy was in a big big fret and the next thing i hear is youve turned up in devenishs den in like seriously mysterious circumstances thats bollocks there was nothing mysterious at all there she stopped talking spotting the slowgrowing smile and knowing shed blown it because if there was genuinely nothing to hide then shed have played along pretending there was wouldnt she oh janey what are we getting into i mean are we like talking erm we talking orchard no way see like theres two possibles where that orchards concerned one is that youve actually got a secret guy bitch said jane how did you find out or it goes back to that night when the cider did things for you it aint never done for me and you know how i really hate it when that happens well obviously it did things to me it didnt do to you on account of youve been getting regularly pissed out of your mind for years not good enough plus theres the devenish angle that creepy tacky little shop you cant turn round in without horrible little fairies dropping down your front youre going there now yeah again so its a weekend job all right were not all seriously rich like on the cassidy scale ill find out colette said menacingly you can frigging count on it by the mids prosecutions for witchcraft were rare in the western half of the country a notable exception was the case of wil williams of ledwardine the second english vicar in this period to be accused of consorting with the devil about twentyfive years earlier the reverend john lowes vicar of brandeston in suffolk had been brought to justice by the notorious witchfinder general matthew hopkins lowes who was over eighty when he was ducked in the moat of framlingham castle was alleged to have caused the death of a child and a number of cattle by witchcraft as well as employing a familiar spirit to sink a ship off harwich by comparison williamss alleged crime was minor he was accused by a local farmer of ruining his crop of cider apples however other witnesses were said to be ready to testify that the vicar had been seen dancing with shining spirits in the orchard which at that time almost surrounded the church whether these charges would have been proved in court will ever remain a mystery as when warned of his impending arrest williams hanged himself in the very orchard he had been accused of bewitching this was naturally taken as proof of his guilt and he was buried in unhallowed ground with only an apple tree to mark his resting place it was said that neither this tree nor any others planted on the spot ever yielded an apple the farmer who had laid the charge died soon afterwards and his family was quick to dispose of the orchard dividing it into sections which were sold off separately ledwardine would never again be quite true to its reputation as the village in the orchard merrily laid the book on the pine table which looked like a footstool in this barn of a kitchen and made herself some tea certainly this account backed up coffeys argument that williams had been framed and this surely could only have been done with the approval of the local jp thomas bull but it was still a big leap to the idea that wil was gay there was something missing jane was embarrassed she thought hurting anyones feelings was the worst thing you could do to them sticks and stones might break your bones but bones usually healed i feel awful she said i didnt know nonsense said lucy devenish i wouldnt have expected you to youre not old enough the book before jane on the counter in ledwardine lore was quite slim and clearly for children its cover was this splodgy watercolour all green a small girl done in pen and ink was sitting in a clearing in a wood surrounded by trees which were not big but with their tangled branches making the vague shapes of faces were very sinister the girl was looking halffearfully over her shoulder the book was called the little green orchard it was by lucy devenish title came from walter de la mares poem lucy said do you know it oh yes jane remembered that poem from way back in primary school when it had frightened her a lot it was about someone you couldnt see but who was always waiting there in this little green orchard always watching you it used to scare me good lucy snapped children today are not scared nearly often enough a child that grows up without fear grows up to be a danger to us all jane opened the book its dust jacket was quite dry and brittle and its price was seven shillings and sixpence nineteen sixtyfour lucy said they stopped wanting to publish me about seven years later fairy stories oh dear me no they wanted tales about robots and space ships old dahl kept getting away with it the bastard and blyton lives for ever but i accept i wasnt such a wonderful writer that i could do what i wanted so i stopped doing it jumblesale fodder before you were born so its hardly surprising youd never heard of me there was another book underneath the first this one was larger format and had a more cheerful cover with a happylooking landscape of smiley flowers friendlylooking shady trees and sunny hills and another small girl this one wandering down a long path and looking kind of blissedout in fact the whole package looked a bit like one of those albumcovers from the sixties when bands first discovered mindaltering drugs lucy seemed a bit old to have been involved in all that perhaps it was just the artist this book was called the other voices did you never think of reprinting them and selling them here in the shop heavens lucy said that would have been desperate wouldnt it oh one might do a spot of squirming at the efforts of the dreadful duchess of york but at the end of the day well at the end of the day its the end of the bloody day isnt it dont say that jane lucy leaned over her folded arms watch my lips i dont care dont give a flying fart i got the book out because i wanted you to read it now at once look i brought you a stool be a good girl sit down over there and read the books take you about twenty minutes each theyre only childrens stories but they might make some things clearer read the other voices first then ask any questions you like at which point lucy seemed to lose all interest in jane took down a row of apple mugs and set about them with a duster jane had no alternative but to sit down and get into the other voices which was probably intended for nineyearolds max it was about a little girl called rosemary whose mother was ill and so she went to stay with her grandparents in herefordshire natch on a farm so remote that there were no other children to play with for miles for a while rosemary was very sad and wandered the fields and paths talking to the flowers and the trees because there was no one else pretty soon she was imagining that the flowers and trees were talking back which seemed psychologically reasonable enough to jane each with a distinctive voice like the dandelions had these high pealing yellow voices the bluebells because there were so many of them so close together spoke in a soft blue harmonious chorus watched over by the oak trees who of course had very deep powerful brown voices soon in the background rosemary could hear other sounds and realized that the hills themselves were breathing in fact if she looked hard she could even see them breathing their misty sides going in and out very slowly far more slowly than human breathing this went on for some days rosemary waking earlier and earlier because she couldnt wait to get outside to be with her friends one morning she awoke especially early for this was midsummer and her friends were putting on a special concert the birds started them off the dawn chorus activating everything and then as the sun rose the flowers began to open and as they opened they started to sing and the trees joined in with their bass notes and the hills amplified their heartbeats like drums and by the time the sun was fully up rosemary could no longer hear separate voices but only musical tones which blended together until the whole of nature became one huge magnificent orchestra and rosemary started to wonder about the orchestras conductor who had composed the music who had arranged it of course rosemarys mother came out of hospital which she was very glad about except that she had to go home to the city which kind of mortified her she at once caught a cold which turned into flu and she was very miserable one day when she was a little better to give her some air her mother took her out to the dreary old park shed been to a thousand times and on the way there rosemary spotted a single dandelion growing out of a patch of earth around a street lamp and the dandelion beamed up at her in recognition and she looked up over the rooftops to distant hills and could feel them breathing inside her and by the time they got to the park well and rosemary realized everything had changed for ever jane looked up shed changed of course but you never say that first rule of writing for children never lecture never let them think its a parable which of course lucy put down her duster you know it isnt shame there arent books like that for adults adults said lucy can read traherne oh jane said right not a single customer had been in while she was reading she wondered how lucy kept this place going the story youve just read is of course an introduction to trahernes world traherne showed how higher consciousness is there for us all ill give you some of his work to take home leave it lying about and hope your mother reads it theres so much she needs to know if shes going to surv succeed here lucy snatched up her duster now read the other one in the little green orchard there was an awesome hush in the little green orchard it all became serious rosemary again a little older her grandfather had died and she was spending the holidays with her grandmother helping out on the farm where it would soon be time to harvest the apples rosemary had never been into the orchard before she was to discover that the orchard was the heart of everything the nighthouse lucy sent jane to the village stores to buy a pound of apples any apples would do jane returned with three large bramleys the apples lay on the counter the only living fruit in a shop devoted to artificial representations of it lucy talked about apples as the highest and purest and most magical of fruits she talked of the golden apples of greek myth of the mystical avalon the orchard where king arthur had passed over of eve and of the apple as the mystic heart of herefordshire the seventeenthcentury diarist john evelyn had written that all herefordshire has become in a manner but one entire orchard praising lord scudamore who had improved and refined the cider apple developing the famous redstreak from which the ledwardine apple the pharisees red had been in turn created whys it called that jane asked lucy smiled when she did that her cheeks seemed to take on the ruddier colours of the apples on the counter she was wearing a long green dress her hair in this complicated bun she must have really quite long hair jane realized you could imagine her in years gone by striding the land with her hair blowing out parallel to the ground listening to the hills breathe believing everything was possible like some ancient celtic enchantress jane was just blown away lucy was just like the coolest person shed ever met pay attention jane lucy snapped sorry now lucy plucked a souvenir penknife from a rack she selected an apple laid it on a square of plain wrapping paper im going to cut it sideways have you ever done this before jane shook her head and lucy pushed the point of the knife into the apple and sliced it in half there she held out a half in the palm of each hand what do you see jane leaned over the counter the greenwhite pulp was veined with thin green lines and dots which made a kind of wheel count the spokes lucy said five it makes a fivepointed star you see inside a circle a pentagram oh wow jane had read enough weird books involving pentagrams in her time forget all this black magic nonsense the pentagrams a very ancient symbol of purification and of protection and theres one at the heart of every apple that says something doesnt it thats like really amazing she couldnt stop looking at the little green veins something really ordinary like an apple nothing is ordinary read traherne im going to least of all the apple lucy said sternly let no one talk of the humble apple to me jane looked around the shop and saw it with different eyes like the storybook child rosemary in the park it was more than a little souvenir shop it was a shrine a temple a temple to the apple you were going to tell me why it was called the pharisees red no i wasnt lucy said all right well i asked you didnt i thats not the same thing will you tell me like in the scribes and pharisees all that stuff jane youre so illread lucy came out from behind the counter pulled down a large fat softbacked book here find out for yourself page fortythree it was the folklore of herefordshire by ella mary leather published in lucy said a formidable work of research and scholarship on page fortythree jane found a subheading fairies although there are now hut few persons living in herefordshire who believe in fairies faith in their existence must have been common enough with the folk of the last generation all the old people who can tell anything about fairies do not call them fairies at all but farises the word is pronounced almost like pharisees so you see jane nothing too biblical about that oh wow dont keep saying that its most annoying of course people deny today that its anything to do with fairies but people always deny fairies because the word itself has become such a term of ridicule jane looked at the matchsticklimbed gossamerwinged things clinging to the rims of cups and plaques perched on the tops of shelves the edges of picture frames nothing like those jane im afraid those are the traditional forms that everybody knows and if one is to create an impression of the spirit in nature thats the one people are normally prepared to accept even as a joke if one were to create an effigy of a real tree spirit as theyre more often perceived by those able to the customers would be disturbed and id have a reputation as something a good deal worse than a lunatic crone tree spirits for want of a more credible term essences whatever you want to call them they are in fact more perceptible in and around fruitbearing trees the female trees thats why i was so outraged by all this nonsensical talk of the oldest tree in the orchard as the apple tree man not a feminist thing simply the way it is but i still dont understand why the apples were called farises red were they supposed to belong to the fairies what you have said lucy is a belief in some supernatural intervention in the creation of this particular apple its a notsorare blending of paganism as were forced to call it and christianity the church being for much of its history in the very centre of the orchard which came first i wouldnt like to say though i suspect the orchard perhaps there was a prechristian shrine where the church now stands we cant say we can but speculate oh w jane swallowed waited lucy detached one of the tiny fairies from a shelf edge held it up to the light translucence you see thats the essence of it as fine as air spirits of the air the spirits of the earth goblins and things are denser the tree elves are brown and green theyre the protective and motivating forces in nature some of them are of limited intelligence but like us they evolve i find it impossible to explain the phenomenon of life without them mum might not be sympathetic lucy thought for a moment her lips becoming a tight bud after a while she said the great mystery of life can be approached in terms of pure physics the electronic soup of atoms and particles and also in religious terms terms thats all it is jane traherne never speaks of elves or devas but he refers all the time to angels cherubim and seraphim and cupids who pass through the air bringing love traherne is full of coded references we know of his interest in the ancient occult philosophy of hermes trismegistus we know from the writings of john aubrey that traherne was psychic but in those days as you know one had to be extremely cautious or you ended up like wil williams precisely jane williams we know was trahernes protege as well as his neighbour i think wil was a little too incautious in his attempts to walk with the angels jane said mum doesnt have much to say about angels angels are not cool in todays streetwise church i mean angelic forces correspond to what are called devic presences the devas are the prime movers if you like in the structure a deva may control a whole area a whole sphere of activity or an ecosystem like an orchard jane said automatically lucy positively purred with pleasure youre making the leaps youre receiving help the channel was opened you know when i thought it was just the cider oh the ciders very much a part of it the ciders the blood of the orchard its in your blood now i felt at once that it had to be one or both of you us you and merrily she wont want to know jane said jane returned just before six she said trade had not been exactly brisk but a nice brummie couple with a corgi had bought a set of four handpainted appleshaped cups and saucers for sixtyfour pounds thank heavens for people with no taste jane said merrily noticed she had with her a copy of the penguin edition of selected poems and prose by thomas traherne you bought that with your wages lucy gave it to me i refused to take any wages its fun playing shop you going to actually read it of course im going to read it trahernes cool oh right shouldve realized why is he cool because he could see that we were surrounded by all this beauty but we didnt appreciate it and we were quite likely to destroy it which was pretty prophetic thinking back in the midseventeenth century when there was no industry and no insecticides and things fair enough merrily said and he said we should enjoy the world get a buzz out of it get high on nature like god wanted us to be happy like have parties and things you know jane said you kind of make me sick sometimes youre so smug merrily said nothing oh dear one of those moods and yet thinking about it she hadnt been at all sullen or sulky of late just distant more selfcontained as if there was something going on inside her which of course there would be at her age all kinds of volatile chemicals sloshing about a boy possibly but why would she hide that shed never hidden it in the past no this was something to do with miss devenish twice jane had disappeared twice shed turned up with lucy devenish but i rather like lucy devenish merrily lit a cigarette should she go and talk to the old girl jane went up to her apartment to work on her mondrian walls this apparently involved painting the irregular rectangles between the oak beams in blue black red and white the listed buildings inspector would probably come out in the same colours if he ever saw it still as even merrily wasnt allowed to see it what the hell sometimes kids should be allowed even encouraged to behave bizarrely merrily finished her cigarette then went to put some supper together when jane came down to eat she dropped the big one ill probably go to church tomorrow sorry merrily turned from the aga dropping a slice of hot focaccia in shock what did you just say i think you heard all right flower merrily said calmly you go and lie down ill call the doctor very funny jane walked over to the kitchen window there was a sunset blush on the lawn merrily gazed out a little bewildered unsure how to handle this development shed made a point of never exerting any pressure to get the kid into a service admittedly it would be politic for the ministers daughter to be present at her mothers official installation ceremony with the bishop next friday and to persuade jane to come shed planned a small deal after the service she could go on to colette cassidys birthday party no restrictions it looked as if no deal would be needed who was the influence thomas traherne miss devenish more like she should be delighted but somehow she felt rather offended she took in a big breath jane huh what happened the day you didnt go to school jane looked at her almost through her the dark blue eyes were completely blank shed seen eyes like that on kids a year or two older than jane up in liverpool they were usually on drugs merrily tried not to panic tell me what happened jane she told you jane said almost wildly lucy told you i want to hear it from you you dont believe me you havent told me anything not to believe a shadow seemed to pass between them she remembered how as a small child jane would conceal small things an old tennis ball once that shed found in the garden for fear they would be taken away from her if her mother found out at the age of ten shed got hold of a thick paperback by jilly cooper hiding it under a panel in the floor of her wardrobe like it was real hard porn youre all the same the kids face suddenly crumpled like a tissue you think you know everything what merrily moved towards her whats wrong flower you jane backed away something inflamed about her eyes you stand up there in your pulpit mrs sodding holierthanthou and you drivel on about the virgin birth and the holy bloody ghost the same stuff over and over and over again and jane whats all this about whats the fucking use i dont think ill bother with any supper ill just go to bed youre not making a word of sense do you know that whats brought this on can we talk about it jane just stamped past her gripping the copy of traherne it must be what three am the alarm clock ticking very loud in the big bedroom with hardly any furniture the clock an oldfashioned one with twin bells none of your cellbattery bleepers in this house set for fivethirty because there was holy communion at eight only about half a dozen people last week mainly pensioners including uncle ted out of familial loyalty she thought about jane then and her mind flooded with anxiety once again the kid had a secret she was afraid might be taken away from her this time it would not be so innocuous she drifted away again with the ticking of the alarm clock a night breeze ruffled the trees and the sounds overhead footsteps very soft bare feet slithering merrily was icily awake the room one pine wardrobe one small table one bed was greywashed by the moon behind clouds like smoke she lifted up an arm and that also was grey as though her skin was transparent and her body was filled with moon gases which made it very light and so she didnt even remember getting out of bed and moving to the door im dreaming she told herself this is a dream but she didnt wake up outside were the doors concealing mournful derelict rooms that would never be filled rooms where even the memories were stale she was alone on the first floor of ledwardine vicarage a bathroom a toilet and four bedrooms only one slept in she was alone on this level while jane paced overhead angrily painting her walls by night was this part of her secret was the secret simply that she had to have secrets a private life merrily shivered it would soon be summer and the nighthouse was novembercold the nighthouse a different place a colder place the noises overhead had stopped well all right if jane wanted to paint in the night that was up to her it was the weekend she could keep her own hours in her own apartment merrily on the other hand needed her sleep if she was going to be up and bathed and breakfasted in time for holy communion she found herself standing by the stairs a hand on the oak rail a foot on the first step to the third storey she looked up quickly and thought she saw a light glowing and then she turned away took a step back it was janes storey janes apartment none of her business but in the moment she turned away she felt an aching sense of impending loss she would go back to bed try for two more hours sleep she turned to her door and realized she didnt know which it was she trembled hugged herself arms bubbled with goosebumps doors moonlight turning their brass knobs into silver balls she lunged at the nearest grabbed it turned it stumbled in with her eyes closed slammed the door behind her in dreams you could make as much noise as you liked when i open my eyes ill awaken in my own bed it will be nearly morning cold moonlight soaked an empty room a room she hardly recognized been inside it no more than a couple of times a long narrow room uncarpeted its floorboards black and bumpy and ending in a long and leaded window unseasonally running with condensation a figure stood by the window its back to her jane what are you doing down here there was a vibration in the room running like a mouse along the floorboard from the window to where she stood she could feel it through the soles of her bare feet and it ran up the backs of her legs under her nightdress to her spine it wasnt jane she backed up to the door her fingers feeling behind her for the knob and gripping it and turning it the brass knob turned and turned again but the door did not open merrily turned it harder and faster in a panic now the figure at the window began to shift and she saw the head in profile and the face was a mans the knob loosened began to spin in the lock until it just came out in her hand in the very instant that the figure turned from the window to face her and it needed no moon it carried its own pale light oh please merrily whispered please not here sean glided towards her he could not speak for the blood in his mouth jane didnt make it to church after all there was no explanation after the morning service two parishioners commented on there being only two hymns and uncle ted had told merrily she wasnt looking at all well it must have been a wearing few weeks getting used to everything and now moving into a new house she ought to think about having a few days away perhaps after her installation service when she felt more secure more bound to the parish merrily asked in a steady voice if her predecessor alf hayden would be at the service there were some things she wanted to ask him about the vicarage ah yes ted said alf no he said alf would not be coming as he was rather unwilling to embarrass his successor at this difficult time i dont understand this is difficult ted said alf s received a letter signed by a number of parishioners urging him to use his influence to keep richard coffeys play out of the village she was dismayed whyve they written to him ted cleared his throat embarrassed well they ah because they dont feel they know you well enough yet to approach you on such a contentious issue and because they think that as a trendy woman priest im bound to support it is that right which of my parishioners are we talking about here ted its causing considerable anxiety in certain areas ted said its only a few people of course but influential people right i suppose they know the bishops supporting coffey i shall attempt to acquaint the bishop with the way local opinion seems to be moving ted said during a dinner party to which i understand we are both invited merrily was beginning to be aware of the levels of local society she was unlikely to penetrate even if she wanted to she found she was shaking with anger it was marginally more acceptable than fear when she got home jane wasnt there this was no surprise she searched her conscience as a parent then as a parent she walked up two flights to janes apartment stood outside the doors on the third floor went into janes bedroom where she found the bed neatly made and clothes neatly on hangers in the wardrobe the copy of the collected poems of thomas traherne was on the floor beside the bed opened spineup she turned it over it was open to a poem entitled the vision which began flight is but the preparative the sight is deep and infinite she put the book down where shed found it went out and closed the door the next door was to the socalled sittingroomstudy where jane had been painting the mondrian walls it was locked she turned away not entirely surprised and went down the stairs to the first floor a weak sun sent halfhearted beams through the landing window and through the oak balusters merrily went into her own room to change into a skirt and jumper the thought struck her that jane on the third floor had risen above her as if the third floor represented something merrily couldnt reach she was on the halfway floor with her anxieties and trepidations her earthly ties her clinging past her sick dreams of sean she came out of the bedroom and instead of going directly to the stairs turned left trying to remember which had been the door in her dream the passage didnt look the same at all she opened a door at random into a square bare room with two small irregular windows would they ever be familiar these rooms she tried another the bathroom of course god this was so stupid you couldnt control your dreams but you must never give into them let yourself be ruled by a runaway subconscious angrily almost absently she threw open another door found herself in a long narrow room with black bumpy floorboards and a long leaded window it all came back at her then the vague sunstroked morning was kicked aside by jagged memories of the night she couldnt stand it with a tiny cry she sprang back out of the room pulling the door behind her as it slammed shut she heard the handle fall out on the other side hysterical women much of the time over the next week jane was fine shed do nice things like get up early have merrilys breakfast made bring her a mug of tea when she was working on the admin stuff or her piece for the parish mag be pleasant to the parishioners and church wardens be sympathetic when merrily got letters like dear mrs watkins as you may have noticed my wife is an excellent singer who used to perform regularly at concerts sadly the village concert as we used to know it is no longer a part of community life and as church is her only opportunity to exercise her undoubted vocal talents in public both my wife and i have been dismayed by the recent unexplained reduction in the number of hymns at our sunday services i trust this is only a temporary aberration and that we can expect a return to the three or four hymns we were used to during the ministry of the reverend hayden dont back down jane said efficiently clearing away the breakfast things from what ive heard old hayden only had lots of hymns so thered be less for him to do his sermons were notoriously crap apparently and whove you heard that from flower oh you know people miss devenish people i see jane what do you think of modern hymns theyre still hymns arent they people dont actually think about them its like being at primary school like that alternative prayer book its not really alternative at all is it you might as well stick to the old one its more resonant yeah how far have you got with that idea for getting the punters to talk back im kind of working up to it i dont know maybe id just be doing an alf hayden because im insecure about preaching and cant accept that my views can be more significant than theirs but youre the middleman mum god speaks through you you dont have to be sarcastic im not sure i was jane said merrily had not told her about the six letters shed received four of them anonymous urging her to not on any account allow the church to be used for the performance of a play variously described as blasphemous satanic obscene and most amusingly typical of a man who writes plays for channel four on wednesday her mother phoned from cheltenham to say shed developed flu and seemed unlikely to make it to this induction service or whatever it was called oh sure nothing to do with her finding the idea of merrily being a priest a little embarrassing i just dont understand weve never had one of those in the family before i mean you never showed any interest in religion as a child shed never been able to talk in any kind of depth to her mother and she never saw her father whod moved to canada after the divorce oh yes had a few of those in the family havent we mummy i gather ted will be involved in this installation business her mother said i suppose hell look after you service for the licensing and installation of the reverend merrily watkins as priestincharge of the parish of ledwardine pm all welcome expect a full house ted said when he turned up with the printed leaflets we havent had one of these for over thirty years and a woman too youll enjoy it youll sparkle i know you will merrily rubbed tired eyes how about if i just smoulder ted smiled by the way was it something important you wanted to ask alf because the old bugger wont be coming hes in the algarve timeshare villa easier to maintain than this place merrily noticed that the kitchens smallest window had been reduced by a rampant russian vine to the size of one of those arrowslits you found in castles ah ted said its this house isnt it you really shouldnt have to tire yourself out trying to make the place habitable he paused look ive been making a few enquiries if you can hang on for a year i think well be able to find you something more manageable plansve gone in for a small development down by the hereford road executive housing aimed at the kind of people whod eat at cassidys so he wont be objecting for once merrily said carefully was alf hayden glad to get away he was glad to retire even more time for golf and fishing i dont know about get away from the village i meant from this house well it was different for him as i say with that big family he always seemed fond of this pile even if he didnt take care of it he actually found it a good atmosphere atmosphere the lawyers eyes narrowing in the florid farmers face drop it merrily thought let it go sorry she carried his cup and saucer to the sink its just a bit dreary thats all youll brighten it up and jane hows her apartment coming along i dont really know shes keeping it under wraps jane had bought her own paints and brushes to do her mondrian thing coming out once to meet merrily halfway up the second stairs arms spread wide no stay out youll only say im making a mess knowing her mum was far too honourable to sneak up there while she was at school separate lives my god merrily thought were starting to lead separate lives meeting at mealtimes like hotel guests on thursday night the night before the installation service she was awoken by a sound from above a single tentative footstep as though someone was testing the floor to be sure the boards were firm between the joists like one of those ballbearings in a gaming machine the sound must have been rolling around her head for an inordinately long time wake up come on dont rise to this wake up now because she wasnt really awake at all was she every time something like this happened she dreamed she was waking up and she got out of bed and there were always more doors than there really were in that passage doors which should never be opened doors to the past the image of sean formed again behind her eyes sean turning from the window eyes full of blood hands feeling the air like the hands of someone newly blind merrily remembered shrinking back against the door knowing that if his hands had found her he wouldnt let go and he would always be in that room she couldnt remember getting out of there only awakening in this bed in her terror to the morning merrily opened one eye with some difficulty it had been a sticky sucking sleep like treacle she pulled her head from the pillow looking for the window a strange terracotta moon hung low and sultry between the trees she sat up blinking pushed her hands through her hair it was damp with sweat her nightdress was pasted to her skin there was a tightness around her chest another footfall and then another closer and then a flurry of them before two final emphatic steps like someone taking up a position directly over her bed and then silence what the hells she doing up there no i slept really well thank you didnt get up once wrapped in her yellow towelling robe jane spread sunflower marge on crispbread i dont get up in the night unless im ill you know that what time was this i dont know merrily carried bread to the toaster she didnt want any toast just a nights sleep after midnight before dawn oh mum do you remember me ever getting up in the night well yes as a matter of fact the first night we spent here you got up to go to the loo i didnt jane im trying to be patient you did no i said i wanted to go when i first got into the sleeping bag and you said forget about it itll go away and so i did and it did you got up in the night flower merrily said through her teeth you wanted me to go with you you were tugging on my hand bloody hell jane threw down the butter knife where do you get this crap from you were dreaming for gods sake all right look i shouldve told you i was throwing this wild party last night yeah we had this allnight binge with masses of booze and hard drugs idve invited you but i knew you wanted a good nights sleep before your initiation ceremony christ mother so youre saying you didnt hear anything at all last night merrily said in a small voice bent over the toaster her back to jane there was a dull ache far behind her eyes jane made a clicking noise beyond exasperation i sleep as you used to keep pointing out the sleep of the innocent perhaps it was a ghost merrily dropped hot toast jane grinned slyly place is old enough yeah bound to have ghosts maybe you should do an exorcism we have the book we have the candles dont know about the bell would a bicycle bell do hey did you have like mockhauntings at college to practise your technique we didnt do exorcism the only ghost that ever got a mention was the holy ghost i cant believe it they didnt teach you anything useful at that college did they jane crunched her crispbread thoughtfully er do you think its him what merrily shovelled her toast on to a plate and brought it to the table she didnt want to talk about this any more one of them was going a little mad what did it mean when half your night seemed to be spent in some ungodly no mans land between reality and dreams how could you be suffocated by a house this big wil jane smiled wistfully dont be silly hey if id known i couldve invited him to my party theres no decent totty in ledwardine these days all right let it go and talking of parties will you be coming to mine the initiation thats what you call a party is it i know very sad but the cassidys are laying on a buffet afterwards in the church itself should be over by about halfnine or ten but perhaps you could slip away get changed and drift over to colettes thing up in the restaurant jane met her eyes the kid could always recognize a deal what makes you think i want to go to colettes party dont you jane shrugged what time would i have to be home merrily shrugged really i trust you to be careful and to remember that youre not sixteen yet so dont get shagged is what you mean merrily held the kids brazen gaze something like that well like i said jane smiled ruefully looking suddenly and disturbingly older theres no worthwhile totty around here these days is there when jane had left for school merrily sat for a while staring at the cold uneaten toast and then she dragged the phone over to the table an admission of defeat but what could she do jane as usual had touched a nerve merrily tapped out the college number from memory is it possible to speak to dr campbell the switchboard said david campbell was on the phone merrily said shed wait david was the only one of her old tutors she figured would be any help he was a liberal but hed also been high church in his time an incenseburner we didnt do exorcism the only ghost that ever got a mention was the holy ghost she felt more than a little stupid about this once in liverpool one of her prozzies had asked merrily what she could do about her flat which was haunted the flat had been supplied by the womans pimp who owned the building merrily had interpreted this as a cry for help found her a room in a shelter but shed gone back to the flat and the pimp after a week never made contact again putting you through the switchboard said merrily watkins how are you love hello david installation day right tonight how did you know word gets around you wont mind if i dont come i hate bloody parishes as you know i remember david are you alone one always hopes not he meant god merrily pondered the getout option asking him about some aspect of installationnight protocol but she let the silence hang too long whats the problem love david said quietly ok i think oh jesus it sounds so her head thumping away go on all right i think my vicarage is haunted and i dont know how to handle that david said i see she imagined him in his office his metalstemmed pipe sticking out of the penpot on the desk im glad you see she said because i dont according to my uncle ted churchwarden and oracle the last incumbent had no problems in that department and that was over about thirtyfive years what makes you think its haunted was she imagining a shift in his voice a reserve setting in oh she said usual stuff or what i understand is usual footsteps in the night seeing things that that cant be there it isnt imagination although the experiences do seem to be interwoven with dreams what i mean some of it happens in actual dreams sometimes i think im awake when im really dreaming and maybe the other way around too and i look i know what youre thinking and i have been overworking a bit and things have been very fraught what with living out of a pub and then moving into an old house thats far too big and what hold on steady im perfectly steady i mean this morning my daughters saying to me didnt they teach you how to do an exorcism in college and i have to say no we didnt even touch on it why didnt we touch on it david how is jane shes fine shed be what fourteen fifteen what are you saying that most poltergeist activity is caused by adolescent children that its jane whos doing it im not qualified to say anything but why merrily demanded why didnt we go into this stuff were supposed to be at the cutting edge arent we were supposed to be dealing with the supernatural on a daytoday basis and yet we never talked about ghosts true david said we never once discussed the area of parapsychology and perhaps we should have if only to examine the demarcation lines youve lost me all right she envisaged him shifting in his old captains chair leaning an elbow on the cushion over an arm establishing a position let me say first of all that i accept entirely that certain unexplained events occur all the time so youre not saying im nuts certainly not theres far too much evidence what i am saying however and i say it as a question to which i dont really have an answer is do these phenomena really fit inside our field of operation good or evil theyre spiritual matters but are they are we not simply talking about say forms of energy which are as yet unknown to science yes certainly this sphere of activity was absolutely central to the work of the medieval church much of what priests were up to in those days would constitute what we now dismiss as magic illusion theyd find it expedient to produce the odd miracle out of their back pockets to maintain their what you might call their street cred what we know to be perfectly natural electrical phenomena would then have been seen as the work of either god or satan yes i do believe in haunted houses but you think let me get this right you think theres a scientific explanation that has nothing to do with religion and therefore nothing to do with us so all the official diocesan exorcists are just remnants of the middle ages dangerous ground here merrily yes some clergy feel drawn to that kind of work but even they are increasingly seeing what they do as a form of psychology the church is guarded about ghosts and demons and alleged appearances of the mother of god as damp stains in kitchen walls and rightly so in my view but that doesnt mean there isnt something happening dangerous ground indeed merrily thought how far was he from saying that one day science would explain god and then theyd all be redundant so you think i should see a scientist or a shrink certainly not or take jane to one david campbell sighed youre a sensible person merrily thats why youre in a responsible position even though im a woman its still sensitive david said now there was an unmistakable coldness in his voice youre saying i should keep my mouth shut merrily said or ill have the diocesan chauvinists twittering to the bishop told you what happens when you let hysterical women take over that sort of thing i think you should give it a few more weeks it isnt harmful in any way is it she thought of sean peering and groping through the mist of blood the dreamsean that definitely was a dream wasnt it the phone felt slippery in her hand and i wouldnt have thought david said that after all the emotional traumas youve come through you would find these minor paranormal fluctuations at all frightening no she paused to bring her voice down oh no you say you dont know how to handle it as if theres a secret technique we didnt bother to tell you about there isnt im afraid sorry love but you have to search your own faith your own belief system look call me again in a week or two if its still worrying you but he was telling her not to he was telling her that as far as the church was concerned she was on her own tears she hauled her headache off to the church was it because she didnt like being alone in the vicarage because the even older church with its tombs and the fractured skulls grinning up at you from stone flags was actually homelier frightened frightened of a paranormal fluctuation frightened for her daughters emotional condition her own mental state the priestincharge gods handmaiden good god no perish the thought her head felt like a foundry shed never ring david campbell or anyone else at that bloody college again she gripped the cold ringhandle of the door into the porch pausing there as she tended to these days if dermot child was slowly undressing her for the benefit of the bellringers she didnt want to be a captive audience she opened the church door just a crack through it echoed a torn and stricken howl you she stopped head pulsing you liza howells the night you came to me with your bruises your torn lip mouth smashed and teeth gone that night your husband beat you for your dalliance with joseph pritchard her first thought was that this was something to do with the pageant the womens institute was organizing for the festival a parade of ledwardine society through the ages ok footsteps leave it there a minute but this voice shed heard before martin creighton the theatre director so ok if we had this liza sitting somewhere in the middle and shes wearing what a fairly simple black dress mira wickham the designer nothing obvious until shes on her feet its important that the members of the audience sitting all around her dont realize she isnt one of them until she starts to react merrily walked in stood by the norman font in fact you know i think what would be really good mira said is if liza and one or two of the others have been chatting to people in character before the lights go down a merging of presentday villagers with their ancestors so that it seems to several people that they know liza and the others as individuals and this communicates itself we get a blur a timeslip spooky creighton said but that only works if you have real locals in the audience every night so we offer free seats to regular churchgoers let the vicar sort that out you might find it just a bit more complicated than that merrily said and there was silence stefan alder spotted her from the pulpit oh hi he bounded down loped along the aisle grabbed her hand youre merrily watkins right mr alder creighton and wickham came to stand either side of him they looked uncomfortable look creighton said i hope you dont think were being presumptuous obviously weve got to plan as if the thing is going to happen here but if you say no he wiped the air both hands flat thats it well understand and where would you go then oh stefan alder flicked back his ashblond fringe im sure the bishop would fix richard up with something although personally if we couldnt do it here id be inclined to knock it on the head you see creighton was glaring at him no really martin i want to be upfront about this whole thing it was my idea after all i look are you doing anything absolutely vital merrily i mean can we talk about this the two of us really succulent totty jane had described him once being provocative maybe this was what she saw when she thought of wil williams it was understandable in a creamcoloured sweattop and light blue jeans he looked as fresh and innocent as richard coffey seemed seasoned and corrupt he looked like the singer with one of those boy bands jane claimed shed grown out of down past the last of the graves where the church bordered the orchard on one side and the vicarage garden on the other there was an apple tree in the hedge it could have been this one stefan said well i mean obviously not this particular tree but its ancestor i was talking to your mr parry and he said this particular spot could well have been orchard in wils time you notice how all the graves at this end are relatively modern showing where they had to extend the churchyard it was true there was even a grave of black marble put in before the conservationists got them banned couldnt be this particular tree though could it merrily said according to the legend no actual apples would ever grow over the place where he lay whereas the tree in the hedge was heavily talcumed with blossom they would say that though wouldnt they all these stories are supposed to have an eerie postscript stefan plucked off a sprig i remember the first time i came here id read an account of it and id thought you know poor sod there was no emotional involvement at that stage not until i actually came here i just thought what a bloody shame i mean even if he was a witch damaging an apple crop really perhaps if it had gone to court it wouldve been thrown out that was happening increasingly its my understanding that by people were getting a bit wise to all these witchcraft accusations you had a neighbour you couldnt get on with youd just accuse him of making your prize bull impotent or something youre right there had to be more they wanted him dead otherwise what was the point they wanted him dead because he was gay thomas bull wanted him dead and james bulldavies knows that his eyes the colour of his jeans were shining with a very innocent kind of fervour he looked on the edge of tears he looked too frail and vulnerable to be living with someone as coldly manipulative as richard coffey but that was none of her business they walked to the churchyard wall yes this part was newer some of the stone wasnt even local and stood leaning against it looking back at the church whose stones if they could speak would be able to answer all their questions lets look at it objectively merrily said youre saying i think that because bull was a puritan hed be absolutely shattered to discover his parish priest was homosexual now i cant quite remember what percentage of todays anglican ministers are gay but its a substantial one and if they all got fired a few hundred churches would have to close overnight now how different was it then in a country area where peoples attitude to all matters sexual would have been well tolerant downtoearth shall we say look i dont know he fingered his fringe i dont know where you stand as a woman for what its worth merrily said i think gays have always been drawn to the priesthood because its something they do rather well it being a job that often calls for feminine qualities i suppose as we werent allowed in for so long gay men have helped to hold it all together theyve given the church a breadth of compassion without which it might not even have survived that make any sense stefan alder stepped back striking an unselfconsciously camp pose with one hand on a hip she was sure shed seen him before not just in the village must have been on television maybe a victim in the bill or a casualty in casualty thats beautiful he smiled radiantly and handed her the sprig of apple blossom thats a really beautiful thing to say you know i feel i can trust you now i really do oh well it was just richard seemed to think i was prejudiced in some way and im not thats all look he said look i want to explain to you at first i mean hes committed to it its his project but at first richard was only doing this for me he wasnt especially struck by the story or the village we were having a few days break and richard was halflooking for a holiday cottage and we spent a night at the black swan after dinner he was tired and he had a headache so he went up to bed and i sat in the lounge with some coffee idly reading some local guidebooks it seemed odd coming across a mention of ledwardine church and looking up and seeing the steeple through the lounge window and then i saw a brief mention of wil i mean id read the story but i hadnt remembered the name of the village and it was such a shock realizing i was sitting just a short walk away from where he died the next thing i knew i was just sort of here he looked very ethereal against the apple trees which themselves with their heavy blossom were like the ghosts of trees it was a cloudy morning a fine spring drizzle beginning its incredible in autumn isnt it stefan said the air around hereford is so full of apple scent it seems in the evening as if the whole countys heavy and drunk on it and even though this orchard was looking rather sad and neglected i felt the way it was back then huge and bountiful the absolute core of the county the very centre of what traherne called the orb merrily remembered with an unsettling feeling what gomer parry had said about the apple tree man so gnarled and barrenlooking in the ice now full of thrusting buds i just knew that wil even if hed had the power would never destroy an orchard stefan said not the biggest orchard in hereford it would be like poisoning the country more than that it i mean he was a friend of traherne nature was an aspect of god it would have been blasphemy he wasnt a witch at all i suddenly felt very very close to him he was in the air in the scent the whole appleaura of this place and then he was close to whispering merrily was still holding the sprig of blossom hed given her she was aware of being set up dropped into a little cameo scene but the snowy numinescence had settled on her senses she was softened i could suddenly see him i could see that poor persecuted boy hanging here all alone all alone among the apple trees it was spring then like today i could see the blossom which had fallen on his hair like stars there were big theatrical tears in his eyes now but it didnt seem like a performance she didnt feel somehow that he was that good an actor did he really think hed seen wil hanging here or was he describing an exercise in imagination perhaps it didnt matter merrily it was the most spiritual moment of my life i just knew id been brought here just me but why me who was i was i him had i been him in a previous life no he shook his head you dont fall in love with yourself do you not like that god she didnt know how she felt about this at all i just knew in that moment what wil was why i had to be here to be near to him to convey the truth about him that it could be the most important thing i would ever do i couldnt sleep i was tortured i awoke early walked all around the village there was nothing for sale not a single for sale sign and then i saw the lodge empty and derelictlooking and i just knew that whatever it cost he stopped speaking looking for some reaction merrily said did richard know why you were so anxious to live here oh yes stefan said if youve seen some of richards plays youll know hes fascinated by obsession i suppose at that time id become sort of his obsession so he bought the lodge at a price merrily could hear james bulldavies made him pay made him pay i have to play him stefan alder said very quietly i have to feel him inside me in the purest sense i mean i have to be wil i have to be wil here you do understand that dont you merrily after they parted merrily walked around the churchyard for some time alone decision time well he was a nice guy an honest guy but he was in love with a dead man with a ghost and thered been a certain madness in those tearglazed eyes coffey he was in love with stefan hed bought a house in the village because of it but he hated the vendor bulldavies he had a score to settle there and he would use stefans desire coffey and bulldavies were both in their separate ways powerful and influential men stefan alder was neither and so was vulnerable but he was also the catalyst merrily sighed and thought back to her famous wil williams sermon collect all the information you can get listen to all the arguments yes done that seek out independent people who might have an opinion or a point of view you hadnt thought about nobody here is entirely independent not lucy devenish nor alison kinnersley they each have their own hidden agenda so why not put it all on him thats what hes there for go into a quiet place yes im here in a cushion of soft white petals put that question tell him its urgent tell him youd like an answer as quickly as possible i wouldnt mind an answer now actually if thats all right with you she looked up to where the church steeple was fingering heaven focusing on the gilded weathercock on top of the steeple as if it could point her in the right direction perhaps only the weathercock had changed since williamss day the steeples and towers were still the tallest structures in the countryside the churches were powerful places merrily bit her lip was this the answer freedom of expression was one thing multiple obsession and the taint of necrophilia something else you let obsession into a church at your peril when she went back into the building the theatricals had gone replaced by uncle ted caroline cassidy and her restaurant manager barry bloom they were setting up tables in the space behind the pews i really dont know about this ted was saying it is a church oh but the very name of the cider ted caroline sang and if as many people as you say turn up theyll get about half a paper cupful each ah merrily merrily will decide thanks a lot merrily said without thinking what is it this time ted and caroline both stared at her oh god sorry im a bit on edge big night coffee vicar barry bloom said he was squat wideshouldered frizzhaired exsas it was rumoured like for some reason quite a few people in the catering business around hereford barry already had a coffee machine set up next to the font oh thanks caffeine wonderful she hadnt had any breakfast wasnt likely to get any lunch she was dying for a smoke but maybe not so whats the problem well as you know caroline said the ledwardine festival officially opens on saturday does it god wrapping her hands around the hot polystyrene coffee cup this meant shed be expected to announce her decision about the play caroline said the idea is we open in a small way with a ceremony in the square in the afternoon terrence has hired a towncrier well hold some of the lesser events and exhibitions in the first weeks and then gradually build up to the major concerts and the pi and whatever else we arrange but you see my dear we wanted before the opening to introduce our new cider produced by the powells to their old recipe with a little help from barry of course i just organized the bottles barry said i gather they had to get in some extra apples to supplement the pharisees reds the orchard wasnt overproductive last year hadnt been pruned hardly in years be a good crop this year though by the looks of it we have an absolutely terrific label caroline said designed by the young man at marches media on his computers it has a drawing of the church on it alfred approved that before he left how many bottles merrily asked how many barry three hundred nearer five its going to be frightfully exclusive and rather expensive proper champagne bottles naturally there was a time when good cider was valued higher than champagne and this is an awfully good cider isnt it barry not the kind of beverage likely to be on sale to the village louts at the ox so we wondered if we might use the occasion of your induction installation makes you sound rather like a household appliance my dear caroline squeezed merrilys arm no we wondered if we might uncork the first bottle at your reception and give everyone a drink perhaps just a teensy one the cider you see this was dermot childs idea will have an ecclesiastical connection because the church was itself once in the very centre of the orchard wasnt it and the name we chose i gather this originated from lucy devenish said barry quite caroline tossed him a disapproving glance i was going to say the poet traherne the poet traherne via miss devenish barry said stolidly being as none of us were that conversant with his work it comes from a prayer trahernes supposed to have written with a woman over at kington but nobodys quite certain about that well merrily said it sounds fair enough to me as youve probably gathered im trying to make the church less formal more accessible and while it might be a bit early to set up an actual bar with beer pumps and optics and things caroline tittered shrilly i cant see any problem over a few glasses of cider do you want me to kind of bless the stuff or something caroline looked thrilled would that be in order i dont know really ted didnt know why she was asking him she was after all entirely on her own merrily ted said in his time alf hayden blessed everything from tractors to the microwave oven in the village hall didnt seem to be a problem then even if the mention of dermot child in connection with cider had sent a bad ripple down her spine ok then she said whats it called the cider barry bloom said the wine of angels you like that thats traherne the line goes tears are the wine of angels and the delight of god which falling from what is it mrs cassidy the whole verse is printed on a label on the back something about them being sweet precious and wholesome thats the bit sweet precious and wholesome and delicious indeed and then theres a bit of a duff line about them being the best water works to quench the devils fires but weve stopped it before that sweet precious and wholesome and delicious indeed you couldnt get an ad agency to do a better one than that could you vicar but i mean he wasnt actually talking about cider he was talking about tears well barry spread his hands if it ends in tears at least we can all get drunk leaving the church merrily met james bulldavies coming in ah mrs watkins as if the meeting was a surprise it was the first time theyd been facetoface since the exchange in the vicarage kitchen look bulldavies shuffled slightly glad i caught you fact of the matter is bit of a pig the other night tried to pressure you wrong of me want to apologize merrily said nothing she walked out of the porch he followed her into the churchyard gets on top of one the old family heritage thing narrows the outlook cant focus sorry so merrily stopped before the first grave turned to look up at him youve had a think about it his eyes narrowed and perhaps come to the conclusion that the idea of your familys stature being toppled by a polemical play with an axe to grind about gay rights is something of an overreaction his long face began to redden he had not of course concluded any such thing anyway merrily said on the question of the church being used ive come to a decision and ill probably slip it in when i say a few words at the reception tonight ok the silence lasted all of three seconds merrily didnt move you have made a decision bulldavies said heavily yeah just this afternoon actually he scowled heard youd been talking to the actor alder sure we had a chat she wondered how he knew who his informant was or perhaps hed seen them himself suppose he won you over cried on your shoulder we had a private conversation i dont cry myself james bulldavies said well merrily said real men dont do they youre mocking me merrily thought about him in the vicarage kitchen you make it hard for me mrs watkins and perhaps for yourself she thought of the funeral card delivered to the black swan wil williams was the devils minister she thought her decision was the right decision but by god some people were making it bloody hard and all her human reactions were still urging her to go the other way but she had to say something so she thought what jane would say and said that you know james you really are a sad bastard he blinked i gave it a lot of thought and the only decision that seemed ethically and spiritually right in the end was to offer richard coffey and stefan alder the village hall for their play if thats all right with the parish council oh he said im not going to explain how i decided but i can say it had nothing to do with anything you said about the need to protect your illustrious family and in fact she went right up to him looked up a full foot into his narrow autocrats face if you ever ever try to put the arm on me again over anything anything at all ill ill have your balls she stepped back there was no reaction on james bulldaviess face but his back stiffened and she saw his feet come instinctively together his eyes were focused over her right shoulder understood he said i merrily the first person jane saw when she got off the school bus was colette wearing her leather jacket and a black chiffon scarf she was with a black guy maybe in his thirties unloading some gear from a dirty white transit van unfortunately dean wall and danny gittoes and a couple of their mates had spotted them too im telling you it is danny gittoes said i seen him in shrewsbury he looks different natrally with all the stuff on yeah yeah dean said mr cosmopolitan you hear that men gittoess been to shrewsbury hang on ill find out ill ask the slag it was a dull afternoon a slow drizzle starting dean wall waddled across the square to colette jane following at an angle party then is it dean trying to peer into the van colette didnt look at him might be this a mate o yours dean looked down at the black guy who was short and lithe wore a black tshirt and white leather trousers dean looking like a

kidderminster than kingston jamaica i dont somehow think so jane said er you are dr samedi he fixed lazy eyes on janes he growled a low seismic rumble long night moonbright burninon a low light everythinyou wearin honey just a liddle too tight oh wow jane said impressed shed always found rap and drum n bass stuff quite tedious after a while but the idea of it happening in ledwardine was something else and de drummin begin feel de drummin inside fingers dancin dancin dancinup andownyospine jeff killed the rap yawned and stretched excuse me ladies i better go make sure them sheepshaggers dont put that gear the wrong way up colette watched the little guy sashay towards the glass doors isnt he just like magnetic i guess he will blow you away janey i promise heavy magic seems a bit cheeky getting wall and gittoes to carry all the stuff in when they arent invited jane said i mean you know cool but i want them like really desperate to get in colette lightly tongued her upper lip and all their mates i want them wetting themselves to be in there jane looked at her there was this perverse side to colette she didnt quite understand they might cause trouble mmmhmm colette agreed they just might if they can find their balls you want that sure i dont understand oh janey colette sighed in despair when they do get in i want them to feel like gatecrashers unwanted resentful you know my dipshit parents have naturally gone over the guest list so we have a lot of nice boys from good families that kind of thing plus a few like lloyd powell on account of his old mans a councillor i mean you tell me where is the tension in that tension a party colette said with heavy patience aint a party without tension the evening was still and heavy with the scent of apple blossom which clung to the orchard trees like hoar frost made lol shudder as he got out of the rusting astra in the drive as he let himself into the cottage the phone began to ring and his spirits collapsed like a cardhouse its lucy he thought somethings wrong around his trainers on the doormat he saw a pale confetti on the mat inside oh jesus oh jesus examining the soles of his shoes to make sure he hadnt brought them in himself the orchard was coming in on him thered be petals all over the carpets on the table over the bed in the bath jesus calling out in his panic to the stern unforgiving god of his parents collecting the usual stab of guilt hed once aged sixteen dropped a cup washing up and muttered jesus christ and his mother had slapped his face with some ferocity wouldnt speak to him for two days the phone kept on ringing and lol kept staring at the petals on the mat maybe they just came in through the cat door maybe ethel brought them in that was it ethel had been hunting in the orchard and returned with her fur full of apple blossom that made sense didnt it the phone went on ringing who would know he was back except lucy lucy who had sent him away after the thing with jane watkins seeing at once that he was in no fit state to go back to the cottage go off somewhere for a few days ill feed the cat go to a city somewhere not like this do you understand laurence well talk when you return when youre in a more receptive state in oxford over four days he hadnt even seen gary kennedy just walked the touristy streets and the parks and gardens and the riverside dipping into bookshops and record shops and pubs and reading thomas traherne and getting as much sleep as he could take and reading more traherne the poet whod found the whole universe in the fields and woods and hills within a few miles of lols cottage and was completely knocked out by everything he experienced out there he has drowned our understanding in a multitude of wonders lucy had underlined this in his copy of trahernes centuries and written in pencil in the margin just because its something you cant explain it doesnt have to be bad it doesnt have to be ominous it might just be wonderful but the old strength the conviction had been missing it was a worried lucy whod waved him off in the rusting astra when hed come down from the loft and said this was a nightmare she hadnt contradicted him it had a fuzzy dreamlike quality when it happened when he saw jane watkins lying in the orchard but the implications were nightmarish the livingroom door was always left ajar for ethel and when lol went in she was weaving in and out of his ankles he picked her up and she purred into his chest as he grabbed the phone hello you little fuck the rasp distorting in the earpiece what you trying to do to me karl windling the old karl windling sounding cracklingly close hed spoken to dennis it had made him angry lol felt cold sweat on his forehead windling could be at the black swan he could be in his car in the lane dont shit me son do not shit me lol said where are you close enough now you fucking stay there you understand you go anywhere ill find you you dont move the rest of the night im coming over ill have a nice simple contract with me which you are signing son you wont very gently lol put down the phone thought for a moment then unplugged the wire from the wall went to the window just the astra in the drive and blossom in the orchard he carried ethel into the kitchen where he put out a bowl of wet food a bowl of dry food and more water he got out the litter tray filled it and laid it by the door he stroked the little black cat and put her down not knowing how long he would have to be away before karl windling gave up when the kid walked in merrily was at the kitchen table with a pot of tea and an ashtray full of butts jane dumped her schoolbag you have to be at the church by seven dont you yeah merrily said glumly sure do jane sat down opposite her second thoughts bit late for that isnt it merrily lit another cigarette when jane was away at school she couldnt wait for the kid to come back fooling herself that her daughter was entirely on her wavelength but looking at her now there was a distance in her eyes this was not paranoia not isolation whether she knew it herself or not part of jane was somewhere else i had a chat with stefan alder today cool jane said noncommittally even a couple of weeks ago her eyes would have lit up and shed have wanted to know all about it because even if he was gay stefan was really heavyduty totty he was telling me about the play and how they came up with merrily paused shed have to explain this sometime because there was going to be a fuss about it but she wondered if jane was really mature enough to understand she put down her cigarette its because of stefan that richard coffey wrote the play stefans gay right stefans a homosexual i do know what gay means jane said sullenly and i know they think wil williams was persecuted because of that even if he wasnt right merrily was encouraged by the last bit stefan is i dont know if his relationship with coffeys going through a bad patch or if he only stays with coffey because of his career thats a bit cynical i said i dont know jane what i do know what i strongly feel is that stefan alder believes that hes been i dont want to use the word possessed because he didnt use it chosen by the spirit of wil williams to recreate the circumstances of his death to reveal the truth wow jane said its become an obsession yeah stefans in love with a ghost its a bit beautiful isnt it jane said no it isnt beautiful its unnatural and its dangerous and coffeys only going along with it because hes a very warped individual and i think it would be very wrong for me to let it happen in the church what merrily picked up the cigarette and drew on it im going to suggest they put it on in the village hall ill tell everybody tonight i thought id tell you first you cant jane said i have to flower jesus jane stood up the chair clattered to the floor behind her you sad cow and i really thought you were smart lol drove twice around the village looking for somewhere discreet to park the astra there were far more cars in the village than usual the square was packed a few dozen people walking about something on in the church arriving at the square a second time he panicked suppose karls car appeared in the mirror a car which could go twice as fast driven by a man ten times as hungry he swung down church street and left the astra by the kerb at the bottom end near the ox getting out and crossing to the shadowed side of the street lucy devenish lived in the middle of a small black and white terrace halfway up church street doors opening to the street he had reservations about going there for sanctuary visions of windling finding out busting in drunk smashing things but what could he do no other options he slid across the road lifted the small brass goblin knocker and rapped twice it sounded very loud in the street too loud no answer shit what if windling was to drive past now he rapped again please lucy she wasnt in it occurred to him that whatever was happening in the church she might be there he ran back across the road sweating now on the noticeboard was a small poster service for the licensing and installation of the reverend merrily watkins as priestincharge of the parish of ledwardine and a couple of dozen cars on the square yeah lucy would be in there along with anybody who was anybody including he spotted a familiar old blue land rover james bulldavies he stood on the cobbles staring at the land rover recognizing the repairs in the canvas each one stitched into his mind from the day it had been parked outside the cottage with all of alisons stuff inside at pm followed by refreshments in the church courtesy of cassidys country kitchen all welcome should he go in there and try to attract her attention hadnt been inside a church since his mothers funeral the thought of it created a ball of cold in his stomach ominous wouldnt help his state of mind going into a church especially tonight besides james bulldavies would be in there and probably alison no not alison a small tremor went through him bulldavies and alison rarely appeared in the village together bulldavies with his sense of what was proper would never bring her to church lol looked up at the church clock it was not yet sevenfifteen how long did these things take couple of hours at least chances were alison would be alone at upper hall she felt completely wrong she felt overdressed and underqualified for the white surplice and the clerical scarf and the academic hood from theological college she should have been barefoot in sackcloth she was here to serve and she wasnt up to it she was going to be a disaster she looked out at all the pious formal faces fronting for the inveterate village gossips whod always known she wasnt going to fit in shed fasted at least if unintentionally a whole day on tea and coffee and cigs her head felt like it was somewhere in the rafters she didnt much care the bishop was ritually explaining a few basics to the congregation as if they needed to know the church of england is part of the one holy catholic and apostolic church worshipping the one true god father son and holy spirit it professes the faith uniquely revealed in the holy scriptures and set forth in the catholic creeds which faith the church is called upon to proclaim afresh in each generation the word generation making her think at once of her daughter oh jane the kid had stalked out and merrily had sat there for another twenty minutes and smoked another two cigarettes was she being weak uncool pathetic even homophobic for heavens sake in spite of everything shed said to stefan alder and now jane even if with her famous sense of honour she wouldnt tell anyone why would boycott the service and then just as merrily was rising wearily from the table to go and change into her vestments jane had appeared in the kitchen doorway dressed demurely in a highnecked jumper and skirt i said id go and ill go mother ill go on my own ill see you afterwards a long time afterwards theyd agreed that the kid would leave after the service come back and change into her party gear all laid out presumably in her bedroom in her apartment her separate life meanwhile in public jane would do the honourable thing play the dutiful daughter oh god half an hour later while making her lonely sorrowful selfconscious way to the church the fake barbour flung over her clerical finery merrily had met lucy devenish or rather lucy had blocked her path just short of the lychgate the poncho spread wide like a bullfighters blanket i was hoping merrily shed said without preamble that you would have come to me but its not too late we have to talk you and i oh you really think we should talk do you miss devenish thats you and me rather than you and jane youre angry just sad my fault i was arrogant as usual i truly thought that you would come to me you said wed quarrel merrily reminded her pshaw shed actually produced that archaic sound a ploy a challenge to which i was sure youd rise i suppose youve been too busy but we cant put it off i need your help the village needs your help and of course your daughter merrily had glared at the old bat for presuming to know what her own daughter needed meanwhile all i would say to you tonight directly a personal plea is that you should announce without delay your decision to permit this man coffey to stage his play in the church do it now do it tonight believe me it will clear the air and alter the focus and make your life so much less complicated merrily had felt the smoke beginning to rise between her ears shed made herself take a long breath before reacting even though about a dozen parishioners were converging on them miss devenish i dont have time to discuss this right now but you can take it that i will not be announcing my decision to let coffeys play go ahead in the church not tonight not any night fury and anxiety nudging each other as she went in to make her vows to the bishop and to god and to blessed ledwardine oh shit alison said standing just inside the crumbling georgian doorway mistress of the house hed come on foot figuring that if she saw his car wheezing up the drive she just wouldnt answer the door hed followed with some trepidation the route alison took in the mornings on her horse the old bridleway alongside the orchard trying not to look at the apple trees but the image of jane watkins going in and out of focus in his head the smell of spring orchard powerfully everywhere and full of a mustiness that made him think of old sepia photographs the bridleway had come out near a pair of huge stone gateposts topped with the blurred stumps of what might once have been lions or eagles hed let his anger propel him between them it had been a long time coming this anger and it felt strange and cumbersome like a stiff new overcoat he knew hed always been one of lifes accepters like when alison had walked out hed accepted it must be his fault there must some deficiency in his character his sexual ability his social behaviour well all right there was he knew that for a fact he was screwed up and yet dont do this to me lol alison said expressionless echoing karl windling it was always him doing it to them lol looked over his shoulder down the hill to where the spire sprang up between the trees with the big red sun almost on its tip like a needle about to burst a balloon like he wanted to burst the smug bubble around alison figured the coloneld be in church doing his squire bit i thought this would be a good time lol alison said gently the good times are over she looked dramatically sultry in black silk trousers a black shirt open to the unexpected freckles between her breasts after all this time he wanted her very badly and that made him angry and sad and dont i even get to come in i dont think thats very wise do you this was where he was supposed to lose his temper break down start asking her if bulldavies had a much bigger dick that kind of hysteria when i saw his land rover on the square i thought maybe i could go into the church sit next to him ask him a few things that would have been embarrassing for you both but only one of us would have anything to lose alison started to close the door he put his foot in it knowing this rarely worked that if she wanted to with a door this size she could probably just break his ankle it would depend on whether she wanted to hurt him any more she drew the door back for momentum he left his puny trainer in the gap fuck you alison let the door fall open and walked away into the house and he followed her the bishop said in the declaration that you are about to make will you affirm your loyalty when theyd met before the service the bishop had enthused about richard coffeys exciting plans a parish church should be a happening environment the bishop said he was so glad that this beautiful vibrant village so full of creative people should have a priest who was young and energetic and sensitive and yes dare he say it female its still sensitive david campbell at the college had said sensitive james bulldavies was out there alone in his family pew james who had said he would support her so long as you remain sensitive to the best interests of this village she hadnt said a word to the bishop about bulldaviess threat it didnt matter now bulldavies had sworn allegiance would be her friend for life coffey and alder and maybe the bishop himself her enemies she felt dangerously lightheaded she should have eaten she shouldnt have drunk so much coffee the bishop intoned in bringing the grace and truth of christ to this generation and making him known to those in your care a question oh god it must be her bit now i merrily rose watkins do so affirm and accordingly declare my belief the bishop waited the bright red evening sun burnishing his high forehead and the apple in the hand of eve in the great westfacing stainedglass window the one so often reproduced on postcards a congregation of over a hundred men women and children waiting for their new minister to speak in a womans voice her face lifted slowly to the light in the vivid sunset the sandstone walls looked redder than shed ever known them the red of arterial blood the red of hellfire the red of the pharisees red the traditional cider apple of ledwardine the village in the orchard they waited the congregation the bishop god and merrily shivered as for wild glowing moments the walls of the church seemed to curve together the pews warping the congregation coalescing faces blending into pink pulp as the church itself became a swelling apple and she found she was caressing it in her hands and its rigid stalk was the steeple and she heard a roaring in her head and tumbled away from it losing all sense of where she was or why an acidic smell breath on her face merrily the bishop leaning over her disturbed at her silence a heavy very earthly pragmatic presence the bishop the administrator the chief executive she could hear his breathing faintly puffy smell his vaguely vinegary breath her own body felt very light as though she could raise her arms in her surplice and float away like a bat among the cob webbed oaken rafters im sorry she couldnt even say that someone coughed she saw the congregation below her caroline cassidy in her light blue jersey suit the sun putting a sheen on terrences pointed head at the other end of the pew richard coffey here because of the bishop his supporter and stefan alder a respectable distance between them and the cassidys but the fact that they were on the same pew showing how the battle lines had been drawn stefans eyes were shining reflecting some erotic wil williams fantasy and the conviction that the priest was on his side but you couldnt trust a woman could you hed be there at the reception afterwards with his glass of the wine of angels how was she going to face him what was she going to say to him i merrily come on shed learned all the replies practised them testing herself but the words wouldnt come and a part of her didnt care because they wouldnt oh god be coming from the heart why not and did it matter she heard whispers washing through the congregation a spreading awareness of something wrong and it was her she was wrong the reverend merrily rose watkins a mistake they were all realizing their terrible mistake she saw jane for the first time right at the back on the end of the pew gripping the prayerbook shelf whiteknuckled you could sense the tension in that grip a tension too under merrilys arms a friction on the skin a burning sensation and then that sudden tightening around the chest as though someone had grabbed her from behind grasping both breasts squeezing and pulling them back into her ribcage she thought of child felt physically sick rocked backwards all the breath forced out of her she saw james bulldaviess left arm stretched along the back of the pew no concern on his face priests came priests went the rock on which this church was founded had bull inscribed upon it she saw jane half out of her pew now i merrily but the priest could not move her chest was as tight and rigid as a wooden board a shockingly cold thrill passed from pew to pew the vicar cant go through with it the priest saw eve in the window holding out the apple to her the apple which she knew instinctively was a pharisees red no try try to speak draw a breath let it out i i merrily rose watkins do so affirm and ace the breath caught in her throat like phlegm the dregs of her voice drifted away into an empty church the pressure was abruptly released from her chest she swayed taking rapid shallow breaths she looked around she was on her own the bishop was gone the congregation had vanished the church was empty the soaring red walls had faded there were no colours in the windows the air was chill something crawled on hands and knees up the aisle towards her it was naked pale and stark as a cold candle her mouth opened as it slid towards her its head bowed its body racked and twisted its anguish crawled into merrily s raw and empty stomach and unravelled a dark ribbon of bile she tried to scream but her throat filled up the congregation rose in horror as the priestincharge fell forward into her own thin vomit blackeyed dog ii almost sulkily alison said it really isnt complicated i give him what he needs he gives me what i want she was sprawled in an ancient shapeless chintzy chair stretching out her legs inspecting her bare toes finding them more interesting than lol the room was lofty and colourless with a high tiled fireplace and no way could he believe this was what she wanted none of it sounded right hed sat here nearly an hour and shed talked and it was all superficial crap how shed always had this fantasy of living in the country since she was a kid in swindon and helped out at this riding school how shed thought that when she and lol got here meaningful things to do would suggest themselves ways of making money finding fulfilment but when you were living as they had in a little cottage with a little garden you might just as well be in some suburban villa whereas this this was the real thing country life as it was meant to be lived what she was saying was profound like hello magazine was profound for once lol couldnt let himself accept it hang on he moved to the corner of a sagging settee leaned towards her you chose the cottage you said it was perfect so i was wrong it was small it was shutin it was worse than the city nothing suggested itself except bulldavies apparently alison still didnt look at him look she said that may not be precisely what you think ok what do you think i think the sun was sinking below the sills of the deep georgian windows the room fading to dusty sepia well she said i imagine youre hurt wounded you think i never really cared for you that i just used you until someone more interesting came along took the words out of his head it was still killing him to think she might have been this superficial all along i really didnt want you to get hurt lol i wanted you to be you know angry as in hating me i didnt want any of this honourable shaking hands letsstillbefriends shit he stared at her i mean that was the very last thing you needed aggression you needed aggression bitterness you were never bitter i couldnt understand that why were you never bitter dumped by your family messed around by the system where was the resentment i wanted you to hate me rather than i mean i couldnt bear to see you just crawling away and crying into the bloody cat how do you know i did that it was not too dark to see her looking pained he remembered how when people started smirking at him in the shops he thought it was because he was this really obvious townie and maybe he needed to wear a flat cap buy a beatup truck grow sideburns below the jawline she curled her toes at him in exasperation somebody really should have told you i put on a hell of a show for miss devenish at that twelfth night thing poor james was dreadfully embarrassed and even she didnt take you on one side jesus little harmlesslooking guy like you and nobody has the consideration or even the bottle to tell him his womans screwing around lol winced little harmless guy thirtyseven years old and the best i ever managed was little harmless guy and endearingly messed up women love men to be messed up i really was going to sort you out but you know you get a an opportunity you have to take it i didnt imagine it was going to come so quickly im sorry he felt cold there were no visible centralheating radiators and although paper and logs were built up in the dog grate she hadnt attempted to light them the message here at least was clear for what its worth alison said it was that day i went into the village and got a puncture james was parking his land rover on the square he changed the wheel for me i said id buy him a drink so we went across to the black swan we talked for ages at one point i said i liked riding and he said he had horses didnt know why he kept them on just that the family always had for hunting and things james hates to let go of a tradition thats sort of admirable isnt it from what i heard lol said his father seems to have kept horses so thered always be a steady supply of stable girls there was a heartbeats silence whered you hear that her voice stayed casual he couldnt see her expression but he was sure he saw her toes tense a friend mentioned it lol you only have one friend what exactly did devenish say about the old man does it matter hes dead isnt he humour me youll just tell bloody james james alison said in a measured kind of way is the last person ill tell she said disregard for the finer feelings of women was a family trait lucy had a friend who was one of the stable girls patricia somebody the windows lit up shit alison said land rover lights get your head down alison said lol didnt move but she did suggest james was different he said more out of fairness to lucy than consideration for bulldavies on account of having a conscience like he was the first in the family to have one and he ought to get out of this house before what the hells he doing back he said itd be at least halften maybe this was meant lol thought facetoface in a cold triangle listen alison hissed he finds you here hell kill you listen to me hell come in the back way so listen wait in the hall until you hear his key and then leave quietly by the front door just pull it to behind you and there was me lol murmured getting all hyped up for a fight go alison was on her feet piss off he stood up disoriented in the gloom please alisons eyes glowing urgently all right in the hall he stood next to a coat stand smelling of barbourwax and manure he heard a key jingling in a distant lock but he didnt move utterly unbelievable bulldavies bawled darling her voice was pitched up the social scale are you ok silly bloody bitch threw up in the damn church who did ten minutes into the service loses her bloody lunch i ask you does a real priest ever lose control of himself like that ive seen hayden in that pulpit with streaming eyes two boxes of kleenex for men james what are you talking about the damn vicar physically sick in front of half the village perhaps theyll realize their mistake when we get a notice outside the church saying all services postponed due to menstrual fucking cycle lol hung on halffascinated alison was a committed feminist if hed said half of that shed be into his throat well darling alison said soothingly you did tell them didnt you lol let himself out stumbled down the steep drive between the broken gateposts the last of the sunset spread out before him like a long beach the church spire a lighthouse without a light nothing left that seemed real theyd brought her into the vestry she must have fainted there was a couch in there and theyd laid her on it and someone had put a rug over her faces came into focus like a surgical team around an operating table stern and concerned and triumphant she must have passed out again and when she came round she didnt remember whose faces those had been stressed out id say dr kent asprey said overworked neglecting herself mrs watkins can you hear me merrily im so sorry merrily whispered i dont know what is the bishop hes out there taking charge uncle ted said dont worry about that wheres jane im here mum kid hanging back sounding scared oh god a white naked figure pale as veined marble still crawled amongst her wildly flickering thoughts what have i done you were taken ill uncle ted said she sensed a reserve in his voice not the churchwarden now but the old wary lawyer the pale figure was inside her now like a white worm she tasted bile sat up at once clutching at her throat someone had removed her dog collar she hadnt completed her vows in the church organ chords swelled pause singing began havent made my vows all right merrily dr kent asprey said just relax ive got to go back i havent made someones going to bring you a cup of tea and then youre going home no please the thought of going back to the huge empty haunted vicarage suddenly terrified her this is my home just relax asprey said what am i going to do what am i going to do youre going home to bed and im going to come and see you in the morning she stared at him all crinkly eyed and caring the stupid fatuous sod just get a good nights sleep merrily in ledwardine vicarage she wanted to laugh in his face to scream in his face to scream and scream scream herself sick the small shadow became detached from the hedge in blackberry lane lol thought it was a rat until it rolled on to his shoe when he bent down it produced a tiny cry he went down on his knees but when he touched her she hissed and slashed at him and rolled over and tried to stand up and couldnt he felt wet in his fingers blood oh god hed left her shut in the kitchen with food and water and a full litter tray hadnt he she squealed when he picked her up and when he tucked her under his jacket he could feel her trembling when he reached the gate and heard the music she was purring but he knew there were two kinds of purr and one was a sign of pain all the lights were on in the cottage he saw the front downstairs window had been thrown open and the music shivered out into the lane the late nick drake singing blackeyed dog the death song the stereo cranked up beyond distortion level fracturing the already tight brittle splinters of guitar he could see karl windlings wideshouldered silhouette in the chair under the open window facing into the room facing the open kitchen door nick sang that there was a blackeyed dog calling at his door and it was calling for more it called for more and it knew his name nicks voice was cut up and broken by the volume under lols jacket ethel the little black cat quaked with pain beyond the kitchen door there was catlitter all over the carpet fragments of food dish in a high scared doomed voice nick drake at twentysix sang that he was growing old and he wanted to go home there was apple blossom all over the lawn and the white petals were huge now the song ended and karl windlings shadow filled the window for a moment before the stylus was ripped across the record with a jagged whizz of puckered vinyl lol saw that the white petals on the lawn were the torn and scattered pages of a book he bent and picked one up and held it into the light from the window to love all persons in all ages all angels all worlds is divine and heavenlyto love all the house invaded the book torn down the spine the album ruined the cat kicked half to death fols life smashed and the fragments scattered and there was me getting all hyped up for a fight karl would be wellstoned by now that was his style a satisfying surge of violence and then a nice fat joint to make it feel doubly all right fol thought i should go straight in there its my house for christs sake my own home and and i wanted you to hate alison had said not half an hour ago but karl knew fol robinson from way back knew he didnt fight and lacked the nerve to hate knew that fols speciality was fear all the lights on the window open karl windling standing in the centre of the room now staring directly at the window but he couldnt see lol in the darkness karls bearded face unsmiling lol glanced at the empty drive wondering for a second what karl had done to the astra before remembering hed parked it in the village under his jacket ethel had gone still he heard his own thin whimper on the air as he turned and walked away from his home into the darkness of blackberry lane she felt like some child molester leaving court as the remaining congregation sang watched over by the bishop merrily watkins was escorted from the church wrapped in the rug surrounded by kent asprey and uncle ted and jane and caroline cassidy and councillor garrod powell their bodies hiding hers hiding her from the eyes of villagers whod left the congregation before the bishop had restored order but were still bunched in the darkness like sightseers on the scene of a fatal road accident ent a good sign an old woman whispered too loudly across the square merrily saw the softly illuminated hanging sign of the black swan a beacon of stability in what was turning into an alien world theyd been happy there now she was cold and confused and frightened and she didnt know why and none of the people with her said a word not even jane it was like a funeral procession they took her into the vicarage ted still had keys as if hed known she was only on probation and it might not work out ill make some tea caroline cassidy looked with distaste around the grim kitchen still partly lit by unshaded underpowered bulbs wheres your kettle my dear no jane said ill do it look merrily struggled to keep her voice level youve done so much already and ive ruined it but if you leave now you can still go ahead with your cider launch merrily i wouldnt dream yes you would you have to village life goes on anyway id be less embarrassed if i thought it wasnt all a total disaster well if youre sure yes she sat down at the table all of you please you go to bed dr kent asprey gave her a shrewdly caring look ill call tomorrow ill call you merrily said if its necessary thank you ill tell the bishop youll be in touch ted said ponderously when youre well ill call him tomorrow thank god dermot child had been detained at the organ hed have been less easy to get rid of merrily let her head fall briefly into her hands as the door closed behind them and jane came back alone peered through her fingers at the kids face flushed with concern or it might have been humiliation go and change flower get off to the party you are joking jane said i need to do some thinking merrily raised her head all right mum youre ill if you go to bed ill bring you whatever you need hotwater bottle i dont need anything and im not going to bed well you cant stay in here its dismal ill light the fire in the parlour just leave me jane jane hung on what was it something you ate i didnt eat anything all day did i i expect that was the problem and getting uptight anyway i feel terrible about everything and im always better feeling terrible on my own im going to stay jane said all right you light a fire and well sit and have a good old discussion well talk about miss devenish and what happened when you went to her aid that day instead of going to school and what you talk about together all those things weve been meaning to discuss ill get changed then jane said but she wasnt too happy about it throwing up in church when you were in mums line of work was not exactly a really brilliant thing to do and since coming to ledwardine mum had been for the first time quite hot on keeping up appearances this was going to damage her maybe in the years to come shed be quite affectionately known as the vicar who tossed her cookies down the nave but maybe there wouldnt be years to come not now how did she feel about that bad because coming here had put her on to like a whole new level of life what lucy called a new depth of being whatever this meant it wasnt in the bible which was why it was unwise to even approach the subject with mum particularly tonight in the solitude of her apartment jane looked up at what were supposed to have been the mondrian walls and the sloping ceiling between the beams into the blue and gold into the otherness it was all so strange made her feel ooooh she shook herself clotheswise she didnt overdo it black velvet trousers and silky purple top not a good night for making a spectacle of herself plus if it turned out to be the kind of party colette had in mind a quick getaway might just be called for shed gone ahead and lit the fire in the drawing room not so much because it was cold as because it might look halfway homely in there with a few flames before changing shed brought in some logs and filled up a bucket with coal kind of wishing she was staying in but that invitation to a serious discussion left her no option jesus mum she wanted to say i dont know what happened that day or that night under the apple tree im not clear on it but im getting help before she left she stoked up the fire mum was down on the rug in a thick bottlegreen poloneck jumper and jeans hugging her knees it was a may night out there but the vicarage remained in january except for the top floor i wont be too late ill wait up you mustnt ill be annoyed if you do ok flower mum said with her face washed clean of makeup and her hair pushed behind her ears she looked awfully young and vulnerable younger than me in some ways jane thought and feeling theres so much she doesnt know uhoh at the core of a bedlam of bodies colette cassidy was mouthing at her what you been janey its nearly midnight jane stayed where she was and let colette come stammering towards her through the strobe storm through a foundry of sound the restaurant at cassidys country kitchen was this square attic space with irregular beams and white bumpy walls there was a stage area where the cassidys sometimes had a pianist but tonight the piano like most of the tables had been taken away and the stage had become dr samedis spectacular soundlab sorry had problems so i heard colettes grin was lifted by the lights and put back intact cool what give the reverend mummy my compliments bet the bloody bishop wasnt expecting that gossip seemed to spread at more than the speed of sound in this village jane didnt bother to explain that it hadnt actually been all that funny at the time there must be eighty or ninety people here mostly imports colettes age and a year or two older the flashing lights were reflected in a lot of sweat on faces jane recognized hardly anybody suspecting she was the youngest here some of the dancers looked well out of it there was nothing stronger than coke and dr pepper on the tables pushed up against the walls but she thought shed seen the boy from her school called mark who seemed to be the fourthforms principal dealer in es and speed all the same janey colette was saying you didnt have to spend half the night with the old girl sorry something else came up colette didnt seem to hear dr samedi was squealing something over the industrial drum n bass on tapes he wore a top hat with ribbons and a black bow tie no shirt jacket open to his shiny chest with a white necklace showing it was a jacket from a morning suit black with tails and strategically torn in several places like the jackets the punks used to wear in mums day it was a scarecrows jacket and that was what dr samedi looked like a scarecrow animated by lightning i said jane shouted something came up you should be so lucky listen colette was wearing something black and shiny and daring naturally a gangly guy in a white shirt was hanging around behind her colette moved close to jane ok listen thats quentin the suitable who like the parents always have to make sure theres a suitable one you know what i mean his old mans some kind of exalted surgeon at the general i just wish somebody would surgically remove him quentin was tall and looked about seventeen hes not bad jane said especially if youre into vintage tractors his hobby he also dances like one jane smiled quentin strobed unhappily about six feet away colette put her squashy lips against janes ear janey i cant unload the dim bastard i go for a tinkle he waits outside the fucking door you want me to do take him off my hands you are joking oh come on your nights ruined anyway you dont have to snog him or anything just keep him for two minutes while i melt away the guys so sad if you tell him you have fantasies about having sex on a tractor hell just ask you what make please janey colette looked desperate like life was running out on her but then it was her party on the stage dr samedi hovered demonically over his mixers moving in a vibrating swirl of lights as though he was turning himself into light into pure bright energy and jane understood hated the heartless music understood perfectly about dr samedis need to become light dr samedi was in his element in his orb she felt suddenly halfseparated from it all as though the dance floor represented all human life and she was flickering on the edge of it for an instant she felt weightless as though she might vanish into one of the cracks of darkness between strobes she felt like this quite often now but never inside a building before well except for the church for a moment earlier on janey colette clutched at her christ i thought youd sorry please janey sure jane said squeezing her hands together to bring herself down whatever when merrily awoke on the sofa in front of the dying fire she was happy for a moment frozen and stiff but shed been asleep for two three hours and hadnt dreamed about anything she could recall a small miracle but this time reality was the curse the priestincharge had tonight been physically sick in her own beautiful and historic church in front of the biggest congregation shed ever pulled how could she have just let that happen children did that just threw up without warning the priestincharge was not even in charge of her own metabolism merrily rolled down from the sofa to the rough industrial carpet after a while she sat up shivering and threw more lumps of coal onto the embers in the dog grate thrusting in the poker levering up some heat inching closer on this balmy may evening to the miniature medieval hell of smoking cliffs and molten canyons medieval hell she was part of a medieval institution just that the modern church refused to connect with its roots which was why the modern church was losing it if youd said that to her six months ago shed have flared up a whole lot faster than this coal but there was no denying it any more in a world where huge numbers of people were begging for spiritual sustenance from exotic gurus and mediums and clairvoyants and healers the church was getting sidelined david campbell had actually asked the question do these phenomena really fit inside our field of operation the church still asking everyone to put their faith in a huge allpowerful supernatural being while loftily backing away from lesser phenomena like a pale naked figure cold as a slug crawling towards you up the aisle of your church obviously a representation of her own perceived isolation as the first woman minister of ledwardine ha from far up in the soaring hollows of the house came a sudden resonant bump there was a break in the music the strobes were off on the stage dr samedi was guardedly allowing some of the boys to examine his mixers and tape decks and things at a table near the door jane sat with quentin the suitable in his baggy cricket shirt it had been hard going at first but so far he hadnt mentioned tractors actually he said i didnt really want to come tonight at all no kidding its just that my parents come for dinner here quite regularly and theyve become fairly friendly with colettes parents they must be really sad lonely people jane said quentin didnt get it jane smiled at him so tonights the first time youve actually met colette i tend to be away at school a lot only this weekend our halfterms started so no ive never actually met her before jane said airily some bitch huh pardon take my advice quentin dont get involved shes you know shes kind of been around quentin looked puzzled you mean abroad jane rolled her eyes i mean been around as in eatyouforbreakfast kind of been around oh quentin said i see well she did seem a bit disconcerted when her father asked her to sort of look after me i think she had other plans colette always has plans no i mean someone she was interested in oh jane sat up i may be wrong no go on jane looked into his soupy eyes but he quickly averted them this is interesting what made you think that quentin but she didnt find out because this quivering shadow fell across the table and she looked up into the face of a grossly sweating dean wall thisll do dean pulled out a chair opposite jane and sank into it and beamed at jane and then at quentin danny gittoes was with him and mark the reputed dealer all right are we jesus jane thought who let these bozos in shed forgotten about colettes professed need for tension silly cow she looked around for barry the manager locating him behind the bar where a waitress was putting out things to nibble apparently on the instructions of colettes mother who didnt realize that the only things that got nibbled at parties like this were ears to begin with mark the dealer stood by the door hands in his pockets danny gittoes sat down opposite quentin who seemed to be urgently wishing he was somewhere else like the dentists so go on dean nodded towards dr samedi and looked at danny voodoo eh kind of thing danny said wheres this then gittoes jamaica haiti he was this voodoo god in haiti only he was called baron samedi see god of the dead hung around graves led these tribes of zombies and he wore that same gear coat with tails and a top hat maybe a stick like a cane i read this book so thats where he gets it from see dean winked at quentin who smiled stiffly and this was like devil worship right yeah well more or less cause janes well into that see dean said not looking at jane you on about got her ma into it now too from what they says ok jane half rose watch it she saw quentins hand tightening around his can of dr peppers what theyre saying dean said is that janes mother the vicar she chucked her load in church tonight danny gittoes said eh you ent yeard all over the village man er chucked up splatted all over the bloody bishop geddoff danny

go in the church porch open a coupler cans and that was when she done it you think about that gittoes fuckin hell dean danny gittoes broke off because the lights began to fade and the strobing began from the stage dr samedi demonstrating something deans voice rose placidly out of the flashes she only got to think about goin in the church porch see an up it comes splat well all right jane never threw up tonight see but her evil presence in that church was enough to jane threw herself at him knocking the glass out of his hand seeing alarm on his fat porous face but because of the strobe when she saw it again it was wearing a grin and he was on his feet around her side of the table and his arms were around her wanner dance with me is it devil woman get your filthy dean gripped her tightly she felt something hard against her stomach she realized that in the strobe it might look as though they were actually snogging she couldnt kick him because of the chair legs in the way she wondered where she could bite him without encountering great pools of sweat all right quentin was on his feet now lets stop this hey dean said over janes shoulder it fuckin talks i ad it figured for one o doc samedis zombies you just just let her go quentin said uncertainly let her geeeow what you gonner do about it sunshine phone up your dad on the mobile is it through the flashes jane saw that danny gittoes had pushed his chair back but was still sitting on it the third boy mark however had moved in from the door his hands were out of his pockets something gleaming in one of them jane screamed hes got a knife and the room went quiet lights someone snapped dean walls arms went slack and jane stepped away as the strobe stopped and the main lights came up barry the manager exsas came across the room like a small tank behind him lloyd powell who shouted barry demanded jane looked across at mark he was a slight quietlooking mousyhaired boy you tended not to notice him both arms hung by his side the hands empty could she have been mistaken she looked away from mark and across at barry sorry i thought someone had a knife one of these boys lloyd powell wandered over hooked out a chair with his foot to see if anything had been kicked under it lloyd looked pretty cool in a timeless sort of way he was the only guy here who could get away with wearing a patched tweed jacket over his jeans and denim workshirt i didnt really see jane said there was just a sort of flash but with the strobelights sorry all right barry said you stabbing a finger at dean wall then danny gittoes then mark out aw come on man dean stepped away from jane we was only havin a laugh tell im lloyd youre outer line boy lloyd said sternly he folded his arms stood shouldertoshoulder with barry out barry said now danny gittoes stood up and edged towards the door some of the kids began to move back towards the walls dr samedi stood protectively in front of his main console dean wall didnt move youve got five seconds barry said like they were terrorists or something and that includes the door closing behind you it was starting to look nasty then colette was there ease up barry there was silence jane reckoned that every man in the room must be looking at colette including barry and lloyd she looked like shed stepped out of one of those moody sexy sundaysupplement fashion spreads one of the threadlike straps of her tight black dress just parted from the shoulder a perfect dab of perspiration in the little cleft over her top lip she looked about twentyseven and dropdead gorgeous id be prepared to bet these lads are not on the guest list barry said stiffly you know your parents rules one of my rules barry colette said was that the word parents would not be mentioned in here tonight yeah sorry colette but they pay my wages we have a guest list nobody comes in theyre not on it these are local guys colette said we dont want to be seen as snobbish do we dean wall leered at colette tell the bastard darlin these exsas guys they ent got it out their system see theyre jus lookin for innocent people to beat up shut it lad barrys lips barely moved what you gonner do you got a heckler and koch down your trousers is it danny gittoes laughed feebly dont push it boy lloyd powell said dean turned on him shit powell i thought you were a mate youre outer line boy colette look barry lowered his voice its getting late so it is colettes eyes were shining with a steady steely light that didnt seem quite natural to jane had she taken something well of course she had the eyes turned on barry i mean i know you army guys like your early nights but youre in the catering trade now baz just theres a little ceremony planned barry said uncomfortably colette gave him a hard stare what did you say its your birthday party barry blushed weve got this cake for fucks sake colette looked appalled whos idea was that your mothers jesus wept jane saw colettes fists clench how old they think i am six please barry said it was supposed to be a surprise jesus christ colettes whole body went rigid and jane saw tears of outrage and betrayal spring into her eyes theyre not coming barry gritted his teeth just for a few minutes colette began to breathe rapidly her breasts rising half out of the shiny black dress bringing a halfsuppressed whimper out of dean wall im sorry barry said you little toad barry colette spat you little fucking toad you lied to me they lied to me what time its after midnight i mean what time are they coming shifhead just before one barry said look colette youre their daughter you cant blame them for wanting to share just a few minutes of your party balls they just want to wind things up while the place is still intact and embarrass the piss out of me at the same time come on love youd be winding up by then anyway like fuck we would colette strode away the tips of two fingers to her mouth thinking hard that cold light in her eyes a rock slide of emotions came down on jane a giddying combination of nervousness and extreme excitement she watched colette approach dr samedi the whole room in a hush everybody looking for the first time tonight jane thought like kids unsure of how they were supposed to react to the hostess throwing a wobbly colette was speaking quickly to dr samedi who started to back away making sweeping motions with his hands colette pursuing him her voice rising getting half a fucking grand for this jeff remember dr samedi glanced wildly from side to side at the spread of his equipment and colette carried on advancing and talking ferociously at him until he had his back against one of the big speakers his top hat fallen off and he seemed to concede submit whatever his head nodding wearily colette smiled grimly walked back to the centre of the room all right everybody listen up seems some of you are not like considered suitable dean wall whooped yeah yeah colette waved a dismissive hand walls first taste of fame very sad ok so if some of us are not welcome i think we should all go yeah thank god for that quentin sighed but jane suspected he was being seriously premature its not a bad night out there right colette said could be better a boy shouted bravely it will be i reckon we get out of this shithole take the action into the streets yeah there was half a second of hesitation before the roars of enthusiasm started gathering their meaningless momentum struth barry rammed his hands into his jacket pockets glared at the floor jane was standing quite close to him now and she heard him mutter to lloyd powell out of the side of his mouth you better tag along with them mate ill make an anonymous call to the police jane thought uhoh carnival merrily moved into the dark kitchen carrying the poker the aga chuntered smugly in its insulated world she laid a palm flat on one of its hotplate covers held it there until it felt uncomfortably warm what else could she do pinch herself did that really work in the event as she pulled away she tripped on the edge of the rug and oh shit dropped the poker bumped her knee violently on a hard corner of the aga sending a bullet of pain spinning to the top of her head she staggered to the switches slammed on all the lights bent down rubbing hard at her knee apart from severe pain what other proof could you give yourself that you were in fact fully awake not dreaming no it was all real it was quiet up there now but the noise shed heard from the drawing room had been real and it wasnt a mouse it wasnt a squirrel it wasnt a bird in the eaves it wasnt real what was real was a minister of the church obliged to consult a psychiatrist these days to find out another small bump slowly holding back her breath merrily picked up the poker closer this time certainly not at the top of the house she looked at the scullery door which was never opened the socalled scullery was a narrow room probably something connected with the dairy in centuries past theyd found no use for it as yet never went in she lifted the metal latch and went through wrinkling her nose as her hair mingled with greasy cobwebs at the far end another door opened on to a small square hall she found a switch and a dangling economy bulb sputtered on curledup white tubes like some frozen bodily organ sending shadows up walls already going black with damp the absence of oak beams in here suggested it was a victorian addition opposite her was the second back door still boarded up except it wasnt the boards had been prised away they were leaning against a wall rusty nails sticking out of them this was recent very recent jane the separate door to the apartment soon to have an illuminated bell and a dinky little nameplate ms jane watkins the door leading up via the disused back stairs that you would forget were even here the stairs came out at a black wooden door her fingers found a hole to lift the latch of course she knew where the stairs came out but it seemed strange seeing it from this angle the dim firstfloor passage with all the doors all of them locked now since the sean dream and the keys taken out and thrown into an ashtray in the kitchen padding past the locked doors she arrived at the top of the main stairs the oakbalustraded landing with its window full of pale night sky she stood at the foot of the second stairway to janes apartment why was she doing this despite the unsealing of the second back door she knew there was nobody up there nobody real why was she putting herself through this because im a priest and priests are not supposed to be scared because they know that the strength and certainty of their faith protects them from the evil that walks by night dont they just oh really jane came up here all the time for heavens sake jane skipped up here never a thought with books and boxes and cans of variously coloured paint and brushes and cds to be locked away in her secret study its me it only happens to me im a sick woman she thought before registering that one of the doors on the landing was already halfopen and a shadowfigure was watching her from the threshold jane knew it was going wrong when she saw mark and this unknown older guy in the unlit doorway of the computer shop marches media or maybe wrong was the way it was supposed to go a party aint a party without tension maybe this party was going exactly the way colette had planned the plan hardening up when she learned she was being doublecrossed by her parents actually jane didnt see what was so wrong with having a sixteenth birthday cake and if the cassidys wanted to share the moment well they had paid for everything and let her use their precious restaurant maybe colette was going just a bit over the top jane watched from the cobbles leaning against one of the oaken uprights of the market cross with a lowburning excitement because it was obvious what was going on down there in the shadowed doorway of marches media the mousy mark and the older guy were busy dealing drugs and no shortage of customers the nice boys from good families going in one after another schoolkids at the tuckshop not all the guests but enough of them to put the market square well into orbit this would be a good safe pitch rich kids at a posh party in a select restaurant in a picturepostcard village encircled by hills and woodland and with no resident police profitable too most of these guys would have no idea of current street prices not that jane did it was just cool to watch from the shadows and speculate about these things she was on her own now the craven quentin had made a swift escape car keys in hand a couple of other vehicles also puttering pusillanimously away from the square she saw dean wall and danny gittoes watching colette keeping a respectful distance a heavy chick she and dr samedi were at the back of his transit van one rear door open dr samedi backing out arms full of something black the size and shape of a childs coffin oh yes colette cried yes yes yes dr samedi was still unhappy and wouldnt let go of whatever it was but tonight you didnt argue with colette she wrapped her arms around the black thing wrestling with poor jeff until they both sprang back and the black box was in colettes arms now lloyd powell was watching from the foot of the black swan steps mr responsible jane thought he might seem cool now with that rangy paul weller look and his white pickup truck but lloyd would turn as the years went by into his father get elected on to the council by which time rod would have shrunken into edgar halfbaked and not to be trusted with a shotgun it was the depressing side of country life they all seemed to know their place in the pattern and the pattern didnt change people like colette fascinated them because they were part of a different pattern jane thought but there was no meaningful overlap she was thinking what a really profound philosophical concept this was when it all began all right a voice crackling into the night dr samedi had materialized under swathes of bunting put up for tomorrows festival launch he held an oldfashioned trumpet loud hailer his top hat was back on how you doin sweatin yeah a few cheers dean walls familiar whoop all right dr samedi raised the white loud hailer up over his head a signal obviously because at that moment the perfectly preserved medieval market square of rural ledwardine just well just erupted the black thing like a small coffin had proclaimed itself in the way it knew best as a huge ghettoblaster with about eight speakers it was sitting on the roof of the van now pumping tumultuous drum and bass into the square at this unbelievable volume and colette cassidy was bouncing up and down beside the van and screaming yes yes yes yes yes a circle of people rapidly formed around her everybody moving in a way it was hard not to when the big black beat was everywhere and loud enough to pop up all the cobbles on the square oh my god jane thought theyll hear this in the centre of hereford welcome ma friends dr samedis phoney west indian drawl had been processed by the primitive megaphone into a deep and eerie croak welcome to de carnivalf the ceiling light was blurred and swirling she was waking up shed been asleep dreamed it all again oh my god it was not possible hadnt she heated her hands on the aga gripped the poker until it hurt bashed her knee so hard the pain had given her a headache proving beyond all doubt that she was awake the light above her was in a warm orange shade janes shade taken with her from birmingham to liverpool to ledwardine to the third floor she was in janes bedroom in the apartment lying on janes bed she didnt remember coming here why would she come in here lie down on janes bed fear streaked through her and she struggled to sit up and looked into a blank grey oval face with dark slits for eyes merrily screamed and squirmed away hurled herself back against the headboard slamming it into the wall behind its ok the grey face was printed on a jumper a sweatshirt over it was a real face behind glasses the real face looked scared no look hey he said im harmless she looked down registering that she was fully dressed the bed unrumpled mrs watkins im really really sorry christ i thought you might need a cup of tea one of her cups coming at her on one of her saucers she didnt move what are you doing what are you doing in aware that even in her fear she couldnt say what are you doing in my house it wasnt it was the vicarage it was huge and alien and maybe this man lived here too in some derelict attic room coming and going by the forgotten back stairs part of the mad sporadic nightmare oh god get me out of here im a kind of friend of janes he was very untogether big unsteady eyes behind the glasses like a scared version of the alien on his sweater where is she she went to a party see what happened we met in the street i needed to take a look at my cat and she just like brought me up here you know jane says you know bring her inside well have a look at her obviously i didnt realize she meant her room believe me there is no way idve come up here cat merrily said somebody gave her a kicking we brought her up here and then she got away we mustve touched her in the wrong place im sorry i dont do things like this she accepted the tea with numb relief youve got an injured cat somewhere in the house wandering around making bumping noises maybe probably merrily could hear heavy music coming through the trees from the square insistent as a road drill this wasnt going to endear the cassidys to their neighbours lets go downstairs she said i need a cigarette it wasnt long before they started coming out of their homes gathering in small groups you could see pyjama bottoms sticking out of trouser turnups one woman in an actual hairnet big torches walking sticks whos in charge here a man shouted not a local voice a sort of retired colonel voice the music was turned up even higher maybe fifty people dancing someone grabbed hold of janes arm tried to pull her into the crush of quivering bodies it was colette aw come on janey get your shit together stuff the reverend mumsy like shes in any position to complain youre disturbing the peace the mans voice rose again this is noise pollution if you dont turn that racket off and go away now at once im going to call the police do you hear me jane let herself be dragged in knowing they were all on borrowed time if barry hadnt rung the police already quite a few people were surely doing it right now you looked up and you could see small furious faces peering out of dark windows could imagine outraged fingers stiffly prodding out anticipating it mark and his friend had already disappeared from the marches media doorway but whatever theyd been selling was taking effect all around her open mouths and toobright eyes we comin out rapped dr samedi we comin back we gonna turn gonna turn de whole sky black but he no longer sounded in control a boy pushed past jane having come out of the antique shop doorway zipping up his jeans did you see that a woman yelped that yobs just urinated in there you hear me the man shouted im calling the police oh do fuck off grandad replied a girl with an equally posh voice and there were wild peals of laughter and somebody turned the music up even higher so that even dr samedi was drowned out but they were on borrowed time and jane wasnt unhappy about that because she needed to get back and find out about lol lol whod come over very weird when shed taken him up the back stairs and hed found himself in her room backing off shaking his head saying this was a mistake his agitation picked up by ethel the cat squirming out of his arms and disappearing into the bowels of the vicarage lol was in trouble he couldnt go home because karl was in there and lol for reasons jane still couldnt quite put together was scared of karl and was also for reasons even more obscure scared other hed seemed relieved to pack her off to the party to hide out there alone in the part of the house where mum was banned he wouldnt be there when she got home he said hed wait until ethel reappeared and then hed go shed left him her secret key to lock the small back door behind him hed leave it he said with lucy but what if karl was still in the cottage when he got back where would lol go then one idea had occurred to jane maybe she could get a few of the guys from the party rugbyplayer types to go over to lols place and force that bastard out of there but the state they were in now how could you even explain to them what was needed by the time they made it to blackberry lane theyd have forgotten why they were going chaos nothing more unstable than wellbroughtup kids on the loose in some place they and their parents werent known the music stopped the silence was deafening beyond the hollow roaring in her ears jane heard the sound of car engines ok colettes voice over the loud hailer listen up its probably the filth yeah were moving on dont worry no cars required follow me or janey wheres janey she knows it wasnt the police the car that turned on to the edge of the square was a volvo like mums only about ten years younger both front doors opened at once the cassidys janey colette called out ok and then the loud hailer was silent jane didnt move what was colette saying to her she knows what she slipped back under the market cross as terrence cassidy appeared on the cobbles panting colette where are you please and was almost pulled off his feet by the stampede from the square colette mrs cassidy was less circumspect the unutterable little bitch i knew something like this would colette terrence implored where are you why are you doing this to us its cause youre such a wanker mate dean wall confided chattily over his shoulder and cackled and followed the others the music had resumed from the top of church street booming off into the churchyard janes shoulder brushed against a poster tacked to one of the pillars of the market cross bold black and yellow lettering inside a big red apple ledwardine summer festival official opening saturday may market square pm be there bloody hell jane found dr samedi next to her the loud hailer dangling limply from his hand back in midlands mode can y believe it shes buggered off with my flamin box bloody rich kids i hate bloody rich kids i do gimme ghetto any day of the week sorry jeff shes hard to stop when she gets going that dont help me does it and suddenly jane knew where colette was taking them oh no she looked around for help but the cassidys had rushed into their restaurant presumably to assess the damage and take it out on barry even the locals were melting away wherever the mob was heading it was at least out of their earshot away from their backyards so what did they care thing is dr samedi was moaning i dont know if my insurance covers this jane saw a tall figure strolling towards the churchyard lloyd lloyd powell turned and waited for her under the fake gaslight jane found herself clutching at his sleeve youve got to stop them i think well wait for the police dont you miss watkins no you could never tell with people like lloyd whether they called you miss out of politeness or because they were laughing at you theyre going to the orchard you can stop them its your land you can go in there and turn them out on my own he was laughing at her everybody knew the powells didnt really care about their orchard but they should they should please its not safe its not respectful youve got to get them out please lloyd hey he put his big rugged hands on her shoulders peered at her from under his paul weller fringe dont get into a state about this theyre just daft kids please she was crying now all right lloyd said ill go and see what i can do he smiled wryly hunching his shoulders you wanner come oh no jane said i couldnt she stood on the edge of the cobbles hopelessly confused awfully apprehensive for reasons she couldnt explain the mondrian walls bleeding from the mouth merrily said lol robinson held ethel on the kitchen table that means internal injuries he looked shattered theyd found the little black cat cowering into the side of the aga who did this he didnt reply which meant he knew in the hall merrily found an old quilted bodywarmer shed kept for gardening you know what to do with this ive never actually had a cat before you wrap her up tight so theres just her head sticking out so theres plenty between you and the claws er right never mind just grab her by the scruff and dont let go no you have to be firm lol im not really a firm person lol said merrily rolled up the sleeves of her sweater she opened out the jacket swept it swiftly around the cat she tucked the ends around ethels claws anybody i might know anybody whose soiled soul i should be praying for any spare prayers he said quietly i would hang on to them no prayers are wasted handing him a bundle with a small black head sticking out hold her very tightly god these lights are crap he glanced up at her yeah i know some people would call that taking the lords name in vain trying to prise the jaws apart no tight lol youve got a leg coming out the way i see it it helps keep the holy names in circulation especially when used in times of stress ethels mouth snapped open merrily gritted her teeth slipped a forefinger inside not entirely sure whether i shouldve used it in the same sentence as crap mind see there lost a tooth possibly a couple where the bloods coming from not internal dont think so she touched the spot ethel writhed good god said lol thank you one of my uncles used to be a vet in cheltenham i wanted to be a vet when i was a kid then i found out you had to put things down a lot shell be ok if youre still worried you can pop her over to a real vet in the morning you can let her go now they watched the liberated ethel make like a bullet for the door to the scullery merrily held up her finger with blood and a tiny white splinter on the end thats probably the last bit of it so she sat down and lit a cigarette talk to me mr robinson im a priest it was fairly quiet on the square now but she could hear music coming from somewhere else fainter it didnt seem a problem but it didnt make sense ethel had reappeared in the doorway looking miffed but not distressed merrily wished jane would also show she smoked in silence while he told her about this guy now occupying his cottage whod been in the band hazey jane with him years ago and had come back from the states with ambitions involving lol and some new songs and an album which sounded reasonable just i have problems with this guy lol said he knows that he doesnt seem to realize how deep it goes not a sensitive person then that would be about right lol said and he drinks and when he drinks he gets overemotional violent temper as you saw and hes in your house hes broken in right so pardon me if this is incredibly naive but why dont you just call the police almost immediately she regretted asking that he looked like hed rather throw himself in the river the police arrived just the two of them in a car no hurry no panic except on the part of the cassidys who came out of the alley to meet them with barry the manager jane crept back under the market hall to listen blending into the mingled shadows of the oak pillars certainly seems quiet enough now one of the cops said that caroline cassidy was in tears is because theyve gone on some sort of drugcrazed rampage everything was perfectly under control all decent wellbehaved young people from good families no strong drink and then it was gatecrashed by some ghastly local thugs barry barry you tell them exactly as mrs cassidy says barry said the crawling sod it was all fine until these lads came in somebody mustve let them in because we had the doors bolted well with the flashing lights and things i didnt notice them for a while but they brought the drugs in no question kind of drugs mr bloom oh well ecstasy i reckon probably some amphetamines crack maybe i wouldnt rule it out they target parties dont they you know them seen em around theres a thin lad about seventeen mark putley dads got the garage on the leominster road then the fat one dean dean i can find out where are they now its what ive been trying to tell you mrs cassidy was close to hysteria theyve gone into the woods theyve taken my daughter unbelievable jane longed to step out there and tell them it was the other way round that if they pulled in colette it would all be sorted out tonight colette was overstepping even janes mark on the other hand she didnt want to get involved she just wanted the police to get them out of the orchard and where were you while this was going on mrs cassidy my wife and i said terrence were having discussions with mr richard coffey the playwright at his home earlier wed been to an event at the church all right and you think the kidsve gone into some woods the orchard down there through the churchyard the powells land i dont think were going to get too excited about trespass at the moment sir you think theyve got drugs with them thats going to be our main interest and my daughter quite lol was cleaning his glasses on the hem of his sweatshirt without them he looked bewildered and innocent an ageing teenager she was supposed to turn him out now with his injured cat in his arms you obviously cant go home tonight teapot and cigarettes between them on the kitchen table you need to give this guy a chance to sober up and realize what hes done so if you dont mind a sleeping bag you could stay here weve got masses of bedrooms no beds lol said that was really nice of her but it was ok really hed got a car down the road merrily thought the state he was in hed probably pile it into a tree look at it this way one of the oldest traditions of the church is offering sanctuary ive always liked to do that im not good at much else i write lousy sermons my voice is too tuneless to lead the hymns i get upset at funerals and ive had a really bad night so just give me a break huh i heard about that lol said heard what that you werent well merrily felt for another cigarette who told you that i overheard somebody talking about it saying what she bit on the cigarette fumbled for her lighter that you were ill at your inauguration service word travels fast in a village by tomorrow half the county would know she stood up lets get this sleeping bag sorted out youre still not well are you mrs watkins im merrily and im fine just need to eat sometime but its a little early for breakfast im trying to think where we put the sleeping bags i think janes room janes apartment he followed her upstairs the main stairs this time its a big house isnt it you could say that would it be ok if i slept downstairs wherever you like she waited for him on the upper landing glad hed said that she didnt quite like the idea of a stranger up here with jane the sleeping bags werent in the kids bedroom which left the sitting roomstudy into which merrily had been forbidden to go until the completion of the famous mondrian walls well this was an emergency and it was janes fault so shed have to slip in there grab one of the bags and just not look at the walls but the door was locked damn the kid is so exasperating sometimes i like to think ive never been the kind of mother who spies you know lol said tentatively i think there was a key on the bedside table in janes room makes sense shed hardly take it to colettes party feeling a need to explain she said janes had this longterm plan to paint the plaster squares and rectangles between the wallbeams in different colours so itd be like sitting inside this huge mondrian painting you know mondrian dutch painter we had a couple of days in london last year and we went to this exhibition of his stuff and when we came here she got this ambitious idea it probably looks terrible the key fitted the sleeping bags were rolled up behind the door merrily could have gathered one up brought it out with barely a glance at the mondrian walls maybe shed have done that if theyd been mondrian walls nice plain squares of colour what she froze in the doorway you ok no merrily put on the lights the walls had been painted all one colour blue midnight blue divided by the timberframing but the timbers were part of it painted branches were made to protrude from them thicker ones closer to the floor becoming more plentiful as they neared the ceiling where they all joined together in a mesh as though shed tried to bring the timbers in the wall alive turn them back into trees i dont understand merrily fought to keep her voice level must have taken her a long time lol said must have taken her whole nights why what does it mean he didnt reply he was looking at the ceiling among the beams and the intertwining branches were many small orbs of yellow and white meticulously painted lights in the trees little golden lanterns lol said hanging in the night she thought he must be quoting some line of halfremembered poetry the police left their car on the square and walked towards the church gates jane followed them about thirty yards behind some backup you reckon kirk one said in bloody ledwardine in the early hours lets take a look around first it turns out theyve just gone in there for a smoke and a shag were gonner look like prats the first two people to come out of the orchard walked straight into the two policemen they were danny gittoes and dean wall they were both drunk aw shit dean put up his hands i never done it officer over by the wall lads lets have your names dean and danny were having their pockets turned out when jane slipped behind a row of graves and past them into the orchard moving not stealthily but with great care excusing herself as she passed between the trees respect is the important thing lucy devenish said individual trees can be trimmed and pruned and chopped down when they are dying but you must always show respect for the orchard as an entity never take an apple after the harvest never touch the trees in spring never take the blossom never ever bring any into the house spending hours with lucy and lucys books there wasnt much she didnt know now about apples and orchards knowledge was the best defence lucy said knowledge or felicity thomas traherne had learned felicity had discovered against all the odds the secret of happiness through oneness with nature with the orb sometimes over the past week usually in the daytime janes worldly self had told her other self that this was all absolute total bollocks but now with the whiteclothed apple trees all around her the blossom hanging from them like robes it was lucys world that seemed like the real world the moon had come out and its milky light bathed the powell orchard and jane felt she was on the threshold of a great mystery if dean walls and danny gittoes were refusing to come quietly jane wasnt aware of it if the bassy music was still booming from dr samedis black box she could no longer hear it if the guests at colettes party were making their stoned confused way among the tangle of trees she couldnt see them although there were figures here she was sure pale and glistening moonbeam shapes interweaving amid the blossom branches as though each blanched petal had a ghost and all these spirit petals had coalesced into translucent dancing figurines and you wanted to join them in the dance far finer and more fluid than the grossness on the square the further into the orchard you went the lighter you felt as though you too were made of petals and could be fragmented and blown away by a breeze dissolving and separating a snow of molecules until you were absorbed into the moonbeams disappearing from the mortal sight a bump a bump stopped her a bump and a bouncing jane bent down as it rolled almost to her feet she picked it up it was small and its skin was soft and puckered and withered like the cheeks of a very old woman she held it in the palm of her hand it was no bigger than a billiard ball though only a fraction as heavy it must have been up on the tree all winter perhaps the only one all winter through and the birds had left it alone in most parts of britain according to lucys books a single apple that remained on a tree all winter was a harbinger of death a bloom on the tree when the apples are ripe is a sure termination of somebodys life the fact that it didnt really rhyme lucy said was a sure sign of the truth in it what did it mean when an overripe apple survived the winter to tumble from a tree in full blossom jane thought back over everything that had happened tonight the images stammering through her mind like a videotape in fastreverse the tape stopped at a moment in the church mum on her knees bent over then looking up threads of vomit on her lips looking up janes arm jerked back in a spasm and she threw the mummified apple so far into the orchard she didnt hear it land and she turned and ran all the way to the vicarage part three airy things thy soul beguile thomas traherne the instruction high flier six a m and fully light if overcast and cool a thin sharp breeze blew apple blossom over the churchyard wall from which the church noticeboard projected on it a printed poster for the festival opening the old prosaic title ledwardine summer festival having pushed out dermots old cider suggestion precisely because most of the posters had already been printed but over this poster another smaller one a size had been drawingpinned giving notice of a special midnight service the reverend merrily watkins will be holding a black mass bring your own sickbags merrily stared at it for several seconds quite shocked before understanding dawned being sick in church was allegedly one way of identifying yourself as a satanist this was probably one of the highschool kids with a computer things could be difficult for jane on monday with the story all round the school she tore down the notice and crumpled it up forcing a smile even though there was no one to observe it if you didnt smile you would go completely out of your mind if anyone could handle this it was jane but the smile wandered when she thought about the funeral card with wil williams the devils minister on it could be the same person couldnt it in which case a schoolkid was less likely it would be another move in the campaign if such it was to persuade her to keep the coffey play out of church which of course disinclined to feed stefans obsession shed already decided to do with a formal public announcement of her decision at the buffet reception following her installation but that was yesterday before something she was insisting to herself was beyond her control had prevented her making her vows and established her as a weak unstable woman entirely unfit to replace the stolid longserving alfred hayden perhaps the parish really didnt want her were ministers of the church supposed to have regard to omens or was that only for anthropologists and social historians just as hauntings were the preserve of psychologists something else not dealt with at theological college she was shivering inside the fake barbour feeling starved she hadnt really slept it was well after two am when shed heard jane come in using her frontdoor key merrily lying on her bed fully clothed for over an hour in case the kid should drift into the drawing room and stumble over the refugee in his sleeping bag in the event jane had come directly up to the thirdfloor bedroom next to the sitting roomstudy with its decidedly nonmondrian walls about which lol robinson rich coming from a manifest paranoiac had told her not to worry too much something possibly that miss devenish would be able to explain she thought angrily that if she did leave this village it would not be because of her own humiliation but because of what ledwardine or something or even miss devenish was doing to jane she dug her hands into her coat pockets and walked head down into the market place it didnt feel like a spring morning the glorious false summer was in suspension the blossom on the churchyard apple trees looking grey like ice a few cars were still parked on the square and she saw that one was a police car some damage during or after the party vandalism a breakin a compact figure in a flat cap and muffler waved at her and crossed over from church street cold mornin vicar it sure is he came and stood companionably beside her unlit cigarette stub between his teeth had he been in last nights congregation she couldnt remember either way she felt absurdly pleased that gomer parry was still speaking to her ent found her yet then vicar sorry gomer dipped his cigarette towards the mews enclosing cassidys country kitchen could be anywhere see flighty piece like that merrily looked from gomer to the police car and back colette cassidy you ent yeard missing she is my god since the party jane didnt say anything ah well gomer said mabbe erd left see fore they knowed this girl wasnt around nmore fars i can make out what happened shed brought in a few undesirables and this dint go down too well with that sas bloke runs the restaurant and theres a bit of a row like and the next thing shes walked out an theyve all followed her and everybodys dancin about the square an raisin cain half of em doped up to the eyeballs an then the law rolls up and theyre off like buggery an merrily an urgent clacking of heels on the cobbles and caroline cassidy appeared in the entrance to the mews caroline as merrily and probably ledwardine had never seen her before her eyes hot and glowing like small torchbulbs out of a halloween mask of ruined makeup gomer parry took one look and stepped hurriedly aside oh merrily i was going to send the police to you wheres jane did jane come home janes still in bed i hope caroline ive just heard we should never never never have let it happen but terrence said in ledwardine what could possibly go wrong what has ever happened in ledwardine merrily im frantic i keep thinking of that girl over in kingsland who just disappeared fourteen years old im sure theres nothing like that to worry about probably a bunch of them went off in a car to some club in hereford and shes just a bit sheepish about coming home colettes very mature shes a child carolines mouth slack with fear you dont know her everybody thinks shes so precocious but its all an act im sorry merrily put an arm around her but i know that with so many other people about shell be ok what actually happened caroline sniffed come in and have have some coffee merrily thought of jane back at the vicarage she was still there wasnt she and lol robinson to whom she was giving sanctuary a priests job was to help people in trouble ok lol awoke on the drawingroom rug to a dead fire and ethel peering down at him from the sofa he knew at once where he was and conflicting emotions crowded in on him scaring him at first like hungry fans after a gig the vicarage church property his old enemy the church this big damp house soulless why did all church buildings seem cold and forbidding and soulless ethel nuzzled him and purred it wasnt the painpurr this time cats could always put the past behind them no matter how bad the past was he stroked ethel and thought about merrily watkins who was nothing like the church and felt a strange sense of lightness in one night hed lost everything his last hope of alison coming back and then his house he lay and almost luxuriated in the simplicity of it knowing that as soon as he climbed out of this sleeping bag responsibilities would tighten around him you never enjoy the world aright till the sea itself floweth in your veins and you are clothed in the heavens and crowned with the stars wild he was filling the kettle when jane appeared in jeans and an orange cotton top the skin around her dark eyes looked pink and swollen she peered at lol recollecting slowly oh hell she knows right i thought she was going to be like out cold for the entire night lol told her sincerely that her mother had been incredible he told her about ethel lost a tooth but shes not vain jane smiled but her eyes had a distant haunted look where is mum i think she went out lol adjusted the rubber band around his ponytail hed washed at the sink but obviously couldnt shave when she comes back ill clear off sort things out jane sat down at the kitchen table this was the best thing you cant reason with people like that no he sat down opposite her it was the pathetic thing jane shook her head slowly where did you sleep in the parlour on the rug in a sleeping bag right jane said and then he saw her face tense where did you get the sleeping bag from the room next to your bedroom there was a moment of stillness in the kitchen before the kettle started to whistle oh great jane said tonelessly oh terrific once inside the country kitchen merrily realized there must be at least one more police car on the square but unmarked terrence cassidy was at a central table with a man and a woman the man taking notes the woman asking questions just try and calm down and think mr cassidy think if theres anyone youve missed out terrence unshaven raised a hand to merrily caroline went across anything what were trying to do mrs cassidy the woman said is to compile a list of everyone who was at the party invited or uninvited and check first of all if anyone else is missing thats going to take time what about the actual search carolines voice was frayed and jagged the woods the orchard the orchards huge weve still got some people out there but it begins to look as if we need to extend the area of operation the woman looked enquiringly at merrily this is merrily watkins our priestincharge terrence said also the mother of a close friend of colettes ah the woman stood up good morning im detective inspector annie howe this is dc mumford take a seat ms watkins di howe had a surgical look tall fine light hair thin lips if shed worn glasses they would have been rimless merrily thought but she wasnt a surgeon she had a law degree it had been in the hereford times annie howe was new to the division a highflier thirtyone years old so your daughter was at the party and her name would be jane shes fifteen dc mumford wrote it down he was thickset and older than his boss by a good ten years and although she was a close friend of colette howe said she clearly didnt spend the whole evening with her dont say was like that caroline shrieked im very sorry mrs cassidy nothing negative was implied just that by the end of the evening they werent quite so close as they appear to have gone off in different directions what time did your daughter get home ms watkins i dont remember exactly perhaps around two twothirty were you worried merrily smiled stiffly youre always a bit worried arent you even though you know theyre not far away were you aware of the disturbance on the square not really there are several big trees between the vicarage and the road plus i might have fallen asleep in front of the fire well ill need to talk to your daughter unless colette turns up soon of course which she probably will howe produced a narrow smile which caroline cassidy must have found as comforting as a shot of morphine i dont suppose janes up and about yet i dont suppose she is merrily said although you are in my job you find it hard to sleep after six holy communion and all that di howe nodded maam a uniformed constable had come in got a minute howe and the pc moved over to the door merrily couldnt hear what they were saying but the constable was pointing through the window to where another policeman was waiting with a radio howe was looking interested raising her eyebrows oh my god caroline said oh my god our kind of record nothing to worry about di annie howe had said almost convincingly and because caroline cassidy was clearly petrified by the possibility that the police had found a body howe revealed that it was simply a suspected burglary at an isolated cottage in blackberry lane probably no connection at all to merrily this last statement sounded even less convincing howe and mumford had both left out on the square a car was starting up they were off to lol robinsons cottage it had to be the police would have routinely knocked on the door to ask if anyone had seen or heard anything in the neighbouring orchard last night they would perhaps have found the place empty this windling gone but obvious signs of a breakin she stayed with the cassidys and when caroline got up to fumble at the coffee machine she said quietly to terrence if some of those kids were looking for somewhere to get drunk or smoke a little cannabis and they found an empty house you know yes he looked for a moment more hopeful shes easily led you know whatever anyone says just a child merrily said nothing she needed to get back and tell jane and lol robinson what had happened sooner or later he was going to have to explain to the police what this was all about and she hoped his story would sound more plausible than it had last night the phone rang on the wall behind the counter caroline stumbled across snatched it down colette oh she sagged hello michelle no no im afraid not mother of one of colettes schoolfriends terrence said to merrily we phoned as many as we could even though wed seen some of them just an hour or two earlier when they came to collect their children merrily said did they all go with colette into the orchard some of them were too sensible terrence said bitterly most of the others seem to have come back fairly quickly who wants to tramp around a place like that without torches or anything unless as you say they were looking for somewhere to experiment with drugs i suppose youve seen some of that you were in urban areas werent you she nodded but didnt elaborate the last thing he needed was to hear where some of these chemical experiments led caroline said yes all right thank you michelle hung up the phone she says cressida thinks we ought to talk to the dj person because colette had gone off with his ghettoblaster thing they found it terrence said bleakly the police found it in the orchard batteries flat carolines face crumpled like a wash leather as for the dj jeff mooney he stayed behind just about long enough to present me with his ridiculous bill look merrily stood up i really think i ought to go back and talk to jane theres always the possibility she knows something that might help id like to give her a thorough grilling before the police get round to it would you caroline dabbed at her face with a tissue and went back to the coffee machine she pulled two cups from a shelf would you come back and tell us if there was something anything at all of course terrence suddenly moaned the festival id forgotten weve got the ceremony this afternoon to launch the festival crowds of people we might even have the press here oh yes merrily thought you can certainly count on having the press here this time fuck the festival caroline slammed down both cups how can you even think of that at a time like this im sorry terrences shoulders shook his unshaven cheeks were wet at the entrance to the mews merrily almost bumped into a woman distractedly coming down from the market place oh alison kinnersley stepped impatiently to one side she wore a genuine barbour one of the very long expensive ones like a highwaymans coat vicar im so sorry excuse me she hurried past merrily into church street then stopped called back lucy devenish the cottage with the red door i think so it was not yet seventhirty early for a social call brass knocker in the shape of an elf or something thank you alison said it had begun to rain it was clear she was in no mood for a conversation she didnt seem to have heard about colettes disappearance or noticed any police activity alison strode off down the street in her highwaymans coat and didnt look back merrily tried to imagine what she could want with lucy devenish tried to imagine her with the lessthanflamboyant lol robinson living with him chatting with him over breakfast sleeping with him and couldnt she turned back towards the vicarage almost running because her legs felt too short and everything in her life seemed to be moving too fast for her and it was raining harder jane had the door open before she could even get out her key the kids hair was uncombed her eyes swollen she looked very young and forlorn like a battered child mum could you make some tea flower merrily stepped inside unzipped her coat the sanctuary man still here you havent had anything to eat again have you whats eating remind me can you make some halfwayedible toast she tossed her coat on to the hall table and went through to the kitchen mrs watkins lol robinson was on his feet its ok im going i just wanted to say thanks for what you did sit down lol merrily said you too jane im making the toast jane walked across the stone flags gathering up a halfwrapped loaf she tossed three slices of bread into the toaster plucked a butter knife from the drainer listen colette cassidy didnt come home last night the village is full of police jane dropped the butter knife theyve searched the village and the orchard theyre now starting to question her friends jane had gone pale which includes you flower the stupid jane picked up the knife and dug it into a slab of hard cold butter so if you know anything merrily said maybe you should tell me first lol said this isnt any of my business i should go you really dont have to go merrily said but you should know the police are at your house they found it had been broken into in the course of their inquiries lol didnt get up they probably think it was a bunch of stoned tearaways she said from the party so perhaps you need to tell them about your unpleasant musician friend but she found herself wondering if this guy really existed and what else she didnt know about lol robinson friend of jane lol was slowly interlacing his fingers jane pulled out the knife with a slab of yellow butter on the end and looked at it what do they think happened to her they dont know flower do they what do you think happened to her the kid pulled a smoking slice from the toaster oblivious to the heat laid it carefully on a willowpattern plate and began buttering it lol robinson turned his head towards her merrily turned her back on the aga but hung on to its rail the knife was scraping backwards and forwards across the same crisp slice scritch scratch over and over do they think shes dead why do you say that merrilys voice rose like the voice of the single tonedeaf parishioner you regularly heard at the end of a hymn somebody will be jane stopped buttering picked up the plate and carried it across to her mother her hands shook youre not making sense jane i thought it might be you came in last night and i prayed for for a long time i was going to go to the church this morning do it properly but then i thought youd be there so it prayed you only that you wouldnt die jane said miserably i always have ive never prayed for anything else in my whole life except that you wouldnt bloody die on me flower merrily said gently why did you think i was going to die when you see fruit and blossom on an apple tree at the same time it means someone close to you we havent got an apple tree it was in the orchard that used to be the churchs the apple dropped off and rolled at my feet my feet couldnt have been more obvious if it was that big finger in the sky from the national lottery that bloody lucy devenish no you bloody christians jane said wildly youll believe any old shit if its in the bible anything else she sat down opposite lol t dont know i dont know if shes dead or not but somebody must be these things dont just happen lol said what happened with colette merrily took a seat all three of them around the table like some screwedup dysfunctional family in a suitably dim and draughty kitchen she told them everything that had happened this morning except for seeing alison and except for the poster about merrily watkinss black mass could she have gone off with some bloke maybe jane said moodily i think she did want to get laid at her party although being sixteen and able to do it legally seems to have taken the magic out of it you think she wanted to go into the orchard to have sex with someone anyone in particular the mood she was in anyone other than dean wall and in the orchard maybe because because the orchards a taboo place colette loves you know breaking taboos a taboo place this is because of edgar powells suicide partly and because things happen to you in the orchard but they never happened to her and excuse me merrily said stop just stop there a minute things happen to you in the orchard what things and to who whom jane said dont push it flower because sooner or later im going to have to talk to you about your sitting room plus ive had next to no sleep plus a lot of other what things jane looked down at the table there came a clipped authoritative knocking on the front door oh merrily found a narrow smile i didnt expect you so soon well something was brought to my attention annie howe wore a loose white raincoat over her dark business suit which rather puts jane at the top of our list oh merrily held open the door not daring to think what it might be dc mumford followed his boss into the hall merrily shut the door er before you talk to jane howe tilted her head impatiently police officers always seemed to think only they were entitled to ask questions how seriously are you the police taking all this i mean colettes how can i put it a bit of a trollop mumford said we know or at least annie howe added that seems to be what shed like people to think times change dont they ms watkins no merrily said not really howe smiled it was glacial you ask how seriously were taking this matter in view of the circumstances more seriously than we would if shed simply left home you can appreciate that yes right sure she looked at annie howe and thought how cleancut and purposefully singleminded she seemed merrily felt much older and yet younger she felt vulnerable somehow for jane and for herself too which was stupid wasnt it well do everything we can to help she said lamely they followed her into the kitchen jane was at the sink washing up there was no sign of lol merrily introduced the police realizing that jane was washing up to remove the cups three of them from the table so howe wouldnt suspect they had company shed even pushed the third chair under the table coconspirators jane and lol in something else she didnt know about merrily said ill stay if you dont mind its important that you do ms watkins merrily she said im merrily howe didnt say that she was annie what did i expect merrily thought sourly instant bonding of two youngish professional women together in a mans world tea coffee thank you ms watkins but we had more of both than we can handle at cassidys country kitchen there was going to be no softening annie howe she pulled out one of the chairs like this was an interview room at police headquarters right sit down jane we wont keep you long what time did you get home last night not too sure jane went around to the opposite side of the table and pulled out a chair of her own after one after two merrily said automatically i heard you come in howe raised a hand let jane answer please ms watkins she sat down colette cassidys a good friend of yours isnt she well weve only known each other a few weeks but yeah we get along ok do you remember where you last saw her yeah it was on the square i mean you know about what happened inside with barry yes perhaps we can come back to that later what happened on the square merrily went to lean against the stove which put her behind howe and facing jane while the kid with surely transparent honesty related what had happened when colette cassidy had decided to take the party outside after the row with barry bloom how colette had bullied dr samedi the dj into setting up his boombox outside and then when people came out to protest and it looked like her parents were on the way had run off with it towards the orchard howe leaned towards jane across the pine table what exactly did colette say when she invited everyone to go to the orchard well she just i dont know i dont remember let me remind you then jane we have several witnesses who say colette shouted something like follow me or janey follow janey she knows would that be you she was talking about jane is that what she called you yeah jane blinked the first sign of nerves merrily gripped the aga rail what was this about annie howe said yeah thats what she called you or yeah it was you she meant both i suppose good all right howe leaned back why would colette have suggested they follow you why would she have said she knows jane didnt hesitate because we got a bit pissed the other weekend and some boys were chasing us and thats where we wound up in the orchard with the boys no wed shaken them off did you and colette often get pissed just that once it was only cider i mean i thought it was only cider id never had it before it was stupid annie howe smiled its all right we arent going to charge you with underage drinking thanks howe frowned but you didnt go with her into the orchard last night did you no why not because jane looked at merrily because my mum wasnt very well and i didnt want to stay out too late you didnt think two am was already a little bit late jane shrugged looked at merrily again annie howe obviously suspecting eye signals said ms watkins why dont you come and sit at the table with us and merrily not wanting to give the icy bitch any reason to suspect anything reluctantly left the meagre comfort of the stove and went to sit down next to jane so howe said you watched her go off into the orchard and then what did you do just sort of wandered around you didnt talk to anyone no youre sure about that jane yeah oh well i did talk to lloyd powell jane sighed i asked him to go and get them out of the orchard he owns it his family mr powell seems to think you were worried about colette i suppose so because you thought she might be attacked no i mean then why because colettes kind of headstrong she gets like carried away youre saying you were more worried about what she might do than what might happen to her yeah i suppose i was what did you think she might do i dont know all right lets go back to the party did you know there were drugs about i think so you knew the people who were supplying them jane didnt reply oh no merrily thought oh surely not id have known wouldnt i do you know mark putley not really we go to the same school thats all i dont think ive ever spoken to him what about colette i dont think she knew him at all shed have no reason to she goes to a different school then why was he at her party gatecrashed i suppose him and a couple of others as far as you know colette hadnt invited them no i mean no were you going to say something else there jane jane trailed her finger through some spilled tea on the tabletop i suppose i was going to say not officially what do you mean by that i jane hesitated oh hell she thought the kids her parents approved of because they knew the kids parents and everything she thought they were all going to be a bit like safe she wanted to kind of spice things up a bit so like yeah she might have made it easier for the local guys to get in like thats the sort of thing she does i mean you never really know what shes going to do or who with annie howe stood up thank you jane you wont be going out will you we may want to talk to you again thank you ms watkins merrily saw jane blow out her cheeks in some kind of relief and in the middle of it howe suddenly turned back to her oh one last thing jane did you see anyone else around after the party anyone you didnt know or perhaps someone you knew hadnt been invited no i dont think so annie howe said how well do you know laurence robinson jane was caught out she looked startled even merrily thought she looked startled i ive met him a couple of times jane said he sometimes helps out at ledwardine lore ive seen him there have you ever been to his house no not really ive been sort oipast his house and colette does she know mr robinson i suppose so i mean yes we all kind of know him because he used to be a kind of rock star sort of when you say we all know him who do you mean other girls no just colette and me and lucy devenish when did you last see mr robinson jane i cant remember you cant remember all the way back to last night when you were seen talking to mr robinson in church street was i oh yes i think i met him on my way to the party yes i did but he didnt go to the party or did he no he didnt howe smiled her icemaidens smile well thank you again as i say we may come back or if theres anything you or your mother want to tell us therell always be someone at the country kitchen until we find colette merrily followed them numbly to the door where annie howe said do you know laurence robinson ms watkins merrily said i may have met him i dont really know him he lives alone doesnt he so i believe he had a girlfriend she left im told and you felt all right about jane seeing him a man twenty years older living on his own merrily said softly is there a problem hes just someone we need to eliminate from our inquiries i suppose i can tell you as a clergyperson i know itll go no further you have my word merrily said mr robinson isnt at home but his cottage is in rather a mess it may be a breakin it may be a burglary because there certainly isnt much furniture in there but there are signs of what might have been a struggle the stereo left on a damaged vinyl record on the turntable theres no sign of the owner or anybody else and mr robinson this is the confidential part at this stage has a history a record he made records merrily heard herself saying ridiculously our type of record ms watkins we believe he likes young girls what laurence robinson was convicted of having sex with a minor girl underage howes smile was steely and barbed like a safety pin opening up cogs by nine oclock they were putting up the last of the bunting and the fancy lights gomer parry lifting lloyd powell in the bucket of his pet digger gwynneth and not happy about this a bit dangerous it was see with no insurance to cover it and all these coppers around for once though the police never even noticed gomer too busy trying to find the cassidys promiscuous daughter or was it precocious no this time gomer reckoned he had it about right got to feel sorry for them though the cassidys moved out here to get away from the big bad city wound up somewhere little and bad gomer watched lloyd powell up in the bucket attaching a string of wooden lanterns to a wroughtiron hook on the righthand gable of the black swan no coloured lights this wasnt christmas these were middle agesstyle lamps handmade by this blacksmith bloke from croydon had a workshop bottom of old barn lane feller provided the lanterns free in the hope of picking up a few orders take more than a few wooden lanterns to light up this place though little and bad now why did he think that it was a decent village in many ways friendly on the whole nobody complaining about the newcomers not as it would make much difference if they did mind seeing as how the newcomers were now well in the majority or maybe it just felt like that on account of they ran everything with their superior knowledge of marketing and public relations fancy stuff like that course gomer he was a newcomer too not so much of one like on account of he only moved about twenty miles and he talked near enough the same and hed done a lot of work in these parts over the years so knew quite a few people before he moved in like bulldavies whose fields hed drained like rod powell whose new cesspit hed dug when lloyd was no more than a babby and ole mrs powell edgars missus had been alive to terrorize rods wife drove her away in the end fearsome woman meggie powell aye it was a hard place all round was ledwardine when gomer first come here lucy devenishd been right about that them days some poor bloke with a mr cassidy accent ventured into the black swan thered be a redcheeked stoneeyed young farmlabourer pissedup on cheap scrumpy and just itching to punch his lights out for the fun of it and for resentments sake nobody hereabouts was rich see save for the bulls and they always punched back except when they punched first sawdust on the floor of the black swan them days to make it easier cleaning up the blood and the puke there was an exhibition of posh watercolours opening in the swan this evening with a recital by a string quartet at the new tourist information office once a butchers shop with slaughterhouse behind blood and offal running down church street on fridays there was a display of local crafts crafted by folk from london and birmingham on monday evening a poetry reading gomer looked up at a movement out of church street strode the bulldavies floozy a little smile on her mouth now that was a funny business the big bull penned up by a woman came out of nowhere who was she what had she got in mind for james and where had she been this notsofine morning ok gomer the chubby face of child the organist up at the window aye gomer said have him all dressed up by eleven the ole square sure tbe some o the little flags got pulled down last night see but we put em back no problem good man said child by the way for my sins ive been coopted as festival coordinator for the duration of the present crisis poor old terrence being hardly in the mood for public conviviality as you can imagine aye gomer said wondered if they might call it off under the circumstances we did think about it but weve all put a lot of work in and as its going to go on for the whole season postponing the opening ceremony would hardly seem like a good precedent besides people coming from miles away no way of letting them know anyway its not as if shes dead shell be on somebodys settee in hereford sleeping it off with her mouth open and her knickers round her ankles what dyou say gomer mabbe gomer said noting the relish in childs voice and mabbe not scuse me a sec lloyd powell having given him the thumbsdown sign from the bucket gomer set about bringing him to the ground got to do it smoothly one jerk and hed be pitching the boy through the window of the public bar and it was a good few years since anybody done that harry morgan the feed supplier had probably been the last slammed through the glass by john bulldavies jamess ole feller for putting it around as the bulls never paid their bills hard men the bulls always had been and now here was james being led around the square and back again by the blonde floozie like there was a ring through his nose power of sex eh leave you to it gomer dermot child busied off towards the tourist info lloyd clambered out of the bucket gomer leaned out all finished then is it good boy what did child want oh hes in charge now boy is mr dermot child cotter do what he says see all we need said lloyd got me in his choral thing he has auld cider plus we gotter do this barbershop kind of thing at the opening followed by a cider tasting thatd be for folk as dunno what cider tastes like would it kind of thing lloyd said good stuff mind the wine of angels sharp though dry take the hairs outer your nose your dad done it all by isself then old recipe gomer lloyd tapped his nose cassidy he wanted to make a thing out of it let the visitors in get a carthorse workin the ole mill bugger that dad says thats for the museums so we done it all ourselves the millin and the pressin served up the casks to barry bloom least you can get some sense out of im and he organized the bottles it goes all right well do it next year be a good crop plus we wont have to buy no apples in next time looks of things aye gomer said and left it at that boy was right never seen that much blossom in the powell orchard not in his lifetime anyway caused a fair bit of comment too grizzly farmers in the ox mumbling about how it was edgars brains mustve fertilized them twisted ole trees looks like thats it then gomer lloyd looking up at the bunting and lanterns mays well take im home he grinned if minniell let you bring im through the gate gomer growled boy was more right than he knew minnie shed got this plan for a proper garden now with rocks and a bloody fountain cherub having a pee no doubt which would require space see and what was taking up more space than a certain collection of nearvintage planthire equipment things was getting tense he pulled in the bucket nice and tidy and gently trundled gwynneth to the edge of the square by god he loved this ole thing the way she answered to every little flick of the levers you could do anything with gwynneth with both eyes shut responsive see like a good sheepdog waiting to get her into church street gomer saw two people first was lucy devenish in her woolly capething striding out determined behind her moped the ole warrior out for somebodys scalp this morning sure tbe second was that little jane the vicars daughter not so bright and smiley today as she come out the vicarage gateway a friend of that colette cassidys lucky she hadnt gone with her last night to wherever it was and gomer was frankly a bit dubious about dermot childs theory that coletted been whisked off by some young stud with pleasure in mind he did not like the feel of this the way shed disappeared into the orchard no more than he liked the feel of the orchard itself for all its explosion of blossom too much blossom they used to say that orchardd been no good since it was cursed back in the seventeenth century by this wil williams the vicar who done his bit of wizarding on the side and hung hisself when he was rumbled well gomer had no fixed opinions on cursing and there was some as said the orchard was just let go on account of the crippling new tax on cider imposed by king charles ii fifteen pence on a hogshead but there was nobody could deny that if hed hung hisself where they said hed done it the last thing this wil williams wouldve seen as he was swinging there was that orchard hed have stopped lucy got her opinion on a few things except she looked so purposeful youd have to block the way with ole gwynneth to get her to pull up unless you was young jane just as determined it looked like lucy the youngster running after the ole woman down church street gomer saw lucy stop in the middle of climbing on to her moped and then they was talking something furious arms waving and such what he wouldntve given to know what they was jabbering on about this gloomy ole morning no listen jane lucy said please listen under her hat her face was very red and her eyes were burning she looked like an oldfashioned stove this like huge massive heat building up inside her you know dont you jane said you know where she is no lucy took hold of both janes shoulders propelled her backwards into the alley by the side of the ox where she and colette had escaped from dean wall and danny gittoes i dont know but jane you must stay well away from it listen to me what you must do is stay with your mother talk to her make her understand something till the apple appeared on the ground i thought you know i thought the worst that could happen was shed get like taken away like me and maybe she wouldnt be able to handle that because of the kind of person she is and lucys grip tightened on her shoulders her hands were terrifically strong and there was so much heat there that jane was scared into silence shed never seen lucy like this before jane are you listening now yes jane felt very small it was quite dim in the alley on a dull day like this she could detect the thin acid odour of urine from the gents toilet it reminded her in some awful way of cider something happened to your mother last night lucy said in the church she was ill dean wall and those creeps were making a big joke about it at the party and saying she was like possessed by a demon or something and they wont be the only ones lucy said others may be subtler therell be pressure on her much of it from inside selfdoubt do you know what i mean jane wasnt sure she did she gets a bit overtired sometimes shes not as certain about things as she used to be but like she doesnt talk much about it she just asks me questions i cant answer yes i know you cant but what i mean jane is that it will have occurred to her consciously or not that she became ill at the moment of taking her vows because she was not meant to take those vows not meant to commit herself to this parish at some point if it hasnt happened already shell be telling herself it was all wrong and that she really knew this all the time that she made a mistake what becoming a vicar going into the church possibly that or coming here i know that must have been a shock for you too having a mother who suddenly decides to commit herself to god im not really jealous of the old guy i know lucys grip softened but perhaps you havent been as supportive as you might have been ive tried really i mean we always talked the same language basically if we stayed off religion and like after whats been happening i thought maybe theres some chance we could connect there as well but were coming at it from different directions arent we i mean sometimes i feel really alight with it but i cant tell her shes like so blocked yeah with all the dogma and stuff i mean i left the traherne book lying around but shes always so busy jane lucy looked very serious this is not the time to sit up on your superior teenagers perch and dont look at me like that you little snot your mother may have a restricted viewpoint professionally but theres a thinking feeling responsive person under that cassock she doesnt wear that thing any more thank goodness except like on the shop floor yes a sign perhaps that the persons reemerging shell come to it in her own way perhaps and while you might have had a crash course her knowledge is still a hundred times greater than yours but you have to help her if she wont come to me and i can understand why she wont then she needs you to tell her that coming here was not the mistake shes fearing it may have been that shes very much needed here she needs assurance from you not from the bishop not from the cassidys not from that pompous old fool ted clowes she just asks me questions then answer them as best you can and pray for help pray jane turned away from the toilet smell avoiding lucys hawklike eyes who to youll know lucy said and theres another thing last night your mother indicated to me that she was going to refuse to allow richard coffey to put on his dreadful play in the church yeah we had a bit of a row about it she talked to stefan alder and she thought hed got this unhealthy obsession this kind of gay thing you know but thats not why shes against it its because hes in love with someone whos dead and its like you know spiritual necrophilia and all that yuk stuff she doesnt think i know about like she doesnt want him to satisfy his weird lusts or whatever in church i said i thought it was cool and kind of beautiful and she was being stupid you were right lucy said but for the wrong reasons jane she must change her mind she has to let wils spirit speak she must be convinced youll have to be subtle jane was confused but you said it was a dreadful play its not the play its the machinery of it the cogs it turns the play may not be the play coffey envisages not if merrily stays i thought shed be a catalyst but i thought it might take years but it isnt its happening very very quickly youve lost me it doesnt matter lucy was looking feverish again burning up inside jane i have to go where perhaps i shall come and see you and your mother its too much for one person to carry especially someone old and creaky like myself what is lucy lowered her arms stepped away from jane looking about as old and creaky as a jumbo jet on the verge of takeoff jane didnt think shed ever seen anyone as poweredup she thought she ought to tell lucy about lol and his problems why hed spent the night at the vicarage how hed inadvertently let mum in to see the painted walls leading to one of those questions lucy said shed have to try and answer go home jane remember what i said ok they walked out of the alley into church street where lucy climbed on to her moped a police car went past i didnt tell them anything jane said the police the police questioned you inspector howe she was horrible she looks like a sadistic dentist shes coming back if they dont find colette she seems to think i know something lucy smiled briefly jane if you told her what you know i think it would be safe to say she would never bother you again shed think i was bonkers she told mum something i couldnt hear when they were leaving and mum was a bit funny afterwards lucy stopped funny in what way kind of shocked and when i felt i had to come out of there and think about things on my own and i said maybe id go for a walk and kind of cool off she seemed glad and she almost pushed me out you know i think that woman told her they thought colette had been attacked or raped or something so bad she couldnt face talking to me about it i mean you dont think i shall be honest with you jane lucy said i fear your inspector maybe right no jane stared at her filled with a horrid stark dismay i wanted you to tell me i was wrong tell me that old apple was just just like some stupid coincidence realizing as she said it that this was a stupid makeitallrightmummy littlegirl reaction help your mother lucy said be there as they say for her i shall come and talk to you both youre not going to the orchard are you lucy lucys smile was somehow less brave not exactly go to your mother the vicarage looked at its biggest and drabbest when approached uphill from church street its timbers needed a few coats of paint or preservative or whatever they used its white bits were grey its windows black except jane froze on the pavement looking up there was a light in the third storey in the apartment a single white light it was the sun surely the sun must have come out she turned looked all over the sky for the sun catching a sliver of light between two bunches of cloud but it wasnt enough something in that room was alive wrong word jane thought in terror wrong word affliction it was the way she looked at him lol came in from the scullery she was waiting for him in the kitchen merrily little and dark and not girlish this quietness around her the way she looked at him made him feel sick the blackeyed dog was with her like a shadow hed listened to the detective dealing out the questions in a clipped and unsympathetic way that was surely all wrong for getting information out of a kid like jane maybe wherever the detective had come from the teenagers she was used to questioning were hard and sullen you had to be heavy with them lol thought jane had been incredible the way shed handled it so young so much together and then the heavy one how well do you know laurence robinson the question coming over like a missile making him cringe into the corner of the doorway a greasy steel hinge biting into his forehead ok merrily said coldly sit down mr robinson he went and sat in the chair vacated by jane and then wished he hadnt she was looking at him like he was caressing some item of the girls underwear she told you right asking the question but he couldnt look at her the policewoman told me what about tracy cooke merrily sat down opposite him in a selfconscious way which showed she was forcing herself to do this as an ordained churchperson a licensed member of the soulpolice he remembered the way his parents minister had spoken to him youngish guy called gregory wallace meeting him at the door of the family home informing him on their behalf that he was no longer welcome here suggesting he might care to join a church some other church in some other town ask for gods help with his affliction see the way youre looking at me mrs watkins its like you really ought to be handing me over to the police only because youre a priest youre going to give me a chance to unburden myself to you first and then youll persuade me to do the right thing and give myself up that about it whatever you think is appropriate for a priest i dont think any of its appropriate but you dont ever get away from it he met her eyes again now youre thinking would he have had time to sneak out of his sleeping bag go and do whatever he did to colette cassidy and slink back before it got light i thought that about twenty minutes ago it seemed unlikely but possible yes he blinked it away weeping would be like confirmation the sexoffender breaks down ok then he stood up ill leave and you call the police or ill just go back to the cottage and wait for them and ive never been here i wont tell them ive been here if i could ask you one last favour is it possible you could look after ethel not for ever obviously if you could tell lucy shell take her or sort something out thats if they you know if they take me away oh for fucks sake merrily closed her eyes in utter weariness cant you say anything without going round in circles tell me about this tracy cooke lol said tracy cooke the rain had stopped but left a wind behind jane turned away from the vicarage all of a dither the bright light in the top window had gone out the window was quite black now it had not been a real light had it no more real than the little lights in the orchard she had to think about all this decide what was real the market square was full of strange vehicles including two police cars and a red car with an aerial on top local radio and they werent here for the opening of the ledwardine festival was colette news a girl who disappears during her sixteenth birthday party yes it was wasnt it and the festival was happening all around it people rushing about dermot child and lloyd powell and uncle ted seriousfaced people who should be smiling making jokes under the bunting and the fancy new lanterns in front of the market hall a little stage was going up with a van like dr samedis only with permanent loud speakers on top welcome to de carnival the whole atmosphere was so weird like ledwardine was inside one of those round glass ornaments and somebody was shaking it hard and everything was swirling around and when the village was eventually put down when it all came to rest nothing was going to be the same in the little globes it was always snow that was swirled here it was apple blossom specks of it everywhere carried in on the wind very white under the summerless grey sky the orb had been shaken and the orchard was back in the village the thought made jane quiver she felt she had to cling to one of the pillars of the market hall or shed be blown away in the blossom again above her a new poster had gone up for dermot childs choral work old cider feel the red earth move lol talked it seemed very hard for him but if it was an act he was bloody good if it was an act then everything else about him was false he talked like he himself was hearing all this aloud for the first time and merrily willing jane not to come back until this was over found herself constructing a story around the faltering fragments filling in what was unsaid this tracy cooke was nearly fifteen at the time she had a friend called kath hurley who was sixteen though you wouldnt have known youd have guessed kath was about twentyfive and tracy would have worn a lot of makeup trying to keep up merrily tried not to cast jane and colette in the roles it was not appropriate tracy and kath were rock fans from banbury in oxfordshire they went to a lot of gigs afterwards they kath particularly liked to talk to the musicians if they were accessible one night they went into oxford to one of the colleges to see a band called hazey jane play this quite gentle mostly acoustic music that wasnt all that fashionable at the time and the audience wasnt very big so it was easy for kath and tracy to get talking to the guys in the band karl who played bass and piano was very extrovert and generous and he said would the girls like to come back to their hotel have dinner dinner was what he said very sophisticated that would have been the clincher for tracy and kath turned out that only two of them were staying at the hotel karl himself and the singer lol who was the one kath really fancied though he looked very young but karl who was in charge of this situation he fancied kath who was the best looking and so he made sure that lol was sitting next to tracy in the hotel which was really just a pub with spare rooms and when karl and kath went to the bar karl nudged her and laughed a lot as he got the barman to put vodka lots of it in lol and tracys drinks karl at some stage said they would have dinner sent up and kath thought yeah fair enough and so they went into their separate rooms and fucked natch which would have been ok which would have been fine if karl hadnt said after a while to kath that maybe they should invite tracy and lol to join them bring a little variation into the proceedings and kath who as karl told him later by way of consolation had fancied lol in the first place said yeah why not and so karl pulls on his briefs and strolls along to lols room not locked of course hotel rooms often werent in those days particularly a place this economical karl finds lol and tracy sleeping like the babies they were and being the considerate guy he is he doesnt like to wake them up he just squeezes himself in on tracys side you were asleep all this time merrily said he didnt wake you up i was drunk lol admitted not used to it you know what thats like yeah merrily said so does jane he worried her again then the way he winced but she said go on karl of course is not sleepy and one thing leads to another and about five minutes later little tracy wakes up almost suffocating with her nose in this big hairy chest and these big sweaty hands easing her thighs apart tracy goes berserk tracy has presumably just made love with gentle hesitant lol tracy is hysterical with shock and terror guests in neighbouring rooms are awakened one marches down to reception and demands that the licensee calls the police and when they arrive they find a tearful tracy over by the window wrapped in one of the curtains and the defendanttobe laurence robinson drunkenly fumbling some clothes on there is no one else in the room questioned by police kathleen hurley of riverdale drive banbury insists that karl windling spent the entire night with her and no they didnt get much sleep which is how she knows he didnt slip away in the face of blanket denials further investigation simply isnt worth the manpower the police go with what theyve got which is laurence iain robinson the parents of tracy cooke insisting the prosecution should go ahead as their daughters reputation as a decent modest person is on the line and these bloody pop people think they can get away with anything tracy tries to speak up for lol nobody listens jane wandered into the mews cassidys country kitchen was open as usual and doing good business although not surprisingly there was no sign of the proprietors ledwardine lore however was shut jane watched three obvious tourists walk up to the door and push and shake the handle and then walk away shrugging businesswise this could have been lucys best day for ages wherever shed gone on her moped it was obviously terribly important even the lights were out behind the closed sign only a pale glimmering of fairy wings in the window fairies yes lucy had said people saw fairies with gossamer wings fairies very much like these it was how they were traditionally perceived and how people liked to think of them like very tiny angels which was what they were tiny angels but neither fairies nor angels were in reality like these images and yet they were it was complicated lucy said and yet very very simple simple as blossom as lights in an apple tree excuse me at the mouth of the mews a plump twentysomething woman stepped out in front of jane im with bbc radio hereford and worcester i dont suppose you know colette cassidy do you she looked a bit harassed she wore a black velvet hat and had a small recorder with a microphone sure jane said thank god could i ask you a few things about her ok terrific the microphone had a blobby thing on the end be with you in a couple of seconds sorry your name is jane w wilkins it was ok talking about colette but she didnt fancy any vicars daughter stuff ok jane so were you at the party yeah the microphone about six inches from her nose i gather it was fairly lively no jane said not really no it was quite dull actually people were just dancing and stuff and drinking coke why did they all come outside fresh air i suppose oh i understood there was some dancing going on out here no not really people were just kind of wandering off it was no big deal wasnt colette trying to you know get them going no shes not like that shes very quiet i dont think she really wanted a party it was just kind of expected normally she liked er reading and going for walks very interested in wildlife and er flowers that sort of thing so what do you thinks happened to her well knowing colette she probably went off somewhere with a friend to get away from it all for cocoa or something stayed the night oh the reporter switched off her machine well thanks jane turned and walked off towards the radio car on the square thanks a fucking bunch jane heard merrily tried to remember if shed read about it at the time but as hazey jane were hardly famous it probably hadnt been widely reported they said i was very lucky lol said it could easily have been rape it was rape surely merrily said and how on earth did he persuade that girl not to give evidence if this was her friend lol was silent for a moment i dont know i imagine he threw her around a bit and gave her some money karl thinks on his feet even when hes stoned so you were alone in the dock what did you get probation he was looking down at the table she could see him fighting the tears eighteen years ago and the wound was still wide open and oozing did she believe this if it was true it was hardly shocking when you considered that the alleged victim was not so much younger than the alleged criminal and probably emotionally more mature i mean i did it lol said i pleaded guilty i had sex with an underage girl it was enough in the eyes of god as they say who say my parents well theyre dead now it was what they said at the time well they didnt actually say it because neither of them ever spoke to me again only their minister he spoke for them and for god as you priests do what denomination was this i cant remember big pink building with posters outside merrily smiled theyd caught religion in middle age it just pushed everything else out i was like a lodger by then the old pictures of me as a kid all gone replaced by pictures of jesus only child he nodded but id stopped being their son in any real sense when i wouldnt go to their church after they threw me out they had my room cleansed merrily said lucy devenish know about this some after that i went a bit gigging doesnt come easy when your last public appearance was in court when your parents have thrown you out spawn of satan and youre living in one room over a fish and chip shop in swindon and your music is stuck in a time warp and you keep dwelling on nick drake who was afraid of playing live and so never built up a following so his records didnt sell and the black depression set in the blackeyed dog at the door like the hellhound on my trail of the s blues singer robert johnson who was so shy they had to record him facing the wall and died at twentysix just like nick drake and youre getting more and more confused and taking pills and you get it into your head that theres some dark virus in the music passed from johnson to drake and maybe other people in between and now its in you the band fizzles out as bands do youre living alone in one room and a toilet one day dennis clarke the drummer comes to see you suburban dennis is appalled at the way youre living the stuff youre taking your hair unwashed your eyes way back in your head where its always night and your current girlfriend who picked you up in a pub is nearly old enough to be your mother almost certainly on the game and she takes your money and brings you drugs youre ill and shes making you worse the truth of it was blindingly obvious to merrily you were afraid of young girls werent you you were probably even afraid of girls your own age in case they turned out to be younger than they said they were right you felt safe with this woman lol shrugged are you still afraid of them lol were you afraid of jane even though you came into the house with her last night went up to her room lols fist tightened it was this dennis who realized lol had had a breakdown dennis who got him into the hospital dennis and a mate of his who was a doctor voluntary of course lol was a voluntary patient no kicking and screaming no straitjackets on the other hand no analysis no therapy that you couldnt swallow with a glass of water but he was glad of the rest and time passed how long yeah i know i know its very easy for people on the outside to say you should have got yourself out but you get very grateful its to do with people helping you stopping people helping you thats the hard bit saying no i dont want help i dont need your help im all right piss off it was like karl he helped me get through the court thing how did he do that lol lol sighed he gave me stuff to make it so that it didnt matter or so you didnt have second thoughts about implicating him was that how you got started was it heroin no i dont know what it was well i do but that doesnt matter it wasnt addiction just reliance thats different i think but the more you took the less it mattered sure in hospital they call it your medication god can we skip the hospital i did get out eventually people helped dennis again then this soundengineer we once worked with prof levin who was an alcoholic nice guy he put me in touch with gary kennedy who was looking for a lyricist so things looked up money came in quite a lot things were better and then there was alison alison was a friend of one of the nurses at the hospital whod become a friend of lols and kept in touch alison was the first girlfriend hed had in a long long time who was younger than him so alison was progress she also made lol realize he wasnt such a young person any more and where had it gone his youth missing years you never make up for missing years but hed made it through to the other side of something unlike nick drake and robert johnson he had not died although thered been a period when the thought of it hadnt frightened him too much listen alison had said this beautiful creature too beautiful to entirely believe in listen why dont we get out of here theyd found the cottage the very next day like it was meant lol said and something about the way he said it made merrily wonder she found herself thinking of alison on the square at night with an upperclass drunk calling her a whore a slinky slinky whore and that morning in the church james is full of shit i thought i should tell you that what are you full of alison she stood up lets have some more tea lol he looked at her he nodded he didnt ask her if she believed him and because of that she found she did on the square a tv cameraman was unpacking his video gear the local radio woman snorted bollocks bella the radio woman turned towards a man leaning out of the window of a chunky blue fourwheeldrive thing he beckoned her over jane followed not sure why you know where kings oak corner is bella the man in the fourwheeldrive asked maybe what for developments the man in the fourwheeldrive said oh yeah the radio woman hugged her recording kit looked unconvinced the man held up a mobile phone i know a man with a police scanner he reckons theres some interest in kings oak corner just if youre going that way bella my darling we could follow you and dont say i never do you any favours yeah all right bella nodded towards the cameraman whod met up with this sassylooking girl in a long black mac be casual dont want the circus do we he nodded and the fourwheeldrive crawled to the edge of the cobbles bella made a play of standing around and looking at her watch before making her way to the radio car where jane was waiting for her ok if i come with you certainly not bella said shes my best friend colette sounded like it i bet you dont even know what she looks like jane stepped out of the way of a troupe of jingling morris dancers alighting from a minibus several of them were laughing at something evidently unaware of anything going on apart from the launch of the ledwardine festival please jane said were not supposed to take members of the public in this bella unlocked the radio car with a bleeper bbc regulations sorry oh well thats ok jane sighed i suppose i could ask those tv people the morris dancers headed up the steps to the black swan there was a muted cheer from inside all right you evil little bitch said bella get in but if theyve found a body you keep well out of the way or well both be stuffed accessory of the three roads close to ledwardine the b road in the west was the quietest it was an old road which had been rerouted straightened and widened taking a strip off the great orchard and dividing two farmhouses including the powells from the village a mile out of ledwardine spectacular views opened up across the lush quilted wye valley to the black mountains on the welsh border its beautiful sure bella said but not so terrific as a news area well not usually anyway it was clear that bella was secretly hoping colette was dead jane thought you must really hate yourself for that if you were a reporter or an ambitious detective wishing for something really awful to happen to somebody while you just happened to be on the spot i dont really work here bella said im on what they call an attachment i was in manchester for two years then london for a bit but i was a naughty girl and it was either this or back into researching or out six months then theyll review my position as we say so how fars this kings oak corner hang on said jane i thought you knew do i hell i did bloody well to make it here from hereford if id said i didnt know where it was chris mightve clammed up so how would you have found it if i hadnt been with you stopped and asked somebody i expect but you do know dont you chuck theres a pub called the kings oak about two miles on where you turn left we go past it on the school bus sounds good to me bella speeded up kings oak corner it was a long way from the orchard wasnt it perhaps the message the guy had picked up on his police scanner related to something else entirely because it was a long way from the orchard in janes mind an old withered apple rolled along the snowypetalled orchard floor to her feet she gave her head a brisk shake what do you think they might have found if not you know search me chriss mate couldve got it wrong but at least it gets me out of bloody ledwardine for the big opening ceremony if there are no developments on the missing girl or she gets found alive im supposed to put together a package on the festival as well yawn yawn what i want is just to tie it into the main story festival goes ahead despite missing girl drama rather than have to interview the little fat guy about his choral work et cetera whats she really like bit of a sod colette shes ok oh so you do know her yeah she got a boyfriend nobody regular what about you jane gonna stick around and shack up with a farmer or get out soon as you can i dont know bella was pretty direct jane could relate to that i dont really know what i want to do whats your job like jobs fine its some of the people you have to work for whats your old man do he was a lawyer hes dead oh sorry chuck and my mothers a priest really bella glanced sideways at jane hey hold on bloody hell merrily watkins well well how dyou feel about that mixed ive only seen her picture in the paper but she looked like an otherwise normal person attractive whyd she do a thing like that become a priest god knows grief like medieval widows used to go into a nunnery definitely not it started before he died anyway like i know she got pretty friendly with our local vicar and his wife this was when my dad when they were going through a difficult patch over a few things and she started helping this guy with his parish stuff advising people with problems shes pretty smart and then it just seemed she was reading the lessons in church and stuff like that and it just sort of crept up and one day it was like jane we need to have a little chat mummys going to train for a special new job i was about nine your dad was alive then yeah he got killed in a car crash but he was alive when she decided to go for it hey youre not planning to use any of this are you me no way how did your dad feel about it he was seriously pissed off about it but things werent good between them by then anyway she watched the countryside go past views shed seen a hundred times fields of sheep and cows but it all looked different today like it had a pulse it was really weird bella asking about mum why shed done it because there had to be something didnt there or there would be with her it wouldnt be like oh i like helping people but i couldnt cut it as a nurse so ill be a vicar thats cool like there was the problem with dad things he was doing that she thought maybe she ought to like atone for but thats not enough is it realizing she wouldnt have thought even a few weeks ago that there would need to be anything else because the word spiritual didnt mean much until she was having long talks with lucy until after she got pissed on cider and fell asleep in powells orchard and looked up this the turning bella said what oh oh yeah the black and white pub was up ahead vehicles including a police car on its parking area not far around the corner bella had to pull up for a hurriedly erected sign saying police road closed oh my god jane said there really is something suddenly she didnt want to get out of the car all right merrily said taking control you cant go back to blackberry lane theyll nick you annie howe will not believe you shell make your life unbearable until they find colette or some some other direction you should stay here the church does this sort of thing its called sanctuary its called being an accessory lol said merrily laughed she didnt know why listen you have enough problems lol said the longer im missing the more the fingers going to point my way if they find out the vicars hiding me whats that going to look like priestincharge merrily said in charge five minutes ago shed taken a phone call from uncle ted whod informed her that in view of her illness theyd organized a locum for sunday a retired rector from pembridge canon norman gemmell only too glad to step into the breech old norman merrily who had not been consulted had suggested ted telephone norman immediately to say that it wouldnt after all be necessary to iron his surplice like the fallen jockey needs to get back into the saddle the crashed pilot back behind the joystick she had to get up in that pulpit show to the congregation of doubters a face washed clean of vomit if i quit i quit she told lol but im not slinking out the back way and nobody tells me who i accommodate in my vicarage she saw he was looking at her with something verging on awe she sat down reached for cigarettes lol do you never feel youve been pushed around once too often the problem is sorting out whos pushing you around because it serves their purposes or its fun and whos genuinely trying to help you and hes been pushed around by the best she thought alison this windling guy lucy devenish thats too complicated for me she said but if you ever think im pushing you tell me ok the phone rang again in the hall news travelled fast in ledwardine it was dermot child he was delighted to hear she was so much better he thought he just ought to mention but of course everyone would understand if she still felt a little too frail that she was to have said a few words at this afternoons opening ceremony poor old terrence had had her down for twothirty ill be there merrily said not letting herself think it was that word frail that did it she put the phone down went back into the kitchen found lol looking no less worried what if it was karl he said he was drunk he was angry and hes not there any more oh she sat down opposite him if colette came to his door your door at two in the morning how would he react like it was his birthday lol said bella pulled the recording gear from the well by janes feet if you come you keep quiet ok i think ill stay here bella flashed her a look of concern she really is a good friend of yours isnt she we go back jane said they went back less than a month it felt like half a lifetime stay cool bella said it may not be jane sat and watched her stride boldly towards the police barrier clutching the recording gear the fourwheeldrive had pulled up behind them and bella was joined by the other reporter chris and a photographer a uniformed constable appeared making these negative wiping gestures with his arms but the photographer started taking pictures and bella and chris marched right up to the barrier jane couldnt see from where the car was parked what was happening the other side she was thinking about that faraway night in the orchard colette saying i often come here and jane had said arent you scared and colette had turned sly you mean of the ghost of edgar powell hey listen hes been seen old edgar powell the headless farmer all aglow and hovering about nine inches off the ground colette hadnt been scared of the ghost of edgar powell or anybody else she thought it was all a joke and yet and this had occurred to jane when she was giving bella that spoof interview on tape despite being a cool city chick with a professed disdain for the countryside and wildlife and all that colette was secretly fascinated by the orchard compelled kind of seduced i often come here shed admitted pissed before forcing jane to look up into the branches and then when janes reaction had been well not what shed expected it must have hardened into a desire to really know about this giving jane the third degree outside the chip shop giving her the hazey jane album colette must have gone again and again to that orchard drawn by something she couldnt explain that the cool chick in her sneered at but something deeper in her perceived as being sexy as hell and when something happened it happened to jane bella was coming back with chris and the photographer chris smacking a fist into a palm there was something jane tensed as bella got into the car handed her the tape machine what jane said what bella started the engine they wont give us anything theyre holding a press conference at four at hereford police station theyve found something but im pretty sure it isnt a body no sign of a meat wagon or anything people in plastic suits though chris is going to hang on here for half an hour see if theres anything ill have to shoot back grab some actuality of the opening of the festival in case the parents come out for it what do you think it is i dont know bastards ill have to put over a mystery surrounds piece and then the tellyll be on to it bastards bella reversed the car into the entrance to the kings oak car park and pointed it back towards hereford and ledwardine jane said what have you got against the tv bella laughed her side window was wound down and her elbow rested casually on the ledge what could i possibly have against people who get paid about twice as much as me for working less than half as hard i love those guys there was no other traffic in sight in either direction and when they rounded a bend and came upon the carnage in the road bella was doing over seventy but where is he merrily said wheres he gone what evidence have you got that he was even here that he even exists that you didnt make him up jane saw him lol said when it was nearly lunchtime time jane was making a reappearance it no longer seemed an entirely good thing for jane to be out there despite the police on the streets she came into the shop this particular afternoon to ask about wil williams i asked her to mind the shop while i went and hid hid upstairs nobody merrily thought would make that up she could see i was scared and she was having fun with that like building him up as a drug dealer or something she seems to have quite an active imagination youre not wrong so i told her to forget all about him i said he was just a guy it was hard to get out of your hair and to tell colette to keep out of his way too oh jesus merrily said youre not big on child psychology are you sorry so here she is hypothetically on the cottage doorstep at two in the morning this is a girl whod really quite like to get laid tonight jane said that what happens he invites her in or he says why dont i give you a lift home you shouldnt be out on your own on a dark night like this and i know this guy once he had her in the car hed just keep on driving merrily thought about this all right well wait till jane comes back and well talk it over with her shes had time to think about things several things i hope and then perhaps well both go and see howe shed only split us up question us separately thats what they do she couldnt merrily said im not a suspect youre an accessory merrily lit a cigarette she said its at times like these when i usually suggest we kneel down together and pray for guidance youre not serious lol said its what i do merrily said id forgotten outside across on the square a brass band began to play bastard god bella spun the wheel hand over hand over hand and the brakes and the tyres screamed and the hedge burst out at them from the wrong side of the road shiiiiiiiiit bella shrieking as they were torn across a tangle of branches and thorns with a grating noise rising to a high thin whine like a scythe on a sharpening wheel and shiiiiiit again and a wing mirror snipped away as jane lurched against bella all the breath kicked out of her and the windscreen was full of slapping branches before the radio car seemed to wrench itself out of the hedge hit the tarmac again with a clanging jolt the engine coughed once and stalled jane wasnt aware of losing consciousness but she seemed to awake into a deep uncanny stillness during which she could only think about that newspaper picture of her dads car balled like paper with him and his secretary and lover karen all mashed up together inside she became aware of a distant voice bella saying almost calmly got to get out weve got to get out of here the voice repeating itself over and over again but that was probably only in janes head because bella was saying now are you all right are you all right jane janes mind was searching back through thirty seconds of snapshot memories for the horrific reason bella had braked and swerved and theyd come off the road she sat up the car was full of twigs and leaves the recorder had fallen on to her trainers and she pulled one foot from underneath it feeling for the doorpull it still worked but the door wouldnt open cant get out my side bella said her velvet hat had come off and there were twigs in her hair and her face was raked with blood hang on jane turned herself round wedged both shoulders against the passenger door her feet up against the handbrake heaved backwards and the door sprang open and she slid out clawing wildly at the air bella grabbed her hands before she could hit the tarmac let her sink down gently to the road bella was easing herself out of the car as jane struggled to her feet she saw the car was sideon to the road blocking one narrow carriageway and half of the other the steeple of ledwardine church prodded out of some trees about half a mile away bella leaned back against the car put a tentative hand to her face oh shit bella said jane remembered the window had been wound all the way down on the drivers side bella leaning an elbow out offering a bare face to the slashing twigs jesus my whole face is on fire im gonna be disfigured for life still she smiled wanly at jane through the streaks of blood youre ok and were not dead are we she pushed her hands through her hair as though feeling for fractures and its not as if oh no she sagged against the car and they looked at each other remembering there was a white almost wintry sun now in a sky like tinfoil jane didnt seem to be hurt at all no cuts no scratches no aches except for an ankle where the recorder had fallen but she felt sick with dread remembering what had been in the road what was now concealed by the radio car sideon against the traffic except there was none no vehicles in sight no sounds of traffic the road clear in both directions this was the straight stretch into ledwardine from madley and few people came this way on a saturday jane said softly til look no bella stood up stiffly you stay there but they knew they were both going they went slowly around the car taking different routes to show they werent scared jane round by the boot bella by the bonnet somewhere in the car a phone bleeped neither bella nor jane looked back jane saw the dead eyes of the ewe first the ewe lay in a lump at her feet like you sometimes came upon them dead in fields bloodlessly dead for no apparent reason sheep seemed able to leave life behind in an instant without suffering without a thought poor sheep they should die in grass not on tarmac because of stupid farmers too mean to put in proper stockproof fences poor sheep jane said aloud as though by focusing all her sorrow on the ewe there would be nothing more oh christ bella said there was some blood where she stood though not much of it the blood was over a yard from the sheep where there was another hump a black and white checked blanket thrown over something the blood was seeping from underneath the blanket jane stared at it rejecting it it was a blanket there was nothing underneath it it was a familiar pattern it was just a blanket please she said feeling her eyes bulge her lips already stretching in pain and shock please dont look bella said let me but jane was already bending down and lifting the hem out of the corner of an eye she could see a wheel in the hedge jane looked down kept on looking under the summerfine wool the old warriors head lay in profile on the road the lips closed under the hooked nose one eye wide open as blank as the ewes the face weathered and reddened by the many years of wind and now by sticky blood when shed come off her moped the light summer poncho had been thrown over her head bella was back in the car jane could hear the tight little bleeps as her fingers stabbed at the mobile phone no jane said no she pulled the poncho away sank down to the tarmac she didnt know what to do she was sure lucy was breathing she had to be breathing she put her cheek against lucys breast that was a heartbeat wasnt it she didnt know what do she looked up the sky wore a remote uncaring sheen through the blurred screen of her tears jane screamed into the mindless heartless selfsatisfied face of her mothers bastard god superstitious crap from the hall window lol watched her walking out of the gates head down shoulders squeezed in hed seen the shadows on her face and one of them was him should have kicked me out when you had the chance vicar he looked around for ethel but shed pattered off somewhere in the big bare house in which they were both effectively trapped leaving him to walk round and round the kitchen in despair at what a really fucking small person he was in every conceivable sense he thought of his suicide all the care and logic hed put into the scheme to bring alison to his door which was face it an insane thing to do as insane as going to alison last night and asking her why shed left him like this was going to make her think yeah why did i leave the poor little guy what kind of a bitch did i become and then return which he didnt want he didnt want alison back he didnt want his cottage back he didnt want to pick up his car he was mad still very sick he needed a small room and all his meals prepared he needed his medication lol walked round and round the kitchen like a mouse looking for a gap in the skirting ascending the three steps to the wooden platform under the mirror sky merrily had this absurd vision of a scaffold a beheading block or even worse right now the pulpit oyez oyez wailed the hired town crier in his long red coat and threecornered hat villagers of ledwardine be it known that ye festival will be commenced at three of the clock merrily waited for lucy devenish to come striding out condemning it as a ludicrous travesty because in over a thousand years of recorded history ledwardine had never had a town crier merrily dermot child clasped her right hand in both of his are you sure youre all right in a lightgreen polo shirt with an apple motif he looked brighteyed and excited in the unfortunate absence of terrence cassidy he appeared to have acquired a festival just one of those twentyfourhour satanic viruses merrily said tightly im told its going around oh that dermot laughed some semiliterate youngster dont let it worry you what the posters merrily ignore it its a joke albeit a poor one posters plural well i did remove a couple one from the market hall one from the bus shelter in old barn lane hey he squeezed her shoulders kids its kids i dont think so someone was broadcasting a sick specious rumour somebody out to do damage the hitech version of the anonymous letter with a printer they could turn out dozens hundreds anyway dermot said poor joke how many would even understand it and so she took her seat on the platform at the opposite end to bulldavies festival president who nodded councillor garrod powell followed her up sorry im late car accident out on the madley road dermot glanced at him serious didnt look much some young lunatic hadnt no time to find out well over a hundred people had drifted on to the square which wasnt bad for a mere opening ceremony opening ceremonies were for the organizers there were quite a few strangers among the villagers most of them either drinking outside the black swan where tables and umbrellas had been set up or gathered around the craft and refreshment stalls in the market hall or watching the police the ledwardine festival providing the perfect cover for the curious oh shit said dermot child wearing a dark suit and a pale face terrence cassidy was crossing the cobbles what we dont need is a spectre at the feast brave of him and everything but bloody hell give the man some credit child bulldavies stood up terrence any news cassidy mounted the platform smiled stiffly at dermot and sat down between bulldavies and powell he shook his head never say die bulldavies said thoughtlessly i had to come out terrence said sombrely atmospheres so utterly oppressive in there merrily i dont suppose jane merrily said cautiously jane has every confidence that colette can take care of herself but no she doesnt seem to have seen her after anyone else im sorry terrence dermot said i was simply going to pay tribute in my opening speech to the tremendous amount of work youve put in but is there i mean the police presence is pretty obvious what do you want me to say about nothing dermot it has absolutely nothing to do with the festival terrence stared straight ahead as a photographer took a picture of him on the platform dermot child scowled not at the intrusion of the press for the wrong reason merrily thought but because the silent tragic dignified cassidy was going to upstage him all right lets get on with it dermot approached the microphone tapped it ladies and gentlemen could we have your attention now please he handled it well hed become mr ledwardine round and rosy and polished he thanked the tourist board english heritage the marches development board then he talked as a native about his village a few centuries ago we were a flourishing market town as you can see from the beautiful little market hall behind me in those days like most country towns we had half a dozen shops we still have half a dozen shops we remain as we were but like pembridge and eardisley and weobley were no longer a town we are no longer famous for our orchards and our cider indeed we were in danger of becoming famous only for what we were dermot paused merrily saw a police car followed by another car turning into church street from old barn lane it would have been too easy dermot said to live in the past to be a village of ghosts to preserve our exquisite black and white buildings as no more than an openair museum but that would be to deny the power of the present the police car pulled up a respectable distance from the square the plain car behind it nobody got out a policeman in the front was leaning over his seat talking to people in the back merrily glanced at terrence cassidy he was on the edge of his seat above his jaw a muscle twitched the wealth of creative talent in our midst which makes ledwardine a unique centre of excellence an excellence which between now and september we plan throwing off our traditional herefordshire modesty quite shamelessly to show off mild laughter the passenger door of the police car opened and a policewoman got out moved to a rear door please god terrence whispered please later therell be concerts exhibitions morris dancing here on the square but first dermot said wed like to show off our very newest asset our minister our priestincharge the er god almighty merrily thought hes going to say the lovely the reverend merrily watkins behind the muted applause as she stood up merrily distinctly heard a wolf whistle and at least two young male voices combining in a low throaty ritual phwoaw as she moved towards the microphone her calves felt weak she saw the policewoman holding open the rear door of the police car thank you dermot merrily said into the mike the words slamming back from the twin speakers on the roof of a van parked in front of the black swan bit early to call me an asset my predecessor was here for over thirty years so i a woman merrily didnt recognize climbed out of the police car with a heavylooking black case under her arm at the same time di annie howe was emerging from the plain car followed by jane i jane was shouting at howe who was holding up both hands a policeman moved in behind jane merrily couldnt hear the shouting but she saw in a moment of rigid disbelief that janes face was pulsing with rage and tears have to go im sorry sorry orry the speakers snapped back as she stumbled away from the mike down the wooden steps as she pushed through the crowd she heard a man remark that if hed known the vicar was coming hed have worn a plastic mac annie howe said i should take your daughter inside ms watkins shes had a shock jane glared at her muttered cow right merrily pointed at the vicarage gates in now jane scowled and walked about ten yards to just inside the gates stood there defiant streaks down her face merrily said to howe youd better tell me there was an accident one of the traffic people will be along in due course to take a statement from jane accident howe said impatiently jane appears to have bummed a lift from a radio reporter whod discovered an aspect of our investigation we were not prepared to discuss on the way back they swerved to avoid a road accident which had already happened jane claimed to know the victim and became very distressed she was reluctant to leave the scene and we had to bring her back who was it not formally identified yet look i have to go i suggest that unless she has something specific to tell us you keep the child out of our hair look merrily said if one of my parishioners has been hurt in a car accident i want to know about it annie howe walking away told her who they understood it was and that she was dead merrily thought lol was going to collapse she made him sit down he sat at the kitchen table and stared at a white wall he didnt move around him the kitchen was black and white and grey janes eyes were smudges she was standing in the middle of the room pulling at her hair stop it flower please that apple jane sobbed the apple was lucy why didnt i realize that sit down jane this is she didnt want to know janes eyes were hot and flashing it was get traffic out here mumford we dont want the damned road blocked all afternoon i said do you know who this is for christs sake do you know who this is it was just another accident to her jane and shes cid not her problem they wouldnt let me stay i wanted to stay with her i wanted somebody she knew to be there when she woke up but she wasnt going to wake up merrily said gently was she look it was one of those freak accidents a sheep seems to have run out into the road and she hit it and came off her bike and hit her head on the road it must have been instantaneous she wouldnt have known a thing about it she was the apple jane said bleakly it was an old and withered apple i even told her about the apple i told her i told her about her own death she started to pull her hair again merrily walked over and pulled her hands down they stood there facing each other merrily clutching both janes hands this is no time merrily said for that superstitious crap and knew as soon as it was out janes expression curdling that this was about the worst thing she could have said demarcation merrily was on her knees with a plastic dustpan over the rubble of mugs jane had swept from the drainer she was very very sorry about lucy shed really liked lucy for her independence her forthright attitude her wonderful eccentricity but she could hear janes feet on the stairs big childish clomps the fact remained that the old woman had caused the kid to reinvent her life as a fairy tale the phone started ringing lol took over the dustpan ted clowess lawyervoice on the line the itsmyjobtoprotectyourinterestsbu tyouarentmakingiteasyforme voice the sound of another gulf fast widening you say youre well but you clearly arent far from it have to say merrily that what id very strongly advise as your churchwarden is that you permit me to revert to my original plan bring in norman gemmell to conduct tomorrows services ted no wait everything spinning away from her like the fragments of the mugs if youre talking about the opening ceremony just now the police brought jane back shed just seen the accident miss devenish she was distressed you see your daughter brought back in a police car in tears very tragic ted said his measured willreading voice but everyone said it was going to happen one day the way shed ride that thing in the middle of the road too old for it refused to wear a crash helmet and the local police too tolerant or scared of her more like to enforce the law ridiculous situation an accident waiting to happen sure didnt some people just love it when an accidentinwaiting finally came through she remembered ted in his quick guide to village characters telling her how youd find the famous moped on its side on some grassy verge and youd slam on your brakes only to discover miss devenish lying in a field on her back smiling contentedly at the sky a straw in her mouth and the way janes been hanging around her i did warn you about that dont get too close i think were my words yes thank you ted she felt like clubbing him with the phone i need to ask you are there any relatives in the parish none left alive i know of mccreadys her solicitor hell deal with all that no i meant oh forget it im trying to be down to earth merrily trying to rescue a runaway situation somebody has to situation you should never have gone out on that platform this afternoon here was i telling people youd contracted a stomach bug and now it starts to look like shall we say a nervous complaint oh a nervous complaint i see merrily i dont know what your personal problems are as you havent seen fit to come and talk to me about them but i do know that people are beginning to see you as a little too too he broke off the line throbbed with the unspoken hed seen the posters and god knew what else and one did have to think of ones own position in the community lucy devenish lol said cant die like this lucy devenish just did merrily said gently and theres nothing you or jane with due regard to superstitions and omens can do to alter that he stopped pacing from the market square came the merry wail and thump of an accordion band for the morris dancing not christian i suppose omens merrily shook out a cigarette you smoke lol i cant remember used to he took one his fingers twitching thanks thereve been shocks but this she could make you believe you werent abnormal you know everything has a rational explanation shed say just that most peoples idea of whats rational is severely limited especially the churchs maybe shes dead im alive wheres the divine logic there im supposed to know that being a priest i cant see you as a priest lol said i dont know why someone like you would want to be a priest lol she put her lighter to his cigarette is there something happening that its not been considered suitable for me to know about because of me being a priest i donthe looked apprehensive maybe there have certainly been things i dont understand she took a lungful of smoke breathed it out hard and that the church doesnt want to like like the house haunts me i hate it nothings been right since we moved in i have bad dreams the kind that make you wonder if they really are dreams what would poor lucy have said about that do you think if i hadnt been a priest he took a small selfconscious puff on the cigarette she once said to me that i was living too near the orchard meaning what well this was the village in the orchard the orchard was its lifeforce now thats all gone maybe the orchard isnt such a good place resentful they grows resentful merrily put the cigarette in the ashtray pushed it a couple of inches away im having too many of these if an apple had rolled right up to my feet from a tree full of blossom lol said id probably feel much like jane he looked at his cigarette as though it represented some aspect of his past he didnt really want to remember he put it out in the ashtray sorry wasteful you always been superstitious or paranoid is that the same thing like i was always influenced by this guy nick drake called the band after one of his songs hazey jane merrily started to sing it went wrong and gave up never quite figured what that song was about but she was obviously maladjusted cursing where she came from swearing at the night my stepbrother had his albums he was very appealing was nick drake but probably ill probably was lol said for a long time i was convinced i was going to die when i was twentysix like him and then i was twentyeight and i hadnt died and so i felt guilty and let down somehow that was when i went in for the second time the hospital sounds he smiled insane but these things get inside you and they get mixed up with everything else thats wrong and its like is it illness or is there something else alison thought itd be good for me moving out here fresh air simple life only lucy saw the problems everywhere has its own bag of superstition wherever i go it all seems to connect i remembered nicks song fruit tree which more or less says you dont make it till you die sometimes i had the feeling that nick and robert johnson and these guys were out there among the apple trees that make sense does it hell yes it does ill tell you what happened to make me do it if you like i mean join the clergy she undid her dog collar placed it on the table so that it surrounded the ashtray and the smoking cigarette the past unclouding the days when it all fell into place sean away in london for a week of meetings and on the second day there was this tentative visit from his anxious clerk with a briefcase full of grief and it was all laid out before her all the corrupting entrails the third day trying to lose the bad smell she took her shrieking headache on a long drive into the country in the illgotten volvo ending up at the unknown church of some saint with an obscure celtic name you could see the tower from a couple of miles away but it turned out to be a tiny little place reachable only by a track how could you put into words what happened in that bare little church what happened inside you that chose to happen there see for some time before this id been helping our local vicar decent guy but what a waste this man being a vicar collecting ten grand a year whatever it was then if you lived with sean everybody was rated according to their income hes a forty a year man whatever so ten grand a year and a regular congregation of nineteen what a loser merrily watched the smoke rising out of the white circle it was funny one of the things that occurred to me in that little church was nineteen thats a hell of a lot of lives and that was when i saw the blue and the gold ah the blue and the gold an inner vision hey watch it warning finger raised by dr david campbell youre in danger of crossing the demarcation line aw come on david arent i allowed one mystical experience if i dont talk about it too much the sense of a huge benevolence the awesome moment of cosmic awareness the dwindling of self in an exhilarating vastness of blue and gold anyway whatever it was she wound up with a halfdesperate cynicism it got rid of the headache you ever experience it again a trace an essence whenever i knelt to pray it would be there like a backcloth this velvet security blanket of deep blue and gold it kept me going and it isnt there now no merrily said it isnt now i dont quite remember when it stopped these past couple of weeks have seemed like about ten years you ever go back to that little church id be scared to she said frankly in case it was just a little grey empty building wow youre really getting everything here lol the full crisisoffaith bit she pulled the cigarette out of the ashtray out of the dog collar its ironic because i thought the way you do that i was being guided here like you maybe did you feel that no just alison alison wanted to come here and i was the guy who could afford to take on a mortgage nice place no special sense of destiny i thought there was then in a matter of weeks the whole edifice is developing cracks i dont know why that is something i did something i didnt do maybe women really arent strong enough for this job shit wash my mouth out was that why you were ill in church because i was feeling like a fraud that doesnt matter any more didnt you know theres now a whole bunch of ministers within the anglican church ready to tell you the virgin birth and the christmas story and the resurrection are all myths and god as we know him is just father christmas no i dont know why i was sick a lie because she couldnt talk about the worst of it that while her prayers had become flat and dead while she was getting no comfort no response no sense of resonance she was also becoming prey to cold visions from the other side of the demarcation line visions which began in dreams and finally made it finally got into the church superstition mental illness you know what occurred to me lol hesitated playing with the sleeve of his alien sweatshirt winding it like a tourniquet around his forefinger when you were on about the blue and gold go on i thought of janes room the ceiling see the night we brought jane out of the orchard she was rambling about little golden lanterns she was drunk i dont think she was i think she was heavy word coming up merrily can you handle this hit me enchanted she was enchanted everything that word says to you all the different meanings like elated like under a spell youre right merrily said thats a big word and what about you when you were in the little church that she said mockprimly was what we like to call a religious experience there you go somethings happened to jane and youre in denial about it because shes just a kid and youre an ordained minister lucy would say that was a fairly primitive attitude everything not connected with god must be yeah merrily said i get the message im sorry youve been really good to me and im insulting you listen im ok maybe what happened to jane and to you was just lucy no lol said she was a very persuasive woman it wasnt just lucy theres something else isnt there something you talked about to lucy devenish tried to he said cautiously you and lucy talked about my daughter and something that happened to her kind of all right she put up both hands im not accusing you of anything but it relates to what you told me before about the girls everything relates to that lol said but this was scary it was scary but nobody thought to tell me like you said i suppose it was because of what you are lucy said that when you were ready to hear this stuff youd go to her and now its too late for that merrily stood up so lets go and ask jane both of us oh yes i think so together in silence they walked up to the apartment they were nearing the top of the second staircase when the radio came on in the sitting roomstudy newstime on radio hereford and worcester the search for a herefordshire schoolgirl has been stepped up following the discovery of clothing in a ditch two miles from her home police say theyre now very concerned for the safety of colette cassidy who disappeared from her sixteenth birthday party in the village of ledwardine this report from bella ford bella ford said over a telephone line the items of clothing were found by a farmer about midday at kings oak corner between ledwardine and madley police have declined to say what exactly they were but confirm that theyve been identified by colettes parents as belonging to their daughter and probably worn by her when she disappeared oh god that means underwear merrily whispered or theyd be sure she was wearing them detective inspector annie howe whos leading the search for colette says they now have to be worried for her safety and are appealing to the public for any information it was around two oclock this morning when colette a student at the hereford cathedral school its him lol said it has to be elderly woman has died in a road accident you dont know that hang on lucy country lane near ledwardine the dead woman who was riding a moped has not yet been officially identified no other vehicles were involved they heard jane moan you dont know you dont know anything meanwhile a man who died when his car left the hereford to abergavenny road and smashed into a stone wall at wormbridge late last night has been identified as anthony karl windling from abingdon near oxford theres been a mixed reaction to the news that fifty thousand pounds of national lottery money is to go to the radio went off merrily turned to find lol sitting on the stairs she looked up to see jane in the doorway of the sitting roomstudy nobody spoke the little golden lights lol looked up at her from his stair like one of those small dogs that quivered he was still institutionalized merrily thought looking with lucy gone for someone else to administer the drug of reassurance mutely asking what he was supposed to feel wheres wormbridge he said at last its a place you pass through when youre heading for abergavenny and the m so he was leaving he must have been very drunk she said thats the usual reason cars go out of control when no other vehicles are involved yes he shook his head slowly like a boxer coming up after being knocked to his knees only to be told that he might still win on points some part of him trying to equate the random meaningless deaths of his mentor and his tormentor within the same twentyfour hours both in road accidents with nobody else involved punchdrunk not sure what any of it meant so colette ruled out lol according to that report he died last night when she was still at the party they never met its all a bitterly ironic coincidence ive been there she wanted to say sensing sean moving towards her across bare bedroom floorboards smiling through his fatal injuries ive been exactly there feeling in one of those spinning crystal moments that they must both be part of the same bizarre pattern and then turning she saw jane looking down at them in manifest bewilderment from the doorway of the sitting room study her face was white and blotched her usually sleek dark hair like knotted string she said mum will you come in please they clung together for a long time janes hot wet sticky face against merrilys under the blue and gold ceiling janes body shuddering as the accordion was wheezing up from the market square and merrily found she was crying too for miss devenish and sean and even the wretched windling united in roaddeath crying for colette and the suffering cassidys and other sufferings known and unknown and lol and all his wasted years and all those senseless wasted days for jane and her hiding from each other behind screens of divisive superstition from the square came a chattering of polite muted applause jane broke away and stood in the centre of the room as if unsure where she was she swallowed merrily looked around the cheap stereo and its whitecased speakers sat on bare boards there was also the old couch the kid had insisted on having in her bedroom in liverpool even though you had to climb over one of its arms to get to the bed there were paperbacks in piles there was edwin the teddy oneeared and balding familiar items but the blue of the timberframed walls and ceiling made the room dark and mystical like a grotto in a wood the yellowwhite lights were out of an overthetop starry night by van gogh lucy said jane sniffed and straightened up she told me to like paint it out of my head to externalize it she told you to paint all this she gave me this book of hers to read the little green orchard and this kid in the book did that she was afraid of the orchard until she brought it home in her head and did drawings and that gave her not control exactly but like a stake in the orchard a connection id already told lucy about the mondrian walls idea so this is what you saw in the orchard the night you the night colette dragged me into the orchard and she was trying to scare me saying the ghost of edgar powell had been seen by the tree where he shot himself but when i looked up instead of seeing something horrible and grisly it was jane looked up to the ceiling it was beautiful merrily said yeah i was floating it was awesome and warm dreamy it was like outside time and all these little lights moving about among the branches and they were like like they had existence life you felt they were responding to your moods needs lucy said it was kind of reaching out to me the spirit of the orchard why couldnt you tell me about it you need to ask that merrily remembered her anger at the absence of headache queasy tummy morningafter contrition lucy devenishs explanation about the cider and the orchard like curing like natural holistic medicine crawl into the centre of the orb and curl up let nature do the rest wouldnt work for everyone the orchards a risky place an entity in itself a sphere and this is a very old orchard so it tells you or rather it tells me something about your daughter all that evening jane said id had this kind of a sense of coming home first it was colette she just like appeared in the black swan and we clicked and that was great but when i looked up in the orchard i was on my own again and it was like a different kind of bonding with i dont know i still dont know something beyond everything merrily said clumsily she must have felt excluded jane said that was the problem colette yeah she felt that was why she tried to lead them all into the orchard at the party she wanted to i dont know reestablish control inspector howe said she was shouting jane knows like it was a secret we had between us but there wasnt its not something you can share she didnt know anything about it she was going in mobhanded trampling on everything she was going to cause offence what merrily stiffened going to cause offence miss devenish on the night of the wassailing nose twitching in disdain cant anyone see that deep offence merrily said offence to whom the watchers jane said the watchers in in the little green orchard merrily tensed who are the watchers jane janes mouth opened but the words wouldnt come she saw lol standing shyly in the doorway poor karl windling she said but you must be awfully glad it was all very strange and cathartic merrily and jane sat on the old sofa lol walked around and they talked about levels of existence and the lifeforce in nature the lucy devenish memorial discussion so how does the apple tree man come into this merrily said i thought he represented the spirit of the orchard oh no said jane you havent been listening lucy said that was wrong that wasnt local folklore she said different places grew their own customs and beliefs according to what was needed she said wil williams knew the reality of it because he was so psychic and all that about him being seen dancing with sprites that probably had a basis in fact because when he was in the orchard the spirits would show themselves to him she and lol explained about the pharisees reds how when the old farmers found out they had an exceptional cider apple that was different to the ones growing anywhere else they thought it was a gift from the spirits of the orchard or the angels jane said lucy said that in the seventeenth century if you said too much about fairies youd wind up well like wil williams oh merrily sank into the old sofa i see the wine of angels barry bloom said that was lucys idea she wasnt happy about it though mum she wasnt happy about the way the orchard had been let go and now its all started coming back after the wassailing and old edgar shooting himself lucy thought things were coming to a head lol said and when jane oh shit this is really difficult down in the house the phone was ringing jane exchanged a glance with lol ill get it she said lol said she was just there one second there was blossom on the ground lots of it and the next jane was there kind of enshrouded in it i dont know where she came from i dont know how long shed been there and what had you taken merrily said coldly lol sighed im sorry she spread her hands on her lap and looked down at them that was the scary thing right the thing you discussed with miss devenish if there was anything calculated to scare you it would be the appearance of a fifteenyearold girl lying on her back wearing a school uniform and apple blossom could she have been there all the time and you just didnt see her until you were close up i dont know its possible she had on this white school blouse when she sat up it was covered with petals she sat up just like shed been asleep sunbathing except there was no sun i took her right back to the cottage and phoned lucy she could have been there all day thats what youre saying since she failed to get on the school bus i dont know lucy said it sometimes happened though not as often as you might imagine from all the folk tales she said a day was nothing sometimes it could be a year before people came back although it only felt like a few moments and sometimes it felt like years but it was only a few moments she showed me stuff in books he looked sick you see why i was reluctant to tell you this you imagine me telling the cops dont even contemplate it merrily placed a cigarette on the arm of the sofa searched around for her zippo its like these alien abductions was it a dream was it hallucination you want me to believe that in some way the orchard took her that jane has or thinks she has in some way been possessed by the orchard which is itself an entity a sentient thing and that its now taken colette maybe lol shook his head in defeat which merrily said i suppose could hardly be dismissed as entirely incredible by someone whose profession implies she believes a dead man appeared to his mates displaying his crucifixion scars right lol shrugged except merrily located her lighter in a cuff of her sweater that this is paganism i suppose it must be it really is lol it makes me want to reach for my big cross mum jane said from the doorway its some solicitor in hereford called mcgreedy so you told her you told her her daughter had been spirited away something like that she scoff no but that doesnt mean she believed it though youre going to have to be patient with her supportive as they say thats what lucy said jane pulled the teddy bear on to her knees she said mum was the catalyst im not sure what that means means shes the one whos going to make things happen shes the one we could wait for ever what for what do you expect to happen what happened to you where did you go did you just fall asleep or what its a blank i mean maybe theres some part of my subconscious that remembers being prodded about by little green men or whatever but it must be well buried suppose thats what happened to colette what can we do about that suppose because she wasnt respectful shes been received less kindly lol was allowing himself to wonder whether they were really having this conversation or whether he himself had been abducted slipped back into the hospital back on to the medication when merrily returned a little out of breath from all the stairs her forehead furrowed this your doing flower lol relaxed for the first time in nearly two decades in the company of a teenage girl let himself think how very pretty her mother was that was a lawyer called harold mccready he is lucy devenishs lawyer he says she went to his office a couple of days ago to add a codicil to her will appointing an extra executor as though she knew she hadnt long to live mccready said a folksy country lawyer seen it before he said people often know even when theyre not ill jane sat up whats an executor someone responsible for seeing that the wishes of the deceased are carried out to the letter normally just a formality somehow i suspect this is going to be more complicated why because its me flower things get stranger why would she do that someone whos had so little to do with her its weird im supposed to look over her possessions for any indications of her last wishes as vague as that theres a clerk from mccreadys office driving over with a key to her house have either of you ever been in there just the shop jane said mum you have to take this very very seriously she said you might get cold feet and want to leave because of what happened in the church and stuff she said you mustnt she also said you should change your mind about not letting that play go on in the church she said flower im just a kid jane said does executor mean the same as catalyst dancing gates disastrous dermot child said into the early evening stillness totally disastrous by the end of the afternoon it was fairly conclusive about three dozen genuine ones the rest were rubberneckers hoping for a body bag when the police cars dwindled to one they took themselves off home he stood on the corner of church street looking out to the square where the last stallholder was packing up spreading stains of armpit sweat on his polo shirt uncomfortably reminiscent for merrily of the menacing dreamdermot the bloody press too not an arts journalist among them ten people went into the exhibition none of them bought a thing thirty tickets sold for the string quartet is it even worth it come and have a drink merrily do your understandingvicar bit tell me youll offer a prayer for the festival priestincharge merrily said dully lack of sleep was already corroding her resolve the last thing she needed was a cosy drink with dermot child understandingpriestincharge im sorry i cant dermot i have an appointment ill try and make it to the concert perhaps its telling us something controversy certainly attracts attention but this was the wrong kind of controversy pulls in the wrong element the gossiping classes as distinct from the chattering classes he smiled clearly the morris dancers were a mistake terrences idea falls between two stools the cultured consider it quaint but a little simplistic the working class find it more than a bit of a yawn terrence is all for harmless tradition i think we need to be a touch more avantgarde like your old cider thing ah his eyes went to sly slits and he tapped his nose you havent seen that yet merrily and neither has terrence thank god it might seem tame but what you have is this very male celebration of fecundity fascinating merrily said im sorry i do have to go approached it the wrong way at first you see i was looking for singers when i shouldve been seeking out untamed virility chaps who with a little training can learn to sing not from the throat not from the stomach but from the ah loins yes merrily said dermot talking dirty only made her feel more exhausted well good luck with tonight im sure youll get lots of people turning up on spec she walked across the street but carried on down past miss devenishs house not wanting him to know where she was going at the junction with old barn lane she turned and he was gone she walked back to lucys terraced black and white taking out the key as she pushed it into the lock beside the goblin knocker a gruff and loaded male chorus sang in her head auld ciderrrrrrrrrr dermots choral work was going to be a kind of aural hardon she shuddered she was several feet into lucys living room when the door twitched shut behind her she started and turned her head but no one was there the silence in fact was almost companionable and she understood that she was more afraid of dermot child having crept in behind her than she was of lucys ghost would almost have welcomed the jolly ponchoed apparition to advise her for a start on what the hell she was supposed to be doing in here the muted evening light was a soft presence in the single small window leaded and lacecurtained but not in the room which was well into its own dusk merrily went back to the door and found a light switch an old metal one like a pewter pip it activated two victorian bracket lamps over an ornate ebony desk which sat under the window and dominated the room like an altar the beams above it were stained as black as the exterior timbers there was a rigidlooking armchair and a victorian chaise longue all four walls were halfpanelled to waist level whitepainted above between glassfronted bookcases there was a single etching two victorian fairies elegantly poolpeering in a thin black frame and some framed photographs merrily stood for a moment hands by her sides trying for quietness inside receptivity the solicitors clerk from mccreadys office had arrived on a red honda motorbike just before six handing her a brown envelope containing only the frontdoor key and a smaller one no instructions no advice jane had wanted to come across with her but shed felt that would be wrong this apparently was between miss devenish and her although it would have been useful having lol in here the person whod known her best of late but who dare not be seen on the streets she was still reluctant to touch anything without at least a sensation of having permission it was all so tidy as though lucy devenish had actually walked out of here this morning under a premonition that she might not be returning merrily folded her arms what do you want me to do lucy it didnt seem foolish to ask aloud shed always had the slightly unorthodox idea that the dead were not fully gone until after the funeral service sometimes shed look at the coffin in the church and sense a relief a gratefulness emanating from it occasionally a sense of indignation what do you want me to know nothing happened the lights did not go out no batwinged hooknosed spectre peeled itself from the panelling neither did she feel anything nor hear any inner voice she went to look at the photographs on the walls one in blurry black and white showed a much younger bushyhaired lucy in a summer dress sitting on a bench a young smiling man in cricketing clothes was leaning over the back of the bench hands on her shoulders lucy wore a sad halfsmile as though she knew it wouldnt come to anything in another picture a shorter haired middleaged lucy trousers rolled into riding boots held out a feed bucket for a piebald pony while a younger woman looked on she looked curiously familiar sister close friend merrily peered into the bookcases without opening the doors there was a surprising number of volumes on english and welsh history from the old popular favourites like arthur mee to modern classics like john daviess history of wales and more specialist keith thomass religion and the decline of magic with the slump in congregations and the growth of new age cults somebody should have written one called magic and the decline of religion someone like lucy perhaps she turned back to the desk there was a box on it a victorian writing box which should open out into a small sloping desksurface merrily saw that both bracket lamps had been angled to focus on it pooling it in light spooky she said aloud to show to herself that she wasnt spooked by this not at all good heavens no from the pocket of her denim skirt she brought out the second key a little brass key the box had a brass escutcheon over its keyhole the key fitted of course the lock glided open with a discreet pock eerie she made no immediate move to lift the lid remembering the story of joanna southcotts box which could only be opened in the presence of about a dozen bishops and never had been because most bishops were too lofty or politically sensitive even to consider it she wondered if she should say a small prayer this was it lol picked up the hefty lapridge press paperback of ella mary leathers the folklore of herefordshire this was all there was inside lucys bible careful there are markers folded bits of paper had been placed between pages at intervals some had scrawled notes on them when lol put the book on the kitchen table it fell open at once to the section on wassailing the old girl had quoted on twelfth night im at a loss merrily sat down with a bump i liked her i want to honour her last wishes im trying to feel flattered that she chose me as the instrument but you know what are we looking for and in what context jane perched on a corner of the table its obvious that we have to work it out for ourselves because if she just wrote it down in black and white we or you especially would be able to say like yeah yeah very interesting but the old boot was completely out of it but if you have to spend some time working it out youll see the reasoning behind it merrily yawned can we look at this tomorrow mum its important its vital sure but vital how vital to what vital to lucy jane dropped her feet to the flagstones isnt that enough for you its enough for me and lol merrily smiled wearily ok youre right we have a duty i have a duty no idea where to start of course she plucked out one of the paper bookmarks keeping her thumb in the place hannah snell she read from the paper thats all it says whats that mean mum we can find out you can find out anything if you put your mind to it sure she pushed both hands through her hair therere a few more obvious references to cider and apples and this looks like a photocopy of a page from some other book stuffed in here something about oxford university cant think what that connects to theres a page marked here lots of heavy underlining fairies again it seemed to be a story told to mrs leather by an unnamed woman who got it from her mother who said it had happened to her first cousin and she remembered it well the cousin a girl about eighteen was very fond of dancing she insisted on going to all the balls for miles around wherever there was dancing going on there was she her people told her something would happen to her some day and one night when she was coming home just by the dancing gates near kington she heard beautiful music it was the music of the fairies and she was caught into the ring search was made for her and she appeared to her friends from time to time but when they spoke to her she immediately disappeared her mother was told probably by the wise man or woman that if seen again she must be very quickly seized without speaking or she would never come back so one day a year after her disappearance her mother saw her and took hold of her dress before she could escape why mother she said where have you been since yesterday merrily looked up at jane now leaning over her other shoulder i know what youre going to say this girls a nineteenthcentury colette but i see no mention in this curious precedent of clothing found several miles away do you whats this written inside the back cover young alison with a question mark its not an uncommon name merrily said but alison kinnersley did go to see lucy this morning alison did lol came over this morning early just after id left the country kitchen she asked me which was lucys house and i directed her i wondered at the time why she wanted to see her that early did they know each other not that i know of young alison its just a pencil scrawl but mum what if this was the last thing she wrote before she went out on her moped the last thing she ever wrote well we arent ever going to know that are we flower the phone rang jane walked over to answer it you in or what depends who it is ill leave it to your judgement i might be having a bath right im very confused merrily said to lol im not happy and whos that jane said into the phone oh right well no actually im her daughter but if you tell me what its about i might be able to find her jane listened expressionless for over a minute really she said flatly and who told you that she smiled no i didnt think you would hang on give me a couple of minutes ill wander over the vicarage see if shes around she inspected the receiver and then put it down on the window ledge and signalled to merrily to follow her into the passage guy from the sunday times in london apparently somebodys rung to tell them theres a row developed over you refusing to let coffey do his play in the church looks like your chance to back off before they crucify you as a philistine damn you want to buy some time how about if i tell them youre out at a string quartet recital and then youre going on to a fashionable village cocktail party and then they print it anyway and say i was unavailable for comment sod it merrily went back into the kitchen snatched up the phone hello merrily watkins mrs watkins hi so sorry to bother you in the evening craig jamieson at the sunday times newspaper im just checking sure to be honest i cant imagine why anyone should want to cause mischief by telling you complete lies about an issue on which no decisions yet been announced one way or the other really that is puzzling isnt it mrs watkins craig jamieson sounded about seventeen but merrily supposed he must be at least a phd to be a hack on the sunday times you see ive spoken to richard coffey and he told me he wouldnt be in the least surprised to find that youd turned against the play because of all the pressure youd been under pressure craig jamieson chuckled i gather certain wellestablished families are feeling threatened look i dont want to be cagey but whoever told you this is going way over the top theres been no row have you spoken to the member of the wellestablished family i was going to see what you had to say first well im sure that if you spoke to him hed tell you he was right behind the play good heavens when someone as distinguished as richard coffey wants to put your obscure little community on the literary map you dont throw it back in his face do you god forgive me there was a pause then craig jamieson said so youre going to let them do the play in your church i look i cant just tell you that can i when nothings been officially decided yet i mean theres you know what the church is like theres protocol i havent even talked it over with the bishop yet he has to give his permission does he thats the bishop of hereford right its just its protocol you know im sorry but theres really no story you know im sure youre right said craig jamieson blandly coffey merrily thought this is coffey he wants to force the issue perhaps it was time to call his bluff replacing the phone she saw lols fist connecting with the table he was staring down at the scrawl in mrs leathers book young alison he said young alison wils play in a corner of the bar at the swan gomer parry sniffed suspiciously into his poncy glass not that he was any kind of connoisseur see but there was something stop that minnie hissed down his ear its not french wine you know youll be showing us up ent right somehow gomer shuffled uncomfortably inside what hed always thought of as his layingout suit nothing wrong with it like but it ent right the rubbish you talk gomer cant you just drink it there was a free glass of the socalled wine of angels for everybody attending the string quartet concert recital minnie kept stressing i think its a recital gomer served in thin champagne glasses bottles of the stuff with the picture of the church on the label were set out on a special table emrys the wine waiter doing the honours to make everybody think this was a real privilege like fermented in the bottle he kept telling the arty buggers from off whose land rover discoveries were clogging up the market place not that there was many of them but a few of that sort went a long way in gomers view on account of the tickets not going as well as theyd figured dermot childs festival flunkeys had been doing the rounds offering halfprice seats to locals and finally fetching up at gomer and minnies bungalow the bastards oughter be called off i reckon in respect of poor lucy gomer had mumbled but minnie had shelled out for the tickets straight off though neither of fhemd know a string quartet from a dustcart crew there were other people you wouldnt expect to see at this kind of do brenda prosser from the eight till late shop and bernard and norma putley from the garage putting a brave face on it spite of their boy being grilled by the law over drugs oh and bulldavies with his blonde floozie no sign of the vicar mind gomer was worried about that little lady needed friends she did and all that was happening was folk getting turned against her too many mischiefmakers life was boring in the country now for folk born and raised locally no jobs worth getting up for less they moved away the telly always showing them what they were missing the sun telling them they ought to be having dynamite sex twice a night and different partners at weekends drug dealers showing enterprising youngsters like mark putley how they could earn enough for a smart motorbike and no characters any more gomer fiddled in a pocket of his stiff blue jacket for a cigarette he darent bring out no characters now poor lucy was gone all gloss and no soul the string quartet was made up of professional musicians from london with weekend cottages hereabouts and the socalled wine of angels even that had no character all this talk about the pharisees red and it tasted like supermarket cider whatever the old recipe was the powells had lost it ent right gomer mumbled following minnie into the big dining room done out as a concert hall artificial that was the word whole village was artificial nowadays but the cider that needed checking out here for the concert reverend asked the fiftysomething man at the hand dryer bankmanager type yes i er im staying with friends in hereford try and project your voice more always sound confident i gather the queens arms quartet are building up quite a reputation yes indeed the bank manager said i believe they are well enjoy it as the toilet door wheezed into place the face of sandy locke came up in the mirror the reverend sandy locke whose parish was in hampshire who was spending a couple of weeks with some old college friends in the cathedral city and who this evening was indulging his fondness for chamber music in the mirror the rev sandy locke produced a surprisingly encouraging smile it scared him how plausible he looked how confident how relaxed he actually wouldnt have recognized himself a natural vicars face merrily had told him kind of fresh and innocent god forbid the ponytail had had to go it was quite reasonable for a vicar to have long hair these days merrily said but in ledwardine it would make some people look again jane had cut his hair finishing off with nail scissors so that it looked neat and groomed merrily had produced the black jacket and black cord jeans the black tshirt thing and the dog collar all out of her own wardrobe everything was very tight the jacket buttoned the wrong way but it wouldnt button anyway he froze momentarily when on leaving the gents he brushed against a woman who turned out to be detective inspector annie howe severely youthful in her business suit howe glanced at him and they both smiled and he was terrified but howe moved on and that was the clincher the rev sandy locke bore no resemblance to the police picture of the young lol robinson sex offender he went to the bar he ordered a perrier carried it over to the window and stood there and watched the beautiful alison kinnersley in a lowcut winecoloured velvet dress he didnt recognize flashing smiles across a table at her lover and he felt no longing where hed thought hed be feeling ridiculous in fact he felt controlled it was a strange and powerful sensation everything now tightly wrapped around this deep and focused curiosity wild exhilarating and in the garb of a church minister entirely and ironically unexpected he stood there by the long floral curtains the opulent scene before him glimmering with artificial candlelight from the oakpillared walls and he looked at alison kinnersley as though he was seeing her for the first time and saw that she was focused too every smile she flung at bulldavies had a weight of history behind it or was he imagining that because of what he now knew he went on looking at alison kinnersley whose name just happened to be the name of a straggling village in north herefordshire which you might pick off a map and think how solid and convincing it would sound as a surname he went on looking at alison kinnersley but he thought about the reverend merrily watkins look shed held the dog collar to his throat itll work this is the only way itll work shed seemed exhilarated by it fussing around attending to details she was very lovely he only wished she hadnt seen lol robinson at his most pathetic alison and bulldavies finished their drinks together and stood up together and walked together through a double doorway under a sign saying dining room in his strange controlled way the rev sandy locke followed them where lol robinson would have hung around outside in the bar hoping shed need to go to the toilet the rev sandy locke would take the seat right next to alison controlled jesus could it possibly last you are happy to discuss this in front of your little daughter richard coffey said he wore a black leather waistcoat over a grandad vest a rather good plaster facsimile of michelangelos david flaunted itself on a plinth beside his chair on the flockpapered walls were some artfully lit but fairly blatant black and white photos of naked men if theres anything i dont understand merrily said im sure she can explain it to me on the way home coffey didnt smile the truth was she hadnt been prepared to leave the kid alone in the vicarage you might be able to lock ethel the cat in the kitchen but jane disappeared too easily these days jane sat on a cushion on a stone arm of the fireplace and gazed at stefan alder who shared the sofa with coffey still young enough to think it just needed the right woman to come along to straighten him out merrilys view looking at coffeys bare steely hawsered arms and his patchwork face inclined more towards the right younger man but to business reason i wanted to see you mr coffey was the telephone call i had from the sunday times ah coffey leaned an arm along the back of the sofa behind stefan dear craig i presumed he got his initial information from you coffey scowled he did not the light in the lodges cubical sitting room was fading and dusty the room was furnished with reproduction statuary and thousands of books no tv only a small portable stereo nothing valuable because the house was left empty for long periods coffey had explained and who wanted to steal books not that their despicable neighbour bulldavies would do anything to stop them if youre looking for craigs informant coffey said i suggest you look no further than the festival committee and i suspect that under the present circumstances one can rule out the unfortunate cassidy merrily sat up even straighter than her pine shakerstyle chair demanded you mean child controversy certainly attracts attention dermot had said bemoaning the poor attendance in real terms on day one but this was the wrong kind of controversy coffey pursed his thin lips and raised his tightly plucked eyebrows and said nothing for a quick blast of publicity for the festival it made sense if the festival flopped now that dermot was in charge after his frequent disparaging of terrence cassidy thered be enough egg on his face to whip up mayonnaise coffey leaned his head on his arm merrily as i think i told you im a thorough sort of chap and i dont do business with unknowns i had them all checked out with particular reference to precisely what they were doing before they came to ledwardine or came back in childs case cassidy small beer a polytechnic poseur who inherited his fathers house and decided on a new start child hmm well stefan calls him the goblin dont you steffie goblins being the entities that enter your house at night and mess up your possessions stefan said hed looked quite pleased to see them when he first opened the door as though there was tension between coffey and him hes a failure basically coffey said started out as a music teacher at some comprehensive school then decided his talents were worth more worked with an earlymusic ensemble and composed in the loosest sense the music for a television costume drama which was so awful they screened it around midnight been trading on it ever since with diminishing returns childs a loser but a rather poor loser im afraid stefan said a poisonous loser mans so embittered he doesnt care who goes down so if youre looking for the designer if not the actual distributor of for example certain posters branding you a person of satanic bent you might begin by checking out the equipment at the festival office merrily was shocked i cant believe that of course you cant hes a charming little man jane said posters juvenile trivia flower only dean wall and gittoes and those hairballs were coming out with all that satanism stuff at colettes party who said coffey just some yobs from janes school ah well schoolboys can be terribly useful coffey said with a certain insouciance they always need money and it doesnt have to be a great deal stefan glared at him but why would he merrily said what have i ever done to him i really wouldnt know perhaps not enough who can say christ merrily said she couldnt look at any of them and stared out of the window across a few semiwooded fields to the village between the lodges victorian gothic mullions smudges of evening cloud had blunted the church steeple after no more than about seventyfive minutes the queens arms quartet were showing signs of strain and the tubby beaming guy dermot child arose to lead a standing ovation seriously undeserved lol thought having detected more than a few bum notes still it was at this moment when they all stood up with an assortment of creaks from an assortment of chairs that alison glanced for the first time directly to her left and met the eyes of the rev sandy locke it was worth it for a second her face was frozen tight before it imploded into a gasp another first maybe the gasp was even a tiny scream but it was lost among the spurious applause like a leaf in a gale lol clapped harder so that he swayed against alison he put his cheek next to hers and in his jolly vicar voice he said alison young as i live and breathe stefan alder began to look excited leaned eagerly towards merrily so what are you proposing it was quite dark now but coffey had not put on a lamp i dont quite know merrily said it all seems to go deeper than i can say or you i suspect it couldnt go any deeper with me stefan said and coffey frowned in the village i meant merrily thought of her afternoon with lucy whod said she wanted the play to go on in the church so that the truth would come out when the ditchwaters are stirred the turds often surface i think i want whatevers bubbling under there to come to the surface is that what you want its all i want stefan said humbly without even a glance at coffey what i dont want though merrily said and what i dont think the village deserves is for it to happen in the middle of a media circus i dont want a sideways glance at coffey to play dermots game coffey said from the shadows dont try to be clever mrs watkins spell it out all right she looked down to the village where lights were coming on i heard stefan and your friends martin and mira discussing the idea of involving the community in the drama by having a few local people virtually take on the roles of their ancestors so youd have wil williams defending himself from the pulpit explaining his situation and perhaps some reaction whether its surprise or dismay or sympathy whod play thomas bull wed have an actor coffey said guardedly i even considered doing it myself merrily said before she could stop herself you do like to live dangerously dont you a cold silence from coffeys corner we would hardly expect bulldavies to be there stefan said dont underestimate him and dont underestimate me mrs watkins richard coffey inclined his head to her dont push me too hard there are other churches theres even a cathedral no stefan cried merrily raised a palm im not pushing anybody im just suggesting that if you want the local people on your side and no embarrassing interruptions then you might like to try a private runthrough with a private local audience unpublicized word of mouth i can guarantee an audience and child would guarantee a television crew or two i think not merrily said icily and when were you thinking we might do this tomorrow night she heard jane gasp two or three seconds of incredulous silence followed before coffeys forced laughter and merrily interrupting it why not its all written isnt it stefans well into the role mrs watkins your ignorance of the demands of a theatrical production i find but were not talking about a theatrical production were talking about i dont know what we re talking about a confrontation a dialogue a dialogue with the past the village facing up to its most shameful episode seeking redemption looking into its own soul and groping for the truth after three centuries of ignorance trying to find the light the beginnings of a pretty soliloquy said coffey who would you play mrs watkins i understand what youre worried about youre afraid of a shambles of word getting out that it was a disaster maybe dermot child shafting you well all right i can buy that but this would be a village thing the sort of thing churches were intended for she might be right stefan alder was on his feet his back to the window looking out over the lights of ledwardine we know everything about the village he said to merrily weve a great thick file of information richard paid a chap who used to work for the local paper to collect stories and memories from local people shut up steffie this chap was marvellous he hung out in the ox and places he talked to a meeting of the wi they all thought he was collecting information for one of those local history books nobody knew it was for us we can use all that well surprise everybody with how much we know how much a part of this village weve become in such a short time shes right richard we can bond with these people we can win them over prove beyond all doubt that were the right people to do this to tell the truth she might very well be right steffie but what shes suggesting is utterly impossible why tomorrow night anyway why not in a couple of months time when we know where were going with this because i dont know where im going with it mr coffey it keeps coming up in front of me i keep telling myself its only a bloody play but it isnt stefan said its a public redemption yes whatever anyway those are my terms you want to do it somewhere else you go ahead you know my number merrily stood up come on jane all right stefan alder turned towards them a shadow even his ashblond hair black against the bluegrey window well do it well do it tomorrow night bring who you want fill the church stefan dont be a bloody fool coffey sprang up his face pulsing leave us mrs watkins sure flower jane crept quietly away from the empty hearth they let themselves out in the dark room behind them they heard richard coffey snarl you stupid little shit its my play ill see hes there stefan called after them his voice high and tremulously theatrical ill have him there its my play not you stefan sang out with stinging contempt wil its wils play winding sheet mum drove them slowly home in the volvo with the hazey jane album playing quite loudly on the cd a signal she didnt want to talk maybe this was just as well jane was thinking shed only have said something really crass about mum coming on at last like an actual catalyst it was like lucy was in the back seat and what was so crazy about that jane looked out of the side window as they came into the village as if she might spot the lamp of the moped bobbing into the market place a little golden light what had they done with lucys moped probably being examined by some police mechanical expert whod say the brakes were crap or something and the little bike was a death trap and why wasnt she wearing a helmet because it wouldnt fit over her big hat you cretins you want lucy devenish to go out without her hat there was life after death there had to be or there was no justice no justice for good people like lucy who nobody could replace something had died with lucy a spirit it was megadepressing she glanced at mums profile the dark curls in need of a cut run with this vicar dont let her down and then thought about colette where was she tonight its like somebody cuts out a section of time and joins the ends together second to second like with the dancing girl in mrs leather maybe colette will be visible occasionally in the little green orchard the thought wasnt scary it was hopeful it had been there on the back burner since she first read that story if colette was there somebody should try and reach her the market place was still full of cars but at barely ten people were already dribbling out of the black swan under the hanging lanterns not much of a gig then she wondered how lol was getting on it had just been so much fun making him look like a vicar like traditional country vicars were supposed to look kind of weedy and innocent in the end he looked much more like one than mum but then mum never really had before they left for coffeys place mum had told her the whole story about lol and karl windling and the young girls in the hotel which shed found so awful and so barely credible that she wanted to go and find these girls and their smug parents and tell them just what theyd done as for that bastard windling on the cd lol was singing the low breathy voice solo with acoustic guitar about being alone in the city in a cold january rain but not wanting to go home it made such horrifying sense it made her want to cry it made her wish she was old enough to marry him or something a police car rolled out of church street the awful howe would be hoping now like bella that colette was dead turning it into a big case for an area like this dreaming of picking up lol and shoving him into a little greywalled room like on the bill her and that mumford asking him kind of nonchalantly what hed done with the body telling him they just wanted to help him that was what the police always did they told you they just wanted to help you but they were just in it for themselves like everybody was except mum suppose theyve got him she said as they pulled into the vicarage drive if theyd got him mum said calmly switching off the engine and the stereo i think theyd be waiting for us too i dont see anybody do you lol wouldnt finger us no mum said i dont think he would inside the vicarage she seemed to collapse no sleep not much food for over a day running on empty for too long she was trying to open a can of sardines for ethel but the metal key thing snapped and she just stood there in the kitchen and started to weep somehow the vicarage did this to her the vastness of it the emptiness was far worse for mum than it was for jane who still thought a big house was cool not as if it was haunted or anything it just seemed to do mums brain in shed been dynamite at the upper hall lodge pushing even the scary coffey into a corner getting what she wanted and now here she was sobbing her heart out in her own kitchen and jane just knew she was thinking about dad and what a balls theyd made of their marriage and everything and how stupid shed been to think she could manage a parish and all the other stuff that came down on you when were exhausted in a place you hated go to bed mum please go to bed ill look after everything i cant what about lol ill wait up for him please go to bed mum wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her jumper sorry youre overtired jane eased the sardine can out of her hands i gave him a key mum said didnt i i think you did dont worry sleep mum looked at her just about finding the energy for suspicion ill go up too jane assured her i wont go out again i promise not tonight anyway got to prepare got to get it right there was a lounge for residents only with a tv set tuned to a film about surfing with the sound down a waitress served cocoa to two elderly couples at a window table lol took a seat by the door one of the elderly ladies smiled at him and lol said good evening in his soft but resonant vicars voice and sat composed his fingers loosely entwined she would come shed directed him here smiling and nodding pleasantly for the thirty seconds shed been speaking to the rev locke smiling for the benefit of james bulldavies whod been getting drinks at the time an actress every move she made powered by this lowburning highoctane fury he saw that now the rev sandy locke one step removed from it all seemed able to see so many things concealed from screwedup introverted lol robinson two eggs one of the elderly men said bacon sausage liver onions black pudding chips nine ninetyfive he sat back triumphant inclusive of sweet the toilets werent clean though his wife said at least the toilets are clean here and whats more what i always think is important in a hotel she broke off as alison glided in both elderly ladies looking rather shocked when this blonde in the revealing dress went to sit next to the clergyman the old men looking pleased hi lol smiled where did you tell him you were going powder my nose evidently i bumped into someone i knew in the ladies you know what women are like im kind of learning lol said at last hell find someones ear to bend wont notice im missing for a while as to that alison gestured at his dog collar im not going to ask a drink no time so you talk lol said and ill listen i wont interrupt he felt like he was hovering very steadily everything delicately balanced but for the first time in his adult life he was keeping the balance alison shook her hair back i suppose devenish told you god rest her heathen soul no it was insight from you he grinned she couldnt touch him tonight he lowered his voice he took this great leap in the dark i cant help wondering what james would say if he knew hed been fucking his what halfsister she remained entirely calm you going to tell him jesus its right probably not he said in the darkness of her toobig bedroom merrily knelt to pray by her toobig bed i er i dont know what im asking for strength certainly yeah im not strong but you know that she went quiet receptive opening up a space in her heart wanting very much to receive something if it was only an upsurge of blessed scepticism she didnt want to believe in bloody ghosts and fairies in the silence there was no sense of blue or gold was that itself a sign was the lack of response the sense of praying into a black void an indication that she should harden herself against phoney mysticism spurious superstition she felt distantly angry at god for never giving it to you straight of course it was lol himself whod pointed her at lucy mentioning when alison had talked about the bulldavies tradition of keeping horses that jamess old man seemed to have carried on the equine tradition purely for a steady supply of stable girls the first chance she had this morning alison had been off to pursue this angle with lucy devenish good friend of patricia young whod slaved in the bull stables in the early sixties and came home pregnant to swindon alison said steadfastly refusing to name the father my gran was very supportive although god knows she had enough on her plate at the time with grandfather failing fast he died in fact the night after i was born so we came back to a house of mourning mother and i the waitress returned and evidently thinking the minister was a hotel guest asked if they would like anything lol ordered coffee figuring this was going to take longer than alison imagined i dont think he said that lucy mentioned anything to me about her friend being pregnant i dont think she knew she said shed warned her to get out of upper hall and shed taken the advice youre right devenish didnt know about the pregnancy she said this morning that that was what she was afraid of my mother would come to her in tears asking what could she do when she needed the job and the money in the end devenish gave her some to get away which was kind but too late no she didnt know about a baby how did you lol explained without mentioning merrily about the book in the box the word young and then alison how hed kept looking at it and puzzling and then remembered the name patricia young all those weeks of agonizing over why she left him and then this moment of blinding certainty intuition i had no choice lol no he said neutrally you dont believe that hell you dont owe me any generosity i dont expect any i needed to live in a certain posh village couldnt afford a mortgage she shrugged you were there you needed help too im sorry but id do it again lol didnt react he understood now he didnt care so when did your mother eventually admit the old bull was your father never never did my gran said shed sometimes imply it was one of the village boys unconvincingly you must have asked her who your father was as you got older no no you dont understand shaking her head impatiently i dont remember patricia i dont remember my mother at all thats the whole point one day when i was about eighteen months old she left me with my gran said she was going back to hereford to see some people get some money out of the father that was always grans theory because they had money problems at the time after the old man died bills debts he was a farmer too of sorts my grandad so gran didnt try to stop my mother going died regretting that why because she never came back lol she returned to ledwardine to face the father and she never bloody well came back gran reported it to the police and they made cursory routine inquiries in ledwardine and said nobody had seen her and that was that that was it he thought of the way the police were turning over the village for colette cassidy grown women lol sometimes choose to disappear the police were suggesting shed only come back to swindon to dump the baby make sure i had a good home then off to join some man with no inconvenient little kid in tow they check with old bulldavies oh sure squire john county councillor and magistrate local constable deferential on the doorstep sorry to disturb you sir tugtug on the forelock but this silly girl you once kindly employed just a formality sir if youd be so good as to confirm you never saw her again thank you very much sir sorry to have bothered you alison tossed back her hair people like you lol into all this progressive sixties music forget that it was still quite primitive then in country areas you didnt ruffle the hawks feathers what do you think happened to her i used to think she was given money to go abroad but now i know they hadnt got that kind of money no way and this is the country what do you do with nuisances in the country what do you do with the dog thats worrying your sheep what do you do with the badgers youre convinced are spreading tuberculosis to your cows even though badgers are officially protected what do you do with the woman whos threatening to expose you to the county was she no way she probably just asked for a few thousand quid perhaps he was worried shed be into him for money for the rest of his life but i cant imagine shed have even thought of that she just went to ask for a bit of help lucy said she was naive kind of innocent which wouldve made it even easier for him easier to get rid of her the way people always did in the countryside with pests thats more difficult than it used to be but not that much more difficult i knew it as soon as i came here with me no years earlier ten years ago with a couple of girl friends camping holiday it had been gnawing at me more and more the number of times i found this place on the maps circled it and circled it until the biro went through the paper then when gran died i mean she died hard she was working well into her seventies cleaning peoples houses so i could stay on at school go to university she died hard and she died full of regrets and remorse with no reason whatever she was a saint my gran she died when i was in my final year and i dropped out at once and i got a job and i thought those fucking rich smug bastards they killed my mother and they killed my grandmother and i i just wanted she was hunched up now gripping the sides of her chair with both hands a side of her shed never before let him see she tossed back her hair again getting herself together so we were on this camping holiday julie donna mates from college i made sure we came here never told them why yeah it would be twelve years ago the year after i dropped out it was a good summer we hired mountain bikes i had the route all marked out on the os map and when we came to upper hall there he was the good and great john bulldavies overseeing the haymaking sitting on the edge of the bottom meadow in his linen jacket with his fat bum on a shooting stick john bullfuckingdavies how did you know it was him i didnt at first i walked over on my own and asked for directions to canon pyon it was very hot and i was wearing shorts and a skimpy top and sweating profusely and he said i looked awfully hot and i could probably do with something long and cool always remember that something long and cool he leered mustve been in his sixties then he saw the other two waiting for me down by the field gate too many too awkward so he gave me the directions to canon pyon you think hed really have made a play for you with all the blokes at work in the field absolutely probably wanted them to see the old squire as potent as ever he was theyve always fucked who they liked it was the way their right droit de seigneur before i went back to the bikes i stood there and looked at him full in the face memorizing every little poxy detail been a goodlooking guy in his time i stood and i kept on looking at him until even he became uncomfortable and turned away then that night in a pub in this pub actually i stared at myself in the mirror and i was nearly sick with disgust the coffee came and lol paid for it it was a different waitress who clearly recognized alison so lol said oh and auntie doris sends her love by the way alison poured the coffee with a steady hand cramp in her left leg awoke her shed fallen asleep in the middle of her attempted prayer head in a curled arm on the duvet the arm was numb she was cold she needed to pee she struggled upright rubbing at the cramped calf there was no sound from above or from below what time was it she groped for the alarm clock peered at its luminous hands nearly halftwelve sunday the sabbath the working day holy communion morning service an unusually full church what would the vicar look like how would she behave would she be pale and penitent would she have crimson eyes and drool however the vicar looked thered be enough material for a whole weeks gossip the efficient ted would have rung back while she and jane were at the lodge and on getting no reply gone ahead and summoned the trusty retired minister from pembridge making longterm plans no doubt to distance himself a discreet word here an expression of concern there did my best for her but the traumas of the past you know my fault should have realized her nerves were simply not up to it parish this size all the pressure pressure on her bladder merrily slid her feet into her sandals found the sweater at the bottom of the bed and pulled it on over her nightdress shuffled to the door aching with weariness feeling old and beaten worn out done in for several minutes after shed finished she sat there on the lavatory bowed over her face in her hands her nerves were shot it made her ashamed dozens of people in the village had real solid frightening problems serious illness recent bereavement job loss the prospect of a house being repossessed because they couldnt meet the mortgage and of course the extreme and constant anxiety and fear when a daughter has disappeared compared with all of this her own problems were meaningless ephemeral fatuous merrily washed her hands and face in cold water go back to bed forget it dont think about tomorrow night either or how youre going to organize it if its meant to happen it will if it isnt let it go let the original decision stand no wil williams in the church thank you thank you and if necessary goodbye she pulled the bathroom door closed behind her something rushed at her from the blackness in a vivid instant she had the clear impression of a hard nucleus of bitter cold rolling along the lightless passage like a soiled grey snowball rapidly gathering momentum frigidity she shrank away flattened herself against the bathroom door turned her head into the wall the cold hit her it stank of misery it wrapped itself around her a frigid winding sheet she couldnt breathe she squirmed wake up lips pulled tight around a prayer god yea though i walk through the darkness of the soul though my heart is weak at the end of the passage a light hung over the stairs wake up wake up wake up wake the light was a lean vertical smear it wasnt much promised no warmth but she reached out for it her hands groping for the stairrail on the landing should she try to run downstairs she looked down she tried to call down to lol who might not even be there there was no easier name to say but she couldnt say it l l her tongue stuck to the roof of her mouth and all that emerged was a sound like an owlhoot weak and lonely and looking down the stairs was like looking down an endless cold black well the only way was up she looked up just as the light flared over the stairs like a small contained area of sheet lightning behind cloud and she was briefly caught in its periphery which sent a jagged shock into her stilltightened chest and she stumbled in panic fell forward on to the stairs into a clinging damp vapour dense with particles of fleeing light and the wooden stairs under her were very rough and the air around her cold cold for january desperately cold for may she pulled herself up and was nearly pulled down again because her heart was so packed with pain despair a worm of liquid despair wriggling inside her the light flared again for a moment and she felt a penetrating agony in her chest as she toppled into the attic there was no sound but the whine of the night wind in the exposed roof timbers and her own breathing as she pulled herself up the tightness fell away and she breathed odourless air stood panting on the top floor of the vicarage a place of dreams where there were no doors no bedroom no sitting roomstudy no jane only a long empty space with a sloping roof where something cold and naked wretchedly embracing an unending misery metamorphosed for a wild defiant instant into a spinning swirling silken vortex of silvergrey and then was gone levels downstairs in the drawing room of the vicarage the lights were on there were brown smoking embers in the grate she was wearing a shapeless green poloneck jumper over a white nightdress it was still night shed lost a sandal she felt cold and drained and heartbroken and didnt know why shes sleeping lol said i went back and stuck my head around the door shes fine everythings normal except me merrily threw coal on the fire she would never be warm again lol contemplated her seriously through his glasses round and brassrimmed like some old nautical telescope she said where was i at the top of the stairs swaying about i thought you were going to fall what did you see what was it like was it a kind of big open space rough joists damp her voice faded she knew what he was going to say it was normal just like now you didnt go to the right place she said maybe not he sat her down on the sofa and positioned himself at the other end his back against the arm ethel jumped into his lap maybe not no seconds passed he was thinking she said youre still wearing your vicars gear absurd reversal of roles mm he was calmer than shed seen him or maybe that was merely relative to her own condition time is it lol about twenty past one you been back long his sleeping bag was on the rug in front of the fire still rolled up hour or so i was wandering around the garden for a while thinking things out he looked down at his black chest scared to take these off i suppose this guy looks at things objectively lets put some more coal on the fire merrily said she told him about all the times it had happened before from that first night when she thought shed followed jane and shed kept opening doors and wound up at the foot of the stairs looking up to the third floor she shut her eyes and rolled her head slowly around small bones creaking at the back of her neck and then sean your husband my dead husband i know it wasnt a dream because she told him about the door handle which fell out again proving shed been in the empty bedroom when she saw him and not in her own bed dreaming in the fireplace cool yellow flames were swarming over the new coal lol pushed in the poker what happened i dont know i did wake up in bed and it was morning and i thought it had been a dream it was a hallucination i suppose i went into that room and i hallucinated sean a source of guilt because i didnt help him when he needed help but he didnt want me to he had another woman youre the kind of person always feels responsible jane tell you that no ive actually started figuring things out for myself he prodded at a cob of coal until it developed fissures and opened up and let more flames through if its not the house merrily said it has to be me could it be a combination of both you and the house setting something off in each other or you and the house and jane yeah i know like adolescents cause poltergeist phenomena ive heard all that but this doesnt happen to jane nothing happens to jane here only in the orchard he looked into the fire for a while and then he said this question of different floors when youve read lots of books on psychology like me thats what i used to read in hospital they had a library for the doctors and the staff with a resident librarian and i got to know her and thats where i used to spend days whole days i suppose reading books on psychology and psychiatric syndromes some of it made more sense than the patronizing crap i was getting from most of the staff how did you stand it time passes lol said you dont notice but anyway levels the floor where youre sleeping thats where youre at thats your situation your husbands there your past all your problems your insecurities your fears your guilt thats where you keep opening doors and they lead nowhere except into the past thats where you saw sean and when it gets too stifling just when you feel theres no escape you wind up at the stairs leading to the third floor psychological claptrap she needed a cigarette but up there merrily is the unknown it could be enlightenment but it could also be madness youre afraid of what you might learn i didnt learn anything id fallen asleep in the praying position and woke up feeling really low and beaten and hopeless but until i went up into that attic i didnt know what sorrow was or felt like because i still dont know what it was why i felt so bad and it was different i wasnt frightened i had this freedom up there the freedom to cry for ever and i knew i couldnt i couldnt make a sound mustnt be heard by jane jane wasnt there nobody else was there it was a different time lol it was a time of indescribable unhappiness merrily wept the sorrow she was giving off was so profound he had to blink back his own tears he wanted to hold her he didnt touch her he went to make tea later he lay on the sofa and watched her sleep in front of the fire curled up in the sleeping bag there like a child the orange coals and the wire fireguard making glowing crisscross patterns on her face the cigarettes and zippo lighter on the rug a few inches from her nose ethel by her feet never had got around to telling her about alison hed wanted to ask her how will this end what can we do about it hed asked alison she said she had no idea but itll be on my terms when i tell him you still hate him how can i hate him my own flesh and blood alison had laughed yesterday morning shed told most of this to lucy and then lucy had died bequeathing the responsibility to merrily watkins lol was back in the alien sweatshirt the vicars clothes neatly on hangers behind the door merrily had not told him what had happened when she and jane had gone to richard coffeys place lol looked at merrily sleeping he thought of lucy on her back on a mortuary table in hereford cold and hatless and awaiting her postmortem this made him anxious too anxious to sleep ethel the cat wasnt sleeping either she lay at the bottom of the sleeping bag where merrilys ankles were and she watched lol goldeneyed and purring gently merrilys face was flushed by the firelight he couldnt stop looking at it twice in the night he got up to put more coal on the fire to keep her warm bad year for apples oh wow jane said she was standing in the drawingroom doorway fully dressed lol came up behind her from the kitchen with tea things on a tray over janes shoulder he could see merrily hurriedly propping herself up in the sleeping bag flower before you say a word well well jane said so you got it together it was nearly eight am substantial sunshine had collected in the bay window coloured pale green by the trees you slept together jane said no merrily sat up in the sleeping bag i mean yes but no this jane ambled into the room hands on hips is really quite seriously cool she turned beamed at lol and she looks so much better dont you think she looks fantastic yes lol said honestly however merrily stood up the sun shone through her white nightdress lol thought maybe he should close his eyes couldnt quite manage that thats it that is just about enough merrily looked around for her sweater failed to find it covered herself with the sleeping bag make some toast child right jane said anything you say the phone rang ill get that merrily gathered the sleeping bag around her jane giggled lol moved out of the doorway merrily passed him without a glance lol shut the drawingroom door behind her faced up to jane vicars dont lie nothing happened in which case jane frowned you ought to be bloody well ashamed she doesnt attract you well yees yes she does god jane breathed hard through her teeth shes not quite a nun she needs somebody but preferably somebody stable oh yeah somebody really really stable she glared at him come on my dad was stable my dad was this like utterly focused individual who knew exactly where he was going the whole time i thought he was bent and getting away with it because he knew he could because he was stable inside focused balanced never worried about anything not really my dad thought a neurosis was was something you can grow in a window box with care yeah exactly so you know screw stable lifes too short look i know youve had your problems i listen at doors sometimes im not afraid to admit that you do huh those back stairs are very useful you could go through life really ignorant if you didnt listen at doors like colette always saying you were scared of her like it was really cool having somebody whos scared of you but it wasnt her at all you were scared of i know that now and im glad and im glad karl windlings dead i mean not glad hes dead like if there was some other way he could be completely out of your face well i havent figured out how i should feel about that either you should feel free hey i forgot did you get to see alison last night i have a problem with free lol said just that i keep seeing people twice three times jesus four times as old as me and they still havent done anything and then they die jane slumped into the sofa i dont know what im trying to say everythings peculiar ive decided if i dont want to believe things then i wont so i dont believe you and mum didnt sleep together and i dont believe lucys dead ok ok and they havent found colette i had the radio on at seven it was the same stuff more or less as last night thats starting to not make sense depends on how you look at it doesnt it suppose i dont want to believe colettes dead either or gone off with anybody anybody human thats even more dangerous ground everythings dangerous to you isnt it lol even mum whats the matter with you all i cut off was your ponytail stefan alder on the line its sorted he sounded very calm very purposeful its on im going to make it happen merrily well good thats wonderful ill put the word around but what if nobody came what if the church was empty save for stefan and coffey and the sick priest come and see you shall i merrily after your morning service no that would be im not actually doing the services today but if you want to rehearse or anything the church should be empty by twelve she was calmer this morning at least the villagers old and new would be given the chance if nobody came then it suggested nobody except james bulldavies was bothered so the play could go ahead in the church whenever coffey and his team were ready it all seemed so simple now i hope this hasnt caused problems between richard and you no stefan hesitated perhaps its resolved them you see richard he wont be having anything to do with this its going to be entirely down to me oh god merrily thought sulks this is how it should have been in the first place it was my idea i discovered him wil its a oneman show merrily it comes from the heart not the page some of it was going to be improvised anyway im a performer a stage an audience you know give me one and a half hours or more shall we say seven pm we dont have an evening service any more so thats not a problem could you make it halfeight nine id prefer it to get gradually darker all right they agreed to meet in the church at one im bringing him home merrily stefan said merrily put down the phone and stood for a moment thinking about last night shed slept easily between the fire and lol robinson daylight had cancelled the fear although there wasnt any at the end only sorrow she wouldnt forget that when she came back to the drawing room lol and jane had one of the sunday tabloids spread out on the coffee table oh well lol was saying it had to happen at some stage the page two headline was fears grow for party girl colette there was a picture of a rather younger more innocent colette with no nosestud and an unfamiliar smile the fact that it was quite small was a strong indication this was not the picture the paper had wanted given the comments gathered from neighbours colette was a bit of a handful one said a real wild child most of the story was an innuendoladen account of the steamy sixteenth birthday party which brought midnight chaos to a sleepy village music was provided by notorious voodoo dj dr samedi who has been banned from several clubs following claims of blood sacrifices the yearold dj real name jeff mooney said last night compared with some of the gigs i do this seemed like a really tame venue but as soon as i met this chick i knew she was trouble hes actually ok jane said the blood sacrifice stuffs probably a bit exaggerated like only small amounts of blood lol pointed to the end of the piece police also want to talk to the owner of a cottage close to the orchard songwriter laurence robinson we think he may have information that could help us with our inquiries di howe said mr robinson who has been working on new songs with seventies rockhero gary kennedy was still not at home last night speaks for itself doesnt it ill go and see her ill explain about karl ill spell it all out are you completely crazy jane snatched up the paper waved it in his face shell nail you to the wall how are you going to explain where youve been she could be right lol merrily said with hindsight it wouldve been better if youd been sitting there when she came to talk to jane yesterday youre still the best theyve got theres at least enough circumstantial evidence to hang on to you for a few days which would be a strain thinking that if howes team found a body lol would be signing a confession before the week was out just to get them off his back give it another day she said none of us needs to have seen a paper perhaps theyll find her every day drops me further in it why they carefully havent named you as a suspect she cares lol jane smiled mischievously dont knock it dont push it flower it was that good huh make the breakfast merrily picked up the paper where did this come from anyway it was on the mat lol said is this the only sunday paper you take i dont take it i told you she didnt jane said i normally collect the papers from the newsagent on the way back from communion this isnt one of them well it was on the mat lol said it must be a mistake laurence in a village this size you dont mistakenly deliver papers to the vicarage somebody wanted us to see it us lol said alison know youre here yes that wise shell keep quiet shes on her own knifeedge ill tell you about that jane blinked young alison you cracked it merrily said make the breakfast jane all right jane found some eggs put the toaster on it was infuriating but maybe after what shed said to lol this was not the best time to listen at the door and also mrs leathers the folklore of herefordshire was still open on the kitchen table it had fallen open at that page portentous right search was made for her and she appeared to her friends from time to time but when they spoke to her she immediately disappeared but suppose the friends had known the score suppose the friends had it totally sussed her mother was told probably by the wise man or woman for whom read lucy devenish that if seen again she must be very quickly seized without speaking or she would never come back so one day a year after her disappearance her mother saw her and took hold of her dress before she could escape why mother she said where have you been since yesterday jane had this sudden crazy image of grabbing hold of the shoulder of the freshly materialized colettes sexy black dress and colette rounding on her shrieking what the fuck are you playing at janey this is my poxy party jane laughed but why not why the hell not ok if it was all airyfairy nonsense total cobblers if colette had actually gone off with some smooth crack dealer from hereford then what was lost who was hurt the plain fact is nobody but nobody apart from me is ever going to try it ok practicalities she couldnt simply keep taking walks through the orchard on the off chance colette would show there had to be method in this she thought back to the night it all began the apple tree the little golden lights another element though if you followed lucys logic was crucial cider does she know what shes playing with here merrily had a clear picture of alison in the church that morning black shirt gold pendant knowing smile james is full of shit oh yes alison knew precisely what she was playing with and lol whod been used and discarded seemed to be able to live with that now that he knew the circumstances now that he understood he was either a naturalborn christian or a naturalborn sucker its good at least to have explanations he said looking back my lifes been pretty short on explanations its horrifying whats she want out of it half the hall the farm half the debts goes deeper than money obviously but this is a very oldfashioned guy i really hate to imagine how hes going to react when he finds out hes been f merrily glanced at the door theyd been whispering but the kid had good ears and no scruples and that his father may have killed someone theres certainly enough ground there to bury a body in i dont think lol said that bulldavies is under any illusions about his family last year he apparently spent a lot of money on the only copy of some unpublished handwritten addendum mrs leather had written to her folklore book it was going to be auctioned he got in first it was all about apple orchards with special reference to wil williams lucy know about it found out too late presumably maybe she doesnt have friends in auction houses alison came across it a few weeks ago not on the bookshelves rotting in the attic it shows the bull family in a bad light all it shows is how flimsy the evidence against williams was the farmer who accused him of bewitching his orchard according to mrs leather all that amounted to was that it had been a very bad year for apples except in the ledwardine orchard where the crop was very acceptable the orchard at that time belonging entirely to the church so god looks after his own that was it he bought the thing purely because it suggested his ancestor accepted iffy evidence of witchcraft in the year sixteen sixtywhatever lol shrugged just you know an illustration of the level of jamess paranoia about his family according to alison shes got to be hard as nails hardened by circumstance you are too generous lol this is her brother halfbrother the sun had gone in another capricious spring day lol did she mention anything about another document the journal of thomas bull therere some volumes of it in a bank in hereford which is where i suppose theyre destined to stay merrily said breakfast was a muted meal jane produced boiled eggs and toast nobody mentioned alison or bulldavies or the deaths of lucy and karl windling or little golden lights or the nighthouse they talked like ordinary people with ordinary lives and only ordinary undercurrents like a family thought lol whod forgotten what a family was like they discussed how merrily was going to spread the word about the personal appearance in ledwardine parish church that night of its former incumbent the reverend wil williams without attracting unwelcome publicity its a village thing merrily said and it has to stay that way thats why i want it done quickly done finished with everybody gets their say the issue decides itself thats the theory anyway it would be good to get the womens institute out in force theyll all fall for stefan in a big way lots of tearfilled hankies what about the press lol said you cant keep them out the way i see it the search for colette will overshadow everything i really dont think the press would be interested unless someone told them dermot child jane said the goblin im going to deal with that merrily bit decisively into a slice of crisp toast from midmorning she hung around the churchyard under apple trees listening to the leaden victorian hymns feeling redundant and rejected she should be in there today of all days offering prayers for colette cassidy and her family holding the community together siphoning gods comfort from the chancel to the nave stupid stupid stupid stupid hadnt thought of the implications of not being there today but ted presumably had the machiavellian bastard it had taken her rather too long to see ted not as an uncle but as the worst kind of country solicitor a man whod spent his adult life smoothing over glossing over planing off rough edges female priest a nice idea that failed too soon my friends too soon and there he was as the main doors opened fawningly attendant upon the imposing figure of the rev norman gemmell tall stooping pointed beard gravely patriarchal presiding in the porch dispensing cordial clerical aftercare bowing over hands tilting his head with concern as though hed known these rusticized city folk for many many years followed their family heartaches and triumphs through the generations a true professional the worst moment came when the cassidys emerged the cassidys who rarely attended morning worship because of the sunday lunch stampede norman gemmell held carolines fingers tenderly led her a few yards away from the porch bent his head to her pale tight face spoke with earnest sincerity and then patted terrence on the shoulder as caroline began to cry and two press photographers recorded the moment in a discreet chatter of motordrives seemed like a good time before the saintly gemmell returned to the vestry to change into his civvies merrily crept from under her apple tree and made for the small rear door which led to the bull chapel and the organ pushed open the small gothic door and stopped there he stood in his friarlike organists robe pensive by the effigy of the bull looking up an initial shock at seeing her plumped up in a second into the charming old dermot why merrily i thought we need to talk ah if only id known i should have rearranged my lunch appointment you know now merrily said coldly perhaps this evening a table at the swan dermot merrily said get your chubby little arse through that door before i rip my sweater and make allegations merrily calling as a witness mr watts the organ repair man among others merrily what are you saying she looked him steadily in the eyes and slowly lifted her sweater exposing her midriff and the base of her bra then she screamed all right dermot scowled and scurried after her out of the church hitching up his robe home cooking at the bottom of the churchyard where apple trees in bloom overhung the graves dermot child sat legs crossed on a nineteenthcentury tombstone looking very affronted and disturbingly very much like a goblin a poisonous loser mans so embittered he doesnt care who goes down and merrily gripping a gravestone had cold feet supposing they were wrong about him suppose he was just a funny but basically harmless little man with a perfectly harmless perfectly natural perfectly healthy about a hundred buttons down the front and you imagine yourself undoing them all very slowly one by one oh god white collar pink body brown nipples lust for female clergy lets be frank with each other shall we dermot his button eyes arose to level on her no smile possibly the beginning of a sneer lets do that ms priestincharge oh yes im all for that merrily thought she could see behind the blossom on the apple trees the first small swellings of the embryo pharisees reds what do you know about the posters scattered around the village the ones we discussed yesterday the eyes were still a poor joke as i said not terribly funny except there wasnt really time for subtlety wasnt there she took a chance i gather they were done on the festival office printer the eyes flickered really you supervise that the printer or the production of the posters yes to the printer and the posters well indirectly who knows do you know merrily and the sunday times did you perhaps speak to them there was nothing prominent in todays sunday times as it happened at least not the edition shed picked up on the way to the church the story had evidently been judged insufficiently strong at this stage which was fine oh yes dermot said of course ive spoken to all the quality papers i have to try to interest them in our lovely festival part of my function in the absence of poor dear tragic terrence and told them about the storminateacup over coffeys play more than that surely merrily a storm at least in a hogshead of cider old cider a dark storm fermenting for many years centuries lets not make light of these things and you told the sunday times about it he shifted on the tomb uncrossed his legs under the thin robe did i did you he giggled did i she gritted her teeth did i dermot said gaily did i did i did i oh merrily my dear you dont know a thing do you youre fishing in the dark with a twig and a bent safetypin and you dont know a thing about our ways any more than poor old hayden did but he at least was content with that and went his bumbling way the very model of a genial faintly tedious country cleric ghastly though not everyone agreed oh lord how i wanted you as his replacement a jolly little dolly of a clergyperson with nice legs and dinky titties oh what fun merrily cut off a shocked breath dont react she stayed very still tried not to look away from his eyes although dermot had certainly looked away from hers blatantly lowering his sardonic gaze to her breasts what fun he said coldly but dont dare imagine that you any more than cassidy any more than the obnoxious coffey could ever know the essence of our quaint little village ways she bit her lip he wasnt supposed to behave like this back in the church she was convinced she had the little bugger she was going to threaten him quite calmly in an absolutely straightforward way tell him about the projected wil williams event a village affair and warn him that if the merest whisper of it got out to the media shed know precisely who to blame she rallied and what do you know about the village ways dermot about ledwardine life as its been lived in the past two decades having spent over halt your life away trying to make it in the big cities a plump cheek twitched with no conspicuous success merrily said he scowled and so feisty arent we the new woman oh my well as a matter of fact ms wafkins being born and raised here and then separated from it for a while gives one a highly individual perspective the incomers dont see at all the locals see but dont notice but someone like myself with a foot in both camps observes all knows all the pressure points knows where a tiny tweak may have maximum effect and you do like to tweak dont you dermot dermot grinned he leaned back on the tombstone legs apart hands behind his head i like to think he said that i orchestrate the parish organist one takes great pleasure in that the first dramatic chords which stir the blood and energize the sleeping church like auld ciderrrrrr does to a man wonderful he stretched and spread his legs assisting the slippage of the dark cotton robe from his fat red naked thighs cassidy hates all that as you know to him its an academic exercise for purely commercial purposes like his phoney wassailing i didnt go to that it was always going to be a silly charade with his pompous speeches and caroline fussing and tinkling mind wasnt a charade in the end was it old reality burst on to the scene with a vengeance thank god for the powells merrily realized shed lost it he couldnt care less whether she knew about him or not he felt completely secure in revealing the side of him that when you thought about it hed never entirely hidden behind the civilized glaze of educated frivolity she said i suppose youll say old edgar topped himself at the wassailing specifically to show up the superficiality of it all shouldnt think so he smiled cant see edgar throwing away a good old country death on the cassidys salt of the earth the powells a bloody good phrase salt of the earth overused devalued but its a good one for the powells a good dark old family older than the bulldavieses this was ridiculous she was merely making conversation now hed insulted her to her face and she was just sidling away from it the bulls dermot snorted norman blood there acquired the davies adjunct a few generations ago to highlight a little welsh strand amounting to nothing the bulls of ledwardine sounds good doesnt amount to a lot always liked to think they had control but they were still newcomers compared with the powells something strong and tight and sturdy about the unassuming powells thats where the real tradition lies she was picturing garrod powell in his wellpressed slacks and his blazer rod he startled her seeming to snatch the thought from her head cant see it in rod is it well you cant see anything can you youre an outsider even if your grandfather did farm at mansell lacy youre way out of it now and youll never get back in let me tell you about rod raised the old way ever hear talk of edgars wife scabby old harpy she was but eyes like diamonds i remember her on pig friday marvellous great toothless grin and blood up to her elbows and then home to teach young rod a thing or two if you know what i mean what merrilys legs felt suddenly weak ha shocked you at last have i reverend what dyou think traditional country lifes about if not fecundity and potency and making sure your eldest boy knows what a woman likes best on a dark night in front of the fire country life merrily home cooking home sex and plenty of auld cider home milled with a dead rat or two thrown in for flavour the farmers wife hoisting up her skirts and pissing into the mix im going merrily turned away thank you for the anthropological lecture go on give us a real blush girlie hows this he leaned right back on the tombstone grinning into the sun sliding the robe to the tops of his flabby thighs where the thin fabric rose up triumphantly whoops dermot said well thats that isnt it her voice distressingly shrill youve finally made sure we arent going to be able to work together again sad isnt it we could have got on so well he pulled down his robe the smile vanishing where will you go merrily leave the clergy perhaps we all make mistakes dont we i could have you arrested enough police about the place dermot sat up ah yes he said soberly im glad you reminded me i do have to see the police did you notice the prowler in your garden in the vicarage garden last night latish no she began to walk away along the blossomstrewn path the big sandstone church in front of her the old country church with its erect steeple she wanted to scream the bloody goblin had been creeping about her garden not a very big chap he called after her spectacles she froze just had a haircut one couldnt help noticing that and dressed bizarrely as a clergyman what happened you see id returned to the church to collect some music and couldnt help noticing him going through your gates i think the lady inspector would want to know about that dont you what dyou think merrily or should one tell ted clowes first good old uncle ted no the police i think it might be important his forced but merry laughter followed her all the way to the lychgate she slowed evened up her pace would not show him her panic he delivered sunday papers too then oh jane said like this was an afterthought and a couple of bottles of that whats it called wine of angels jim prosser who always looked too big for the counter at the little spar shop reached up instinctively to the shelf and then paused how old are you again jane fourteen is it fifteen old enough to know the rules then oh come on jim its only cider no such thing as only cider ciders stronger than beer and this stuffs stronger than your average cider its not for me its a present thats what they all say my dear bloody hell said jane exasperated youre always selling cans of woodpecker and stuff to dean wall and his mates this is sexism oh come on now said jim dont give me a hard time the place is crawling with coppers and you are the vicars daughter for my sins jane paid for the two bags of doritos this was going to be a problem there was whisky in the house a few bottles of wine no cider you wouldnt like it anyway jim prosser said it might be in a fancy bottle but you can get better at half the price i reckon the north side merrily stood in the sunday morning square and prayed silently for guidance two parishioners discreetly crossed into church street pretending they hadnt seen her or perhaps shed become invisible now a nineday wonder and the nine days were over nobody special any more just another single mother to be ignored gossiped about sniggered at flashed at stop it all right so dermot child had recognized lol robinson knew where he was hiding had gone to the trouble of delivering a lateedition sunday tabloid to make sure merrily knew the police had named lol as someone they wanted to question the devious goblin planning ahead setting something up blackmail would he have held on to the information and tried to blackmail her demanding what in return for his continued silence precisely what the mind boggled the loins shrivelled her hand went to her mouth stifling reaction vicar gomer parry stood a few yards away breathing heavily cigarette waggling whitely in his teeth hed run after her a word vicar sure she followed him between the oak pillars into the market hall apologies for the state vicar cleanin out your boundary ditch i was see gomer held up both mudred hands i know i know the sabbath it is but there ent gonner be a fine day for nearenough a week cordin to the farmin forecast so i reckoned id get to grips with the bugger do the manual fore i brings in ole gwynneth see i see well just you know keep the lid on it we have our zealots you didnt actually have to inform me and wouldnt ave vicar no way if that is i hadnt been down in this yere stinkin ditch keepin a low profile as it were when our friend mr dermot child happens to take up occupancy of the ole probert family tomb just this side the hedge followed by your good self oh you want my personal stance on the issue i reckon that feller oughter be strung up by the nuts but thats only my personal opinion like gomer merrily said fervently its a very valid one tried to rope me in for this ole cider rubbish i sez mr child i cant sing worth a bag o cowshit dont matter he sez longs you got it down there i sez whatever you got down there i sez is between you and your ole woman and you dont bring it out in no church gomer coughed embarrassed or churchyard no if itd gone any further see idve been up outer that ole ditch but you was off an child he just stays there lyin on the stone chucklin and schemin anyhow all im tryin to say gomer looked down at his mudcaked boots is thats a dangerous feller an he ent on is own so for what its worth vicar you got my full support whatever goes down like if you wants a witness no i dont think ill be taking it any further whats happenin yereabouts see it smells off i were you i wouldnt trust nobody i know that ent in the spirit of your profession like but thats my advice see it smells off an thats comin from a man who was once up to is adams apple in billy tudges cesspit it was time merrily decided to take gomer parry seriously i suppose she said delicately that you heard the bit about the intruder sure tbe gomer confirmed producing a soggy match bending down to strike it on a cobble that would be mr robinson mabbe oh dear merrily said gomer stood up his cigarette burning vicar theres no problem yere friend of poor ole lucys right so no problem see he rubbed mud from his glasses and winked all right thank you merrily said ent done nothin yet jus lettin you know im yere anythin i can do say the word cause i never told lucy devenish see i never quite said that to lucy and now she ent yere no more which was a funny sort of accident my way o thinkin and so the only other person i can say it tos you an im sayin it you knew i was her executor nope that matter funny sort of accident gomer can we talk were talking innit not here back at the vicarage hell i wouldnt go in the vicarage in this state minnied never speak a civil word to me again ill mabbe get a bath and catch you later if thats all right with you no please gomer listen there is something you can do you come into contact with quite a few people and minnies secretary of the wl on account of nobody elsell take it on aye ok she told him briefly about stefan alders private preview of the wil williams play to be performed in about ten hours time it didnt sound remotely possible gomer whistled tonight so this let me get this right this is like a play but its its a partly improvised drama stefan alder as wil williams presents a kind of sermon telling his life story how he came to be in the mess hes in his congregation as i understand it will be able to question him and anyone else but theyll all know its just an act gomer when half the nations watching a soap opera everybody knows its an act but does that stop them getting involved does that stop the tabloid papers printing stories about coronation street characters as though theyre real people this guys an experienced actor and this is a role he cares deeply about theyre the congregation this is their church within half an hour theyll have forgotten who stefan alder is by golly gomer said you really are gonner throw the shit in the mincer you can get the word around the village you and minnie bugger me the ole phonell be burnin up anybody in particlar you dont want at the moment i can only think of dermot child bulldavies is an optional right then gomer nodded stamped out his cigarette consider it spread well i suppose there comes a point in your life lol said when you start to accept that some people are just not good people and you cant do anything about that i know its your job to try and put them on the path of righteousness and all that but thats not always the wisest strategy sometimes i suppose tackling coffey last night i thought i was on a roll again it was a mistake i shouldnt have gone to see him perhaps child wanted you to i think people like him quite like to be discovered im really sorry this means you cant accuse him of indecent exposure but then hed know that friday i throw up at my installation service saturday i go to pieces at the opening of the festival sunday while admitting to sheltering a man the police want to question i claim my organist flashed at me i think were looking at a resignation situation here at the very least dont even think of it jane said lucy said sure the catalyst where do you go lol dont say the cops thats not an option not with child working against us why is he mum whys he doing this because because he obviously has the most incredible ego and no remorse hes a psychopath lol said very few of them actually kill people they just do damage merrily smiled in spite of it all lol has read widely on psychology come on we may not have much time where shall we put him flower lucys house or lucys shop with the cops hanging round the country kitchen the reverend locke again wont work childs sussed that and we dont know what else he knows we dont know if or when hell go to the police its very unsettling look i have to go and meet stefan im going to leave lucys house key on the mantelpiece if you can think of any way of getting across there without being seen do it otherwise sit tight and pray right jane said tell me about these people stefan alder called down from the pulpit these villagers wholl be here the older residents particularly the ones from the older families ive no actual idea merrily sat alone in a pew halfway down the nave were hardly issuing specific invitations but in my experience anything mysterious anything faintly bizarre happening in the churchll still pack them in they wont come the following week but in this case that doesnt matter does it no but who specifically strange stainedglass colours blurred in stefans thick pale hair who comes to all your services ive been twice if we include your illfated induction ceremony i made a few mental notes on both occasions for example the old lady who arrives in a wheelchair but insists on leaving it in the doorway and have people help her into a pew looks terribly fragile who is she thats mrs goddard priscilla lives in the stables house at the end of old barn lane whats wrong with her osteoporosis quite advanced brittle bones yes i wonder what they called it in the seventeenth century is she in much pain much of it emotional she used to be an enthusiastic horsewoman ran a riding school from her home now the stables are empty shes looking out on an empty field and she feels her lifes effectively over needs to be handled with great care i understand stefan made a note in the stiffbacked book hed brought with him he asked about any other people who were chronically ill or whod been recently bereaved or had sick and disabled children or grandchildren or conspicuous money worries marital problems difficulty conceiving a child all a little disturbing audience participation was one thing meddling with a congregation something else and what good would it do him if he made a mistake and insulted someone stefan you cant hope to absorb all that information even i still have problems remembering everybodys name not a problem for me merrily indeed my notes are a formality i dont forget faces i have a photographic memory im not boasting its a simple fact i can learn a fiftyminute television script in a night and today he leaned over the pulpit today i am concentrating he was certainly a presence in the church although he wore tight black trousers and a billowy white shirt out of one of those old douglas fairbanks jr movies there was nothing effete about his movements or his speech today he had merrily thought stepped out of richard coffeys shadow oozing intensity of purpose no more toyboy youre taking this very seriously arent you she said without thinking the echo emphasizing the stupidity of the question it will be the performance of my life he said it simply quite quietly no histrionics no camp melodrama perhaps he said there wont be another oh i think there will i think somehow youre going to win a lot of support its already quite a talking point i suspect everyones going to rather enjoy it enjoy wrong word he came down the pulpits wooden steps stood behind the carvedoak eagle lectern oh my god merrily thought hes going for the full messianic bit i should like one spotlight if i may just here he stood at the foot of the pulpit one of the high rear ones so that its quite wide is there someone who could operate that merely a question of switching it on shortly before dusk say half an hour into the performance so that everyone will have become accustomed to it by the time it takes effect jane could do that as you can see weve actually got several spots up there which we could vary without too much difficulty i mean i dont know much about theatrical lighting but just the one will be sufficient in the pulpit and elsewhere i shall be using candles do you have candles few dozen ill bring more i want these people to believe totally that they are in the seventeenth century and that wil williams is their minister if that doesnt offend you no thats thats fine in fact that may be easier than you think you know the pageant thing the womens institute are organizing for the festival the working life of ledwardine through the ages im afraid ive paid scant attention to the other aspects of the festival even his speech pattern had altered become more formal a touch archaic theyve been making costumes merrily told him authentic stuff its not all seventeenth century obviously therell be victorian and medieval stefan said warily there wont be roman soldiers or anything will there no roman soldiers no tudor doublets and ruffs no second world war fighter pilots im not saying there wont be anachronisms but theyre unlikely to be glaring besides working country clothes have always been very muted and they havent changed much look at the barbour yes he considered yes that would be wonderful it would add to that sense of otherness do you understand what i mean take them out of themselves absolutely i also thought well the seating pattern it was different then i mean the arrangement of the pews facing the chancel facing the pulpit that was roughly the same but in those days pews were allocated according to your social standing areas were set aside for the gentry and other areas well away for the servants and the servants were packed in like sardines while the nobs had room to lounge about now obviously we cant attempt to segregate people in that way but well men and women were also separated were they really women were generally relegated to the north side why is that because women were naturally considered less important and the north side of the church any church was supposed to be more exposed to the influence of the devil i dont quite know why certainly people didnt want to be buried at the north end of the churchyard look at any church around here and youll find the more recent graves to the north and not many of them and would they do that will the men sit separately they will if their wives tell them to times seem to have changed in that respect at least and the women will go to the north til organize it what about the bulldavies pew if he doesnt come which he probably wont its going to stand out as conspicuously vacant do you want no it must remain empty i can use that its your show merrily said thank you youre a good person merrily i yes ive studied the parish records and various histories there are certain old families who i know have descendants in the village the monks the prossers the woods the cadwalladers will you stand with me this evening somewhere discreet the bull chapel perhaps and point out the various people as they come in all right and then disappear huh he smiled once they enter the church i want it to be my church again you going to spend the afternoon here rehearsing i dont need to rehearse i shall walk among the apple trees i want to meditate open myself to him right ill leave you then merrily stood up not entirely comfortable with this good luck wil merrily she stopped dont dont joke about this stefan said i beg you the performance of my life remember yes meant gomers lunch was on the table minnies potato pie when the phone rang tell them to call back minnie shouted through from the kitchen and if its that man about the septic tank dont forget youre retired ar said gomer noncommittally if you cant bring yourself to tell him you put him on to me minnie went on ill give him septic tank gomer groped for the phone jeff harris gomer you were right boy wouldnt use this stuff to unblock my sink gomer sat up shirley was coming through ledwardine this morning so i asked her to call for a bottle you had me worried see got to protect the image of the product or were all done for uncorked it not so much a pop as a fizzle poured half a glass took it to the window held it up to the light and gomer was on the edge of his seat now if you couldnt trust the word of a man whod worked for bulmers westons dunkertons and god knew who else during a fortyyear career you couldnt trust nobody when it came to cider but he did like to make a performance of it did jeff harris well that about the sink exaggerated a bit there i confess its not absolute piss but if thats the original old pharisees red ill drink six pints of australian lager out of my old farm boots gomer minnie came in from the kitchen all pink and homely and steaming angry if you dont get back to that pie in thirty seconds its going back in the oven dyou realize how much ive got to do before tonight gomer raised a finger pleading for one minute its bottlefermented all right jeff said but theres a difference between fine champagne and twoquid fizz all right if the powells want to take these daft londoners for a ride they might think thats all right and at six pound fifty a bottle they can be pretty sure none of us is ever going to taste it but in my book you dont misrepresent cider the wine of angels indeed what you gonner do about it gomer well not my place is it just wanted to know like talkin to young lloyd i was see yesterday and he reckoned they had to buy some apples in not havin enough of the ole pharisees to produce the kind o quantity cassidy was after that account for it bought the damn lot in if you ask me and got somebody to produce it for them but whyd they wanner do that gomer asked watching minnie ceremoniously carrying his piedish through to the kitchen didnt want to lose face i suppose said jeff harris hadnt made cider in more than a generation except perhaps a drop or two for themselves now heres cassidy saying they must have the traditional stuff and talking about grants from the tourist board and all this they came to an arrangement with jeremy selby or one of those boys thats my guess save a lot of work make a few hundred quid each and that idiot cassidy and his cronies never having tasted cider in their lives are none the wiser wouldntve thought it of rod his ole man mabbe like father like son my boy mans a councillor isnt he most councillors are in it for what they can shovel into their back pockets fact of rural life let me know of any further developments sure to gomer said and hung up puzzling hard of course minnie brought his lunch back and while he was eating it she paraded before him in a long dullbrown woollen dress with a wheatycoloured shawl round her shoulders gomer didnt think much to it we ent short of a bob or two min you dont have to go as a peasant woman this isnt peasants clothes sunday best this is for an eighteenthcentury farmers wife still pass for seventeenth century though wouldnt it give up trying to look nice once they got married did they minnie snorted i only wish i had a veil too to hide my blushes we all know what kind of play that coffeys likely tove written aye well thats why were all gettin a chance to see it first innit you dont like it you think it treads on too many ole corns you get your chance to say so out loud not that you will you women youll all just sit there all pofaced and then pull it to bits outside and ave another go at the vicar for good measure i never said a word against that young woman aye but you done your share of noddin and frownin and glancin sideways you would say that youre a man if she was fat and fifty youd be having second thoughts just like the rest of us especially when shes letting something like this go on in the church that dont stop you goin though do it i like to make up my own mind oh aye and youll all be gatherin round like them women round the ole guillotine hopin shes put both feet in the slurry again thats not fair anyway when youve finished your pie well sort something out for you my duck gerroff woman i ent goin i done my bit me bein there ent gonner help the vicar anyway they didnt ave no plant hire in the seventeenth century never mind plant hire youre a retired businessman gomer closed his eyes in anguish it was simple really or so jane said lucys house like most of those on the vicarage side of church street backed on to the old bowling green which in turn was accessible from the orchard which you could access from the bottom of the vicarage garden so if jane were to let herself into lucys by the front door and go round and leave the back door open for lol geddit and while youre in there maybe you find out whatever lucy was trying to tell us if she was trying to tell us anything i know she was jane said soon after shed gone with merrily still organizing stefan alder the phone rang the answering machine kicking in merrily its ted what the hell dyou think youre doing dont you think there should have been a meeting of the church council before you let these people take over the place at short notice especially for something so politically and morally sensitive i cannot believe you went over all our heads in this deplorable fashion and i have to say that if this is an example of the kind of behaviour we can expect from you in the future then im afraid you can no longer count on my support and i wish herewith to dissociate myself entirely from tonights outrage that was the first the second one just under ten minutes later said sternly councillor powell mrs watkins i should be glad if you would telephone me immediately upon your return within two minutes the third ah merrily my love no wonder you dont need a man youre obviously quite capable of fucking yourself my condolences firmly and decisively jane shut the door of the house in church street and then was stopped very scared by the sight of the winter poncho draped over the post at the bottom of the stairs the poncho hung there dark and sombre like a kids idea of a ghost it was both frightening and awfully moving it made her wish she hadnt come because it brought home to her more even than the sight of the body in the road the cruel reality of lucys death to banish the fright she threw her arms around the poncho buried her face in its folds burst at once into sobs hugging the woollen thing tight but the hardness the deadness of the oaken post beneath only made it worse its rigid knurled point imprinting on her forehead the message that the wonderful lucy devenish really was never coming back when she pulled away the poncho fell in a heap to the floor as if the spirit had drifted away from under it she gathered it up quickly and carried it up the narrow stairs finding lucys bedroom putting the poncho on the bed and walking out without looking at anything because a bedroom was private she went into the bathroom and looked at her face in the mirror she looked like a child and the tear stains didnt help she washed her face dried it on an aztecpatterned bathtowel that reminded her of the summer poncho and was just so lucy she nearly wept again wipe your eyes you little snot pull yourself together she tried to hear lucys voice saying it but it wasnt there was it she wasnt here and there was nobody else who knew the real truth about ledwardine the place was all tarted up and polished like the archaic tools and farm implements on the walls in the swan that nobody quite knew the original purpose of anymore downstairs in the lowceilinged living room she felt a bit better there were photos on the walls to look at which was different to photos in some dusty album at the bottom of a wardrobe and of course the bookshelves beckoned but first jane went into the little kitchen which faced north always the bleakest light and overlooked the old bowling green a few morose sheep nibbling out there now under the window was a belfast sink beside a sturdylooking castiron cooker and there was a small fridge and a kind of sawnoff welsh dresser with a cardboard box on it a note was tucked into one of the boxs flaps compliments of the ledwardine festival thanks for your help barry bloom the box contained six champagne bottles she lifted one out its ornate label featured the familiar black linedrawing of the parish church and in archaic lettering the wine of angels oh lucy oh wow jane went quickly to the back door unbolted it turned the key and then removed two bottles from the box it was like theyd been waiting for her she looked out of the window giving lucys hooknosed ghost a chance to manifest among the sheep its arms rising angrily from the dark ponchos folds put those back at once you tripehound but nothing appeared the wine of angels lay heavy in her arms jane carried the bottles out of the back door and over the fence on to the path bordering the bowling green it was meant you duplicitous woman your hypocrisy defies belief you lied to my face the machine as merrily came in recording a message distorting badly to my face mrs watkins and good afternoon to you too james merrily dumped her bag on the hallstand when the shit hit the fan an answering machine was mercifully absorbent she saw lol in the kitchen doorway and smiled weakly i get more popular all the time it is clear to me now that you were from the beginning conspiring with certain subversive elements to undermine the stability of my village i am a soldier i cannot tolerate that lol said is he real my information is that tonight you propose to allow this man to lay out his foul smears in public i am giving you this opportunity to call it off you may consider this an ultimatum my god merrily said this is a prepared statement the red light on the answering machine blinked and swelled like some warning vein in bulldaviess forehead if i do not hear from you before four oclock i shall personally take action to put a stop to this homosexual farce and to ensure that you never again have an opportunity to use church of england property to defame and to destroy if you are representative of women priests then by god i shall make it my business to ensure this village will never have another when you are gone goodday to you lol said and you thought alison was playing with fire sometimes merrily said you do things without quite understanding why you dont know why youre doing this well i know how it started she leaned against the hallstand with her back to the flashing red light it started with me feeling pressured by anonymous letters and veiled threats and people trying to use the media to get what they want and she sighed and dug in her bag for cigarettes and then we were sitting there in coffeys house and this idea was suddenly taking shape and it all came pouring out almost like i was speaking someone elses thoughts i hadnt reasoned it out it just i dont know maybe my selfdestruct mechanism came into play maybe when its over he said theyll all wonder why they made such a fuss she looked at him over her lighter shaking her head you dont think that he didnt know what to say i suppose i was kind of hoping coffey would put the arm on stefan and it would all fall through and then id have done my bit given them a chance but of course stefan got his way and then this morning i mentioned it to gomer parry and now we have a whole bunch of people due to turn up in fancy dress so its been generating its own momentum like it was meant preordained destiny fate something working me like a puppet out of control except of course it isnt i could stop it now lol turned to her and put out a hand and she took it what should i do she said looking at it objectively he had no idea what to say how could he be objective when he was falling in love with her is it the right thing merrily said thats the only question isnt it when you think about it part four a mist involves the eye while in the middle it doth lie and till the ends of things are seen the ways uncertain that doth stand between thomas traherne the demonstration pink moon stefan alder was waiting for her under the lychgate just before eight shed expected some smart stately latestuart gentleman but he was no more in period costume than he had been this morning the neutral black trousers and white shirt a little crumpled now a smudge of green mould on the arm where it reached a muddied open cuff a deep red scratch dividing the back of one hand i dont want stefan stepped away from her scrutiny as though it were a court summons i dont want a twee little costume drama i dont want a pantomime they understand this dont they its all right merrily backed off putting up her hands nobody wants that stefan sorry he smiled palely firstnight nerves he laughed as if this was a private joke you eaten an apple symbolic but insufficient calories he looked lonely and he looked frail merrily suspected hed been given a bad time at the lodge she imagined the patchwork face sneering but inwardly richard coffey would be eaten up with unquenchable jealousy because his beautiful steffie was in love with a ghost the sun was going down behind the church which had faded from red to brown and would soon be black merrily wasnt in costume either not period nor clerical she wore a long black skirt and a black highnecked cashmere sweater another relic like the volvo of seans boomtime there would only be room in there for one minister tonight stefan she said whats in this for you he looked frightened of the question the moon was rising over his shoulder an unusually distinct moon already yellow redemption stefan said bleakly isnt that what we all want i suppose but for whom he didnt answer that he looked out across the empty market place where the first lights were coming on which way will they come where shall we stand she led him to a tree an apple tree as it happened which in the evening was absorbed into the big shadow of the church he stood rigidly a bag of nerves bloody coffey he might have helped he could have been here for moral and artistic support he could have enlisted the aid of his technical friends or did coffey perhaps want this to fail so that the whole project not his idea anyway might be discreetly dumped had she actually been playing into coffeys hands stefan was watching her now the evening was quite warm and ashen hair hung damply over his ears he pushed some back and whats in it for you merrily i dont know she said truthfully i really dont know answers perhaps to the things i dont know anyone can ask questions thats the point isnt it theres nothing i wont be able to answer ive read all richards research but ive thrown away the script merrily walked into the empty church and sensed at once a disturbance thered been a temporary estrangement between her and the church but when you preached and prayed in a building it began to send messages to you in the atmosphere and the echo tonight the church was agitated and it wasnt with anticipation something had happened she walked out past the font and into the nave in the northwest corner the door to the tower and steeple was closed and padlocked the vibration was not like the shiver of bells but it did seem to be on this side of the church she stood by the tower door and looked along the northern aisle towards the organ pipes the curtain screening the organ was drawn she thought of malevolent goblins strode up the aisle and swept it aside the organ loft was curiously like the cockpit of a very oldfashioned aircraft merrily switched on the curling brass lamps which lit the keyboards and the panels of knobs nothing seemed disturbed but she lingered allowing herself to consider what until today had been unthinkable that dermot child might be connected with the disappearance of colette cassidy he might have been giggling when he exposed himself on the tombstone this morning but it was in fact an act of rage of violence shed made dermot lose his temper and hed brandished his cock like a knife a peevish child grown into a bitter screwedup middleaged man who thought he was entitled to more arrogant enough to believe younger women could fancy him remorselessly devious enough to lie in wait for a sixteenyearold girl who everyone said was asking for it she backed out snapped off the lights drew back the curtain perhaps she should play dermots own game and send an anonymous note to annie howe perhaps she should swallow her pride and go to see annie howe still unsettled she moved up the steps and under the rood screen into the chancel the altar shone down at her in white and gold nothing wrong there she entered the side chapel which began a few yards behind the organ and ran parallel to the chancel the bull chapel its high east window was dulled now but the bigger northfacing leaded panes cast a hard and coarsening light on the face of thomas bull on its trim beard its bulbous lips its scarily wideopen eyes in the bleak northern light this was a dour and creepy place but there was nothing here but the unsleeping bull in his frugal sandstone clothing the dull blade of his naked stone sword quiescent at his side it irked her that this chapel should be next to the chancel so that you couldnt approach the altar without getting a glimpse of him her shoe crunched something she bent down cement or sandstone dust on the flags near the foot of the tomb and directly below the place where it seemed to have been repaired at some stage where she remembered thinking it looked as though tom bull had stretched out his legs and kicked out a couple of bricks she sprang back in horror it looked as though he had merrily took a long breath gritty with stillfloating cement dust the eyes of tom bull sneered at her as she pulled up her skirt and then lowering herself beyond his field of vision knelt on the flags by his stonebooted feet on their stone cushion she saw that all the cement had been chipped out around two bricks she put hands either side of one and lifted it it was old and parched and not very heavy and it came out easily and she laid it on the floor removed the second brick revealing a hole like a large letterbox it was black in there and she had no torch with a rising dread she slipped a hand in hes bones unless you touch him and then hes dust she didnt touch him a small draught caressed her fingers she snatched her hand back shaking youll be ok lol jane seemed quite anxious to get away sure he said shes not here you know in case you were worried i wasnt he was sitting at lucys desk with the two lamps on and the velvet curtains drawn the windows faced the street but jane had been outside and said no chinks of lights were visible unless they wandered round the back and into the garden no one would have reason to think the house was occupied i thought she would be here jane said gloomily i really didnt think shed left us for ever well maybe shes gone on as they say to something better but her work here isnt finished no he admitted perhaps it isnt what are you going to do now just muddle on i suppose no i meant now as in now oh im going to the church im supposed to be in charge of lights wow it means i get to switch on one spotlight just before it goes dark thats it she just wants me there to keep an eye on me so suspicious he said mothers jane turned in the doorway she does like you i can tell i think on reflection the way things turned out you probably did the best thing not actually sleeping with her thats what you think it will stand you in good stead jane said solemnly when shed gone he thought about lucy and he thought about merrily he looked around the tidy little room jane was right lucys spirit was not here perhaps it never had been you could look around this room and you would not know her youd know what shed looked like from the photos on the walls what shed eaten from the food in the kitchen what shed worn from the clothes in the wardrobe but you would not know lucy if there was a shrine it would be the shop with its fruit and its fairies it seemed to lol though that the spirit was too small to be confined in one small space it would have to hover over ledwardine its guardian hills and its apple trees the spirit would want to light up the orb but it was too late to help lucy in any practical way lol opened the annotated copy of ella leathers folklore the living light tonight was in merrily watkins and he was scared because it was flickering let me help you please outside the porch stefan was bending over mrs goddard in her wheelchair a rug over her knees the stress lines had vanished from his handsome face concern glowed out the setting sun colouring his hair stefan was acting or something thankyou mrs goddard said mr williams he said simply the daughter pushing the wheelchair frowned merrily noticed but mrs goddard smiled they didnt want me to come but i insisted she patted his hand resting on the arm of the chair i believe in you i am glad stefan said and you know i believe what poor miss devenish often used to say that until we face up to our history and uncover the truth we shall never be a real village again merely a tourist museum a sort of black and white theme park stefan listened and nodded merrily marvelled at the old girl although shed noticed this before the way disabled people often became clearer sighted more focused and certainly more outspoken most of the others had been less forthcoming a couple of men had uncomfortably declined to shake the hand stefan offered them as though they might contract hiv or something a retired headmaster called carrington had pushed past him into the church grunting dont take us for fools mr alder but most of the women had seemed charmed if in some cases reluctantly theyd all seen him on television many had been scandalized and titillated by the news that he was living in ledwardine with an older man who was also a controversial playwright but he was young and goodlooking magnetic charismatic and he was performing exclusively for them and they were part of that performance boy knows what hes doing big jim prosser from the shop had come to stand with merrily on the grass to the left of the porch look at em all nearest theyll ever get to being extras in pride and prejudice i know thats a century or so out but what do they care yes there was an unfortunate number of rather showy dresses drifting along the path from the lychgate jim himself in a striped apron over a collarless shirt was rather more than a century out but he didnt seem to care either whats the feeling in the village about this jim caused a bit of a flurry vicar nothing else got talked about in the shop this afternoon thats for sure you know what i mean aye mabbe i do ted clowes walked in on his own he was wearing his dark churchwardens suit he did not look at merrily and jim grinned you know as well as i do that most folk yere tonight dont give a toss about wil williams never even heard of the feller until all this fuss started but the old timers and the wi ladies and the ones whove been around a while are all of a flutter cause they seen the effect its having on some folk they wanner be able to say i was there all dressed up the night of the fireworks fireworks said merrily some folk gonner be real disappointed if there ent vicar you havent seen james bulldavies around by any chance not yet big jim twinkling with anticipation good evening ms watkins merrily turned to find detective inspector annie howe stepping on to the grass she was not in costume hello merrily said annie howe stood quietly watching the villagers gather in the churchyard she wore jeans she carried her white mac over her arm night off merrily said what do you think depends how close you are to finding colette cassidy i suppose you think we might be close tell her about dermot tell her about the desecration of the tomb i pray that you are she said thinking this was precisely what alf hayden would have said a platitude all right be practical lol told himself be objective for the first time in your life shes out there shes presiding over something she doesnt understand there are people there who want to stop her there are people who want to destroy her and people who want to watch at the centre of all this is a secret involving the death of a man more than three centuries ago merrily doesnt know the secret ignorance is dangerous if you want to help her you have just a short time to discover the secret help me lucy lol said he didnt know where to start he switched off the lamps and drew back the curtains church street draped in dusk was deserted above the house across the street the moon rose it was almost full it was pink no other way to describe it this was a pink moon nick drakes bleak last album was called pink moon the title track was this short song with very few words one verse repeated it didnt have to explain all the folklore about a pink moon that a pink moon meant death violence was tinted by blood the song just said in nicks flattest coldest most aridly refined uppermiddleclass tone that the pink moon was going to get ye all im over that lol howled wrenching at the curtains his legs feeling heavy his arms numb his heart like the leaden pendulum of some old clock im over it the eternal bull and let us pray stefan said for tom bull it was as though the red stone of the church had trapped the sunset as it had on the night of merrilys noninstallation as priestincharge the remains of the evening travelled through all the apples in the windows the pharisees red in the hand of eve the cluster of green and orange fruit around the nucleus of the big circular window above the pulpit where stefan stood collecting the last light in his hair and face and shirt the man stefan said more loudly and the bull the pulpit steps creaked as he came down the nave echoed back the rapid crackling of his shoes on the stone flags bull of ages stefan cried mockheroically he stopped in front of the organ halfturned towards the screen which hid the chapel the eternal bull an edge of desperation will you be joining us thomas will you pray with us before you take me im your priest thomas still your priest when all is said tom tom bull will you come and pray there was an almost audible apprehension in the church faces lifting to the organ pipes and the wooden panel which sheltered them from the eyes which were open for eternity merrily watched from the rearmost pew of the northern aisle where the women sat stefan it seemed had had no difficulty at all in persuading the women away from their husbands and they all clustered in the satan sector in their variety of costumes minnie parry at the front in dark brown wool the velvet wives mostly incomers conspicuously in the middle like visitors from restoration london silence apart from some shuffling a few coughs stefan wiped his brow with an arm he sniffed he looked beyond the burnished walls and pillars into the blackness of the rafters it goes dark he said sadly we have so little time he was at the front of the northern aisle now close to minnie merrily could see gomer parry sitting just across from her in the central nave squeezed into his inquest suit he looked in need of a cigarette she could sympathize in the otherwise empty pew behind gomer sat the only woman who unsurprisingly had resisted attempts to put her in the northern aisle but annie howe looked curiously uncomfortable bessie stefan called out suddenly where are you bessie cross advancing down the aisle looking this way and that over the heads wherever he went he seemed to take the light with him bessie cross nay dont deny me now woman he stopped three pews from the bottom of the aisle he waited bessie two rows in front of merrily a woman moved teresa roberts a farmers widow in her late sixties a friendly decent soul and a regular churchgoer earlier shed been one of several people stefan had asked merrily to point out to him teresa said hesitantly bessie cross she was my grandmoth but stefan was leaning over the pew end reaching for her hands to pull her to her feet bessie how is the girl now how is janet for i myself have prayed for her many times bessie dont be affeared hes not here the bulls not here yet we have time for this how does she lie now bessie is janet cross at peace the woman next to teresa looked up quickly and merrily saw with widening eyes that it was caroline cassidy in a dark brown cape she must have come in alone after the others still holding teresas hand stefan turned to the wider congregation raised his voice you all know about this all of you know what happened to bessie crosss girl who went into the bulls meadow to look for her cockerel at close of day fearing the attentions of the fox and was caught and branded for a poacher a murmuring merrily remembered what stefan had said before coffey could shut him up about hiring a researcher to gather memories and old stories from the village but if this was about teresa robertss grandmother it was victorian for wil williams a couple of hundred years in the future it didnt seem to matter stefan was clearly invoking memories of a figure which bestrode the centuries the eternal bull and the bull said to the child did he not now janet would you appear in court and bring shame down upon your family or have me deal with you now stefan paused deal with you now he repeated quietly with low menace bessie my poor dear woman is what i say true in every detail teresa roberts entirely in shadow said well my mother she used to tell me how old was she bessie how old was janet when she was brought before the bull the church had gone very quiet some had turned to look at the dim tableau of stefan and teresa others gazed stoically in front of them as if they were afraid to respond afraid of repercussions merrily marvelled at the willingness of a group of disparate people in an enclosed space to relinquish their world for another indeed their inability not to the power of theatre power shed never had nor wanted power but this was what being a successful minister was still all about twenty minutes and hes got them in his hands theyve never given me half this much attention teresa said twelve twelve year old has she stopped crying now stefan asked gently has the poor child stopped crying in the night she she never stopped hardly a week went by they wouldnt hear her crying in her bed hardly a week my mother used to say deal with her now a whipping was that not what you were told by the gamekeeper when he brought the child home it was a whipping does a whipping do that to a girl a farm girl a big hardy rawboned girl a scamp does a whipping do that teresa roberts said pain coming through please dont worry stefan whispered just loud enough for merrily to hear this should be heard the air inside the church was thicker and darker now the walls like dull earth but a heart of pure red fire in the circular window all that was visible of stefan was the white of his shirt he moved around the pew like a restless ghost does a whipping do that bessie ill bet shed been whipped a time or two at home aye teresa roberts was a talking shadow we all were back then how long did she cry at night they say she was never at peace and she couldnt look no man in the face from that day till where did the bull take her bessie dont be afraid let it be told in this holy place for this haunts your family still the cider house he took her in the ole cider house where they say he took all his women because the air itself in there they used to say the smell of it could make you drunk sos you wouldnt notice the cider house it was always the ole cider house it made you drunk to be in there and wanton merrily froze up in the darkness images came alive in her head the dream shed had in the afternoon in the black swan the dream of dermot child in the foetid sweating cell the cider house stefan said with satisfaction the old bull cider house god bless you bessie for your courage god have mercy on the bull and god bless the child who cries in the night no the voice of teresa roberts was ragged she dont cry nmore reverend dont cry nmore how old was she stefans voice gentle but full and round and relishing his punchline how old was she the day she hanged herself in the barn sixteen teresa whispered sixteen that day sir in the long hollow silence that followed merrily was aware of gomer parry edging out of his pew and then stefan alder was leaning over her his lips against her ear she could smell his sweat the light please merrily the spot five minutes he was so screwed up he couldnt think he kept walking around the room pulling books from the shelves he didnt know where to start he had so little time and no idea where the hell to start he made himself sit down traherne start with traherne how did traherne come to know wil williams help me lucy just remind me thinking back to when lucy had first introduced him to traherne who had a link with ledwardine through wil williams and hopton susannah hopton the patroness it took lol nearly twenty minutes to discover from the various histories of herefordshire that susannah hopton had been the wife of a judge on the welsh circuit who lived right on the border at kington and was a devout high anglican with some kind of circle of disciples during the puritan cromwellian years mrs hopton had moved towards roman catholicism but returned after the restoration of the monarchy she had a strict and punishing regime of daily worship which began before dawn she was very fond of clergymen and her bestknown protege was thomas traherne but wil williams lucy said had become virtually a part of her household his background had equipped him to meet her schedules without difficulty i was born stefan said on a grey and windsoured hill farm at glascwm in radnorshire he looked down at his fingernails as if remembering a time when they were black and ragged my father held seventy acres of rocky boggy clayheavy goddeserted earth my father had little faith no hope and no conception of charity stefan moved around the church you could hear the crackling of his footsteps the only sound and wherever he would stop light would flare candles all around the church faces were lit by little oval spears and in this timeless light the centuries dissolved and you saw that essentially nothing had changed farming faces no less rough and reddened than ever they were than the stones themselves and no face more severely stony than garrod powells an axe to grind merrily recalled the councillors fist striking the table in the village hall let him grind it somewhere else sir not in our church and would he say a word tonight probably not no muscle would twitch in rods puritan face no eyebrow rise there were no stray breezes in the church tonight and the flames were vertical sending up wispy tapers of smoke and that faintly bitter singeing aroma faces she saw the moonbland countenance of dermot child he had not looked at her she saw the pert urban features of caroline cassidy made gaunt and austere by the wan and waxy light and the anxiety that many a mother knew in the seventeenth century when so many children would expire in infancy caroline had not noticed her then she saw alison kinnersley who had slipped into the back central pew occupied at the other end by annie howe behind them jane hovered merrily walked over made a little signal with a forefinger to tell her to put on the lefthand spot she could easily have done the lights herself but it was an excuse to have the kid safely in the building jane nodded by the time the spot came on a dusty yellow tunnel from the rafters to the area below the pulpit stefan was there sitting on the second step half in the beam half in shadow he began to speak conversationally as though to friends about his adoption by a rich and pious woman who recognized in him an intelligence a longing and a purity of spirit so rare it required special nurturing he had everyones attention the world of wil williams but he spoke boastfully and that wouldnt go down well herefordshire people were generally laidback and selfeffacing all around her merrily felt a cloudy ancient atmosphere but when she looked at stefan she saw an actor why she rubbed her eyes was it jealousy because they were never so silent so attentive to her she went and stood against the back wall of the nave next to the heavy curtain covering the entrance to the vestry and listened to stefan telling of his introduction to traherne how traherne with perhaps financial assistance from hopton had secured wils acceptance to his old oxford college brasenose merrily felt very strange she felt a tightness in her chest she leaned against the wall took deep breaths until it subsided stefan was saying something about him and traherne being two halves of the same apple traherne was a poet and a mystic wil was deeply sensitive a natural psychic a visionary in the most direct sense when wil walked out on the hills or into the oak woods the spirits came to him like the birds and animals to st francis he was a wild child possessed of a raw exciting beauty where was this leading trahernes rough trade or what merrily felt that alarming tightening in the chest and this time she couldnt make it go away she held on to the curtain to the vestry to prevent herself falling to her knees when she began to wheeze heads turned oh no not again not again no way merrily walked out mum jane stood in the porch watching her anxiously merrily took gulps of air all around her the graves were washed amberpink by the moon youre not ill again are you sorry flower i think its the fumes from all those candles you go back stefanll think we dont like it i dont do you ill tell you when its finished just go back jane ok theres nothing to worry about im just going to have a cigarette ok god said jane you cant go an hour without one can you she gave her mother one final disapproving glance before disappearing into the porch merrily turned away and leaned her arms over a tall gravestone as a red speck came up from behind another stone sorry vicar went and hid i did thought it was gonner be my minnie his cigarette end made a glowing triangle with the twin moons in his glasses hello gomer lost track of time in there ent allowed to wear my watch tonight digital see gives a bit of a bleep on the hour minnie says whats that gonner sound like in the seventeenth century eh had to sit at the back too on account of not havin a proper fancydress costume still you came im glad out here the pain in her chest had dulled to a throb gomer took a pull on his cigarette ent workin is it what ent sorry thought e was gonner hit the spot that young feller when he got on to cider but it went by see how do you mean the cider house got me thinkin that did so i come out to think sumore does a lot o thinkin these days too much time the cider house where the bulls took their women not their wives like you know their women them as was old enough to qualify as women their mistresses not even their mistresses vicar the ones they used for their sport you might say the ones as didnt count for shit scuse my language there were more like this janet i should say god bless you vicar it were cheaper than fox untin and no hounds to feed gomer shook his head sadly you looks in need of a ciggy i got a few yere ready rolled thanks but oh sod it if you can spare one gomer produced a skinny rollup and lit it for her when youre retired see god damn it you gets to hangin around and dwellin on things and all the folk you ever worked for or had a pint or two with and they all gets jumbled up in your memory and then a coupler things rolls out when you ent expectin it and you thinks well bugger me whyd ole edgar powell shoot isself accidently like why ent the cider the real stuff i dont understand ill tell you you got time im sick of keepin it all up yere cause i dont understand neither and i reckons its time we did go on well you start with the ole cider house thats the powell cider house now see the bulls originally but the powells they had it off em way back when the bulls got rid of all that ground interestin when you works out just how much bull grounds now powell ground i reckon its gotter be gomer stopped talking merrily followed his gaze towards the lychgate through which they could see car lights you notice when you come in vicar them cars parked on the edge of the square just across from the church so many these days why miserable andy mumford in one coupler young fellers in the other usually wears uniforms but plain clothes tonight mind if we just gomer set off towards the lychgate merrily following theyre on to somefhin i reckon dont waste manpower on that scale less they got somefhin in mind and that lady copper in the church theyre lookin for somebody or they got somebody in mind wheres your friend mr robinson tonight as they approached one of the parked cars had put on its lights and pulled out to make way for another vehicle which took over its space just left of the lychgate the new vehicle was a battered blue land rover with a torn canvas the drivers door opened as the wheels gritted to a halt gomer put a hand under merrilys arm and pulled her into the trees beside the gate as james bulldavies stepped down and ducked quickly under the lychgate slamming the land rover door behind him both front doors of the parked police car opened mumford and another man followed bulldavies at a distance gomer looked at merrily not my place to ask mabbe but they clear this with you the police stakin out your church and whatnot she could hear bulldaviess voice crackling into the answering machine i shall personally take action to put a stop to this homosexual farce you may consider this an ultimatum no she said they bloody didnt you better get back in there wouldnt be anythin i could do would there i think there would from the apple trees next to the porch jane watched james bulldavies go in followed by the two detectives the eternal bull it could start to get interesting at last sadly she couldnt stay for it she waited for mum to come back on her own and looking pretty fired up before she slipped away pretty foul the orchard was mine stefan alder said the spotlight hugging him like a sunbeam from a high window as he knelt at the pulpit steps looking up towards the roodscreen where a hundred apples were carved oh yes it belonged to the church the whole forty acres but it also belonged to me it was where i found my peace and my god god was always in the orchard he turned full into the light his hands held out in supplication half an apple in each his face was creamed with sweat even from the back merrily could see the film of desperation over his eyes he was losing it hed gone on too long without coffeys cohesion his performance had become shapeless and overemotional the dramatic edge was blunt the audience shuffled and coughed older ledwardine folk beginning to see the holes and there were holes despite the research richard coffey had not wanted this because he was not ready but stefan had been lured here by merrily and when the evening was discredited as a piece of faintly tedious overdramatized gay propaganda the remaining fragments of her own credibility would go with it by the light of a cluster of candles she could see a satisfied smile on the face of dermot child occasionally he would glance towards one or other of the police he would have told them lol could well be here knowing that the vicarage was now unsafe where else would she hide him one of the few pieces of information to escape dermots intelligence net perhaps would be merrilys appointment as lucys executor her receipt of the keys to lucys house although you could rely on nothing in a village this size but where much as he would enjoy the sight of lol being taken away with merrily as an accessory did bulldavies come into this shed followed them into the church prepared to battle this out now she felt drained again get it over whatever it is just get it over for god was inside every apple stefan held up the halves and here had left his mark the fivepointed star of wisdom thats not god a woman called out scornfully from the middle of the northern aisle ive seen that we all know that thats a pentacle its satanic its the mark of the serpent thats why youre supposed to cut the apple the other way stefan reeled for a moment as if struck in the face and then in a graceful piece of theatrecraft came back there dropping the apple halves he arose pointing straightarmed at the woman this is how it starts what upon a tree is more beautiful more wholesome more sacred than an apple the whole world is in an apple the apple was gods most precious gift to hereford the apple heals and yet his arm and voice dropped together he backed against the pulpit glanced from side to side hunted in the wrong hands even an apple can be poisonous and this is how it began this is where the hounding began in front of merrily annie howe leaned forward revealing the fine light hair cut close to the nape of the neck the ears exposed no earrings raised a forefinger to someone towards the front a hand went up merrily saw that it belonged to james bulldavies sprawled now in the bull family pew an arm stretched along its back although every eye was focused on him he seemed entirely relaxed stefan had left the spotlight was walking from candle to candle in a circle round the church showing how the net had gathered around wil williams who was alone now in ledwardine the muchrespected thomas traherne although still nominally the vicar of credenhill having gone to london as chaplain to sir orlando bridgeman now wil had no champion no defender no lover was the implication and one enemy stefan said arriving back at the pulpit a buzz with those words he had his audience back they didnt want to hear about his sensitivity his affinity with nature his perception of the whole world in an apple they wanted the full unexpurgated chronicle of hate we were friends tom bull and i stefan alder mused he was not a wellschooled man but he had some small understanding of latin and of the welsh language and was always eager for news of advances in the physical sciences he would dine at the vicarage and sometimes i would spend an evening at the hall and talk of letters we had received from oxford and london so what went amiss it was clear that stefan had not yet noticed james i will tell you he said the bull discovered or rediscovered an aspect of himself that he could not bear to confront stefan rose up several inches in the pulpit as though jagged lightning was working through his body abruptly he turned away and vanished into the darkness reappearing at the foot of the pulpit sitting on a step full in the spotlight what do you think he said and laughed tom bull had fallen in love a tapping on the window this time lol stood in the dark with his back to the kitchen door the front doorbell had rung twice the back door had been knocked on mr robinson lol robinson gomer parry it is see well everybody knew gomer parry even lol genial harmless gomer it was the name youd announce yourself by if you didnt want to scare someone away if you wanted them to open the door nice and quiet you listenin lol the voice said cause this is what the vicar told me tsay see er says you ready for this er says have you noticed the dick drake moon hope i got that right lol let him in anyway now that the blossom had dropped from neighbouring trees and because it was lighter tonight than the last time you could see that the apple tree man was actually very sad halfdead covered with scabs and sores and his branches stuck up like an umbrella with its fabric torn away some of the prongs bent the more jane drank the more bent they would seem against the brown sky and the brickcoloured moon she lay with her back to the tree roughly where shed lain the night colette had brought her here it had been easy to find the man in his small clearing but now she was here nothing was quite as she remembered it it was a different kind of night and a different kind of cider shed come in over the wall from the vicarage tossing the strong heavy dark green bottles before her the idea shed had from lucy of this traditional ledwardine drink made from the legendary pharisees red was that this was the booze endorsed by the fairies who were the little angels of the orchard and so it would be like nectar right the cider itself would have mystical properties shed eased out the champagnestyle cork expecting an emphatic pop like a magical starting pistol this is where it begins but the cork had merely fallen out and rolled away and although the bottles must have been shaken up getting here there was no exciting frothy rush either just this joyless dribble oh well jane had leaned back against the trunk trying not to think of edgar powell with his grizzled old head blown off that episode was a complete irrelevance and had gripped the lips of the bottle with her own and thrown her head back and then came the real shock the wine of angels was actually pretty foul to begin with it was dry horribly dry the cider she and colette had drunk that night in the ox was cheap and sweet and went down very easily and made you happy and bubbly but the wine had this cloying taste that was more like soil than apples she recalled the first time shed had real champagne at a wedding mum had conducted up in liverpool and what a bitter disappointment that had been especially out of such a brilliant bottle this was worse and this was the wine of angels named by lucy devenish she sat in the toffeecoloured night and felt like crying what it was she was bloody useless on her own she was just a kid and a townie kid as well shed tried to imagine lucy walking alongside her into the orchard but lucy was cold in the mortuary lucy was never coming back to the orchard upset and furious and frustrated jane had another drink it couldnt really be so yuk must be another sign of how immature she was that she couldnt appreciate the quality of a fine cider made to an ancient recipe fermented in the bottle but she wasnt bloody well going back now she had to go all the way with this so that nobody could say she hadnt tried shed even put on the same old blue pulp tshirt shed been wearing when colette had first brought her in here all for colette do it be there for her use your contact what she needed was to get into the same mood to find the same state of mind she went over all the events leading up to the golden lights moment getting the sequence of it starting with the outstanding time theyd had in the pub laughing at people like james bulldavies realizing they had this repartee going between them that they could be good mates if not exactly soulmates then that sweating boil dean wall and his cronies eyeing them up and coming after them the smell of urine from the gents toilets the flight past the old bowling green to the church porch the afterhours social club colettes delight at jane throwing up all over her stomach lurched at the thought of that and she pressed her hands down on it and belched this cider was so much gassier and it wasnt working shed drunk masses of the stuff or it felt like it and yet she didnt seem to be particularly drunk certainly didnt feel at all happy all the optimism was long gone the feeling that ledwardine was her real preordained home that she could really function here help mum make a go of it have some laughs with colette maybe find some cool guys together help lol get himself straightened out and organized and recording again work with lucy on reestablishing the natural way of things become more aware of the orb the orchard smelled damp and mouldy she was sure it hadnt been like this before she tried to remember the moment theyd both flopped down under the apple tree man but she couldnt her only memory was of saying she was dying and then colettes voice so cool so smokey so sassy coiling out of the ground beside her you aint felt nothinyet honeychile those really prophetic words like she really knew the score but it was just some scam to scare jane colette hadnt known a thing not then and afterwards was far too cool to think she had anything to learn from a weird old bat like lucy devenish but shed hated to feel shed been left behind by anybody she had to be the leader and on the night of her party shed impulsively led some kind of raiding party on the orchard determined to break through to whatever it was jane had accessed bust into what lucy called the orb find the contact and had vanished search was made for her and she appeared to her friends from time to time but when they spoke to her she immediately disappeared jane took another swig of the awful wine of angels and slumped back with her hair against the knobbly bark of the apple tree man still clutching the big bottle by its neck she closed her eyes lay very still and tried again she imagined colette in a land of lights separated from the orchard by a billowing night mist the point being that colette was nobody special in this place she was learning that there were higher forces and inner structures and that most of the things she thought were really cool were actually quite trivial and insignificant it was time for her to return chastened colette jane whispered you hear me you dumb slag its me ive come back ive come to fetch you there was an answering rustle of leaves from somewhere beyond the edge of the clearing it was probably a fox or a badger but in her mind jane turned it into colette she had a clear picture of colette strolling through the orchard she could see the nose stud and the red plastic windcheater open over the daring black dress the rustling came closer if she opened her eyes now she would see she was getting shivery vibrations at the back of her neck remembered dr samedi and de drummin begin feel de drummin inside fingers dancin dancin dancinup an downyo spine colette colette was coming she was coming back the urge to open her eyes was overpowering but she didnt she mustnt the moment must be absolutely right she must be very quickly seized without speaking or she would never come back she heard breathing it wasnt a fox or a badger it was her old friend colette cassidy and shed stop in the clearing the cynical cow and shed go aw janey youre not still here this is just so sad and then theyd both crease up laughing come on lady she concentrated on keeping her eyes squeezed tight tight shut and holding her breath and putting everything she had into the image of colette summoning this incredible detail a light sheen of sweat on the forehead overhung by a wing of hair a blob of mascara on the end of an eyelash the weird red moon glinting in the nosestud a slick of crimson lipstick on her avaricious little teeth when she smiled she heard colettes voice calling to her across the nights look up for me just look up once and then well go jane looked up false lover gomer said dont suppose lucy kept the odd bottle about the place helps you think better it do my experience well not better mabbe but a bit wilder like you gotter think wild to get your brain round this kinder business he certainly looked wild tonight lol recalled them watching the little guy troop past the shop one afternoon and lucy saying gomer parry was an object lesson on the dangers of retirement not the man he used to be not the man he was a year ago tonight though gomers springy white hair was on end like a lavatory brush and his eyes looked hot enough to melt the wire frames of his glasses no accident lol said going through to the kitchen you sure of that course i ent gomer snapped all im sayin see is ive used bloody hedge trimmers with more power than that little bike and it never got much stick from lucy devenish you know lucy it makes no sense theyre calling it a freak accident freak accident my arse said gomer lucy seen a ewe amblin out the hedge shed just pull over and wait for the ole thing to get across this is a country woman born bred and what you like through and through that woman could sense a sheep from fifty yards but you try tellin that to one o these bloody inquests itll be edgar powell all over again accidental bloody death if it wasnt an accident what was it suspicious is what it was you think somebody killed lucy thats a wild question gomer said but its gotter be asked see gotter be asked ent nobody else gonner ask it are they all right then its nmore than a feelin ent never gonner be no evidence now coppersve made up their minds open and shut shut for ever like a lot o stuff in this village but when the winds in the right direction pulling his tobacco tin from his jacket pocket gomer got going furiously on a rollup put it this way boy you dont dig out two thousand cesspits in thirty years without learnin what shit smells like i know the vicars taken a few shovelloads she ent deservin of and we had a bit of a chat about tonight and er says do me a favour you go round and talk to mister lol robinson about this and anythin else thats on your mind give him summat to think about stead o worryin about the colour of the moon like she said that give or take so yere i am well lol brought the presentation case of the wine of angels into the living room im glad to see you gomer ive been sitting here getting nowhere fast we can pool what we got mabbe i told you that about lucy see cause i know you and er was friends lol nodded point taken resolve strengthened he put down the wine of angels box the only bottles he could find in the house gomer sniffed no thank you boy once was enough looks like a present to lucy from the festival committee er was mabbe keepin it to donate to the christmas raffle lol observed that two bottles appeared to have been drunk already impossible gomer said nobodyd ever drink a second wine of angels balls must be fifteen year back rod powell he calls me in to dig out a couple hundred yards o drainage ditch well edgard made a few barrels of pharisees red cider strictly for their own consumption like and it was a hot day see and they gives me a jugful and by god that werent the kind o cider you forgets and this gomer brandished a bottle with some contempt ent it what is it supermarket cider boy pop not quite cheap muck not far off this never come out o the ole powell cider house the bull cider house as was id stake my jcb on it they bought this in knowing poor bloody cassidy and his flash friends wouldnt know the difference if it come out of a fancy bottle now why they done that thats a mystery lol said dubiously aye gomers glasses gleamed another bloody mystery boy you might reckon that ent got nothin to do with nothin but cider as lucy used to say was the lifeblood of ledwardine this is central boy central i know im not thinking too well tonight lol said but i dont see where this is going nor me said gomer not yet but it all smells off we looks at things and we draws conclusions and sometimes theyre wrong like the vicar sees all these coppers movin in on the church and she reckons theyre after you i think theres summat else afoot but well have to wait and see isnt it except we dont have time to wait lol said merrilys playing it by ear in there bulldavies is planning to get it stopped and drive her out of the village for good and a lot of things are closing in you know ar gomer said they stood there in lucys living room two little guys in glasses who wanted to help and didnt know how eventually lol said you know anything about wil williams gomer not a lot thomas traherne know lucy was keen on the feller thats about it lol looked across at the framed photograph of lucy and a young blonde woman feeding a pony from a bucket patricia young gomer thought for a moment no susannah hopton gomer shook his head lol picked up mrs leather opened it to the handwritten notes on the inside back cover hannah snell ar sorry hannah snell gomer said i know who she is all right he cleared his throat and began to sing in a tuneless tenor all ye noble british spirits that midst dangers glory sought let it lessen not your merit that a woman bravely fought gomer beamed thought you was some sort o folk singer lol you ent never yeard that my ole gran used to sing me that as a nipper hannah snell bugger me that takes me back tell me lol said tell me when gomer had finished he said tell merrily and christ james bulldavies came almost languidly to his feet so he leaned forward both hands on the rim of the prayerbook rack youre suggesting my ancestor was ah gay stefan alder stood defiantly in front of the pulpit he was in love with me gords sake man do we have to have this bloody playacting his voice filled the church you make accusations about my family you dont hide behind bloody wil williams you stefan alder are saying thomas bull was a poofter correct thats not a word i would use im sorry a homosexual this man with four children it doesnt make any difference you must know that but thats what youre alleging come on man you cant libel the dead spit it out all right i believe that tom bull had a physical relationship with the priest of ledwardine and when there was a danger that it would become a matter of general knowledge in the village in his family in the courts where he presided he sought to have wil condemned as a witch he had a neighbouring farmer accuse wil of diminishing the productivity of his orchard he had a local artisan who was dependent on his patronage invent a story about him dancing with sprites or even stefan glanced around his silent congregation dont stop alder bulldavies said were all agog or even paid some of the local youths to disport themselves naked in the orchard to torment poor wil beyond his powers of endurance murmurs of disbelief and disapproval mostly from the northern aisle bulldavies sighed went to an awful lot of trouble didnt he stefan had been too long in the light his hair was damp and darkened his shirt hung limp and grey with sweat what i find most objectionable is your slur on the integrity of the man you dont understand stefans face streamed he refused to move out of the light i do think tom believed in what he was doing he convinced himself that wil williams had occult powers how else could he a bull possibly fall in love with a man unless that man had bewitched him a hush merrily saw jamess hands tighten on the prayerbook shelf of the bull family pew very slowly james straightened up and walked out of the pew and into the well below the pulpit stopping two yards from stefan alder and on what he said with a clear menace do you base your evidence stefan didnt move he kept a journal did he not and you of course have seen this journal you know i cannot possibly have seen it as your family keeps it in a bank vault in hereford murmurs in the pews and unless and until you are prepared to produce this journal youre in no position even to pretend to refute any of what ive said are you james said confidently there is no journal relating to your spurious allegations in any bank vault to my knowledge in hereford or anywhere else they faced one another at the end of the tunnel of light james heavy in tweeds making stefan look even more pale and fragile somebody should stop the fight merrily thought absurdly so youve taken it out of the bank have you stefan stared into jamess eyes his body arching towards the big soldier his hands weaving in the light in an almost womanly distress when he spoke again it was in a soft imploring voice please tell us the truth james please dont hold back any more you know that tom before he died made a confession to the then priest together with an enormous donation to the church in order that his body might lie where it lies now behind me in the area between the altar and the orchard where his beloved wil lay in unhallowed ground a man who took his own life rather than face conviction for the crime of being gay conviction and betrayal at the hands of a dishonest man and a false lover who you little shit with a roar james was on him and the church exploded into light some women on the left screamed men in the centre were on their feet blinded by the glare merrily threw both hands up to her eyes and through the fingers saw figures converging on the threshing bodies below the rood screen she stumbled down the aisle towards them aware of annie howe striding in front of her scrambling up the steps under the chancel arch she saw policemen holding back bulldavies and stefan alder and she filled her lungs and screamed out in the name of god stop this and for a moment there was quiet annie howe looked up at merrily and smiled pleasantly thank you ms watkins the two detectives holding james bulldavies let him go and james stepped away from them brushed down his jacket and straightened up and stood quite stiffly looking directly across the nave at nobody the detective holding stefan did not let him go it was mumford stefan sullenly tossed his head back against mumfords shoulder mumford went rigid annie howe said bernard stephen alderson im arresting you for the murder of richard coffey you dont have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you fail to mention the rest was lost in the tumult merrily closed her eyes thank you lord full of breathless excitement and bad gassy cider jane looked up looked up in hope and then began to scream the figure rearing up in the clearing the shape hiding the moon was not colette was far too big to be colette she shrank back against the apple tree man let go of the neck of the wine of angels the bottle rolling away sloshing cider over her jeans her lips went soggy and a whimper began in her throat please she was trying to say please im drunk the figure didnt move if it was the police thered have been a powerful torchbeam in her face she was pushing herself back so hard that a spiky piece of bark was stabbing into the top of her head the pain brutally assuring her that this was not a dream jane watkins the voice was sorrowful and male and local oh god jane said her head was all fogged up she knew the voice couldnt identify it what you doing yere jane watkins whoever it was he knew the orchard too well to need a torch this is not in the best of taste id say oh god jane sat up its you the last time theyd met shed rushed up to him in a panic in the market place and hed put his big hands on her shoulders and said yes all right hed go into the orchard after colette and see what he could do and his eyes had looked sort of rangy and fearless under his paul weller fringe but even then she hadnt held out any great hopes of everything being all right two things lloyd powell said one youre too young to be drinking that ole pop two this is where my grandfather died and if hes looking down now hes gonner be disgusted he is sorry lloyd i really didnt mean to be disrespectful i thought better of you i really did young lady but you ent such a lady after all are you look at you you stink of it disgraceful i let the bottle go and it all came out she struggled to her feet stumbling about a bit which she hadnt expected the wine of angels had been so foul she hadnt really thought it would have any effect i dunno at all lloyd said just look at the state of you jane gritted her teeth he might look cool and hunky but he was just like his dad all straitlaced and backbone of the community and no sense of humour at all well he said i dont hear an explanation oh sure well actually lloyd i was conducting a mystical experiment on the lines indicated by mrs leather to try and bring colette back from the land of faerie which isnt as stupid as it sounds if people like you had ever taken the trouble to listen to miss devenish were simply talking about a parallel dimension and i know it exists because i think ive been there although i dont remember a thing it was a kind of trance state and all right it was a long shot but oh sure come on jane we better get you back to your mother before something happens to you jane stood up straight well almost she pushed her hair back behind her ears bits of bark and stuff dropping out i can get myself back thank you oh aye and how am i gonner feel something happens to you or you goes off like your friend though heaven only knows why a decent girl would want a friend like that looking at you now mind im not sure youre a decent girl after all jane dragged an angry breath between her closed teeth you could only stand so much of this look im sorry for trespassing in your precious orchard im sorry for resting under your grandads tree and most of all im sorry for drinking your disgusting cider i shall go and i said lloyd stood up right in front of her about a foot taller and nearly twice as heavy that i will take you home miss come on pick up that bottle litter that is i wasnt going to leave it i care for the countryside oh aye lloyd said all you incomers care for the country and all you farmers are just so smug you always think that whatever you dos got to be right because youve been doing it for centuries or whatever jane bent and picked up the bottle there was another one somewhere but what would he think if he saw shed brought two of the things probably that she was expecting a bloke she stuck the empty bottle under her arm and turned back towards the church but lloyd was in front of her again spreading out his long arms like an official police barrier no you dont not that way miss watkins got my truck over the other side isnt it oh for gods sake thats stupid its only a few minutes walk back to the churchyard youre going back in the truck and thats final i wanner keep my eye on you make sure you goes in the right door she was furious but she was also a bit drunk damn lloyd powell damn lloyd and damn rod and damn bloody old edgar who was too gaga to point his gun in the right direction feeling really sullen sickeningly bloody teenage she let lloyd steer her out of the clearing in the opposite direction to the way shed come in towards the farm entrance to the orchard which was out near the new road she noticed he never touched her just put out his arms like barriers the powells were such puritans or could it even be that it was like with lol and lloyd was afraid of teenage girls guys could be so strange i didnt think thered be anybody around tonight she said when they picked up the rough path through the apple trees still floury with yellowing blossom against the treacly sky i thought youd be in church with everybody else lloyd snorted with an unexpected venom he said whyd i wanner to listen to the ramblings of some poncy posing little queer who thinks he can rewrite other peoples history it wasnt clear whether he was talking about stefan or richard coffey nothing was too clear actually shed deliberately drunk too much hoping to disconnect her mind and shed succeeded hazey jane again we supposed to sit around and allow that its only a play lloyd nobodys saying its true ent they no all you know miss all you know as they emerged quite suddenly at the roadside jane said resentfully youd be surprised what i know lloyd stopped his famous white truck was parked by the kerb without lights he got out his keys unlocked the passenger door all right there was a kind of resignation in his voice he held open the door you better get in standing on the footplate hauling herself up she got dizzy stumbled again and clutched at the sidepanel to stop herself falling off in the back of the truck the pink moon shone out of dead eyes mumford and his colleague took stefan away nobody in the church attempted to follow them except for annie howe merrily caught her arm as she walked down from the chancel excuse me inspector do i have to disturb the bishop and ask him to disturb the chief constable or do i get to hear an explanation annie howe halfturned in irritation and then the woman of the hour who could afford to be magnanimous she relaxed comfortably resigned ms watkins i really am very very sorry but it did seem inappropriate at the time to tell you what we were doing besides which we didnt at that stage have what i would have considered sufficient evidence so i actually hadnt yet decided precisely how i wanted to handle it it was what you might call an ongoing situation sorry just go on talking merrily said ill tell you when ive heard enough oh god but it made terrible sense its sorted stefan had said richard wont be having anything to do with this because richard had died a bloody but not protracted death in the living room of upper hall lodge under repeated blows from a blunt instrument merrily pictured some statuette of a nude biblical male spattered with blood and brain it will be the performance of my life perhaps there wont be another james bulldavies had discovered the body when he went to confront coffey after learning about the proposed evening of drama cooked up by stefan alder and the vicar the livingroom curtains had been drawn but on the frontdoor frame was a blatant and unavoidable handprint in blood bulldavies had kicked the door in stefan it seemed had made very little attempt to conceal the killing a crime very definitely of passion but the passion was for a man over three centuries dead perhaps after tonights performance he would have given himself up so why didnt you just arrest the poor sod before the performance did the idea of an audience appeal to your ms watkins im really not obliged to justify my choice of procedure to you nor even to it was james wasnt it he wanted the entire village to know that the man attempting to defame his ancestry was not only a liar but a murderer or to conclude that because hes now revealed as a murderer he must also be a liar inspector bulldavies boomed from behind her as you so rightly say you are under absolutely no obligation to defend your methods to this woman who in my view is simply wasting police time as she has wasted everyone elses she might also care to consider that had it not been for her irresponsible promotion of this impromptu fiasco richard coffey would in all probability not have died its not my place to say hes right annie howe said but i do have to go now nobodys been permitted to leave yet by the way because we shall need the name and address of everyone here tonight dc thomas will stay and take them down why possible witnesses to what jamess assault on stefan alder may i have a word in private ms watkins merrily followed her down the central aisle through a parted sea of appallingly excited faces to the south porch look howe said im still looking for colette cassidy its possible that the death of richard coffey has absolutely no connection with that but in a village this size it would be amazing if there wasnt some kind of overlap however peripheral so thats one reason i want to know precisely who is in this building its a church its just another public building to me i thought you were looking for this laurence robinson hes one of the people we want to eliminate from our inquiries why is he here i wouldnt know merrily said no well im going back to hereford now to talk to mr alder but there will be other officers around should you wish to give them any information a celebrity murder merrily said tonelessly arent you lucky it would sound grudging meanspirited distinctly unsaintly i need some air she said outside she lit a cigarette and walked among the graves so that was it all over richard coffey dead and his play stillborn stefan alder destroyed wil williams reburied in a deeper grave the troublesome and ineffectual woman priest publicly discredited last seen plucking feebly at the sleeve of the younger woman who took all the honours god and the fates had conspired to make the world secure again for the bulls of ledwardine thank you lord and the pink moon shone down after a while merrily squeezed out the cigarette and went back into the church to find jane and go home wherever that was badger baiting lloyd laughed just an ole ewe jane picked her up from the north field this afternoon forgot she was still in the back second one just dropped dead in two days you get weeks like that no reason for it a spent eye gazed past jane who shuddered thinking of the ewe lucy had run into the one that killed her and itself that was one of the powells too presumably the trucks engine rattled into life lloyd threw it into gear switched on his lights and pulled out the last time jane had been on this road it was with bella the radio reporter bound for kings oak corner where the police had found some of colettes clothing she didnt want to be on it again heading for the spot where lucy had died why are we going up here she looked over her shoulder the village is that way because the truck he was pointing this way lloyd said exasperated and it ent a good road for doing a threepoint turn in the dark we got to carry on up yere a mile or so then reverse into morgans yard all right oh which meant they were going to pass the section where lucy had hit the sheep and then theyd have to pass it again when lloyd had turned round he had no right to do this who was he anyway who did the powells think they were generation after generation of boring councillors and selfrighteous farmers who slagged off townies for never having shagged a sheep or whatever sheep she thought of the poor lifeless ewe slung in the back of the truck and then with a flush of anger realized that if the powells had been such brilliant farmers lucy would still be alive that was one of your sheep wasnt it that lucy devenish hit like i said two ewes gone in two days lloyd said it hadnt been quite what hed said but jane pressed on not wanting to lose the impetus so where did it come from i dunno the field across from the orchard presumably he was driving with one hand on the wheel his right elbow was resting on the ledge of his wounddown window he looked pretty cool actually one of the girls at school had said shed tried to snog him once at a young farmers dance but lloyd had just kissed her limply and walked off like he had better fish to fry how did it get out what you on about the sheep i got no idea jane you would if you bothered to check your fences jane said tartly lloyd eased off the accelerator what you mean by that next to a road like this you should have decent fences and check them regularly that way sheep wouldnt get out and run in front of people and cause accidents it wasnt the sheeps fault it was yours she thought hed be angry and she didnt care but he seemed relieved making a small sound that was almost a laugh youre a cheeky little devil jane and youre just irresponsible she said ineffectually the truck jolted to a standstill jane looked out of the window for lights and saw none whyve you stopped morgans yard morgans bloody yard jane i cant see anything lloyd sighed morgans farms been derelict these past twenty years he reversed quickly and carelessly as though hed done it a thousand times at night and then with the car pointing at ninety degrees to the road took his hands off the wheel well go on then jane felt suddenly quite nervous of him take me home no lloyd said you got a bee in your bonnet about this devenish business i want it sorted she was good to me and if youd seen her lying dead in the road well i didnt but if i had id stillve thought she was a cranky meddling old troublemaker and this village better off with her gone you rotten bastard jane blurted what did she ever do to you plus lloyd said pedantically she was a danger to herself and every other roaduser two reasons one she never wore protective headgear she liked her cowboy hat and everybody knew it was her coming along it was part of her im two that ridiculous mexican poncho thing get the wind under that it blows up over your handlebars up over your head if youre unlucky which was exactly what happened wannit yes jane whispered shutting her eyes as if that would drive away the picture of lucys face under the happy summer poncho lloyd revved hard and she was flung back into the passenger seat silly bugger lloyd said and put both hands on the wheel sending the truck bolting back in the direction of ledwardine thank god for that jane thought suddenly the idea of being dumped back at the vicarage or outside the church with some snide little comment to mum about keeping her daughter off the booze seemed almost cosy she only hoped the speed lloyd was going that no more sheep had strayed on to the road there was a cold explosion in her head oh god second one just dropped dead in two days you get weeks like that no reason for it hed said not and that makes it two with the one lucy devenish ran into he was saying it had already dropped dead how could he possibly know that plus that poncho thing up over your head if youre unlucky which was exactly what happened wannit how did he know that how did he know lucy had been lying dead with the poncho over her face when he said he hadnt seen her nobody had except jane and bella and the police whod immediately concealed the area lloyd put his headlights on full beam as the truck began jolting like all the tyres had gone flat or something whats happening whys it gone all bumpy short cut lloyd said tersely in the green glow from the dashboard he looked angry no its not where are we going he rounded on her shut up whats the matter what have i done this is all your bloody fault you stupid little cow i never bloody wanted this i tried to be fair with you and you just kept pushin it and pushin it and pushin it you couldnt leave well alone i dont know what you mean what have i said its not what you said its what you made me say leadin me on all the time laying traps you come yere you all think youre so smart you and your universityeducated parents and all i ever went to was the local agricultural college all laughing behind your hands bloody ole yokels well show em how to organize emselves oh you think youre so were not my mother dropped out of university jane said desperately grabbing at a change of topic anything not to do with sheep and road accidents she got pregnant shes worked really hard all her life were not posh townies mums family came from shut your bloody clever little gob the truck slithered to a greasy stop let me think take me home jane discovered she was crying she didnt feel disgusted with herself anybody would cry in this situation please lloyd youve had that miss you wont get home now where are we she made a grab for the door handle he reared over her she screamed the scream floated away out of the window into nowhere dont make me touch you lloyd said jane got both hands to the doorpull but it just kept clicking and the door didnt open dont work from the inside nmore lloyd said i was gonner get him fixed then i saw he had his uses gomer caught up with merrily under the porch lantern vicar hold on he was out of breath she stepped outside again although she didnt think she could bring herself to explain what had happened gomer seen em fetchin im out vicar at least four people told me the story tween church street and the market should be moren halfway round the county by now forget that that dont matter see you gotter get back in there fore they all leaves sorry you gotter tell em the truth dear gomer she sighed i dont know any truth any more and if i did nobody would want to hear it from me i know the truth me and lol we figured it if youd just give me chance gomer whatever it is its too late ent gomer said obstinately she shook her head ive got to find jane he followed her back into the porch vicar you gotter listen lol see hes been puttin me in the picture bout a lot o things you been keepin to yourself too long then he shouldnt have its all been a waste of time and i shouldve known better inside the porch sitting on the stone bench like a smug gnome dermot child smirked at her quite an interesting night reverend in spite of everything im sure the repercussions will be many and varied whos that gomer peered sourly at him ah its you mr child didnt recognize you with your dick in your pants he held open the church door for merrily gomer hear me out vicar at the prayerbook table just inside the door detective constable ken thomas was sitting taking names ken was local well known to most of the villagers and merrily too he was a nice man overweight and approaching retirement age therefore consigned by howe to such menial clerical tasks as this he didnt seem to mind you ent gonner write my full name down are you ken jim prosser was saying just put jim shop youll remember but she wont and shes the one matters that girl that girl could be divisional commander next year way things are going its called accelerated promotion tonights likely shoved her up two more rungs bugger me jim prosser said behind him brenda his wife fussed with her inappropriate crinoline behind her dr kent asprey looked impatient rod powell dignified and unconcerned james bulldavies heritage vindicated hung out by the pulpit aloof chin thrust out gazing up at the opaque apple window on the opposite side of the church to the bull chapel where merrily was convinced hed earlier hacked his way into a seventeenthcentury tomb but who would ever learn about that now nobody seemed to notice merrily there was no sign of jane probly gone home lookin for you gomer said well find her dont you worry bout that now wheres quiet vestry he held back the curtain and almost pushed her inside jane wrapped her arms around herself shrinking into the corner where the sunken passenger seat ended and the metal partition separated her and the dead sheep in the back of the truck this was the powell farm on the wrong side of the new road the village a sparse and distant glimmering through the orchard im not getting out i want to go home youve got to take me home stop whining bitch lloyd said i gotter think he was clutching the steering wheel tightly with both hands as though he wanted to bang his head on it the film of sweat on his forehead was limegreen in the dashlight the engine was chunnering a smell of petrol inside the cab mixed with cattle feed and manure then let me get out ill walk home i can see youve got a lot on your mind ive told you to stop that lloyd looked up from the wheel his face severe but kind of bland like his dads like being moved by anything was a weakness genetically eradicated in the powells centuries ago you think were stupid you think you can softtalk me and ill let you go and youll toddle off back to your mother and tell her all about what the bad powells done to poor miss devenish i dont know what youre talking about jane lied desperately i know you wouldnt do anything to lucy just let me go home lloyd im a bit pissed and everything and i probably wont remember a thing in the morning just let me go back to the orchard and ill find my own way home all right whyd you do that he leaned back curious now whyd you take that bottle of cider into the orchard couldnt very well drink it at home could i and that was where colette and i came on why there why under that tree i dont know colette colette colette colette he slammed a fist into the wheel that little slapper you want me dont you dont you lloydie piece of rubbish piercing her body advertising herself and they paid for that to go to the cathedral school jane said i think im going to be sick right lloyd leaned on his door a second later he was opening hers from the outside out she didnt want to get out she wondered if she could slide across and somehow start the truck and lloyd gripped her arm above the elbow and squeezed on the muscle until she screamed in pain out outside there were hulking buildings without lights barns and sheds the air smelled of working farm go on then jane she struggled out on legs that felt like foam rubber and stood shivering in a stiffened rut made by tractor wheels the raspberry moon shone out of a bitter chocolate sky she did want to heave now but she wouldnt not in front of him not to order like a prisoner im a prisoner you wanner be sick be sick its gone off she looked around for somewhere to run but they were in a kind of stockade fencing topped by barbed wire you ent leaving now jane dont get ideas and dont try and fool me with any ole crap about you dont understand im gonner tell you so you will understand only fair that is lucy devenish see she come up to talk to father about colonel bulldavies and his ole man thinking as father could help her clarify a few points its nothing to do with me jane said hopelessly honestly cant you no i bloody cant too softhearted thats my trouble i can feel sorry see but it dont get you nowhere the little fluffy lambs still gotter be killed the ole sows still gonner wind up hanging by her back legs its the way of the world and some you ent sorry for like the fox when the ole fox starts rootin around hes gotter go fast bang lloyd clapped his big hands and that was the way lucy devenish went clean and neat and efficient no jane threw her hands over her ears i dont want to know father driving the truck he pulls in front of the little bike i tumbles out the ole dead ewe smack happens in a twinkling she dont know a thing takes off like an owl from a branch dead before she hit the ground wouldnt surprise me their hearts ent too strong that age efficient that was efficient youre completely insane she wouldntve suffered anyway lloyd said reassuringly wed justve banged her ole head one more time on the tarmac we can be humane see when we need to be ole lucy she was a nuisance no question got these funny ideas and she couldnt leave well alone and she got father in a right state the stuff she was comin out with but he shrugged she was still one of us so when shes in the way when shes gotter go then its done humanely he nodded and smacked the side of the truck his cleancut face shining in the moonlight with pride at a job well done he straightened up stood with his hands on his hips and contemplated jane and then theres you he said i suppose im in the way too momentarily astonished at how calm her voice sounded now there was no need to pretend any more now that there was nowhere to run and nobody to hear her screams she looked up at the pink moon and it occurred to her that this could be the last moon she would ever see she felt full of hate and terror but hazy too hazey jane cursing the night but remote from it all somehow because people like lloyd just couldnt be not in the modern world i cant make up my mind see lloyd said what you are a fox or a lamb or even a badger you ever been on a badgerdig no thats disgusting illegal now mind but it goes on it has to go on see else how we gonner keep em down had him near enough wiped out in these parts once ole brock pesky ole bugger but the conservationists who know best see from their offices in london and them places they lets the badger back to spread tuberculosis through our herds badgers coming back as fast as townies in their holiday cottages and they said we couldnt touch em that was never proved jane said clutching at another conversational straw tuberculosis never proved arseholes it wasnt all im saying badger on my land he goes down and if i can have a bit of fun with him before he goes wheres the harm there hes dead anyway at the end what difference is half an hour gonner make not badger baiting jane said faintly aye if you wanner call it that feller from up north he brings his terriers once in a while ole brock he gets dug out we throws him to the dogs its a bit of fun its cheap nobody gets harmed cept the badger and thats his fault for being a badger and the dogs sometimes but we stitch em up no problem thats despicable why his face puckered slightly in genuine puzzlement you dont look at things the right way round a savage bastard he is the badger when he gets going or if its a female with young or any kind of female asking for it daring you to do it lloyd leaned against his white truck arms folded asking for it he repeated he looked up at the moon in a parody of a wheedling posh female voice he said you want me dont you lloydie turned to jane they all want you see women bit of a catch a farmer always was you get stuck with the wrong one mind shes hard to dislodge so you gotter get it right drummed into me from early on this was you gotter get it right she didnt know what he was saying gotter get it right he hacked a heel into one of the trucks back tyres meantimes he said you does a bit of badgerbaiting kind of thing come along jane ill show you the ole cider house deep offence as each name was written down by dc thomas the person was allowed to go few had there was perhaps a sense that this electric night was not yet over the laborious procedure at least had given merrily time to assemble her thoughts after gomer had told her about hannah snell and the rest they had gone back outside gomer to report back to lol and find jane while merrily had made three slow circuits of the church trembling with a fearful excitement all the time the thoughts assembling in her head like blocks falling together compacting until she found she was looking at a solid stone staircase leading all the way to the top of the vicarage now she was walking back into the church where ken thomas was coming to the end of his list she stopped by his table merrily watkins she said the vicarage ledwardine i merrily rose watkins the image from the installation service of an empty church something crawling up the stoneflagged aisle naked and pale and wracked and twisted poor wil you came in the evening when the weight was too much to bear you came in and you locked the door behind you and shed your hated clothing and went down on the cold stones and crawled sobbing on hands and knees along the aisle and up the chancel steps until the altar was above you and there you showed yourself to god and you called out is this rightis this right you all right vicar ken thomas said sorry miles away been a long night ken said he lowered his voice bloody disgrace her not saying a word to you humiliating you like that shouldve told you no excuse for it complain i would merrily shook her head thanks anyway she started to walk away then went back ken i dont suppose youll be hanging around for a while well im supposed to call in but most times theyve got a job remembering who i am these days you rather i stayed until you locked up i think i would we had a bit of vandalism earlier what was that then well its kind of complicated if you stick around all will be clear possibly she moved slowly towards the chancel past james bulldavies who was still standing on his own while alison watched him thoughtfully leaning over the back pew of the northern aisle merrily didnt look at james she walked halfway along the chancel past the choir stalls to the spot where shed imagined the twisted naked thing that was wil williams asking is this right is it the right thing shed said to lol thats the only question isnt it when you think about it and it had seemed right to find the truth and lay it out she could have become a lawyer working the criminal and civil courts towards a similar end the first courtrooms had surely been constructed in imitation of churches down to the presence of the bible but in church there was only one judge the preacher in the pulpit was merely an advocate at worst a hellanddamnation prosecutor but is it the right thing to do merrily walked up to the altar and knelt and prayed for guidance if this is wrong she said aloud maybe you could just strike me down everyone else seemed to have lol looked into the box of the wine of angels to confirm that two bottles were indeed missing he showed gomer the dancing gates story in mrs leathers book its obvious she thinks she can reach colette she thinks lucy wants that gomer was dubious shed go down there on her own to the place where ole edgar done isself in merrily had given him a key to the vicarage and hed been in there to make sure there was no jane all the way to the top floor nothing except for a little black cat watching him from the hallstand its where they both went once whether she fully believes it or not shell think she has to try it right then gomer said lets not waste no more time with a long rubber torch theyd found in the kitchen they went the back way over lucys fence across the old bowling green towards the orchard i dont know what to say about this kind o thing gomer said when i was a boy people laughed when my granny was a girl nobody laughed whats that barely a century for hundreds of years folk never questions theres more in an orchard more in a cornfield few decades of computers and airconditioned tractors even the farmers thinks its all balls sad ent it computers and airconditioned bloody tractors watch yourself lol said theres brambles all over the place aye gomer chuckled wryly through his ciggy some orchard this is never could figure it they gets buggerall off it but they keeps it tickin over plants a couple o new trees every year chops down a dead un for firewood but they wont plough him up start again do it proper superstition i used to reckon disguised as concern for the village heritage but you look at rod powell do he look like a superstitious man whats a superstitious man look like superstitious man looks more like you lol you want the truth thank you gomer more like you than powell is all whyd he go along with the wassailing then no way he could refuse cassidy says its in the interests of the village powells a councillor bugger me gomer stopped in the clearing where the apple tree man stood twin pink moons in his glasses gave him a nightmare quality ive fuckin got it boy why the wine of angels tastes like its been through a horse listen cassidy he wants to revive the ole cider industry right well thats a tall order given all the established firms but if they does manage to get it off the ground the first thing happens see is they get the experts in and they looks at this lot and cracks up laughin grub the bloody lot up theyd say not cost effective plough up the whole flamin orchard plant some nice neat rows of dwarf trees could you have a dwarf pharisees red pharisees red red streak wheres the difference orchardins moved on it ent what it was so why dont the powells want it dug lol stared down at the base of the apple tree man oh jesus gomers grin was savage youre thinkin wild at last boy when merrily came down from the altar caroline cassidy was waiting for her i dont know why im still here i dont really know why i came terrence refused he said he would prefer to wait by the phone i almost walked out when poor stefan made that woman tell the story about the girl who was raped and then hanged herself with that story merrily realized now poor stefan was making more of a point than he imagined knowing that these things have always happened to young girls doesnt make it any better caroline said people got away with it then merrily said now they seldom do perhaps she thought were here to bring peace to the spirits of old victims perhaps thats the secret of restoring balance to a community theyve been stopping motorists and showing them her photograph caroline said now theyre even talking about some sort of reconstruction though what use that would be in a village this size i cant imagine get it on television again whats the use of that colettes dead no no caroline warded off merrilys protests with an impatient wave dont give me the obligatory platitudes i only wish i only wish shed been going through a nicer phase when shei mean some people had a chance to grow up to change for the better and didnt wont be many mourners for richard coffey will there horrible man its poor stefan one feels sorry for i would hate im sorry dont think i know what im saying stefan could be a free man in a few years and getting more acting jobs than ever merrily said it is actually coffey i feel sorry for caroline look im going to start something in a minute and if the other bit disturbed you it could be fairly painful so if you want to leave this might be a good time it wont be caroline said absently there wont be any more good times for us here merrily stepped up to the pulpit and for the first time ever took out the microphone from the shelf underneath she pushed in the jackplug switched on tapped the mike heard a thump from both sides of the rood screen she needed this tonight there were a lot of people a lot of tension and she didnt want to have to shout to sound like a preacher right erm could i could i have your attention the sound was far louder than shed expected everyone stopped speaking even bulldavies turned round merrily moved back from the mike perhaps when kens finished taking the names those of you who are interested in er the truth about wil williams and er and other things might like to return to your pews thank you lol held up the wine of angels bottle in the beam of gomers long black torch unopened the apple tree man was still heavily blossomed despite the dead branches lol thought of dickenss miss havisham in her wedding dress grotesque wrong gomer bent down to sniff the grass the other bottle got opened my guess and some got spilled but wheres he gone that bottle was it likely shed wandered off drinking out of the bottle but that wasnt what happened last time shed be trying to replicate that to summon the little golden lights and then colette maybe she cleared off when she heard us coming she wouldnt know who it was jane jane no answer what do we do now gomer gomer was looking at the apple tree man i was yere when ole edgar blowed his head off accident balls if that were an accident any moren lucy what somebody killed no you pillock he killed hisself all right but it werent no accident bulldavies fixed that inquest verdict i reckon just like the bulls always fixed things for the powells on account the powells fixed other things for the bulls how do you know it was deliberate comin to it ent i see edgar powell he was ninety year old near enough and quite a few bales short of a full barn by then so edgars standin yere with both barrels ready to go and anybody can see the poor ole bugger cant remember why the hell hes come wassailin what the hell do edgar know about wassailin specially not the foreign kind them cassidys organized all hes pickin up is aggravation mrs cassidy yellin at lucy lucy yellin back and it all boils up into a mush until its time to do the business and rod gives the ole feller a nudge and mabbe up until then hes been asleep on his feet like an ole shire horse and he comes round with a jerk i seen this hes standin gomer walked about five yards back from the tree and dug a doc marten heel into the grass yere just about and he looks down and i swear to god the look come on his face i thought the ole boy was gonner mess his britches not scared exactly more hunted like hunted aye days later it come to me what lucy devenish said mabbe a split second fore that can never remember the exact words see but it was about causin offence to the tree and all that lives yere lies yere deep offence summat like that and that was what put the shits up ole edgar i reckon and then he done hisself gomer spat out the remains of his rollup before it could burn the skin off his lips she meant the spirits lol said ar but what did edgar think she meant you know what id like lol id like to bring ole gwynneth out yere and ave a bit of a dig around this yere tree but if theres something buried here and the powells know about it why would they let them hold the wassailing here where else in this orchard you gonner ave it nice clearin see for the folk to gather in and so mrs cassidy dont ladder her tights on no brambles sides it wouldnt worry rod rod wouldnt turn a hair it was just edgar comin out of his stupor realizin where he is and hearin the voice of doom lucy lucy god rest her soul meanwhile theres jane ar lets be realistic yere lol some bastard mighter took er lol said you dont like the powells do you important to get the voice right firm but not preachy not hectoring not clever after stefan and james they wouldnt be sure who they could believe and on the last occasion the reverend watkins stood before them in this church shed had to be helped out of it she looked around the congregation there were about sixty people in church though the men and women were not separated any more except for alison kinnersley and the eternal bull sprawling in the bull pew ted clowes had gone dermot child had gone possibly a good sign who could tell ok pushing up the sleeves of her illgotten black cashmere sweater earlier tonight someone went into the bull chapel and broke into the tomb of thomas bull fewer gasps than might have been expected but understandably so given the preceding drama ken thomas appeared interested anyone want to confess she asked jim prosser who couldnt have appeared less guilty not a murmur anyone like to finger anyone else too public merrily looked directly at alison kinnersley she was wearing a dark tweed suit with a cameo brooch she didnt look like a mistress i mean it wasnt desecration it wasnt black magic in that as far as i could see the body remained undisturbed but something i think was removed whatever it was there was a little space for it just under the feet of the effigy of tom bull my guess is a journal or part of one just the relevant pages she paused say for instance the record of a certain incident she waited she shifted her gaze from alison now a shadow to the roof timbers clasped her hands loosely in front of her i know this sort of thing is often best kept in the family in the loosest sense o k alison kinnersleys long sigh was audible the length of the nave what do you want me to say youve been very astute vicar he brought it into the hall when he came back to phone the police about coffey under the circumstances he was less careful than he usually is he slipped it into a drawer in his desk merrily risked a glance at bulldavies he remained motionless his arm along the back of the pew there was enough light to show that his face had hardened his mouth tightened his eyes seemed to have retreated under the heavy brow i read it of course alison said and youre quite correct it relates to wil williams and it looks pretty genuine i suppose you want to know what it says bulldavies stood at once and spun like a soldier on parade he pointed as hed done earlier at stefan throwing out an arm as though it held a sword you he said have no damned right i have every right a voice that wanted to shed some old burden as you implied vicar im fam miss kinnersley merrily tapped on the microphone not the time not yet i dont want to cause any undue distress perhaps it would be better if you didnt actually reveal the contents of those papers at this stage there was a low but perceptible moan of disappointment from disabled miss goddard sitting next to minnie parry who still kept looking around for gomer merrily said into the microphone perhaps i can save you the trouble anyway does it perhaps offer an entirely new perspective on wil himself a hush i dont actually know what you mean alison said like that i am not actually the first woman priest of ledwardine vision the cider house he took her in the ole cider house where they say he took all his women because the air itself in there they used to say the smell of it could make you drunk sos you wouldnt notice the cider house it was always the ole cider house it made you drunk to be in there and wanton the description with its overtones of the erotic and the forbidden had lodged in janes mind but surely the woman whom stefan had called bessie couldnt have been referring to this hellhole jane was no longer in the least bit drunk she was far from wanton she was frightened of what would happen she was cold the cider house was damp had no windows was lit by a fluorescent strip set into the low roof of blackened timber which sent a wobbly purplish hospital sort of light up the thick walls of old discoloured bricks there was a putrid smell like rotten potatoes the cider house was a nasty place no one would ever buy a bottle of the wine of angels if they thought it had been produced in here it couldnt have been surely yet all the equipment was here there was a mill a big stonesided tub that you put the apples in so that they could be crushed to pulp by the great stone wheel it was pulled round by a horse or in this case pushed by men leaning on a projecting pole of wood or metal this one was so dirty it was difficult to tell which and there was a press like a giant printing press a wooden scaffold with an enormous wooden screw down the middle to tighten a sandwich of slabs and squeeze the juice from the pulped apples over the mill was a kind of hayloft full of black bin sacks there was no sign of apples even rotten ones but why should there be the harvest was five months away still it was all wrong so filthy that the old rustic machinery looked like engines of pain from some medieval torture chamber jane sat huddled against a wall describing the cidermaking process as if to a party of visitors going into all kinds of detail most of which was probably wrong you had to give your mind something to do try and think of something normal and interesting it was useless in this atmosphere closing your eyes and trying to put yourself on a beach in tunisia or a fishing harbour in greece or an exhibition of nice clean paintings by mondrian of course hygiene was never considered terribly important in cidermaking in the old days jane said indeed it was frequently asserted that in some areas a dead rat would always be added to give it a certain piquancy which was one ingredient they wouldnt go short of in this dump in trying to make herself laugh jane only succeeded in crying again and asking herself between sobs why a respectable councillor and his son should want to kill a lovable old lady on a moped come up to talk to father about colonel bulldavies and his ole man thinking as father could help her clarify a few points got father in a right state the stuff she was comin out with it was the way he was so matter of fact about it lucy must have gone to see councillor powell directly after talking to jane in the street what could she possibly have said to get garrod powell in a state and how could you tell jane started to laugh again was this what they called hysteria the lock scraped and the great thick oak door cranked open and lloyd was standing there the big key dangling and night behind him he ent back jane lloyd said grumpily said hed be back before ten he stared at jane suspicious what you laughing at what you done normally she would have said wouldnt you like to know something sarky not with lloyd lloyd wouldnt recognize even sarcasm it wasnt that he wasnt intelligent he probably was that was what was so awful you learned that you had to play everything dead straight like when shed said in sudden disgust at his sniffy narrowminded attitude towards colette that she was going to be sick hed taken it literally she was scared to mention colette didnt dare ask herself why nothing she said i havent got anything to laugh at have i i dont understand why youre doing this you dont think people arent looking for me by now do you lloyd looked appalled insulted nobody ever looks yere fathers a magistrate he used to be on the police committee grandfather was chairman of planning for many years greatgrandfather was to have been mayor of hereford but he died like a litany i expect youll be standing for the council too then jane said when im thirtyfive jesus said jane nice language from a vicars daughter oh yeah jane lost it and how nice is it she sprang to her feet to keep a vicars daughter in this disgusting pit lloyds expression didnt change two things he said one my father was not in favour of the appointment of your mother but he was prepared to support her in the interests of local democracy two you wouldnt be yere if you hadnt behaved like a little slut would you jane pushed her knuckles into her eyes he couldnt be like this really not cool slimbutmuscular lloyd powell in his denims and his white truck not hunky lloyd the young farmers news centrefold how could genetics be so horribly linear how could this not be a stupid nightmare not going to cry this time she wrenched her fists away from her face and blinked he was still there and to think we thought you looked like a young paul weller whos paul weller said lloyd god anyway lloyd said i just come to say father ent back yet and when he is ill be bringing him in to you and let him decide decide what you know he said uncomfortably dont ask she bit her lip hard i dont know what youre going on like that for lloyd said its all your fault we got that much on now see with the festival and all what did what did lucy tell your father to make him so upset business is that of yours he said sternly im sure she didnt mean to oh you are are you it was probably all a mistake its very easy to get things all wrong if you let me go she let the sentence trail off because lloyd had put his hands on his hips and his head to one side you really do think were stupid dont you no i i dont trying to softtalk me now is it like im some mad psycho lord above jane it ent like that we are ordinary people who serve the local community as best we can and have done for many generations god he was as much of a museum piece as the cider press and you always serve the bulldavieses dont you she said the bulls our families have had a close relationship for a number of years yes we dont serve them that times gone we respect them and they respect us its mutual respect that holds a rural community together in a way you dont get in the cities thats why you got all this crime and drugs and street violence what she couldnt hold it back you just confessed to a murder confessed lloyd stormed into the cider house kicked the door shut with his heel you calling me a common criminal miss like it was wrongto stop that woman spreadin her filth and lies and undermining a stable community built on respect thats whats criminal jane he towered over her one foot half over both of hers she cowered instinctively which seemed to excite him father ent back soon he said i ent gonner wait why dont you go and look for him shut your mouth jane before i he stepped back and pulled something out of his jeans jane screamed only my mobile jane lloyd opened the phone and moved closer to the fluorescent tube i phoned him twice but he wont take his phone into church see not respectful he stabbed out the number and waited with the phone at his ear come on father come on funny thing she saw his mouth twist in amusement over the lip of the mobile i thought you were a bit different at first even thought you might make a wife in a year or two funny how first impressions can be deceiving it was lucy devenish who put us on to it merrily said though i suspect it was me coming here that put lucy on to the idea i dont think she could prove it but she was expecting it to be proved the arrival in ledwardine of a female minister well she seems to have thought that would set something off and perhaps it did certainly in the vicarage but thats ill come back to that if i can the amazing thing was not that everybody shed looked at including james bulldavies and alison kinnersley had shown genuine surprise but that nobody out there now looked sceptical most were clearly intrigued bulldavies seemed confused and unhappy only garrod powell as usual was expressionless merrily felt strangely and completely relaxed all the pressure had lifted from her chest she was not nervous her breathing was even theres no reason to doubt that the person who became wil williams was indeed a protegee of susannah hopton of kington having been introduced to her in the s it seems more likely to me that mrs hopton would have taken a girl into her house than a man and a hardup radnorshire hill farmer would be rather more likely to spare his daughter than his son certainly mrs hopton would have been fascinated by someone so utterly committed to the christian life that she was prepared to abandon her womanhood for it let me get this right mrs watkins bulldavies said you are suggesting that williams managed to con his or her way through university and bamboozle the church of england into accepting her as a man and then went on to practise as a clergyman for several years without once yes its ridiculous no one would get away with it have you heard of hannah snell james should i have hannah snell was born in worcester about a century after wil williams she made a name for herself on the london stage singing songs and telling tales of her bizarre life which began the bizarre part when her husband a dutch sailor disappeared hannah went off to try and find him joined the army later the marines travelled as far as india was obliged on occasion to share abed with servicemen and was also allegedly stripped to the waist for a flogging during all that time nobody seems ever to have spotted she was a woman thats true jim prosser shouted a fact that is and she wasnt butch neither apparently merrily said and there was nothing about this in the bull journal they must have discovered the truth about wil after death at least nothing that i could see alison said shed left her seat at the back and moved to the choir stalls possibly to observe jamess reaction it concerns the death itself more than anything james looked sullen again well come to that merrily said im just trying to show that if hannah snell could pass herself off as a frontline fighting man for over five years then it would certainly be possible for a young woman to get through college and become ordained and serve as a priest especially if she had the support of people of the order of susannah hopton and thomas traherne merrily switched off the microphone leaned over the pulpit look we know hardly anything about the real wil williams and i doubt were ever going to we presume she went to oxford as a man perhaps there are records i dont know we can only speculate about many things like why the estimable thomas traherne who so loved hereford and delighted in the countryside should have gone so readily to london perhaps he too was in love and knew better than anyone why it was doomed thats an enchanting thought said mrs goddard the crippled horsewoman he never married you know he died at thirtyseven bulldavies snorted merrily wondered whether lol robinson who was also thirtyseven knew that traherne had died at precisely that age she was suddenly worried about lol and jane she would have to end this soon what must itve been like for her though effie prosser said a woman alone in that big vicarage pretending to be a man merrily thought for a moment before responding i know exactly what it was like youre really a man are you mrs watkins mr davies said mrs goddard im getting rather tired of the sound of your voice please go on mrs watkins well she wouldnt have been alone merrily said thats the first point ministers in those days i gather were rather more upmarket than they are today so there would have been servants certainly other people in that house from whom she would have had to hide the truth can you imagine the problems that would cause shed have no privacy in her own house except merrily no longer wanted to be in the pulpit she wanted to be a woman not just a minister she came down and sat on the chancel steps as stefan as wil had done except in the attic i feel that the attic was the only place where she felt free to be a woman even her bedchamber on the first floor would have been cleaned and tidied by a maid so it would have to be a masculine room when im on that floor particularly i sometimes sense a constriction perhaps i imagine that perhaps its psychological or perhaps you are psychic said mrs goddard brightly merrily tried to look dubious i feel she went through quite a lot of pain both emotional and physical flattening her chest deepening her voice never daring to show herself in public without the bindings or corsets or whatever she wore unlike traherne she couldnt go out in the countryside with any sense of freedom she couldnt even go into her beloved orchard and just be herself without the risk of being seen the images were coming to her as she spoke she felt she was quivering with vision so she made a place for herself a dark secret place where she could perhaps keep womens clothes parade at night in the flimsiest most frivolous of dresses and weep silently of course always silently in the attic of the vicarage i saw her oh my god i saw her i its funny she looked up my daughter jane was drawn to the attic from the moment she entered the house i was thinking what a miserable draughtylooking house it was and jane was dashing upstairs and claiming the attic for herself she thought of the mondrian walls which had become orchard walls had whoever became wil williams lain up there and closed her eyes and dreamed of walking out as a woman smelling apple scents seeing those little golden lights among the branches and floating like jane on cheap cider had the presence the spirit of the orchard manifested there it was getting on for midnight gomer sat down at the base of the tree where the moon couldnt find his glasses all right he said ill tell you why i dont like the powells lol was getting restive he didnt know what to do but he wanted to be doing it could gomer make it brief ent a long story went back mainly to that day fifteen or so years ago when rod hired gomer parry plant hire to dig some drainage ditches the hot day when hed had some of edgars excellent cider made from the pharisees reds except the cider wasnt served up by edgar or rod who were both at a cattle sale that day jennifer it was jennifer powell jennifer adair who used to work in the kitchen at the black swan lloyds mother and rods missus and a hell of a nice girl erdve been about thirty at the time and lloyd was ten and rod was forty and a bit more they likes em younger the powells and they dont marry till late cut a long story short it was clear jennifer powell had been crying and if you knew her motherinlaw meggie powell it didnt take long to work out she was the reason tough wasnt the word for meggie powell built like a hereford bull face to match said gomer bit less feminine mabbe when the flu epidemic took off half the fellers worked at the slaughterhouse there used to be bottom of ole barn lane meggie filled in for a fortnight that kind o woman you know good wife to edgar mind all senses of the word good mother to garrod likewise by which i means likewise aw shit said lol ar sixtyseventh woman edgar slept with sure tbe first one for rod youre kidding it was normal enough then boy some families normal sex education like well not normal but not uncommon teach em young teach em how it all works selfsufficiency see look after your own dont make a mess but if you do make sure you clears up after yourself and above all keep it quiet what rural life was all about in the old days feller beat up his wife in the city all the neighbours knew about it same thing happened in the country well all the neighbours knew about it too but they kept quiet anybody got really out of hand they got dealt with one way or another the powell women were chosen with care gomer said there were traditions they had to observe had to be a special sort of woman which was not always the prettiest well look at meggie by the time a powell married usually at thirtyfiveplus hed sown his wild oats over a wide area and was ready to settle down and pass on his knowledge to the next generation by powell standards however rod chose unwisely jennifer adair was too prissy too genteel and on the day fifteen years ago when rod and his old man were at the cattle sale and jennifer powell learned in a heart to heart with meggie what was going to be expected of her in relation to lloyd in a couple of years time jennifer fled the premises and wound up weeping into the upholstery of gomers jeep what it come down to er knowed rod mustve put it about though he never said much and she never asked like but one thing she couldnt cope with was the thought of spendin the rest of her life sleeping next a feller slept with meggie what happened i seen her point and give her a lift to hereford station and a hundred quid and she ent been back to this day and not a word lol boy cause if rod ever finds out im a dead man and that ent a figure of speech like behind that wooden mask garrod powells the bitterest bastard youll ever meet never married again after jennifer walked out never a girlfriend not seemly like not proper plus hes doubly suspicious of all women he dont like women but you puts that together with a sex drive could light up half the county you got a few big question marks innit this common knowledge gomer were never exactly common knowledge except to the few of us working over a wide area of farms and such and nowadays when half the folk in ledwardine was living other side of the country three year ago ole rods a councillor and a gentleman and lloyds the decentest politest boy youd want your daughter to fetch back for sunday tea im confused lol massaged the back of his neck where the ponytail used to lie he was thinking about patricia young i dont know whether were looking at the bulls or the powells there you hit it boy peoples always looked at the bulls in the big house looks at the bulls dont see the powells but them two families been linked up for years centuries lives are entirely separate o course bulls is walkin out with nice ladies doin the huntball circuit and what have you the powells is huntin on another level when mammy done her bit see the old mand take over their education take the boy into town bit further away ledbury abergavenny mabbe show him how to hunt and not get hunted powells liked to marry late like i said so thered be plenty of huntin for a good few years but theres huntin and theres baitin what the difference baitins where you brings em back gomer said grimly the loft it was the part shed been worrying about merrily walked up the two steps to the chancel to whisper to alison in the choir stalls i know alison said i know what youre asking and now im not so sure i mean for christs sake look at him james sat with his head bent as if in prayer revealing a bald patch like a tonsure sooner or later somebodys going to have to explain whats in the journal merrily said and it isnt going to be james is it and if i dont do it youll tell him who i am what im doing here right no merrily said im never going to tell him its not my place emotions crowded alisons starkly beautiful face merrily tried to see a resemblance there to james and couldnt you see its changed some things alison said fundamental things i havent taken in half this stuff tonight ive just sat there going over and over it look merrily said whatevers in there both you and james know exactly what it is while everybody else is going to speculate for generations it needs to come out were exorcizing this village tonight you must have sensed that i dont trust what i sense alison said not any more as alison walked from the choir stalls to the chancel steps james bulldavies came out into the aisle alison no no alison walked down the steps merrily moved back against the pulpit its getting bloody late and im tired james said im tired of defending my family against a load of pure fantasy and im tired of you mrs watkins im tired of your smugness your highhandedness and im tired of your bloody voice mr davies sit down this instant mrs goddard shook off her daughters hand and rose painfully from her pew i want to hear what mrs watkins and this young woman have to say and i want you to hear it too youre emerging as even more of an obnoxious man than we thought and a liar to boot dont show yourself to be a coward as well sit down he didnt sit down but he didnt leave he went to stand at the back near the vestry curtain dc ken thomas was watching him alison stood just forward from the rood screen with its wooden apples her voice was muted but distinct what we learn from the journal is that wil williams was buried on the wrong side of the ditch he she did not commit suicide yes said mrs goddard as if shed known all along thomas bull says nothing about having a physical infatuation with the minister but he does say he came to believe he was bewitched the implication is by wil he doesnt say that bulldavies shouted in pain from the back of the church of course not merrily said but he wouldnt would he i think we can assume he was tortured in all kinds of ways he was frightened of his own feelings which were foreign to everything hed always understood about himself and perhaps he was worried about it coming out im not qualified to comment on the level of antigay prejudice in the seventeenth century or whether tom bull was particularly homophobic but he must have been pretty scared alison said what seems likely and this is very strongly implied jamie whatever you say is that tom having built up this spurious witchcraft case against wil then became extremely paranoid about what might come out in court merrily came to stand next to alison to give her some support she wasnt even hanged was she oh she was hanged merrily she was hanged after death they took the body out to the orchard and put a rope around its neck and hung it from the tallest apple tree no james howled she was probably strangled alison said merrily said tom bull admits that she was murdered tom bull agrees that wil williams was murdered the extreme remorse he shows only really makes sense when you start to think of wil as a woman he was not a bad man james said not the brutal archvillain youre making out he overreacted ha said mrs goddard james merrily said for gods sake theres a lot of things you could clear up you took those papers out of the tomb so obviously the family knew they were there i dont understand why if the bulls and bulldavieses were so embarrassed by all this that journal wasnt simply destroyed years ago because youre not damn well supposed to understand its no ones business but ours oh you pompous prick alison threw up her arms cant you ever see the virtues of opening out hanging out the dirty washing youre so curled up and tight inside its a wonder you can breathe come on james for christs sake come out here you dont understand you cant understand but we need to merrily said because we know that poor wil williams was only the start alison put out an elegant hand james for close to half a minute james bulldavies remained motionless then slowly he pushed himself from the back wall and moved into the central aisle alison didnt move jim prosser started to clap as james walked towards the chancel other villagers joined in the applause and mrs goddard banged her stick on the stones when james bulldavies was halfway to the front someone squeezed out of a pew and he and james glanced at each other once james carried on walking the other figure moved silently towards the south porch where ken thomas blocked his way i think its better nobody leaves just yet if you dont mind sir oh sorry rod bit late this ken for a farmer sorry rod said ken moving aside at once lloyd had gone out again to wait for his father periodically she would hear him tramp past the door or the beepbeep of his fingers on the phone as he tried to reach his fathers mobile jane seethed the idea of this brutal humourless tosser sizing her up as a future bride blew through her fear she would refuse to think what he might do to her shed think instead of what she might do to him she got to her feet her jeans feeling disgustingly damp from the straw and crept silently around the cider house perhaps there was a wooden paddle or something they used to push the apples around in the mill she imagined herself waiting behind the door with it raised and smashing it down on him when he next came in it always worked in films but then in films there was always something handy the only stave in the cider house was the one used to turn the screw mechanism on the press and this proved to be metal and bolted firmly into place and the bolts were so rusty even a wrench wouldnt dislodge them she kicked about in the hay in case there was something underneath only flagstones nothing nothing nothing nothing she flung herself at a wall scratching at the bricks on the off chance one was loose and could be prised out and she could throw it at him hopeless was she even strong enough to hurl a brick with any force she still tried going from wall to wall even looking up at the roof to see if there was a loose slate which she could send skimming at his throat oh sure arriving finally at the hayloft over the mill shed forgotten all about that worth a try she might be able to hide up there and drop something on his head height was always an advantage wasnt it there was no ladder which anyway she would have broken up for a hefty stick but only a couple of feet separated the loft from the top of the stone millwheel no problem probably jane tested the thick wooden axle stuck through a hole in the middle of the stone it was all so crude in a stone age kind of way but the wood wasnt rotten and she was able to get a foot on it to hoist herself to the top of the wheel she had an awful vision of the wheel suddenly rolling away leaving her dangling from the rafters but it was as solid as a rock which she supposed it actually was and she hauled herself up quite easily in the end into the loft where she rolled over and flopped on her stomach between a couple of black bin liners she could wait behind the door with one and throw it over his head then duck behind him to freedom oh jesus this was getting ridiculous it seemed much brighter up here the fluorescent tube was only about three feet away and she felt exposed and pushed herself back from the edge until she felt her feet slot into the narrow area where the rafters met the sloping slates now she was up here the total seriousness of the situation clouded around her her bowels felt suddenly weak and she threw her arms over one of the bin sacks to stifle a sob oh mum please be looking for me please please plea the evil little smell from the bin sack had entered her nose like a thin needle not a smell she knew but one she had a horrid feeling she ought to before she realized what she was doing shed drawn the plastic back over the damp hair and the soft white skin purpled by the light the open bulging eyes and the big squashy lips and the tongue out like a dogs the diamond nosestud winking in the clinical light watching im a bloody madman ent i gomer said even look like a bloody madman so people tell me i got a wife ent gonner speak to me for a month as a result of what i already done tonight this far so what do we do boy what we gonner do about this the cider house the cider house where the bulls took their women until they give it to the powells soon as tess roberts told that story tonight it bothered me had to go out have a ciggy whatever theyre doin in that cider house it ent makin cider whereabouts is it top of a field other side o the new road as i recall a barn an ole sheep shed and the cider house used to be a tiny little shepherds cottage there at one time but that got pulled down years back you want to take a look lol said put your mind at rest meaning put my mind at rest if theyd found jane hed have said lets call it a night lets go and find merrily and talk about all of this see how it looks in daylight but they hadnt found jane unpredictable kid though gomer she comes and goes has her own ideas her own apartment in the vicarage she could be back there now for all we know all right boy ill tell you what we does gomer said hed go back via the old bowling green through into the churchyard check on the situation there and whether the kiddie had been found grab his jeep off the square always felt better on wheels never much of a foot soldier see lol meanwhile would torchsweep as much of the orchard as he could before making his way to the gate opening on to the new road where gomer would pick him up in about half an hour that way we covers both exits if hers in the orchard one or other of usll mabbe stumble gomer coughed shuffled sorry didnt mean shell be ok lol said shell be ok like repeating it was going to make it so shes always ok but when gomer had gone the garrod powell in his head faded into lloyd powell and both of them merged into karl windling and the whiterobed apple trees stood around like bent old druids at some woodland ceremony and he didnt think jane was ok he was very fond of jane he could say that to himself now it was ok to be fond of a fifteenyearold girl it was ok to fall in love with her mother he walked away the salmon moon was entangled in a cluster of spiky dead branches projecting from the blossom below gomer was right the only way to make any kind of productive orchard here was to start again he walked quickly pointing the torch at what remained of the path sometimes apprehensively sweeping it from side to side and finding patches of fungus pale as flesh and exposed roots like withered limbs she went as far away as she could get squeezing herself into different corners squatting in the straw but wherever she was she could still see the loft and the bin sack wherever she went she thought she could see colettes eyes popping out at her like marbles even though shed dragged the bin sack back over the face she seemed to see the eyes making little round bulges in the plastic what a bummer eh janey aint this just the pits but the cool sassy voice she remembered no longer matched the face colette dead had a childs face again this was what was so awful she looked so pitifully young younger than me and the smell colettes sickly new perfume putrefying a putrefying child a little swollen doll with a livid throat pleeeeeease the folds of the bin sack settled around colettes face with a crinkling sound naaaaaw in a frenzy jane scrambled back on to the stone mill wheel and balanced there piling more and more empty bin sacks over the corpse to lose the shape lose the smell a stink which would have so disgusted colette her thoughts flitting fearfully into the forbidden unknown how long had colette been kept here before they killed her like a turkey what had they done to her before they throttled her and took her clothes and dumped them in a ditch at kings oak corner and dressed her in a crinkly black shroud hunky lloyd powell and his dignified father what had they done to her she remembered what lloyd had said about pests and badgerbaiting its a bit of fun its cheap nobody gets harmed cept the badger and thats his fault for being a badger behind her the door swung open she didnt even try to get down what was the point ah you found her then is it lloyd standing in the doorway with his legs apart lloyd sounding quite pleased like colettes body was a birthday present theyd hidden amazing what you find when you snoop around girl still its not very nice shouldnt leave em unburied health risk it is i apologize he sighed we got too much on see at present and too many strangers about we never wanted the slag mind we never done anything like that before you dont not on your own doorstep not on your own land stupid that is and then we couldnt even bury her with all these police tramping around untidy hate that i do stop it she screeched jumping down putting the mill wheel between them i dont want to know you disgust me lloyd folded his arms affronted now dont you bloody come on like that with me jane it was your fault it was you sent me after the bitch oh you gotter stop them you gotter get them out lloyd please lloyd please please please you think i wanted that last thing we bloody wanted after that one father brought back from kingsland did nothin but bloody cry day and night but no you had to keep on at me please lloyd oh please please stop it jane shrieked and bent her head into her arms between her knees so i find the slag and shes looking at me like im gods gift throwing herself all over me in the middle of our own orchard got rid of her mates fast enough she had and here she is wandering around half naked all by herself what was i supposed to do you tell me that jane fetch her back to the restaurant with her slobbering all over me making up her lies what would that do to my reputation what would it do to father you didnt have to bring her back here why couldnt you just just make love to her whatever she wanted you didnt have to bring her back here but we always fetches em back yere lloyd looked momentarily puzzled like even he wasnt quite sure why they always fetched them here just what hed been brought up to do a few stupid city people might think it was cruel but it was a different way of life out here wasnt it nobody gets harmed cept the badger and thats his fault for being a badger colettes fault for being a slag jane didnt know how to talk to him any more he wasnt mad in the normal sense he didnt have the imagination to be mad you couldnt humour him he had no humour jane said in a very low faint voice i didnt throw myself at anybody im not going to spread any lies why cant you just let me go lloyd shook his head in his brisk and businesslike way not an option jane you gotter see that specially now im sure your fatherll say to let me go hes a councillor for gods sake my mothers the lloyd sort of smiled you dont really know father do you jane and there suddenly was mr powell in her head his councilchairmans chain wound around his hands and tightened she braced herself to attack lloyd she would go for his balls lloyd leaned back slightly on his heels and regarded her sorrowfully you try anything jane on me i got to tell you ill punch your face flat wont offend father wont put father off dont look at the ole mantelpiece when youre she saw that mr powell wore no trousers and his shirt flap was sticking out in lloyds hip pocket the mobile phone had begun to bleep and about time too father lloyd said excuse me when hed shut the door efficiently behind him and locked it again jane gave up threw herself into the filthy straw she was thirsty she had no more tears left her chest hurt from sobbing it was over all she had left to hope for was that they would see her as a fox fast bang please god not a badger she thought back in horrified amazement to the side of herself which had persuaded her to go into the orchard with two full bottles of gassy cider when you knew you were going to die quite soon your body put into a clammy bin liner the idea of being suspended in some parallel ethereal faerie universe was just the most awful selfdeluding crap imaginable lucy devenish believed all this shit and theyd killed her too and she hadnt come back because all that afterlife stuff mum preached was utter crap as well what shed had in the orchard that day had been some kind of blackout she probably had a brain tumour and would have died anyway jane lay there and sniffed the stinking straw because it was better than the piercing perfume of colette she too would start to smell like that quite soon when she was lying in her own bin sack she and colette decaying side by side good mates turning bad jane sobbed and snuffled over this until weak and exhausted please god not a badger her body slackened into a thin sleep and mr powell was there with his chain tight and his thing out not smiling james lifted his chin his eyes focused on the rafters his tone was clipped many times i gather the destruction of that document was mooted but there was a sound reason for it being preserved eventually about a hundred years ago my greatgrandfather suggested it should be entombed with its author thats all there is to it james said merrily you cant just tell us there was a sound reason without saying what it was its a private james listen to me about thirty years ago a girl called patricia young went to work for your father in the stables she got pregnant never mind how i know i know she returned after the child was born to try and persuade the father to face up to his responsibilities he obviously did he faced up to the responsibility he obviously felt to his family and she was never seen again someone shouted out patricia came back this is disgraceful james snarled bloody well come clean bulldavies a man yelled several people were on their feet ken thomas had put on all the lights bulldaviess face was white a vein throbbing in his forehead he flung out his pointing arm at merrily if theres a bloody witch here its you shame minnie parry cried out and was echoed by at least a dozen people some of them out in the aisle all right james threw up his hands reason we didnt destroy that document is because it also vindicates tom bull didnt kill williams didnt even order it done truth of it like thomas a becket all over again will no one rid me of this troublesome priest one of his servants did it and thats all im saying thats it shows over im leaving goodnight to a chorus of groans and protests from the pews he strode away to the south porch didnt look at ken thomas went out alison glanced at merrily then followed him merrily shrugged and followed alison behind her a score of conversations were detonated garrod powell had a sunday car a silvergrey ford escort whenever he came to church he parked it in the same place on the square adjacent to the market hall where it reached out towards the mews where cassidys country kitchen was and ledwardine lore rods space only tourists parked there when rod wasnt in town when gomer spotted the car rod was in it talking on the phone gomer pulled his jeep into the kerbside at the mouth of church street and waited bulldavies strode past towards his blue land rover almost dragging the floozie behind him he was unlocking the drivers door when the little vicar caught them up alison suddenly snatched her hand away and turned on james like a cornered cat tell her you bloody fool why dont you just tell her everything you know this has nothing to do with honour or tradition if that were true he leaned back against his land rover and breathed in through his teeth if that were true my darling mistress this would not be a problem the problem is merrily said that i think were talking about a tradition thats far from honourable youre very clever mrs watkins no im not ive not been very clever at all ive got people killed if youre talking about coffey you didnt kill coffey did you james it just came out what jamess jaw fell open like a padlock he blinked good lord you saw alder in there fellow as good as confessed didnt say a word in denial took it he grunted took it like a man hes an actor merrily said his great performance was dying on its feet i wondered if he was just grabbing the chance of getting out on a moment of high drama look mrs watkins mrs watkins no i did not kill coffey found the man and went to the police cooperated fully even let them take my fingerprints no did not kill coffey may have wanted to but thats not my way couldnt all right tell her then alison said tell her that the bulls dont kill tell her who stop please all right according to his own account thomas bull got very drunk one night opened his heart to the only man he felt he could still trust his bailiff gamekeeper head groom land steward his merrily shuddering had a vision of big brown hands around a small white throat his powell she said now do you see james bellowed now do you bloody well see the this powell killed her merrily felt breathless felt the sudden closeness of the woman who was wil strangled her robert powell his name he was trying to help tom bull and he did a terrible thing even more terrible alison said because hed have soon realized he was killing a woman its not so easy to strangle a man he didnt just strangle her merrily said he raped her first he raped the minister he went to kill a priest and dont make it worse woman but it is worse james it got worse because it didnt stop from then on the powells had a hold on the bulls and maybe it strengthened over the centuries because of the things the powells would do without compunction things it wouldnt have been proper or seemly or honourable who killed patricia young bulldavies reeled i dont know that gords sake dont know anything dont know if the damned woman was killed i was a boy then probably still away at school nobody would have told me i dont know anything just inherited all this shit been trying to keep the damned toilet lid down ever since merrily looked at alison alison gave a tiny nod her face flushed with anticipation who do you think killed her merrily said do you never give up presumably the father of her child whoever james swallowed whoever that was certainly not my poor bloody father who for the last twenty years of his life was impotent through illness and drink and got his only pleasure from james clenched his teeth watching alison gasped watching who james merrilys voice was very faint he wouldnt answer he hardly needed to an engine roared suddenly and the side of the land rover was blasted by headlights vicar gomer merrily saw with a spasm of panic that he was alone behind the wheel of his jeep wheres jane you ent seen her oh christ gomer reached over and threw open the passenger door get in vicar way to blue lol stumbled out into the road before he knew it the tarmac unrolling to either side a fence opposite with a ploughed field rising steeply behind it pink moon on pink soil to a bristle of trees no vehicles no lights no sign of gomer he felt confused and upset didnt know how much time had passed swinging the torch from tree to tree tensely shining it under bushes and briars once hed lit up a rag and nearly thrown up with dread there was no pavement hed have to stand in the hedge if a vehicle came past he stared down at his feet on the tarmac and found himself praying that jane was alive and back at the vicarage then stopped scared it might do more harm than good as if he was tapping into merrilys line to a god he wasnt sure of and jane often mocked omens and portents seemed to have soaked up all his spirituality pink moons and blackeyed dogs please jane he looked up then and saw her she was standing in the middle of the pink ploughed field she didnt smile at him or come running towards him she didnt seem to notice him at all she was standing very still although a wind he couldnt feel lifted her dark hair and then there was only the field and the distant trees with buildings behind under the hardening moon and lol knew the curse by way of robert johnson and nick drake was reaching for him merrily was struggling not to give way she asked gomer if hed tried the vicarage had he been upstairs had he called out had he called out to the third storey gomer told her no way was jane in the vicarage but lol had spotted two cider bottles missing from a case in lucys kitchen merrily let out a long serrated breath i know lucys dead i know she was your friend but i wish to god jane had never known her lols in the orchard now searchin shes there hell find her how is he how dyou mean like gomer was watching a car on the other side of the square lol is she bit off the word unstable unsure of himself sometimes hes all right good boy i reckon gomer pointed across the cobbles thats rod powells car see keepin an eye on him i am hes on the phone now whod rod be callin this time o night you reckon merrily was silent a second later rod was getting out of his car and walking in his stately and confident way across to the black swan where a lemony light still burned in windows either side of the front door rod went up the steps and rapped on a window presently the door opened and he was admitted a couple of minutes later he came out with a bottle of whisky councillor powell keeps his own licensin hours gomer said how about that mans gonner have himself a drink in his car i shouldnt wonder coppers in and out every hour on the hour lately thats how arrogant the feller is perhaps he needs some courage perhaps he could see a few things starting to ooze out of the woodwork she told gomer very briefly what shed learned in the last hour and what shed surmised everything except for the very mixed implications for alison bugger me said gomer wouldnt it just suit the bastard to get his end away with the bulls women whered that happen i wonder no prizes the cider house likely why john bulldavies give rod that bit o land with the ole place on it with a convenient hole in the wall hole in the loft probly that bloody ole john bulldavies he werent never any good you look at that whole situation vicar you can see why james is the screwedup bugger he is obvious hes backin off from the powells tryin to i think he perhaps wanted to do that on his own terms but circumstances arent letting him they comes over so loud and haughtylike the bulls but theyre weak underneath most of em theyll always come back to the powells its like some ole magnetism they might think they got away but they ent as the tail lights of rod powells car came on and the strings of medieval electric lanterns across the square were extinguished by some timer mechanism merrily thought of james and alison free to resume their odd relationship james bulldavies and alison kinnersley or powell as she might have been the bulls and the powells she hoped there would never be a child lol ran across the road there was an iron gate on the other side leading to the pinkwashed field for a moment as he climbed over he thought he saw her again a flitting thing a wisp a trick of the light he turned and looked back across the road towards the orchard he should wait here he should wait for gomer there was a flash like magnesium on the very periphery of his vision and he spun round and once more saw her in total absolute clarity standing in the centre of the field with her arms by her sides she was dressed in black this time he saw in a heartfreezing moment that her feet were not quite touching the soil a girl dressed in black hovering under a pink moon he stood with his back to the gate snatched off his glasses and rubbed his hands over his face replaced the glasses looked back at the road and then spun around again but there was nothing now he wasnt sure if it had been jane or colette both of them both of them out here his hands were trembling as he pushed himself away from the iron gate and began to walk across the churnedup field soil the colour of raw meat the pink moon above him the blackeyed dog he was sure at his heels he knew where he was going among the farm buildings behind the trees was the cider house where the wine of angels had not been made the place where the bulls had once taken their women lol stopped and looked once over his shoulder before walking steadily towards the buildings the escort had turned down church street for old barn lane before gomer started to follow hed pulled back into the shadows to avoid minnie spotting the jeep when she came out of the lychgate accompanied by tess roberts and the prossers never get to keep my ole gwynneth after this gomer muttered rod was turning into old barn lane never even signalled gomer observed he sucked on his ciggy what you reckon a man like powell does he sees the blinds come down after three hundred years wondering that myself merrily thought about the unmissable password shed given gomer to identify himself to lol nick drakes pink moon was the song of his that seemed to get played more often than any other when she was a kid she used to ask her stepbrother jonathan to put it on again because the idea sounded so pretty it was years later before she found out the message was far from comforting spoke of no escape for anyone magistrate like rod gomer said soberly he feels its all over last thing he wants is to sit the other side o the ole courtroom merrily fastened the webbing seatbelt i dont know where this is going to end i think we lost control a long time ago will of god gomer turned into old barn lane ent that the bottom line of it for you vicar im a bit unsure about the strength of my faith gomer if something happened to jane id be swearing at the heavens and cursing in the night like nobody ever did the sights and smells of the dream cider house swelled in her head in the vaporous humidity no longer the pulpy sweating cheeks of the pumping child but the emotionless rhythmical rise and thrust of a piece of wellpreserved welloiled farm machinery gomer glanced at her and then turned back to the lane lol had spoken to him only once before when he and alison had bought the apple wood for fragrant fires but on another occasion the week after alison had left hed seen lol buying cat food in the spar shop and had laughed quietly what you doin yere lloyd powell said now not a man who smiled but he laughed sometimes lol stood uncertainly on the edge of the field where it gave way to a weedspattered gravel forecourt im speaking to you sunshine lloyd said come over yere in the light the only light was a domeshaded bulb in a holder like a question mark over the door of what lol took to be the cider house he moved shyly to within six feet of it hello he said lloyd was marlboro county man in denims but with no cigarette lol saw karl windling with no beard ah lloyd put his hands on his hips i know who you are youre that bloke alison kinnersley left for james lol nodded the pintsized cuckold lloyds expression was blank pintsized cuckold with no bottle just phrases hed overheard in the shop when they were laughing quietly lloyd and another bloke lloyd examined him for a moment then seemed to lose interest go away little man he said im busy he turned his back on lol taking some keys out of his pocket no lol said i wont if you dont mind what was that lloyd didnt turn round lol saw that his dashing white truck was parked a few yards away with its tailgate open in the back was a dead sheep and something not much bigger wrapped in bin sacks got it all loaded then lloyd lloyd still didnt turn give you a hand maybe i dont think so lloyd said dont reckon youd have the strength bugger off gon look at your owls your badgers whatever you little fellers do at night the pink moon shone surrealistically down on a pastoral dreamscape lol wasnt quite sure if he was actually here he glimpsed the past few days in a series of frozen incidents fanned out like playing cards the vicarage days his own mirror image bizarrely in a dog collar alison unmasked the glow of firelight on merrilys eyelids and then the fan was closed and he was standing back where it all began in blackberry lane in front of the invaded cottage the tornup pages of traherne like petals on the lawn karl windling in the window i thought as i was passing lol heard himself saying as though from some distance that i would take jane home lloyd turned slowly back from the door come yere a minute lol heard karl windling say now you fucking stay there you understand you go anywhere ill find you you dont move the rest of the night im coming over he walked up to the door and stood there right then lloyd said the pink moon bulged as lloyd half turned and hit him in the mouth as he fell back lloyd hit him in the stomach as he doubled up and his face came down lloyds fist was waiting to meet it crunching his glasses into his eyes as he rolled over on the gravel lloyd kicked him in the head tell me the truth the vicar said as they came up to the junction of old barn lane and the new road terrible stupid junction this was gomer reckoned right on a bad bend you dont actually think lols going to find her lying drunk in the orchard do you oh vicar gomer slowed down not wanting to come up to the junction right behind rod pretending that concentrating on his driving was the reason he hadnt finished the sentence you think shes in the cider house dont you ent my place to think nonsense like that gomer said gruffly what happens in the cider house they makes cider used to they passed into a tunnel of trees blocking the moonlight i dreamt about it once her voice was very low ive never been in one but i dreamt about it it was dermot child in there gomer thought that dermot child nasty little bugger though he was wasnt in the same evil league as the powells so inbred deepdown evil they didnt even know they was evil he turned out on to the new road and had to brake sharply on account of rod powells escort was dead in front of him having slowed for a big lorry rumbling round the bend strewth you dont expect heavy goods traffic this time o night it was a low loader with a big stack of crates on the back the driver cranked the gears and the lorry built up to a steady speed as they approached the spot where poor ole lucy bought it just before you hit the straight powells farm turning about half a mile off too late before rod too changed gear and speeded up gomer saw him look in his mirror to see whod come up behind him not many folk in this village drove a us army jeep with a cigarette glowing in their gobs bugger hed have seen the vicar too hed know they were following him he wouldnt like that gomer eased up left some space between him and rod his view of it was that rod was heading home fast to check everything was in order mabbe throw some disinfectant around then figure out how he was going to play it he wouldnt want no company tonight but whatever he did to clean up the cider house there wasnt a thing he could do about the orchard about this patricia young who gomer was convinced lay under the apple tree man he werent that old thirty years was a good age for an untended apple tree bugger rod giving it some clog now getting up behind the lorry so he could get past when they hit the straight gomer put his foot down what happened next happened so quick that hed hardly registered it before the jeep was up the bank and notsoclean through the hedge where are you where are you where you gone moving about in the bilious fluorescence throwing hay around old bin sacks dont mess me about you bitch you

daft big tough hands farmers hands bass players hands picking him up and slamming him back against some wall and he can feel the freshly washed hair of a girl called tracy cooke in his eyes and mouth in a dingy hotel bedroom and he can see karl windlings yellow grin as he pushes tracy over onto lols arm and goes down on her im gonner hurt you gonner hurt you real bad you hear me jane jane where is she lloyds screaming his hard face up close what you done with her im gonner tear your other eye out mister lols hand comes up with the bottle in it the empty bottle he found rolling around in the back of the truck the bottle coming up and striking lloyd on the point of the chin with a small click lloyd stumbling and spitting a little blood right then rubbing his jaw once you done it now boy lol swaying hearing the words of thomas traherne to love all persons in all ages all angels all worlds is divine and heavenlyto love all lloyd comes for lol karl windling says and you youre just i mean whod notice whod give a shit whod put flowers on your grave lol with both hands smashing the bottle into the side of lloyds head whispers jane there is no reply lloyd is on his knees the bottle falling to the gravel and rolling over its label lit by the moon the wine of angels tears are the wine of angels traherne sighs the best to quench the devils fires youdve thought it would be all over the road but it was very neat from the bank gomer was looking down on it the moon so warm and bright you could see everything very neat indeed the car looking like it had taken a bite out of the bed of the lorry like the car roof was its upper lip clamped down no you dont gomer said putting out an arm to bar the vicars path call me sexist vicar but this is gonner be no sight for you you stay in this yere field ill go down and check this out first see he slithered down to the mangled wire fence stepped over it and through the gap the jeep had torn out of the hedge lit himself a ciggy then went to look under the deck of the lorry where the bonnet of the escort was barely visible the end of the deck had gone through the windscreen like a widebladed stone chisel gomer bent his head sniffed then straightened up and wiped his hands on his trousers the lorry driver was down from his cab hed thrown up in the road he wore a baseball cap and a big earring well well gomer said jeremy selby gomer bit late for a consignment o cider going down southampton way bit of a rock festival ar gomer said best place for it all be too stoned to taste the ole muck it was so bloody quick gomer couldnt believe it he was right on my arse then it just come running out the hedge i didnt know what it was at first just slammed on you know instinctively it was a really big one all white hang on get a hold boy gomer extracted the ciggy what did what exactly come runnin out the hedge bloody great sheep white as a bloody polar bear ar gomer walked round to the front of the lorry no sign of a sheep naturally gomer nodded ambled back whered it go then jeremy fuck knows it was here one second gone the next i swear to god gomer it all right boy gomer patted him on the shoulder if the coppers asks ill say i seen it too you rung em on my mobile they both stepped into the road it was dead quiet poor bugger jeremy said i suppose there really is no what with half of him in the front half in the back and his head all right christ im still shaking dont suppose you recognize the car oh aye rod powell that is was you what jeremy selby snatched off his baseball cap in horror i just killed councillor powell ar gomers beam was a bright gash in the night as he stuck out his hand put it there pal it was a cawing sound like a nightbird sporadic but coming closer ane ane merrily stood in the pink ploughed field exactly where gomer had left her not looking where hed told her not to look it was as though all her muscles had seized up she felt raw and frozen and unable to think clearly she saw a large hole in her cashmere sweater just below the elbow she could throw it away now something was standing about fifteen yards up the field it cawed again j ane merrily looked up lol is it lol errily sorry i cant glasses gone he stumbled down a furrow before he fell into her arms she saw his face was full of blood and his mouth was up on one side one eye was closed they crushed each other and merrily began to cry oh lol what have they done to you she felt his blood on her face he looked like his cat had she remembered waking up by the fire seeing him looking down at her closing her eyes again content she closed her eyes now and the night swirled around her not pink but deep blue she couldnt understand that when everything told her it should be black streaked with red lol boy merrily blinked gomer stood a few feet away take it easy gomer said everybody take it easy the night became real and hardedged memories battered merrily a flame of fear enveloped her she stared into gomers terrifying face with the white spikes of hair and the core of fire in his teeth bloody useless you are lol boy gomer said wouldnt find an elephant in your own backyard er just comes walkin out the orchard cool as you like through the ole gate merrily swam upwards through the blue flower next to tough wiry old gomer she was looking very small and young and fragile her face was as white as bread her eyes were on the move still travelling back oh christ lol said breaking away from merrily to let jane in he looked up through a single watering bloodblurred shortsighted eye he saw a curious cloud formation above the moon a dark cloud hanging there making a curving vshape so that the moon for a long undying moment was like a big red apple he heard jane saying mum where have you been since yesterday hl mccready and partners solicitors apex house king street hereford june the revd m watkins the vicarage ledwardine herefordshire dear mrs watkins i shall be writing to you more formally about this matter in due course but felt i should give you informal advance warning of something which until now has been subject to a degree of secrecy i am sure that were she alive the police would be more than interested to talk to miss devenish in the light of recent events in the circumstances one can only mutter about there being more things in heaven and earth first may i say how pleased i have been to learn that you and your daughter are fully recovered from what must have been a most disturbing night i doubt if ledwardine has weathered a more eventful period in its lengthy history but to business many people no doubt will be wondering who is to receive the bulk of miss devenishs legacy which will amount principally to the proceeds of the sale of her house and shop both highly desirable properties in a much soughtafter village in january this year miss devenish placed before me a proposal which i confess i greeted with some dismay it was her intention that all the money should be left in trust to the diocese of hereford for the purchase of the orchard immediately adjacent to the parish church whenever it might come on the market the land to remain as an orchard in perpetuity as the aforementioned orchard had for several centuries been in the ownership of the powell family and there seemed little prospect of its being relinquished i was at pains to discourage miss devenish from this course of action but as you know she was a most determined person and was insistent that her wishes be adhered to following the death in the early hours of monday morning of mr garrod powell the property passed into the ownership of his son mr lloyd powell however with the death in hospital yesterday of mr lloyd powell which i am informed is unlikely under the circumstances to give rise to any criminal proceedings against his assailant it seems not improbable that the orchard will indeed shortly become available for purchase attempts are being made to contact mrs jennifer powell from whom it may surprise you to learn mr garrod powell has never been legally separated and to whom it appears the powell orchard may now belong in view of her long estrangement from mr powell it seems likely that mrs powell will wish to dispense with the property especially in view of the gruesome discoveries there over the past few days be assured that i shall keep you fully informed of any future developments meanwhile please accept my very best wishes for your installation service next friday yours sincerely harold l mccready
