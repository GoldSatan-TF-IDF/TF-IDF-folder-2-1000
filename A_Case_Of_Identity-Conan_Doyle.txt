part one my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat by the fire in his house at baker street real life is infinitely stranger than anything we could invent we would not dare invent things which are commonplace things of life if we could go out of that window fly over this great city gently remove the roofs of houses and look at the peculiar things that are happening the strange coincidences the plans and the wonderful chains of events we would discover things much more interesting than in books but i do not believe it i answered the stories in the newspapers are never very interesting in fact they are always very boring that is because said holmes newspapers always repeat the official reports of magistrates and police reports yon can be certain that there is nothing as unnatural and strange as the commonplace i know i replied that your cases are always very interesting but let us look at todays newspaper i picked up the newspaper and began to read an article it was about a husband who was cruel to his wife i dont have to read the article i said but i am sure that the man had a girlfriend that he drank and that he began to hit his wife i am also sure that there was a sympathetic sister or landlady you have chosen a bad example watson said holmes because i have worked on this case the man mr dundas did not have a girlfriend and he did not drink and he did not hit her instead at the end of every meal he took out his false teeth and threw them at his wife you must admit that nobody could invent such a story do you have any interesting cases now i asked well i am working on ten or twelve cases but none of them are interesting they are important you understand without being interesting i have found that unimportant matters are usually more interesting if there is a big crime the motive is generally obvious so they are generally not very interesting but i think i will have an interesting case in a few minutes holmes was standing at the window and looking down at the dull grey london streets there was a woman standing in the street she was moving her hands nervously it was obvious that she could not make up her mind then suddenly she ran across the road and rang holmes doorbell i know those symptoms said holmes when a woman hesitates like that on the pavement it means that she has a love problem she wants help but she thinks that her problem is too delicate to communicate but when a woman does not hesitate and rings the doorbell hard it means she was seriously wronged in this case this woman is confused and perplexed and wants an explanation as holmes was speaking the servant announced miss mary sutherland she was a large woman she wore a hat with a red feather a black jacket a dark brown dress and grey glove she also wore round gold earrings when holmes saw her he said isnt it difficult for you to type with such bad eyesight i thought so at first miss sutherland replied but now i can type without looking at the keys then she looked surprised and frightened when she understood that holmes already knew so much about her how do you know that asked miss sutherland it is my business to know things said holmes laughing if i could not see these things why would people come to me in any case i can see the marks of the glasses on your nose i have come here she said because i want to know where mr hosmer angel has gone why did you come here in such a hurry asked holmes once again miss sutherland looked very surprised holmes then explained that her boots were not the same and that they were not completely buttoned yes i did hurry out of the house because i was angry at mr windibank that is my father he did not want to ask the police about mr angel he said that nothing bad had happened this made me angry so i came here to see you your father said holmes he must be your stepfather because his surname is different from yours yes my stepfather i call him father even though that seems strange to me you see he is only five years older than me and is your mother alive asked holmes oh yes mother is alive and well answered miss sutherland but i was not happy when she married mr windibank so soon after father died also mr windibank is fifteen years younger than mother father was a plumber and had a good business and when he died mother continued the business but when she married mr windibank he made her sell it do you live on the money from the business asked holmes oh no replied miss sutherland i inherited some money from my uncle i cannot touch it but with the interest i receive one hundred pounds a year that should be enough for you to live quite comfortably said holmes i give that money to mother and i live on the money i make typing she replied now can you tell us about mr hosmer angel asked holmes miss sutherland blushed deeply and said i met him at the plumbers ball they used to send tickets to my father when he was alive and after he died they sent them to my mother but mr windibank didnt want us to go he said that my fathers friends were not good enough for us but the day of the ball mr windibank went to france on business so mother and i went to the hall and it was there i met mr angel i suppose said holmes that mr windibank was very angry with you when he discovered that you had gone to the ball no not very replied miss sutherland he said that it was impossible to stop a woman when she really wanted something and did you see mr hosmer after the ball asked holmes yes but he couldnt come to the house when father was there father didnt want anybody to come to the house so mr hosmer said we should wait until your father goes to france before we see each other in the meantime we can write to each other every day were you engaged to the gentleman at this time asked holmes oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took mr angel worked in an office in leadenhall street which office thats the worst part i dont know then where did you send your letters to the leadenhall street post office where he got them he said to me the other workers in my office will make fun of me if they see my letters i told him that i could type my letters like he did his but he said a typed letter comes from an impersonal machine and not from you this shows how fond he was of me mr holmes and the nice little things he thought of it was most suggestive said holmes i have always said that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel he was a very shy man mr holmes he always wanted to walk with me in the evening instead of during the day he was very gentlemanly even his voice was gentle he told me that he had had a bad infection of the tonsils when he was a child so he had to whisper he always wore elegant clothes his eyes were weak just like mine and he wore dark glasses against the sun well what happened when mr windibank returned to france asked holmes mr angel came to my house and said that we should get married before father returned he was very serious and said put your hand on the bible and promise me that you will always love me mother agreed with him mother liked him from the beginning and liked him even more than i did when they started talking about our getting married within the week i asked them if i should ask father first they said no i however did not want to do anything in secret so i wrote to father at his office in france but the letter came back to me on the very day of the wedding it missed him then yes sir he had started back to england just before the letter arrived in france ha that was unfortunate your wedding was planned then for the friday of that week was it to be in church yes sir but very quietly on the day of the wedding hosmer came in a hansom to take mother and me to the church but since there were two of us mother and i went in the hansom and hosmer took a cab we got to the church first and when the cab arrived we waited for him to come out but he never did the cabman said that he could not understand what had happened to him i think that you have been very badly treated said holmes oh no sir hosmer was too good and kind to leave so why all morning before the wedding he said to me if anything happens to me you must always love me you must wait for me i will return to you i thought this very strange to say on the day of our wedding but his disappearance explains everything it certainly does said holmes in your opinion did he know that he was in danger yes i think so but do you know what the danger was no i dont one more question how did your mother react she was angry and told me that i should never speak about him again and your father did you tell him yes he said something terrible has happened to hosmer but he will return i agree with my father why would hosmer leave me after all there was no money involved hosmer did not borrow money from me and i never put the money which i had inherited in his name so he did not take my money and leave then she pulled out a handkerchief and began to cry i will try to solve your problem said holmes but dont think about it anymore forget about mr angel do you think that i will ever see him again no im afraid not then what has happened to him you will leave the question with me now i need some of mr angels letters a good description of him and also your fathers address i never had mr angels address said miss sutherland but here is mr windibanks address he works for a wine importer here is the advertisement with a description of hosmer that i put in the newspaper the chronicle miss sutherland then left but before leaving she said i will always wait for hosmer angel to return part two when she had left i asked holmes about the case the young woman is quite interesting but her little problem is not very difficult or unusual would you mind reading me the description of hosmer angel i then read it to holmes missing a gentleman called hosmer angel about ft in tall hes strongly built with black hair black sideboards and moustache hes a little bald in the centre he wears dark glasses and hes got a speech defect he has got a sallow complexion he was wearing a black coat black waistcoat grey trousers and brown boots please contact miss sutherland etc etc that is enough said holmes now look at these letters which hosmer wrote to her what do you see they are typed i said not only that but the signature is typed too the point about the signature is very suggestive in fact we can call it conclusive of what my dear fellow cant you see how important this fact is to the case no i cant i replied unless hosmer didnt sign his letters because he didnt want to be legally responsible for what he promised no that was not the point said holmes but now i will write two letters which will solve this mystery one of the letters is to mr windibanks firm in the city and the other one will be to mr windibank himself to ask him to come here to meet us tomorrow evening at six oclock a few minutes before six the next day i returned to baker street when i walked in holmes was doing chemistry experiments well have you solved it i said as i walked into the room yes it was the bisulphate of baryta no miss sutherlands mystery i cried oh that i thought you were asking me about the chemistry experiment there was never any mystery in the matter the only problem is that the scoundrel did not do anything illegal so he cant be punished who was hosmer angel and why did he abandon miss sutherland but holmes did not have time to answer me because just then we heard someone knock at the door and then someone walking towards holmes room this is the girls stepfather he wrote to me to say that he was coming said holmes the man who entered the room was a strongly built fellow without sideboards or moustache with a sallow complexion and he looked at us with a pair of penetrating grey eyes he was wearing a black tophat good evening mr james windibank said holmes i believe this is the typed letter that you wrote to me to say that you were coming here yes sir i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little problem also i dont like other people knowing about our family misfortune anyway i dont think that you will ever find this hosmer angel on the contrary said holmes quietly i am almost certain that i will find him mr windibank started violently and dropped his gloves i am happy to hear that he said it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter is just as distinctive as a mans handwriting for example in this letter of yours i can see that this part of the r has a slight defect there are also fourteen other characteristics of your typewriter we write all the letters in the office with this typewriter said mr windibank and now continued holmes i will show you what is really very interesting in fact i am thinking about writing a book on the typewriter and its relation to crime mr windibank jumped out of his chair and picked up his hat i cannot waste time over this ridiculous talk if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have caught him certainly said holmes walking over to the door and locking it i let you know that i have caught him what where shouted mr windibank becoming white and looking around like a rat in a trap you cant get away mr windibank said holmes this case was really very easy now sit down and we can talk about it mr windibank fell back into the chair i did not do anything illegal he stammered i am afraid that you are right but mr windibank it was a cruel selfish and heartless trick now let us look at what happened said holmes then holmes sat down and began to talk the man marries a woman older than himself for her money he can also use the money of the daughter as long as the daughter lives with him and the mother the daughter has a lot of money so it is important not to lose it but the daughter is friendly and affectionate so it is clear that she will soon find a husband at first this man tells the daughter that she cannot go out but this will not solve the problem forever then one day the daughter says that she wants to go to a ball what does the clever i stepfather do then with the help of the wife he disguises himself he wears dark glasses and puts on a fake moustache then he changes his voice and speaks very softly he is even more certain that his plan will work because the girl is shortsighted then at the ball this man keeps away other lovers by becoming the girls lover himself it was just a joke at first groaned mr windibank we didnt think that the girl would fall in love yes that is probably true continued holmes but the girl really fell in love and you decided to take the situation to the extreme you began to see her often and the mother said that she liked him very much then you decided to ask miss sutherland to marry you so that she would never again think about other men but it was difficult for you to pretend to go to france every time miss sutherland had to see mr angel you had to end the situation dramatically in some way you had to keep miss sutherland from thinking about other men in the future therefore you made her promise on the bible and you told her that something could happen on the very morning of the wedding you took her to the church but obviously you could not marry her you disappeared by using the old trick of entering one door of a cab and walking out the other i think this is the chain of events mr windibank yes maybe that is true replied mr windibank but i did not do anything illegal and now you are breaking the law because you will not let me leave this room you are right you did not do anything illegal said holmes as he unlocked and opened the door but you really deserve to be punished and i would do it then holmes picked up a ridingcrop but mr windibank ran out the door and out of the house now he certainly is a coldblooded scoundrel said holmes laughing that fellow will continue doing worse and worse crimes until he does something really bad and finishes on the gallows in any case this case had some interesting points i cannot completely follow your reasoning in this case i said well it was clear from the first that mr hosmer angel had a very good reason for his actions and that the only man who could really profit from the situation was the stepfather he wanted to keep the hundred pounds a year then it was very suggestive that mr windibank and mr hosmer angel were never together and so were the dark glasses the soft voice and the moustache they all suggested a disguise the final point was the typed signature this made me think that the handwriting of the man must be very familiar to miss sutherland and that if she saw even a small portion of it she would recognise it and how did you verify these ideas i asked first i wrote to mr windibanks firm in the letter i described mr angel after i had eliminated everything that could be a disguise like the glasses the moustache and the voice and i asked them if they had an employee like that they wrote back to me and said that i had described mr james windibank then i wrote to mr windibank to invite him here and as i expected he typed his reply to me then i compared his letter with the letters of mr angel voila tout and miss sutherland i asked if i tell her she will not believe me replied holmes maybe you remember this persian saying it is dangerous to take a tiger cub from its mother and it is dangerous to take a delusion from a woman the end
