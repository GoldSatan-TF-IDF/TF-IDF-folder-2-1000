robert wilson the ignoranceof blood seville thursday th september hrs the icecold vodka slipped down vasili lukyanovs throat as the traffic thundered past the layby on the new motorway from algeciras to jerez de la frontera the heat had started the sweat beading in his dark hair as he stood by the open boot of the range rover sport he was waiting for it to get dark didnt want to do this last stretch into seville in daylight he drank smoked ate and thought about his last night with rita the whole escapade making him silently but grossly oral my god she knew how to do it to him he felt bad leaving her behind hed trained her to perfection the blood thumped hard in his throat as he looked down on the solid block of samsonite luggage jammed up against the open cool box with its chilled champagne and bottles of vodka set in blocks of ice he tore another chunk off his bocadillo enjoying the rip of the ham between his teeth chugged the icy vodka another carnal scene from his last night with rita came to him her violoncello waist the caramel of her skin as soft as toffee in his kneading fingers a chunk of the bread roll suddenly clogged his throat he gasped his eyes came out on stalks he struggled and finally coughed a clod of masticated bread and ham shot out over the range rovers roof steady he thought dont want to choke now die in a layby with the trucks rumbling past and your future all before you pepe navajas had just finished loading the steel rods the twenty bags of cement and the wooden planking for making reinforced concrete pillars which hed stacked alongside some plumbing equipment sanitaryware floor and wall tiles he was going to build an extension for his daughter and soninlaw whod just taken delivery of twins and needed more space in their small house in sanlucar de barrameda they also had no money so pepe was buying everything on the cheap and because his soninlaw was useless he was doing the work for them over the weekends pepe parked the heavily laden truck outside a restaurant in dos hermanas a few kilometres before the start of the motorway heading south to jerez de la frontera hed had a beer or two with the guys from the building supplies depot now he was going to have an early dinner and wait for dusk he kidded himself that the guardia civil didnt notice so much between dusk and night and only stopped cars later on when people were more likely to be drunk vasili turned on his mobile phone for the first time that day at just after pm he had resisted the temptation until he was through the tollgate on the last stretch of motorway to seville because he knew what was coming it had been a while since hed spent a whole day on his own and he was bursting to talk the first call came through in a matter of seconds and as expected it was from alexei his old fellow at arms are you alone vasya asked alexei yes said vasili his lips thick and mouth slow from the vodka i dont want you to get upset said alexei make a mistake while youre driving have you called to upset me asked vasili try this said alexei leonids back from moscow silence did you hear that vasya im not breaking up am i leonid revnik is in marbella he wasnt supposed to be back until next week he came back early vasili opened the window a crack and sniffed the warm night air it was pitch black flat fields on either side only tail lights in the distance nothing coming the other way what did leonid have to say he asked he wanted to know where you were i told him youd be at the club but theyd just come from there said alexei theyd found your office locked and kostya on the floor unconscious are you on your own at the moment alyosha asked vasili suspicious leonid already knows youve crossed over to yuri donstov so what is this a warning its me finding out that leonids not lying said alexei silence somethings gone missing from your office said alexei he told me that too vasili closed the window sighed im sorry alyosha rita took a heavy beating for you i havent seen her but leonid had that animal with him you know the one that even the moldovan girls wont go with vasili hit the steering wheel five times the horn blared into the night steady vasya im sorry alyosha said vasili im fucking sorry what more can i say well thats something it wasnt supposed to happen like this leonid wasnt supposed to be back until next week i was going to talk to yuri get permission to bring you in you were going to be part of it you know that i just had to thats just the point vasya i didnt know that i couldnt tell you youre too close alyosha said vasili yuri made an offer that leonid wouldnt have given me in a million years but without me you didnt want me protecting your back and what the fuck does it matter anyway said alexei trailing off what was that vasya nothing i heard it youre crying silence well thank fuck for that said alexei at least youre fucking sad vasya pepe was on the road a little later than planned with a few more drinks inside him than hed intended all because of the football sevilla fc winning a uefa cup game in athens hed got caught up in the postmatch euphoria eaten dinner with wine and brandy now he had the music on full blast and was singing along with his favourite flamenco singer el camaron de la isla what a voice it was making him tearful perhaps he was driving a little too quickly but there wasnt much traffic and the lanes of the motorway seemed as wide and well lit as an airport runway the music drowned out the rattling of the steel rods he was happy bouncing up and down on his springy seat looking forward to seeing his daughter and the babies his cheeks were wet with emotion and it was at that moment at the very peak of his happiness that the tyre beneath him blew it was a noise loud enough to penetrate the cab a muffled thump like distant heavy ordnance followed by the crack and rip of the tyre peeling off the rim and slapping around the wheel arch his stomach sank with the cab as it listed to the left in the break in the music he heard the pieces of tyre smacking down the side of the truck metal screeching on the tarmac his headlights which had been locked steady between the lanes slewed across the straight white flashes and although everything was slowing down so that no detail escaped his wideopen eyes some deep instinct was telling him that he was going dangerously fast in a cab with a very heavy load behind it fear sliced through his innards but the alcohol in his veins only gave him the presence of mind to grip the steering wheel which had powers of its own el camaron started up again just before pepes truck smashed into the barrier of the central reservation only with that abrupt halt did he realize the full extent of his forward momentum as he was catapulted through windscreen glass into the warm night air over the agonized voice of el camaron he heard a noise that was the last thing his befuddled brain managed to compute steel rods now loose taking off like a battery of launched spears into a tunnel of approaching light and the reason vasili was crying was that hed just undergone that extraordinary human facility for compressing a life into a compact emotional experience seven times in six years of service in afghanistan alexei had protected his back and now having survived all those years fighting the pashtoons alexei was going to get shot in the back of the head by one of his own in a forest on the costa del sol for no other reason than that he was vasili lukyanovs best fucking friend tell leonid he started and stopped when he sensed something flashing towards him a strange agitation in the air what the fuck the steel rods their tail ends quivering with expectation entered the cone of light as if attracted to him at its apex they hit with explosive force tyres smeared their rubber on to the dark road thumped against an unseen obstruction and the range rover took off into the abysmal black of the fields beyond there was a momentary silence vasya falcons house calle bailen seville friday th september hrs the phone trembled under the warm breath of the brutal night diga said falcon who was sitting up in bed with a file from one of the hundreds concerning the th june seville bombing resting on his knees youre awake javier said his boss comisario elvira i do my best thinking at this time in the morning said falcon i thought most people our age just worried about debt and death i have no debts not financial ones anyway somebody has just woken me up to talk about death about a death said elvira and why were you called rather than me at some time before eleven thirtyfive which was when it was reported there was a car accident at kilometre thirtyeight on the northbound motorway from jerez to seville in fact on both sides of the motorway but the deaths have occurred on the northbound side im told its very nasty and i need you to go out there something that the guardia civil cant handle said falcon glancing at his clock theyve taken their time its complicated they originally thought there was just one vehicle a truck which had crashed into the central reservation barriers and shed its load it took them a while to realize there was another vehicle beyond some pine trees down a bank on the other side of the motorway still no reason to involve the homicide squad the driver of the northbound vehicle has been identified as vasili lukyanov a russian national when they finally got round to looking in the boot of his car they discovered a suitcase had split open and there was a lot of money i mean a hell of a lot of money i understand were talking about millions of euros javier so i want a full forensic examination of the vehicle and although its clearly an accident i want you to investigate it as if it was a murder there could be implications for other investigations going on around the country and most important i want that money fully accounted for and made safe ill get a security van sent up there as soon as i can raise someone i assume were talking about a russian mafia gang member said falcon we are ive already spoken to the organized crime intelligence centre theyve confirmed it area of expertise prostitution area of operation costa del sol and ive contacted inspector jefe casado you remember him the guy from the greco the organized crime response squad in the costa del sol the one who gave us a presentation back in july about setting up a greco in seville to handle the mafia activity here said falcon and nothings happened theres been a delay why cant he handle this thats the delay hes in marbella running about twenty investigations down there said elvira and anyway he hasnt started work on the situation in seville yet hell know more than we do and hell have the intelligence on lukyanovs costa del sol activity exactly which is why hes sending us one of his own men vicente cortes wholl bring someone from the organized crime intelligence centre with him well im awake so i might as well go said falcon and hung up shaving was the usual morning trial facing the full prosecution of his stubbled face same old story with a few more lines the mind engraving its doubts and fears theyd all told him that the ultimate solution to the seville bombing was not expected of him he knew it himself hed looked at the other inspector jefes who did their ugly work in the world of violence and left it in the office but that was not for him not this time he ran a hand over his shortcropped hair the lifechanging events of the last five years had turned the salt and pepper to steel grey and he didnt dye it unlike the other inspector jefes the light and the remnants of his summer tan brought out the amber in his brown eyes he grimaced as the razor made lanes through the foam dressed in a navy blue polo shirt and chinos he left the bedroom rested his hands on the railing around the gallery and leaned out no visible stars he looked down on to the central patio of the massive eighteenthcentury house hed inherited from his disgraced father the artist francisco falcon the pillars and arches were roughly sketched in by a solitary light whose sulphurous glow lit the bronze boy tiptoeing across the fountain and brought up the far recesses behind the pillars of the colonnade where a plant dried to a rustling husk still lurked in a corner he must throw that out he thought for the hundredth time hed asked his housekeeper encarnacion to get it done months ago but she had her strange attachments her mobile virgins her stations of the cross that wretched plant toast with olive oil a small strong coffee he got into his car with the caffeine sharpening his reactions he drove through the stifling uneasy city which still seemed to be panting from the uproar of the day its tarmac ruptured into thick biscuit cobbles piled on pavements roads ploughed up to reveal vital inner workings machinery poised to strike every street it seemed was fenced off and taped bollarded to kingdom come the air reeked of roman dust uncaked from subterranean ruins how could anybody settle down in this tumult of reconstruction but of course everything had its purpose this was nothing to do with the bombing of a few months ago but the mayoral elections which were to take place in early so the population had to feel the torment of the incumbents beneficence it was fast work getting out of the city at this time in the morning still dark four hours to go before sunrise he was across the river and out on the ring road in minutes flying down the motorway towards jerez de la frontera inside a quarter of an hour it wasnt long before he saw the lights the surgical halogen the queasy blue the unnerving red the slow revolving sickly yellow he pulled up on the hard shoulder behind a huge tow truck disembodied luminous jackets floated in the dark there was hardly any traffic he crossed the motorway and entered the noise of the generator powering the lights that brutally illuminated the scene there were three nissan s in the white and green of the guardia civil two motorbikes a red fire engine a dayglo green ambulance another smaller tow truck halogen lighting up on stalks wiring all around a spray of glass diamonds from the crashed trucks windscreen swept on to the hard shoulder the firemen had their cutting tools ready but were waiting for the law men to show as falcon arrived more cars pulled up on the other side he introduced himself as did the duty judge the forensics jorge and felipe and the medico forense the guardia civil talked them through the accident the range rover was driving from jerez to seville in the fast lane at an estimated speed of kilometres per hour the truck was travelling from seville to jerez in the nearside lane when the front left tyre burst the truck swerved across to the fast lane and hit the barriers of the central reservation at approximately kilometres per hour the impact sent the driver through the windscreen dislodged a load of steel rods wooden planking and metal tubing which shot over the cab roof and flew into the fast lane of the oncoming traffic the driver of the truck cleared the central reservation and the fast lane and came to rest by the crash barrier on the hard shoulder the range rover was hit by two steel rods thirty metres beyond where the truck had hit the barriers the first went through the windscreen speared the driver through the chest and continued through the front seat the rear seat and the floor of the vehicle missing the fuel tank by millimetres the second rod went through the rear window and into the boot this rod seems to have ripped open the suitcase exposing the money the driver of the range rover died on impact lost control of the vehicle which must have hit some of the trucks shed load giving the car sufficient lift so that it cleared the crash barriers smashed through the pine trees and disappeared down the bank into the fields if that steel rod hit him with a combined velocity of kilometres per hour said the medico forense id be surprised if there was anything left of him what is left is not a pretty sight said the guardia civil ill take a look said the medico forense then you can start cutting him out of there felipe and jorge completed their initial inspection of the scene and took their photographs they joined falcon while the medico forense finished his work what the fuck are we doing here asked felipe yawning wider than a dog its not murder hes russian mafia and theres a lot of money here said falcon any evidence we gather might be usable in a future conviction fingerprints on the money and suitcase mobile phone address book there might be a laptop in there theres a briefcase on the back seat which wasnt touched by the steel rods said the guardia civil and theres a cool box in the boot we havent opened either of them this is why we need an organized crime response squad in seville said jorge were running this for the moment theyre sending someone up from the costa del sol greco and an intelligence guy from cico said falcon lets take a look at this money elvira called me on the way to say hes got prosegur to send a van out the guardia civil opened the boot there was suddenly a crowd joder said one of the motorbike cops the visible money was in used notes and bound in packs of and denomination notes some of the packs had burst open on impact from the steel rod but there was no loose money outside the vehicle lets have some room around here said falcon glove up only the forensics and i will touch this money jorge bring a couple of bin liners over one for each denomination they counted out the packs of money avid eyes looking on at the bottom of the suitcase were several layers of denomination notes and below them two layers of notes jorge went to get two more bin liners falcon made his calculations not counting this loose money were looking at seven million six hundred and fifty thousand euros thats got to be drug money said the guardia civil more likely peopletrafficking and prostitution said falcon who was calling comisario elvira as he gave his report the prosegur van pulled up in front of the last nissan two helmeted guys lifted a metal trunk out of the back falcon hung up felipe had taped up the packs of money into tight black blocks and was marking up the bin liners with white stickon labels they put the four blocks into the trunk which was locked with two keys one given to falcon who signed for it the money moved off the scene relaxed falcon lifted out the cool box opened it krug champagne and melting blocks of ice around bottles of stolichnaya i suppose eight million euros would merit a bit of a celebration said the guardia civil we could have all retired on that lot while one of the fire brigade teams winched the steel rods out of the car the other reached through the window cut away the air bag and started on the door frames with an oxyacetylene torch vasili lukyanovs body was taken out in pieces and laid on an opened body bag on a stretcher his arms shoulders and head were intact as were his legs hips and lower torso the rest had vaporized his face was deeply furrowed with red streaks where the windscreen glass had shredded the skin his left eye had exploded part of his scalp was missing and his right ear was a mangled flap of gristle he grinned horribly with lips partially torn away and some teeth ripped from their gums his lap was stained dark with his blood his shoes were brand new the soles hardly scuffed a young fireman vomited into the oleanders by the side of the road the paramedics tucked lukyanov into the body bag and zipped it up poor fucker said felipe bagging the suitcase eight million in the boot and you get speared by a flying steel rod youre more likely to win the lottery said jorge taking a look at the briefcases combination lock trying to open it unsuccessfully and then bagging it should have bought a ticket and stayed at home here we go said felipe whod just opened the glove compartment one ninemillimetre glock and a spare clip for our friendly russian comrade he sorted through the car papers and insurance documents while jorge worked through a selection of motorway receipts something to brighten up his day said jorge shaking a plastic sachet of white powder which had fallen out of the receipts and something to dull someone elses day said felipe pulling out a cosh from under the seat theres blood and hair still stuck to it hes got gps anyone got the keys asked felipe over his shoulder the guardia civil handed him the keys they turned on the electrics felipe played with the gps he was coming from estepona heading for calle garlopa in seville este that narrows it down to a few thousand apartments said falcon at least it didnt say town hall plaza nueva seville said jorge everybody laughed and went quiet as if it might not be so far from the truth another hour and theyd been through the rest of the car they crossed over the motorway with the evidence bags loaded them into the back of their van and drove off falcon oversaw the loading of the range rover on to the breakdown truck first light creaked open at the hinge of the world as he walked back up to where the truck had hit the barrier whose galvanized metal ballooned the truck had been pulled away and was now on the hard shoulder front jacked up behind the tow truck he called elvira to tell him that the prosegur van had left and to make sure someone was at the jefatura to receive the money the forensics still needed to go over it before it could be sent to the bank what else asked elvira a locked briefcase a handgun a bloody cosh krug champagne vodka and a few grams of coke said falcon a violent party animal was vasili lukyanov animal is the word said elvira he was arrested back in june on suspicion of rape of a sixteenyearold girl from malaga and he got off the charges were dropped on him and another brute called nikita sokolov and having seen the photos of the girl its nothing short of a miracle said elvira but then i called malaga and it seems that the girl and her parents have moved into a brandnew fourbedroomed house in a development outside nerja and her father has just opened a restaurant in the town which is where his daughter now works this new world makes me feel old javier there are a lot of wellfed people out there who are still hungry said falcon you should have seen the reaction to all that money in the back of the russians car you got it all though didnt you who knows if a few packs were lifted before i arrived ill call you when vicente cortes gets here and well have a meeting in my office said elvira maybe you should go home and get some sleep they came for alexei just before dawn and couldnt raise him one of them had to scramble down the side of the small villa and get into the garden over a low wall he broke the lock on the sliding window let himself in and opened the front door for his friend who took out his stechkin aps handgun which hed hung on to since leaving the kgb back in the early s they went upstairs he was in the bedroom wound up in a sheet on the floor with an empty bottle of whisky next to him dead to the world they kicked him awake he came to moaning they stuck him in the shower and turned on the water cold alexei grunted as if they were still kicking him the muscles trembled under his tattoos they kept the water trained on him for a couple of minutes and let him out he shaved with the two men in the mirror and took some aspirin swilled down with tap water they walked him into the bedroom and watched him while he got dressed in his sunday best the exkgb man sat on the bed with his stechkin aps dangling between his knees they went downstairs and out into the heat the sun was just up the sea was blue there was barely any movement just birds they got into the car and drove down the hill ten minutes later they were in the club sitting in vasili lukyanovs office but with leonid revnik behind the desk smoking an h upmann coronas junior cigar he had short grey hair cut en brosse with a sharp widows peak big shoulders and chest under a very expensive white shirt from jermyn street did you speak to him last night asked revnik to vasili yes i got through eventually said alexei where was he on the road to seville i dont know where what did he have to say asked revnik that yuri donstov had made him an offer that you wouldnt have given him in a million years hes right there said revnik what else alexei shrugged revnik glanced up a hard fist clubbed alexei in the side of the head knocked him and the chair over what else said revnik they hefted alexei and the chair back to vertical a lump was already up on the side of his face what the fuck said alexei he had an accident that had revniks attention tell me we were talking and he suddenly said what the fuck is this then bang and the sound of tyres screeching a thump a crash and then it all went dead revnik hit the desk why the fuck didnt you tell us that last night i was drunk i passed out you know what that means said revnik to no one in particular but pointing across the room it means that what was in there is now in the hands of the police they looked at the empty safe take him away said revnik they took him back out to the car drove up into the hills the smell of pine was very strong after the cool of the night they walked him into the trees and the exkgb man finally got to use his stechkin aps outside seville friday th september hrs the sun had been up for twentyfive minutes over the flat fields of the fertile flood plain of the guadalquivir river it was close to c when falcon drove back into the city at am at home he lay on his bed fully clothed in the aircon and tried to get some sleep it was hopeless he drank another coffee before heading into the office the short drive took him down by the river past the spearhead railings and gates to the maestranza bullring whose whitewashed facade smooth and brilliant as the icing of a cake had its porthole windows and dark red doors and shutters piped with ochre the high phoenix palms near the toro de oro sagged against the already bleached sky and as he crossed the san telmo bridge the slow water was almost green and had no autumnal sparkle the emptiness of the plaza de cuba and the shopping streets leading off it was a reminder that it was still a summer heat beating down on the bludgeoned city sevillanos had returned from their august holidays to find their new vitality sapped by suffocating apartments drained by power cuts and the old city centre crammed with hot unbreathable air the endofsummer storms which scrubbed the cobbles clean hosed down the grateful trees rinsed the uninspired atmosphere and brought colour back to the faded sky had not arrived with no respite since may ladies fans no longer opened with the customary snap and their wrists trembled with a fluttering palsy at the thought of another month of endless palpitations nobody in the office at am the paperwork from the th june seville bombing still stacked kneehigh around his desk the court case against the two remaining suspects was going to take months possibly years to construct and there was no guarantee of success the wall chart pinned up opposite falcons desk with all its names and links said it all there was a gap in what the media were calling the catholic conspiracy or rather not so much a gap as a dead end every time he sat at his desk the same five facts presented themselves to him although the two suspects they had in custody had been successfully linked to the two ringleaders of the plot all four were rightwing and staunch catholics hence the name of the conspiracy neither of them had any idea whod planted the bomb which on th june had destroyed an apartment building and a nearby preschool in a residential area of seville the ringleaders themselves lucrecio arenas and cesar benito had been murdered before they could be arrested the former had been shot just as he was about to dive into his swimming pool in marbella and the latter had had his throat so brutally chopped with the blade of a hand that hed choked to death in his hotel room in madrid over the last three months a plethora of agencies at the behest of the board of directors had gone through the offices of the banco omni in madrid where lucrecio arenas had been the chief executive officer theyd interviewed all his old colleagues and business contacts searched his properties and grilled his family but had found nothing theyd also gone through the horizonte groups building in barcelona where cesar benito had been an architect and board director of the construction division theyd searched his apartments houses in the costa del sol and studio and interviewed everybody hed ever known and likewise found nothing they had tried to gain access to the iit europe building in madrid this company was the european arm of an americanbased investment group run by two bornagain christians from cleveland ohio they were the ultimate owners of horizonte and through a team of highly paid lawyers had successfully blocked all investigations arguing that the police had no right to enter their offices every time falcon threw himself into his chair he faced that chart and the hard brick wall behind it the world had moved on as it always did even after new york madrid and london but falcon had to mark time wandering aimlessly in the maze of passages that the conspiracy had become as always he was haunted by the promise hed made to the people of seville in a live broadcast on th june that he would find the perpetrators of the seville bombing even if it took him the rest of his career that was what he faced although he would never admit it to comisario elvira when he woke up alone in the dark he had penetrated the conspiracy gained access to the dark castle but it had rewarded him with nothing now he was reduced to hoping for the secret door or the hidden passage which would take him to what he could not see what he had noticed was that the one person over these three long months who was never far from his thoughts was the disgraced judge esteban calderon and by association the judges girlfriend a cuban wood sculptor called marisa moreno inspector jefe falcon looked up from the dark pit of his mind to find the wideopen face of one of his best young detectives the exnun cristina ferrera there was nothing very particular about cristina that made her attractive the small nose the big smile the short straight dull blonde hair didnt do it but what she had on the inside a big heart unshakeable moral beliefs and an extraordinary empathy had a way of appearing on the outside and it was that which falcon had found so appealing during their first interview for the job she now held i thought you were in here she said but you didnt answer up early a colourful russian got killed by a flying steel rod on the motorway said falcon have you got anything for me two weeks ago you asked me to look into the life of juez calderons girlfriend marisa moreno to see if there was any dirt attached said ferrera and here i am by remarkable coincidence thinking about that very person said falcon go on dont get too excited i can tell from your face said falcon drifting back to the wall chart that whatever it is its not much to show for two weeks work not solid work and you know what its like here in seville things take time said ferrera you already know she has no criminal record so what did you find asked falcon catching a different tone in her voice after getting people to do a lot of rooting around in the local police archives ive come up with a reference a reference she reported a missing person her sister margarita back in may eight years ago said falcon looking up at the ceiling is that interesting thats the only thing i could find said ferrera shrugging margarita was seventeen and had already left school the local police did nothing except check up on her about a month later and marisa reported that shed been found apparently the girl had left home with a boyfriend that marisa didnt know about theyd gone to madrid until their money ran out and then hitched back thats it end of story well if nothing else it gives me an excuse to go and see marisa moreno said falcon is that all did you see this message from the prison governor your meeting with esteban calderon is confirmed for one oclock this afternoon perfect ferrera left and falcon was once again alone in his head with marisa moreno and esteban calderon there was an obvious reason why calderon was never far from his thoughts the brilliant but arrogant instructing judge of the th june bombing had been found days after the explosion at an absolutely crucial moment of their investigation trying to dispose of his prosecutor wife in the guadalquivir river calderons wife ines was javier falcons exwife as the homicide chief falcon had been called to the scene when theyd opened the shroud around the body and hed found himself looking down into iness beautiful but inanimate features hed fainted given the circumstances the investigation into iness murder had been handed over to an outsider inspector jefe luis zorrita from madrid in an interview with marisa moreno zorrita had discovered that on the night of the murder calderon had left her taken a cab home and let himself into his doublelocked apartment zorrita had drawn together an extraordinary array of lurid detail involving domestic and sexual abuse and extracted a confession from a stunned calderon who had been subsequently charged since then falcon had spoken to the judge only once in a police cell shortly after the event now he was nervous not because he feared a resurgence of the earlier emotions but because after all his file reading he was hoping hed found the smallest chink into the heart of the conspiracy the internal phone rang comisario elvira told falcon that vicente cortes from the costa del sol greco had arrived falcon checked with the forensics whod so far only found fingerprints that matched those of vasili lukyanov they were about to start work on the money but they needed falcon for the key he went down to the evidence room when youre done tell me and ill put the money in the safe until we can get it transferred to the bank said falcon what about the briefcase the most interesting things in there were twentyodd disks said jorge we played one it looked like hiddencamera footage of guys having sex with young women snorting cocaine some s ampm stuff that kind of thing you havent transferred it to a computer have you no just played it on a dvd player where are the disks now on top of the safe there falcon locked them inside took the lift up to comisario elviras office where he was introduced to vicente cortes from the organized crime response squad and martin diaz from the organized crime intelligence centre cico both men were young in their midthirties cortes was a trained accountant who from the way his shoulders and biceps strained against the material of his white shirt looked as if hed been put through a few assault courses since hed graduated from numbercrunching he had brown hair swept back green eyes and a mouth that was permanently on the brink of a sneer diaz was a computer specialist and a linguist with russian and arabic up his sleeve he wore a suit which he probably had to have made especially for him being close to two metres tall he played basketball to professional standard he was darkhaired with brown eyes and a slight stoop probably earned by trying to listen to his wife half a metre shorter than him this was the reality of catching organized criminals accountants and computer whizzes rather than special forces and weaponstrained cops falcon delivered his report to the three men elvira with his dark laserparted hair kept straightening the files on his desk and fingering the neat and perfect knot of his blue tie he was conservative conventional and played everything by the book with one eye on his job and the other on his boss the jefe superior andres lobo vasili lukyanov ran a number of puti clubs on the costa del sol and some of the main roads around granada said cortes peopletrafficking sexual slavery and prostitution were his main sexual slavery asked falcon nowadays you can rent a girl for any amount of time you like shell do everything from housework to full sex when you get bored of her you hand her back and get another one she costs fifteen hundred euros per week said cortes the girls are traded in markets they may come from moldova albania or even nigeria but theyre sold and resold as much as ten times before they get here normal price is around three thousand euros depending on looks by the time the girl arrives in spain she may have accumulated sales of thirty thousand which she has to pay off i know its illogical but thats only to you and me not to people like vasili lukyanov we found some cocaine in his car is that a sideline or hes recently moved into cocaine distribution or rather his gang leader has struck a deal for product coming in from galicia and theyve now come to some form of agreement with the colombians with regard to their operations on the costa del sol so where is lukyanov in the hierarchy asked elvira cortes nodded to diaz difficult question and were wondering about the significance of finding him in a car bound for seville with nearly eight million euros said diaz hes important the russians make huge profits from the sex trade more than they make from drugs at the moment the hierarchy has been a problem in the last year since we had operation wasp in and the georgian boss of the russian mafia here in spain fled to dubai dubai asked elvira thats where you go nowadays if youre a criminal a terrorist an arms trader a moneylaunderer or a builder finished cortes its the costa del sol of the middle east did that leave a power vacuum here in spain asked falcon no his position was taken over by leonid revnik who was sent from moscow to take control it was not a popular move with the mafia soldiers on the ground mainly because his first act was to execute two leading mafia directors from one of the moscow brigades who had encroached on his turf said diaz they were both found bound gagged and shot in the back of the head in the sierra bermeja ten kilometres north of estepona said cortes we think that it was some old feud dating back to the s in moscow but what it did was create nervousness among the soldiers they found they were having to run their business and look out for revenge attacks there have been four disappearances so far this year were not used to this level of violence all the other mafia groups the turks and italians who run the heroin trade the colombians and the galicians who control cocaine the moroccans who traffic people and hashish none of them practise the sort of spectacular violence they use in their own countries because they see spain as a safe haven they followed our old longstanding friends the arab arms dealers who run their global businesses from the costa del sol to all of them its just a massive laundromat to clean their money which means they dont want to draw attention to themselves the russians on the other hand dont seem to give a damn any idea why vasili lukyanov would be heading for seville with eight million euros in his boot asked elvira i dont know im not up to date on whats happening in seville its possible that cico in madrid have some intelligence on whats been going on here ive put in a request said diaz it wouldnt surprise me if there was a rival group opening up here leonid revnik is fiftytwo and old school i think hed be suspicious of someone like vasili lukyanov who didnt come up through the russian prison system but was an afghan war veteran who bought his way in and works with women which revnik probably considers inferior despite its profitability how profitable asked elvira we have four hundred thousand prostitutes here in spain and they generate eighteen billion euros worth of business said diaz we are the biggest users of prostitutes and cocaine of any country in europe so you think leonid revnik despised vasili lukyanov who would then have been open to offers for his expertise in a very profitable business said falcon could be said diaz revnik has been away in moscow we were expecting him back next week but he returned early maybe he heard lukyanov was making a move i can tell you one thing for sure lukyanov wouldnt be going it alone hed need protection but whose support hes getting i dont know and the eight million asked elvira still not satisfied thats a sort of entry fee it forces lukyanov to burn his bridges said cortes once hes stolen that sort of money hes never going to be able to go back to revnik the disks in the briefcase i mentioned in my initial report said falcon hiddencamera stuff older men with young girls its how the russians get things done they corrupt whoever they come into contact with said cortes we might be about to find out how our town planners councillors mayors and even senior policemen spent their summer holidays comisario elvira ran his hand over his perfectly combed hair seville prison alcala de guadaira friday th september hrs through the reinforced glass pane of the door falcon watched calderon who was hunched over the table smoking staring into the tinfoil ashtray waiting for him the judge whod been young for his position looked older he had lost his gilded moisturized sheen his skin was dull and hed lost weight where there was none to lose making him look haggard his hair had never been luxuriant but was now definitely thinning to baldness his ears seemed to have got longer the lobes fleshier as if from some unconscious tugging while musing on the entanglements of his mind it settled falcon to see the judge so reduced it would have been intolerable had the wifebeater been his usual arrogant self falcon opened the door for the guard who held a tray of coffee and followed him in calderon instantly reanimated himself into an approximation of the supremely confident man he had once been to what or to whom do i owe this pleasure asked calderon standing up sweeping his arm across the sparsely furnished room privacy coffee an old friend these unimaginable luxuries id have come before now said falcon sitting down but as youve probably realized ive been busy calderon took a long careful look at him and lit another cigarette the third of his second pack of the day the guard set down the tray and left the room and what could possibly make you want to come and see the murderer of your exwife alleged murderer of your wife is that significant or are you just being accurate this last week is the first time ive had since june to think and do some reading said falcon well i hope it was a good novel and not the transcript of my interview with my grand inquisitor inspector jefe luis zorrita said calderon that as my lawyer will tell you was not my finest hour ive read that quite a few times and ive also gone over zorritas interview with marisa moreno said falcon shes been to see you a number of times hasnt she unfortunately said calderon nodding theyve not been conjugal visits we talk about what we were never very good at talking said calderon drawing hard on his cigarette we had that other language i was just thinking that maybe since youve been in here you might have developed some other communication skills i have but not particularly with marisa so why does she come to see you duty guilt i dont know ask her guilt i think there might be a few things she regrets telling zorrita about said calderon like what i dont want to talk about it said calderon not with you things like that little joke you had with marisa about the bourgeois solution to costly divorce murder your wife fuck knows how that bastard zorrita squeezed that out of her maybe he didnt have to squeeze too hard said falcon calmly calderons cigarette stopped on the way to his mouth what else do you think she regretted talking to zorrita about asked falcon she covered for me she said i left her apartment later than i did she thought she was doing me a favour but zorrita had all the timings from the cab company it was a stupid thing to have done it counted against me made me look as if i needed help especially taken in conjunction with the cops finding me on the banks of the guadalquivir river trying to dispose of iness body said calderon who stopped frowned and did some concentrated smoking what the fuck are you doing here javier whats this all about im trying to help you said falcon are you now said calderon and why would you want to help the alleged murderer of your exwife i realize that you and ines werent particularly close any more but still you told me you were innocent youve said so from the very beginning well inspector jefe javier falcon youre the expert on the murderers constant state of denial said calderon i am said falcon and im not going to pretend to you that my investigation into what happened on that night doesnt have ulterior motives all right said calderon sitting back paradoxically satisfied by this revelation i didnt think you wanted to save my ass especially if youve read that transcript as many times as you said theres some very ugly stuff in there i cant deny that esteban nor can i said calderon i wouldnt mind turning back the clock on my whole relationship with ines i have some questions relating to the transcript said falcon heading off a possible descent into selfpity i understand that the first time you hit ines was when she discovered the naked photographs of marisa on your digital camera she was trying to download them on to her computer said calderon leaping to his own defence i didnt know what her intentions were i mean its one thing to find them but it seemed to me that she was going to make use of them in some way im sure ines knew you very well by then said falcon so why did you leave the camera hanging around what were you thinking of taking shots of your naked lover i didnt take them marisa did while i was asleep she was nice about it though she told me shed left some presents on the camera said calderon and i didnt leave the camera hanging around ines went through my pockets and what were you doing with the camera in the first place i took some shots of a lawyers dinner id attended earlier in the evening said calderon my alibi if ines found the camera which you knew she would calderon nodded smoked searched his memory something he did a lot these days id overslept at marisas he said it was six oclock in the morning and you know i wasnt as collected as i would have been normally ines appeared to be asleep she wasnt when i dropped off she got up and found the shots and that was the first time you hit her said falcon have you thought about that since youve been in here are you going to be my shrink as well javier falcon showed him an empty pair of hands if you didnt take the shots of marisa and the only reason you had the camera with you was to provide yourself with an alibi for ines how come it was at hand for your lover to take photos of herself naked calderon stared into the wall for some time until he gradually started chopping the air with his cigarette fingers she told me she went through my jacket pockets she said i come from a bourgeois family i kick against it but i know all the tricks said calderon they all go through your pockets thats what women do javier its part of their training theyre very exigent on details did she volunteer that information no i asked her any reason i dont know said calderon i think i was hunting for my shoes i was nervous about getting back to my apartment and having a confrontation with ines id never stayed out all night before i suppose marisas behaviour just struck me as a bit odd any thoughts about it now its the sort of thing a wife would do not a lover said calderon crushing out the cigarette in the tinfoil ashtray its what ines did when i got home youre smoking a lot esteban theres nothing else to do and it calms my nerves maybe you should think of an alternative method of calming your nerves calderon looked up suspicious you can keep trying javier but im not going to lie down on your couch what about somebody elses couch said falcon flicking over a page in his notebook another question about the transcript calderon lit a cigarette belligerently he inhaled deeply without taking his eyes off falcon and blew the smoke out the side of his mouth go on he said im listening why do you think marisa told inspector jefe zorrita that shed met ines zorrita said that dealing with liars was like dealing with children marisa tried to lie about it but he broke her down zorrita is a dictaphone man not a notetaker ive listened to the recording of the interview with marisa said falcon if there was one bit of evidence you didnt want in zorritas hands it was the fact of marisa and ines having met before and especially the circumstances of that meeting probably said calderon not that interested in something he didnt regard as a development zorrita found a witness to that meeting in the murillo gardens on th june it wasnt too difficult because apparently it was quite a showdown between the two women the witness said they went at each other like a couple of whores competing for the same patch doesnt sound like that witness hung around in very nice places they smiled at each other with no humour according to this witness marisa had the last word said falcon flicking through his notebook she said something along the lines of just remember ines that when hes beating you its because hes been fucking me so beautifully all night that he cant bear to see your disappointed little face in the morning is that what marisa told you because she didnt happen to mention that to zorrita whats your point first of all how did marisa find out that youd been beating ines she didnt have a bruised face did you tell her no maybe one of the ugly lessons she learnt in her early life in havana was how to spot an abused woman your point javier said calderon with courtroom lawyers steel marisa gave zorrita the impression that ines had the upper hand she mentioned iness phrase several times la puta con el puro the whore with the cigar thats what she told me said calderon listening hard now zorrita thought marisa had told him all that because she was still furious at being shamed by ines in public but clearly she wasnt marisa crushed ines the witness said that ines went off like the village cur so what was marisas purpose in telling zorrita about that meeting you think it was calculated said calderon i listened to the tape zorrita only had to prod her a couple of times to get the story out of her and the story her version of it was crucial in redoubling your motive to beat ines and perhaps take it too far and kill her now that would be a story that youd want to keep out of the investigating officers mind at all costs calderon was smoking so intently that he was making himself dizzy with the nicotine rush my final question to do with the transcript said falcon inspector jefe zorrita came to see me some hours after hed interviewed you i asked if youd broken down and confessed and his answer was sort of he admitted that when you refused a lawyer god knows what you were thinking of at that moment esteban it meant that he could be more brutal with you in the interview that combined with the horror of the autopsy revelations seemed to create doubt in your mind and zorrita reckoned it was then that you believed that you could have done it i was very confused said calderon my hubris was in refusing the lawyer i was a lawyer i could handle myself when zorrita asked you to describe what happened when you went back to your apartment that night he said you rendered the events in the form of a film script i dont remember that you used the third person singular you were describing something youd seen as if you were out of your body or behind a camera it was clear you were in some kind of trance didnt your lawyer mention any of this maybe he was too embarrassed there seems to be some confusion about what you saw when you came into the apartment said falcon my lawyer and i have talked about that in your film script version you describe yourself as annoyed because you didnt want to see ines i didnt want a confrontation i wasnt angry as i had been when marisa told me about meeting ines in the murillo gardens i was pretty much asleep on my feet those were long days all the work followed by media engagements in the evening falcon flipped over another page of his notebook what interested me was when you said he stumbled into the bedroom collapsed on to the bed and passed out immediately he was aware only of pain he lashed out wildly with his foot he woke up with no idea where he was what was all that about is that a direct quote yes said falcon putting the dictaphone on the table and pressing play calderon listened transfixed as the smoke crawled up the valleys of his fingers is that me falcon played it again it doesnt seem that important i think marisa put a cigarette lighter to your foot said falcon calderon leapt to his feet as if hed been spiked from underneath my foot was sore for days he said with sudden recall i had a blister why would marisa put a cigarette lighter to your foot to wake me up i was dead to the world there are more charming ways to wake your lover up than burning his foot with a cigarette lighter said falcon i think that she had to wake you up because the timing of your departure from her apartment was crucial calderon sank back into his chair lit another cigarette and stared up into the light coming in through the high barred window he blinked as his eyes filled and he bit down on his bottom lip youre helping me said calderon the ironys not lost on me javier you need different help to what i can give you said falcon now lets just go back to my original point from the transcript just one more thing about that night the two versions you gave zorrita about how you found ines in the apartment calderons brain snapped back into some prerehearsed groove and falcon held up his hand im not interested in the version you and your lawyer have prepared for court said falcon remember none of this is about your case what im trying to do might help you but the design is not to get you off the hook its for me to find my way in to what the conspiracy who planted that small goma eco bomb in the basement mosque which exploded on the th of june detonating the hundred kilos of hexogen stored there bringing down the apartment building and destroying the preschool javier falcon keeps his promise to the people of seville said calderon grunting nobodys forgotten that least of all me calderon leaned across the table looked up through the pupils of falcons eyes into the top of his cranium do i detect something of an obsession going on here he said personal crusades javier are not advisable in police work every old peoples home in spain probably has a retired detective gaping from the windows his mind still twisted around a missing girl or a poor bludgeoned boy dont go there nobody expects it of you people remind me of it all the time in the jefatura and in the palacio de justicia said falcon and whats more i expect it of myself see you in the loony bin javier save me a place by the window said calderon sitting back inspecting the conical ember of his cigarette were not going to end up in the loony bin said falcon youre pretty keen to get me down on some shrinks couch said calderon dredging for lost confidence and you know what i say fuck off you and anybody else mind your own madness you especially javier its been less than five years since your complete breakdown wasnt that what they called it and i can see youve been working hard god knows how many times you went through the files on the bombing before you started combing zorritas reports looking for the flaws in my case you should get out more javier have you fucked that consuelo yet lets get back to what happened at around am on thursday th june in your apartment in calle san vicente said falcon tapping his notebook in one version you came in to see ines standing at the sink and you were so happy to see her and yet in the other version you were annoyed there was some sort of hiatus you woke up lying in the corridor and when you went back to the kitchen you found ines dead on the floor calderon swallowed hard as he replayed that night in the darkness of his mind he had done it so many times more times than even the most obsessive director would have edited and reedited a scene from a movie it now played in short sequences but in reverse from that moment of intense guilt when trapped in the patrolmans torch beam hed been discovered trying to throw ines into the river to that blissful prelapsarian state when hed got out of the cab helped by the driver and walked up the stairs to his apartment with no other intention than to get into bed as quickly as possible and that was the point he always seized on he knew at that moment he did not have murder on his mind there was no intent he said out loud start from the beginning esteban look javier ive tried it every which way forwards backwards and inside out but however hard i try theres always a gap said calderon lighting another cigarette from the stub of the last one the cab driver opened the apartment door for me two turns of the key he left me there i went into the apartment i saw the light from the kitchen i remember being annoyed and i repeat annoyed not angry or murderous i was just irritated that i might have to explain myself when all i wanted to do was crash out so i remember that emotion very clearly then nothing until i woke up on the floor in the corridor beyond the kitchen what do you think about zorritas theory that people have blank moments about terrible things they have done ive come across it professionally i dont doubt it ive searched every corner of my mind so what was this about seeing ines alive and being so happy my lawyer tells me that freud had a term for that wish fulfilment he called it said calderon you want something to be true so badly that your mind invents it for you i did not want ines to be dead on the floor we were not happy together but i did not want her dead i wanted her to be alive so badly that my mind substituted the reality with my most fervent wish both versions came out in the turmoil of that first interview with zorrita you know that this is the crux of your case said falcon the flaws ive found are small marisa going through your pockets getting the upper hand in the shouting match with ines in the murillo gardens and burning your foot to wake you up these things amount to nothing when put against your recorded statement in which you say that you entered the doublelocked apartment alone saw ines alive blacked out and then found her dead your inner turmoil and all that wishfulfilment crap is no match for those powerful facts more concentrated smoking from calderon he scratched at his thinning hair and his left eye twitched and why do you think marisa is the key the worst possible thing that could have happened at that moment in our investigation into the bombing was to have our instructing judge and our strongest performer in front of the media arrested for the murder of his wife said falcon losing you pretty well derailed the whole process if your disgrace was planned then marisa was crucial to its execution ill speak to her said calderon nodding his face hardening you wont said falcon weve stopped her visits youre too desperate esteban i dont want you to give anything away what youve got to do is unlock your mind and see if you can find any detail that might help me and it might be advisable to get a professional in to do that for you ah said calderon getting it finally the shrink puti club estepona costa del sol friday th september hrs leonid revnik was still sitting at vasili lukyanovs desk in the club but this time he was waiting for news from viktor belenki his secondincommand when revnik had taken control of the costa del sol after the police had mounted operation wasp in hed got belenki to run the construction businesses through which they laundered most of the proceeds of their drugs and prostitution trade belenki had just the right veneer of the goodlooking successful businessman and he spoke fluent spanish too the veneer though was only an expensive suit thick as viktor belenki was a violent brute with access to a rage so incandescent that even revniks most psychopathic henchmen were afraid of him belenki could also be very friendly and extremely generous especially if you jumped when he told you to this meant that he had developed good contacts in the guardia civil some of whom had thick wads of belenkis euros hidden in their garages leonid revnik was hoping that belenki could tell him where the money and disks that lukyanov had stolen from the puti club safe had ended up he was on his third cigar of the day the empty safe was still gaping the aircon was on the blink and he was uncomfortably hot the mobile on the desk rang viktor said revnik its taken some time to get this information because its out of the normal area of my guys jurisdiction said belenki the guardia civil who went to the scene of the accident came from a town outside seville called utrera when they found the money they called the police headquarters in seville and because it was clear that this wasnt just any old guy whod died in a car accident they went to the top for instructions comisario elvira shit said revnik and he put it in the hands of inspector jefe javier falcon remember him everybody remembers him from the bombing in june said revnik so wheres it all gone its in the jefatura in seville have we still got somebody in there thats how i know where everything is right so how do we get it out you can say goodbye to the money said belenki once the forensics have been over it theyll stick it in the bank unless you want to hold up a prosegur van i dont give a fuck about the money i mean i do but youre right the disks theyre a different matter said revnik what can we get on falcon youre not going to be able to buy him thats for sure so what else theres always the woman said belenki consuelo jimenez ah yes the woman said revnik at the traffic lights falcon searched his eyes in the rearview mirror trying to find the evidence of obsession calderon had seen there he didnt really need to look at the telltale blackberry smudges he knew from the slight gaucherie in his left hand and that feeling of wearing someone elses right leg that what was cradled in his mind was beginning to have physical manifestations work had sat on falcons shoulders like an overweight badly packed rucksack and it never slipped off not even at night in the mornings he opened an eye his face crushed hard into the pillow after snatching an hours lethal sleep to feel his bones creaking in his skeleton the weeks holiday hed taken at the end of august when hed joined his friend yacoub diouri and his family on the beach at essaouira in morocco had worn off on his first day back in the office horns blared behind him he pulled away from the traffic lights he came into the old city through the puerta osario he parked badly near the san marcos church and walked down calle bustos tavera to the tunnelled passageway that led from the street into a courtyard of workshops where marisa moreno had her studio his footsteps sounded loud on the large cobbles of the dark tunnel he broke out into the fierce light in the courtyard squinted against it to take in the dilapidated buildings the grass growing up through old rear axles and expired fridges he walked up a metal stairway to a doorway above a small warehouse foot shuffling and dull thuds came from inside he knocked who is it police momentito the door was opened by a tall slim mulatto woman with an unusually long neck who had wood chips stuck to her face and in her coppery hair which was tied back she wore a cobaltblue gown under which she was naked apart from some bikini briefs sweat pimpled across her forehead over the undulation of her nose and trickled down the visible bones of her chest she was breathing heavily marisa moreno he said holding up his police id i am inspector jefe javier falcon ive already told inspector jefe luis zorrita everything i know a couple of hundred times she said ive got nothing to add ive come to talk to you about your sister my sister she said and falcon did not miss the momentary fear that froze her features you have a sister called margarita i know my own sisters name falcon paused hoping that marisa might feel the need to fill the moment with more information she stared him out you reported her missing in when she was two months short of her seventeenth birthday come in she said dont touch anything the studios floor was patched with rough concrete where the clay tiles had come up the air smelled of bare timber turps and oils there were chippings everywhere and a pile of sawdust in the corner a meat hook large enough to take a full carcass hung from the tie rod which spanned the room suspended from its sharp hook was an electric chain saw its flex thrown over the bar three dark and polished statues stood beneath the oily sawdustencrusted tool one with its head missing falcon made for the space around the piece the headless statue was that of a young woman with breasts high on her chest perfect orbs the faces of the men flanking her had nothing in them their eyes were blank the musculature of their bodies had something of the savagery of an existence in the wild about them their genitals were outsized and despite being flaccid seemed sinister as if they were spent from a recent rape marisa watched him as he took the piece in waiting for the banality of his comments she had yet to meet the white man who could resist a little critique and her warriors with their prize penises drew plenty of lewd admiration what she registered in falcons face was not even a raised eyebrow but a brief revulsion as he looked down the bodies so what happened to margarita he asked switching to marisa you reported her missing on th may and when the police came to check with you a month later you said shed turned up again about a week after shed disappeared that was how much they cared she said reaching for a small halfsmoked cigar which she relit they took down her details and i never heard from them again they wouldnt take my calls and when i went round to the station they just dismissed me said she was with some boyfriend or other if youre pretty and mulatto like her they just think youre some kind of fucking machine im sure they did nothing she did go to madrid with a boyfriend though didnt she they were pretty pleased about that when i told them where were your parents in all this asked falcon margarita was still a kid dead you see they probably didnt put that in the report my father died up north in gijon in my mother died here in seville in and two months later margarita went missing she was upset that was why i was worried your father was cuban we came over here in it was a bad time in cuba russian aid had dried up after the berlin wall came down in theres a large cuban community in gijon so thats where we settled how did your parents meet my father had a club in gijon my mother was a flamenco dancer from seville shed come up to perform at the annual semana negra fair my father was a good salsa dancer and theres such a thing as cuban flamenco so they taught each other things and my mother made the mistake that a lot of other women made so obviously she wasnt your natural mother no we dont know what happened to her she was cuban of spanish descent white and political she disappeared soon after my sister was born in you were seven years old its not something i think about very much said marisa things like that could happen in cuba my father never talked about it so who looked after you my father had girlfriends some were interested in us others werent what did your father do in cuba he was somebody in the government an official on the sugar board export said marisa i thought you wanted to talk about my sister and im beginning to wonder why i like to get peoples family situation sorted out in my mind said falcon it doesnt sound like you had a normal life we didnt until my stepmother came along she was a good woman the caring type she really looked after us for the first time in our lives we were loved she even looked after my father when he was dying how was that lung cancer too many cigars she said waving the smoking stub in her hand he only married her after his diagnosis marisa blew a plume of smoke out into the rafters of the wooden roof she felt she had to keep this thing going do one long stint with this new inspector jefe and then maybe hed leave her alone what did you do after your father died asked falcon we moved down here my mother couldnt stand the north all that rain what about her family her parents were dead she had a brother in malaga but he didnt like black people very much he didnt come to her wedding how did your mother die heart attack said marisa eyes shining at the memory of it were you living here at the time i was in los angeles im sorry said falcon that must have been hard she wasnt very old fiftyone did you see her before she died is that any of your business she said turning away looking for an ashtray this cop was getting under her skin my mother died when i was five said falcon it doesnt matter whether youre five or fiftyfive its not something you ever get over marisa turned back slowly shed never heard a sevillano let alone a cop talk like this falcon was frowning at the floor so you came back from los angeles and youve been here ever since he said i stayed for a year said marisa i thought i should look after my sister and what happened she left again but she was eighteen this time so and you havent seen or heard from her since there was a long silence in which marisas mind seemed to float off out of the room and falcon thought for the first time that he was getting somewhere senora moreno said falcon i havent heard from her no are you worried about her she shrugged and for some reason falcon didnt think he was going to believe what he heard next we werent very close which was why she left the first time without telling me is that right said falcon locking eyes with her across the studio so what did you do when she left the second time i finished the course i was doing at the bella artes rented out my mothers apartment which my sister and i had inherited is that where you live now in calle hiniesta and i went to africa she said nodding mali niger nigeria cameroon the congo until it got too dangerous and then i went to mozambique what about the touaregs didnt you spend some time with them silence as she registered that hed heard that from someone else if you know all this inspector jefe why are you asking me i know it but hearing it from you arranges the furniture i let you in here to talk about my sister who youre not close to you seem to have expanded your interests since you started using up my work time and then there was new york she grunted puffed on the cigar to get it going again youve been talking to esteban havent you how do you know i lied to him about new york she said i saw a movie about an artist starring nick nolte and i assumed the role of his assistant ive never been to new york did you lie to him about anything else probably i had an image to live up to an image thats how most of the men ive spent any time with see women you described esteban calderon as your lover to inspector jefe zorrita he was then still is kind of although prison doesnt help she said im sorry he killed his wife he was always so controlled you know still passionate in the way sevillanos are but a lawyer too and with a lawyers mentality so you think he did it what i think doesnt matter its what inspector jefe zorrita thinks that matters she said and something clicked in her mind thats it ive got it now it was your exwife that esteban murdered thats interesting is it i dont know what youre doing here she said puffing on her cigar appraising him anew was your sister with a boyfriend when she left the second time there was always a man involved with margarita pretty girl that and the other thing sex not exactly said marisa who went over to a small plans chest opened a drawer and slapped a sheaf of photos down on the top she was going to let him in or rather let him think that she was opening up take a look i took these three weeks before her eighteenth birthday falcon flicked through the shots a sadness lodged itself in his chest it wasnt sex despite the provocative nudity even when she was lying back legs splayed she had an innocence about her an innocence that itched to be desecrated in the eyes of men that was why marisa had taken the shots and only marisa could have taken them even in the most pornographic of poses margarita never lost her childlike purity whereas the viewer or the voyeur felt the beast rise up on its hind legs and dance on its furry hooves for a sevillano you dont say very much inspector jefe nothing to add he said giving up on the shots halfway through feeling the womans intention and not flattered by it they do their work youre the first person to see those id like a shot of margarita with some clothes on he said so that we can begin to look for her shes not lost any more said marisa she doesnt need to be found im sure youd like to hear from her though wouldnt you another shrug from marisa something very uneasy about her she handed over a headandshoulders shot of her sister you used to go through estebans pockets said falcon taking the photo why did you do that i mean youre an artist i can see that from the quality of this work so youre curious but not for the sort of crap you find in a mans pockets my stepmother did the same thing when my father came back at seven in the morning she hated herself for it but couldnt help it she had to know even though she already knew that doesnt explain anything said falcon i could understand ines wanting to go through his pockets but you what were you looking for you knew he was married and not very happily what else was there my mother came from a very conservative sevillana family you can see the type in her brother and she got involved with a black man when she was fortyfive years old and he repaid her by fucking everything that passed beneath his nose her bourgeois instinct hers not yours she wasnt your natural mother we adored her thats your only explanation you amaze me inspector jefe keys he said cutting in on her digression eyebrows raised what you were after his keys thats why you amaze me said marisa puffing on her chewedover cigar butt spitting out flakes of tobacco zorrita told me triumphantly no less that he had a rocksolid case against esteban for the murder of his wife your ex and here you are trying to chip away at it for some reason that i dont quite understand did you get a key made to his apartment and have a good look around for yourself or make a duplicate for somebody else so that they could look inspector jefe one time i found he had condoms which he never wore when he was with me said marisa once a woman finds something like that she keeps checking to see if there are any fewer ive spoken to the governor were stopping your prison visits why id have thought that would be a relief think what you like falcon nodded something caught his eye under the table he knelt down and rolled it back towards him it was a stained and polished wooden head he inspected it under the light margaritas smooth unsophisticated face looked back at him eyes closed he ran a thumb over the jagged edge of her neck where the chain saw had bitten into the wood what happened here asked falcon a change of artistic vision she said falcon went to the door feeling that the first phase of his work was done he handed her the head too perfect he asked or not the point marisa listened to his feet on the metal stairway and looked down at the carved features of her sisters face she ran her fingers over the eyelids nose and mouth her arm bearing the full weight of the head trembled she put it down found her mobile on the work bench and made a call the cop made her nervous but she was also surprised to find that she did not dislike him and there were very few men that marisa liked not many of them were white and none of them were policemen leonid revnik hadnt moved hed cleared his henchmen out of the room and theyd got a technician in to fix the aircon he was taking a drink from the halfbottle of vodka that was still left in vasili lukyanovs freezer viktor belenki hadnt called him back he had to remind himself to relax because he kept coming out of his thoughts to find his biceps tight in his shirt and his pectorals clenched the landline phone on the desk rang he looked at it suspiciously nobody used these things any more he picked it up spoke in russian without thinking a womans voice answered in the same language and asked to speak to vasili lukyanov who is this he asked hearing a strange accent my name is marisa moreno ive tried calling vasili on his mobile but theres no answer this is the only other number he gave me the cuban woman ritas sister vasili isnt here maybe i can help im his boss said revnik if you want to leave a message ill make sure he gets it he told me i should call him if i had any trouble and whats happened asked revnik a homicide cop called inspector jefe javier falcon came round to my workshop and started asking questions about my sister margarita that name falcon again what did he want with her he said he was going to find her and what did you say i told him she didnt need to be found thats good said revnik have you spoken to anybody else about this i left a message on nikitas phone sokolov he asked barely able to control his rage at having to pronounce another traitors name yes you did the right thing said revnik well handle it dont worry calle bustos tavera seville friday th september hrs there were two people in the world for whom falcon would drop everything one was consuelo jimenez and the other was yacoub diouri ever since hed tracked down yacoub four years ago hed become the younger brother falcon had never had because of yacoubs own complicated past hed had a special understanding of the complexities of the family horrors that had led to falcons complete mental breakdown back in in gradually revealing themselves to each other yacoub had become synonymous with the reassertion of sanity in falcons mind now in the wake of the seville bombing he was even more than a friend and brother he had become falcons spy the spanish intelligence agency the cni in their sudden desperate need for agents in the arab countries nearest their borders had researched the special relationship between falcon and yacoub diouri having seen other western intelligence agencies fail in their bid to recruit yacoub theyd used falcon to bring him into their fold it was for this reason that when falcon received a text from yacoub diouri as he stood in the courtyard outside marisas studio he went immediately in search of a public telephone they hadnt spoken since the short break in essaouira last month their only communication had been on business via the intelligence services encrypted website the cni had insisted on zero physical contact with yacoub since hed successfully penetrated the radical moroccan islamic combatant group the gicm in the days after the seville bombing it was this group which had been storing a hundred kilos of the high explosive hexogen in the basement mosque in a residential quarter of seville yacoub had found out how that hexogen was going to be used and in doing so the cni were concerned that his cover had been blown there had been some tense days in paris when they thought that their new agent might be assassinated their fears had been groundless yacoub returned to rabat but the cni were still so nervous that the only contact theyd allowed was on falcons august holiday which had been arranged in april two months before the recruitment of yacoub diouri it took him a while to find a public phone falcon understood from the text which theyd arranged between themselves in essaouira that this was to be a private conversation and he should not to use his home phone or mobile to make the call im in madrid said yacoub with a quiver in his voice you sound nervous we have to meet when now as soon as possible i couldnt warn you before because well you know why im not sure how im going to be able to get away at such short notice im not asking you to do this for no reason at all javier its complicated and important its the most important thing thats happened so far is this business its business and its personal falcon had something else personal going on tonight he was supposed to be having dinner with consuelo just the two of them another assignation in the gradual process of their coming together are you talking about tonight asked falcon earlier it sounds like you want me to catch the next possible train that would be good said yacoub its that important ill have to work up a plausible reason for youre in the middle of an international investigation there must be a hundred reasons for you to come to madrid call me when you know which train youre on ill let you know where im going to be and javier dont tell anyone that youre coming to see me it was strange how even after all this time there were still certain moments which demanded an immediate cigarette he drove to the santa justa station got caught in traffic and called inspector jefe luis zorrita said he needed to talk to him about marisa morenos evidence did he have some time this evening zorrita was surprised the case was locked off falcon said he had other things to discuss as well they arranged to meet as close to pm as possible a thought came to him as he replayed yacoubs conversation he wondered if this business and personal problem was related to yacoubs homosexuality although yacoub was a happily married man with two children he had this other secret life which to the radical islamic gicm would be unacceptable the traffic opened up falcon moved on put a call through to his secondincommand inspector jose luis ramirez whose usual stolid pugnacity had given way to a mixture of anger and excitement after viewing the disks theyd found in vasili lukyanovs briefcase you wont believe this shit he said a councillor with two girls at the same time a town planner giving it to a teenager in the ass a building inspector snorting cocaine off a black girls tits and thats the mild stuff this will crack the costa del sol wide open if it gets out dont let it you know the rules only one computer in our department relax javier its all under control im not coming back in today said falcon am i going to see you tomorrow elviras out its quiet here ill be here in the morning and ill stay if you want me to but id rather not lets see how it goes said falcon i hope you can have a nice weekend hold on a sec the greco guy vicente cortes was in here earlier looking for you he wanted to tell you that hes had a report about a russian who was found up in the hills behind san pedro de alcantara with a ninemillimetre bullet in the back of his head alexei somebody a big friend of the guy you found on the motorway with a steel rod through his heart mean anything more to cortes than to me said falcon and hung up at the santa justa station falcon found that the next ave to madrid was at which would put him there just in time for his meeting with inspector jefe zorrita he called yacoub on a phone in the station trying to work out when he could get back to seville and whether it would still be possible to make it to consuelos for dinner wanting that needing that even though progress was slow see zorrita said yacoub ill let you know where to go afterwards falcon ate something unmemorable drank a beer sunk a cafe solo and boarded the train he wanted to sleep but there was too much brain interference a woman sitting opposite him was talking to her daughter on her mobile she was getting remarried and her daughter wasnt happy about it complicated lives getting more complicated by the minute the prison governor called to say that esteban calderon had put in a request to see a psychologist the train slashed through the brown parched plains of northern andalucia where had the rain gone he wont see the prison psychologist said the governor he talks about this woman you know but he cant remember her name alicia aguado said falcon youre not the investigating officer in senor calderons case are you no but im seeing the officer who is this evening ill make sure he contacts you he hung up the woman opposite had finished speaking to her daughter she spun the mobile on the table with a long painted nail she looked up the sort of woman who always knows when shes under observation dangerous savemylife eyes thought falcon the daughter was right to be concerned up since before three and still not even lethargic he closed his eyes to the dangerous ones opposite but never reached below that confused state on the edge of oblivion now that he was worried he might not see her this evening consuelo surfaced in his mind theyd first met five years ago when shed been the prime suspect in the murder of her husband the restaurateur raul jimenez a year later theyd met again and had a fling falcon had been hurt when she broke it off but as hed recently discovered consuelo had had her own problems which had sent her to the consulting rooms of the blind clinical psychologist alicia aguado now for the last three months theyd been trying again he could tell she was happier she was easing him into her life gradually only seeing him at weekends and quite often in family situations with her sister and the children he didnt mind that his work had been punishing consuelo too was expanding the restaurant business left to her by raul jimenez falcon enjoyed the feeling of belonging that he got from sitting at her family table he wouldnt have minded more sex but the food was always good and in their moments alone they were getting on thoughts of consuelo always seemed to involve yacoub the two were inextricably linked in his mind the one had led to the other falcon and consuelo had first been drawn together by their fascination with the fate of raul jimenezs youngest son from his first marriage arturo whod vanished in the mid s never to be seen again the boy had been kidnapped by a moroccan businessman as an act of revenge against raul jimenez who had impregnated the businessmans twelveyearold daughter and then fled back to spain after his brief affair with consuelo falcon had set out to find arturo hoping that this would bring her back to him it hadnt worked but the reward had been to discover that arturo had been brought up as one of the moroccan businessmans sons and had even been given his family name to become yacoub diouri their strange pasts falcon who had been raised in spain by francisco falcon only to find that his real father was a moroccan artist and yacoub born a spaniard forsaken by his father raul jimenez to be raised by his moroccan abductor in rabat had been the bizarre foundation of their powerful friendship and for the first time perhaps as a result of his exhausted state falcon found his mildly confused mind reflecting within the emotional compression of these unusual events on what had happened to the child of the twelveyearold daughter whod been impregnated by raul jimenez he must ask yacoub his mobile vibrating against his chest brought him back with a start to the dusty fields flashing past it was his police mobile and he took the call without checking the name on the screen listen inspector jefe javier falcon keep your nose out of things that dont concern you who is this you heard the line went dead he checked the number withheld he folded the phone away the woman opposite was looking at him again across the aisle they were watching him too paranoia that horribly infectious disease closed in the voice on the mobile had there been an accent how had they got his police number something a little more uncomfortable than satisfaction eased between his shoulder blades as he realized that in putting pressure on marisa moreno he must be on the right track hed been dredging his mind for something to talk about to inspector jefe zorrita he didnt want to annoy him with a bunch of hairline cracks in his castiron case now things were firming up in his mind the train eased into the atocha station falcon hadnt arrived in madrid on the ave for some years and as he came into the main concourse he was distracted by the continuing memorial to the victims of the march bombings he was standing there looking at the flowers and candles when the woman from the train appeared by his side this was too much he thought forgive me now i know it must be you she said you are javier falcon arent you may i shake your hand and tell you how much i admire you for what you said on the television about catching the perpetrators of the seville bomb now ive seen you in the flesh i know you wont let us down he held out his hand almost in a trance thanked her she smiled and brushed past him and in that moment he found that his other hand now contained a piece of folded paper he wasnt sure whod put it there but he was sensible enough not to look at it he left the station picked up a cab to the jefatura the folded note gave an address just off the plaza de la paja in the latina district and instructions to enter via the garage inspector jefe luis zorrita welcomed him into his office he was wearing a dark blue suit a red tie and a white shirt in a way that hinted that minus the tie was about as informal as he ever got he had his black hair combed back in rails to reveal a forehead with three lines drawn to a focal point above the bridge of his nose it struck falcon that there was no mistaking him for anything other than a cop his hardness had been added in layers the lacquer of experience a meeting of the eyes a handshake dispelled any possibility that this person was a civil servant or businessman he had seen it all heard it all and his whole family structure and belief system had kept him powerfully sane you look tired javier he said falling back into his chair it never stops does it they looked out of the window at the bright sunlit world that kept them so fully employed falcons eyes shifted back to the desk where there was a photo of zorrita with his wife and three children i didnt want to do this over the phone said falcon i have enormous respect for the work you did last june under very difficult circumstances what have you found asked zorrita cutting through the preliminaries interested to hear what he could possibly have missed as yet nothing zorrita sat back hands clasped over his flat hard stomach not so concerned now that he knew he wasnt going to have to confront a failing on his part my interest in this case is not to get a wifebeater and suspected murderer off the hook said falcon that man is a cabron said zorrita with profound distaste from behind his family photograph a nasty arrogant cabron hes beginning to recognize that himself said falcon ill believe that when i see it said zorrita who was a man incapable of complications in his love life because thered only ever been one woman in it the prison governor just called me to say that hes volunteered to see a shrink no amount of talking no amount of disentangling the shit that went on between him and his parents no amount of light shed on feelings will take away the fact that he beat that poor woman and then killed her and if hes given half a chance like all those other weak brutes hell do it again this isnt what ive come to talk to you about today said falcon seeing that this was something that stoked zorrita up would you mind if i laid out the basic problem ive got some of it youll know but other parts of it will be news to you go ahead said zorrita still simmering as you know the destruction of the preschool and apartment block by the seville bomb of th june three months ago came about as a result of the detonation by a smaller device of approximately one hundred kilos of hexogen this high explosive was being stored by a logistics cell of the moroccan terrorist group the gicm in the basement mosque of the building the smaller device was comprised of goma eco the same explosive used in the th march bombings here in madrid back in prior to the explosion the mosque was cased by two men masquerading as council inspectors who we believe inserted some device in the fuse box which blew and caused a power failure these men have not been found nor have the electricians who were brought in to repair the fuse box restore power and do some other work during which we believe they planted the goma eco device in the false ceiling of the mosque the idea of the socalled catholic conspiracy was to use this outrage to blame islamic extremists to make it look as if they had a plan to return andalucia to the muslim fold the conspirators wanted to turn public opinion in favour of a small rightwing party called fuerza andalucia who in becoming the new partner of the ruling partido popular would put the conspirators in control of the andalucian state parliament it didnt work and the alleged masterminds of the plot cesar benito a board director of horizonte and lucrecio arenas the exceo of banco omni who were horizontes bankers were executed a few days after the bombing what about the islamic calling cards left near their bodies asked zorrita nobody thinks that those killings were carried out by any radical islamist group said falcon its believed they were terminated by their coconspirators who are as yet unknown were coming to that what about the company that owned horizonte said zorrita squinting at the evening sunlight coming in through the window the media tried to make something of them a couple of american christian fundamentalists iit own horizonte its an american investment group run by two bornagain christians called cortland fallenbach and morgan havilland they are so far removed from this situation as to be completely untouchable and for legal reasons we have as yet been unable to gain access to iits european offices here in madrid and presumably the lives of the catholic kings as the media now calls cesar benito and lucrecio arenas have been taken apart that has been and still is a timeconsuming business the cnis banking and accounting department are working their way into the offshore world benito and arenas were what are known in that world as henwees high net worth individuals their assets are hidden behind nominee directors and shareholders and unregistered offshore trusts it will be pure luck if somebody manages to find something in the next six months that we can act upon so youre blocked said zorrita and the whole of spain knows what javier falcon is after i think i only want what any police officer in my position would want said falcon leaning forward in his chair to catch the people responsible for casing that mosque and planting the goma eco device along with the bosses who ordered them to do it zorrita held up his hand to calm falcon down nodded his agreement youre not getting anything from the suspects in your custody and the two ringleaders have been executed said zorrita so where else have you got to go ive decided to take a long look at the violence said falcon where do a bunch of conspirators sophisticated men like lucrecio arenas and cesar benito access that sort of violence as you say every news channel and paper apart from the abc are calling this the catholic conspiracy what with the national obsession with opus dei the pr campaign by the church to counteract all this has been unprecedented said zorrita do opus dei have an improvised explosive device division the two men smiled at each other what we do know from our suspects in custody and other inquiries is that arenass motivation was not his catholic beliefs said falcon the henwee spoke from his heart and cesar benito was in construction said zorrita where theres always large amounts of black money which can be hidden away in the offshore world but youre not getting anywhere by following the money said zorrita only that theres undoubtedly moneylaundering involved and that both men were well set up in property in the costa del sol the russian mafia said zorrita i know its a kneejerk reaction when you hear the words moneylaundering and costa del sol in the same sentence but after the recent marbella town council scandal falcon nodded and you think theyre going to be easier to penetrate than the offshore world said zorrita lets just take a look at the violence said falcon holding up a finger in that period around the th june bombing there were five expressions of violence the first was the murder of tateb hassani who was vital to the conspiracy for his drafting in arabic script of the extremists plans for taking over andalucia he was found on the seville dump poisoned and mutilated on the morning of the explosion murdered because a he knew too much b he would always be a vulnerable point to the conspiracy and c it got everybodys hands dirty the second expression of violence was the bomb itself which as i said was designed to point the finger at muslim extremism whilst increasing the prestige of fuerza andalucia making them the preferred partners of the ruling partido popular the third presumably was esteban calderons murder of his wife said zorrita which derailed the investigation into the seville bombing and four and five were the executions of lucrecio arenas and cesar benito said falcon they had to be killed once wed caught the other half of the conspiracy because there were direct links between them it would only be a matter of time before arenas and benito gave up the bombers they had employed so theres a clear motive in every case except calderon said falcon he was beating her that was clear and hes never denied it said zorrita if he didnt kill her then why didnt he just call the police when he discovered her dead body in their apartment why did he try to dispose of her body in the river he made a serious error of judgement youre telling me another angle said falcon what was the worst thing that could have happened to our investigation of the seville bombing i agree losing calderon at that stage was a disaster for you he was at the top of his game said falcon giving good direction keeping the media away from my squad the counterterrorism guys and the cni if you were at the zenith of your career would you choose that moment to murder your wife he chose that moment to start abusing her and that was important why because i think that when marisa moreno saw ines in the murillo gardens she noticed somehow that she was being abused said falcon ive just been speaking to her getting her family background her natural mother disappeared in cuba her attitude to her dead father was not exactly respectful he was like calderon an inveterate womanizer she had more time for her sevillana stepmother than she did for him this isnt going to stand up anywhere near a court javier i know all im trying to do here is find weaknesses the only killing about which theres a very slight doubt in my mind is that of ines but not in my mind javier two hours after id been to see marisa this afternoon i got an anonymous phone call telling me to keep my nose out of things that were not my concern it wasnt from me said zorrita deadpan they laughed what else did marisa tell you asked zorrita you must have something more than that i decided to go to see marisa to ram a stick in the wasps nest to see what happened said falcon the only thing i had to go on was something one of my officers found while trying to dig up some dirt on her marisa had no criminal record i know that said zorrita the only thing my officer found was that marisa had reported her sister missing when eight years ago you really are clutching at straws javier falcon was tempted to tell zorrita about marisas wood carving but another glance at the family photo on the desktop persuaded him otherwise he felt weak in front of zorritas steadiness but still resisted the temptation to point up all the other little flaws hed found marisa is no fool said falcon if you despised your womanizing father would you be drawn to an incorrigible womanizer yourself i doubt it would be the first time it had happened said zorrita still feeling as solid as a rock her sister went missing again but this time she was over eighteen so marisa didnt go to the police her sister is the only family marisas got father mother and stepmother are dead would you just shrug your shoulders if your sister ran off again if i didnt care yes said zorrita she cares said falcon youve still got a long way to go with this javier i know said falcon i just wanted to ask you if youd mind me digging around dig away javier the way youre going youll come out in buenos aires la latina district madrid friday th september hrs the earlyevening sun was still bright but low in the sky so it was already dark in the cavernous madrid streets falcon was sitting in the back of a patrol car which zorrita had arranged for him he felt foolish as they left the jefatura and he lay down across the back seat the driver saw him out of the corner of his eye falcon told him to keep looking straight ahead the driver dropped him off at the opera metro station and falcon took the onestop ride to la latina he checked the other occupants of the metro carriage he was still smarting at zorritas scorn for his theory on marisa moreno was all this getting out of control in his mind everything looked dangerously plausible at three in the morning but laughable by ten and did he really have to be this careful about his assignation with yacoub were there actually people on every street corner looking out for him once your mind had been proven unstable there was always a doubt and not just to outsiders a car went into the garage of the apartment block on calle alfonso vi and falcon ducked in behind it as the door was closing he walked down into the dark took the lift up to the third floor stepped out into an empty landing rang the buzzer and waited he sensed the eyeball on the other side of the peephole the door clicked open yacoub beckoned him in they went through the customary pleasantries falcon asked after yacoubs wife yousra and his two children abdullah and leila there was nodding and thanks but yacoub was strangely subdued a full ashtray was the centrepiece of the living room with a smoking filterless cigarette on its edge the curtains were drawn a single lamp in the corner halflit the room yacoub was wearing faded jeans and a white shirt untucked he was barefoot and hed shaved his long hair off to a short stubble which he kept dusting with the palm of his hand as if hed only just had it done his head now matched his beard his eyes seemed deeper set and darker as if some wariness had put him in retreat to a safer place he sat on the sofa with the ashtray at his side and smoked enthusiastically with lips that twitched more than falcon remembered i made some tea he said youre all right with tea arent you you always ask me that said falcon throwing off his jacket rolling up his shirt sleeves you know im fine with tea sorry about the heat said yacoub i dont want to turn on the aircon i shouldnt be here im hiding who from everybody my people your people the world he said and as an afterthought maybe myself too he poured the tea stood up paced around the room to bring his nerves back under control so nobody knows about this meeting said falcon encouraging yacoub to open up this is just you and me said yacoub the only man i can trust the only one i can talk to the only one i can rely on not to use what has happened against me youre nervous i can see that nervous he said nodding thats why i like you javier you keep me calm im not just nervous im paranoid im totally fucking paranoid these last words were accompanied by a ferocious sideways slash of the air in front of him falcon tried to remember whether hed ever heard yacoub swear yacoub then launched himself into a long rant about the lengths to which hed had to go in order to arrive unseen in this apartment you were careful werent you javier he said at the end of it all falcon reciprocated with his own procedure which seemed to have a mildly calming influence on yacoub who listened and gnawed at a hangnail then he lit another cigarette sipped his tea which was too hot sat down on the sofa and stood up again the last time you got like this was after those four days in paris said falcon but you were ok you were taken back into the fold my covers not blown said yacoub quickly no theres no problem with that its just that theyve found the perfect way to keep me close keep you close said falcon you mean in the sense of not straying does that mean they suspect you suspect is too strong a word said yacoub tucking his hand under his armpit and chopping the air with his cigarette they like me they need me but they are naturally unsure of me its the part of my brain that isnt moroccan that makes them nervous were andalucians yacoub same people same berber genetic marker said falcon the problem for them is that they cant rely on me to think in a certain way im not consistently moroccan said yacoub and that makes them uneasy falcon waited if hed been with another european hed have asked the question is this something to do with you being gay but he had the same problem that the radical islamist group the gicm had with yacoub but the other way round falcon couldnt rely on him to think like a european his mentality for argument was more moroccan direct questioning didnt work before friday noon prayers last week abdullah my son came to see me said yacoub i was alone in my study he closed the door and came to the edge of my desk he said i am going to tell you something that will make you very happy and very proud i was confused the boy is only eighteen i didnt remember any talk of a girl and anyway this would not be the way for that sort of thing to happen i stood up as if i was about to hear important news he came over to my side of the desk and told me that he had become a mujahideen and embraced me as a fellow warrior the gicm have recruited him said falcon cannoning out of his armchair yacoub nodded drew on the cigarette took the smoke deep into his lungs and then held open his arms in a gesture of total helplessness directly after the friday noon prayers he left to continue his training continue exactly that said yacoub the boys been lying to me hes taken four weekends away in the last two months i thought he was going to see his friends in casablanca but hes been out in the country on militarytraining exercises how was he recruited yacoub shrugged shook his head falcon doubted that he was going to hear the precise truth hes been working with me at the factory just temporarily before he goes to university at the end of the month we go to a mosque in sale there are elements there i thought he was steering clear of them clearly he wasnt have you spoken to anyone about this you are the first outsider what about in the gicm the military commander is not there at the moment even when he is hes not easy to get to see ive only conveyed my gratitude via an intermediary your gratitude what was i supposed to do i should be happy and proud he said and sank back down on to the sofa buried his face in his hands and sobbed twice and you assume that this has been done to keep you close to control you to make them feel less uneasy about you nobody but the maddest radical would want their son to become a mujahideen potentially a suicide bomber all this talk you hear on tv in france or england about honour and paradise and seventytwo virgins its just its just bullshit you might find that sort of thinking in gaza or iraq or afghanistan but you wont find it in rabat not in my circle lets think this through said falcon what are they trying to achieve through this manoeuvre if its to keep you close then they want to infiltrate my household said yacoub and then touching his temple they want to infiltrate my mind theyre not convinced that they can control you so they set about controlling all those around you their whole reason for being interested in me is that they know that i can live convincingly in both worlds islamic and secular east and west it doesnt mean they like it they didnt like the fact that my sixteenyearold daughter leila was wearing a swimsuit on the beach they were watching you on the beach when we were on holiday in essaouira they were watching us javier said yacoub abdullah has stopped playing his music which i thought a blessing at first but now im desperate for him to be normal and can you believe this he reads the quran he doesnt play computer games any more i had a look at the history on his browser its all islamic websites palestinian politics hamas versus fatah the muslim brotherhood where is this influence coming from another shrug does he know why isnt he telling me thought falcon is it someone close to him someone in his extended family when yacoub had been recruited hed said hed never give up a family member they find their way in said yacoub and you know until abdullah came to me with his news last friday i didnt think these developments were such a bad thing its good for teenagers to have something serious in their lives something other than violent video games and hiphop but mujahideen i know its difficult for you to be calm about this said falcon but theres no immediate danger if as you say theyre trying to keep you close we have time theyve taken my boy away from me said yacoub who shaded his eyes and sobbed again before coming back at falcon angry hes in one of their camps thats when theyre not running over hills and assault courses theyre doing weapons training and bombmaking and when thats all over theyre plugged into radical islam i have no idea what is going to come back to me but im sure it wont be the abdullah i knew it will be their abdullah and then how will i live looking over my shoulder at my own son the enormity of yacoubs predicament hit falcon hard three months ago hed asked yacoub to make what should have been a personal step towards embracing radical islam he had been stunned at the rapidity with which yacoub had been taken deep inside the gicm organization it could only mean that he had something that they wanted and now the gicm were protecting themselves and it meant enclosing not just yacoub but his whole family as well and worse still there was no way out radical islam was not something you changed your mind about once admitted to the close fraternity and their secrets there was no walking away they wouldnt let you it wasnt so different and falcon couldnt believe he was thinking this to being part of a mafia family you dont have to say anything javier theres nothing to say said yacoub i just needed to tell someone and youre the only person ive got you dont want me to talk to pablo at the cni about this pablo what happened to juan said yacoub juan was the old experienced guy juan was given early retirement last week said falcon hed blown it over madrid and their assessment of his work in the seville bombing wasnt so good either pablos good fortytwo years old very experienced in north africa totally committed no javier you must not tell anyone said yacoub the flat of his hand taking on the threat of a chopping blade if you do they will only use it that is how these intelligence people think hes vulnerable lets use it you wont use it i know that and thats why you always have to be there between me and them you are and will be the only one who truly understands my situation something like a cramp started up in falcons guts this was different to the dead weight of his responsibility in this matter that was just a few more rocks in the already unwieldy rucksack this was the knot of fear making itself felt now he was being forced into the unique position of having to decide whether yacoub was reliable or not given the choice between his son abdullah and the anonymous face of the spanish intelligence agency there would be no doubt who yacoub would choose hed said it from the very beginning and the cni had accepted those terms what can i do to make your situation any easier asked falcon youre a good friend javier the only true friend ive got said yacoub you will be the one to help me with the plan to save my son i doubt he could walk away from being a mujahideen very easily especially after hes been to one of their camps i think the only way would be for him to be arrested on his way to a mission said yacoub those would be extraordinary circumstances said falcon for the gicm to let you know what was being planned unless you were directly involved there you have it javier said yacoub it would also depend very much on whether my survival is considered critical falcon and yacoub looked at each other for some time smoke steadily rising from yacoubs fingers and dissipating over his shaven head what asked yacoub i cant believe you said those words we were naive javier we have absurdly idealistic minds it was no accident that you were chosen to recruit me all these agencies have people specifically employed to size you up to perceive whether you have the necessary strengths and weaknesses for the work required of you and im not talking about whether youre a good manager of people or handle stress well but whether under the right circumstances you could torture a man to get the necessary information or or be ingenuous enough to be completely malleable or perhaps utterly predictable said falcon the cni saw in you a need they knew your history they knew that you no longer viewed the world in the blinkered way that most people see it that you demanded a different perspective they fed it to you you fed it to me we didnt know the sort of people we were dealing with possibly we imagined that they might be like ourselves and we could enter their world beneath the surface of everyday life and change things and what happens we meet completely ruthless minds who beat us into corners and force us to behave or else falcon looked around the darkened room their situation meeting in an anonymous madrid apartment to discuss unseen dramatic developments was so far removed from real life that he was suddenly desperate for the surface but like the diver surrounded by sharks who still needed to decompress he had to hold the line not panic you envisage a situation where you will give us information about an imminent attack which will enable us to intercept abdullahs group and arrest him but it will irrevocably undermine my position in the gicm and i will be immediately executed no said falcon yes said yacoub its the only way but you realize all that will happen is that abdullah will end up in jail where he will gravitate to the radical elements which exist in spanish prisons and he will come out even more zealous than he went in having done his time he will be welcomed back into the group and all you will have achieved is your own death said falcon you have to let me draw on some experience in this matter pablo and others in the cni must have come across this type of situation before they will have ideas on how to handle it youre my friend said yacoub im in this because of you by that i mean i wanted to do this and you were the only one i could trust i dont want you to start talking to others as soon as you do that i lose control and they start to run the situation and believe me they will look after their own interests not mine before you know it well be in a hall of mirrors not knowing which way to turn and this is my son javier i cant allow him to be sucked in manipulated turned into a piece of the game a fanatics mass murderer who will imagine in his adolescent mind that in killing and maiming yacoub youre letting this get out of control in your mind this is my moroccan side he said leaping to his feet and pacing around the room scratching at childhood scars on his head which had been laid bare by the severity of his haircut i get very emotional i cant seem to calm myself down or rather i can calm down i do calm down and you know how i do it falcon waited for him to come back into his line of sight but yacoub leaned over the back of the armchair his face so close the tobacco breath was sharp in falcons nostrils i imagine abdullah safe away from all this this madness i imagine myself under a funeral shroud and able to see the sun coming through the cotton the breeze playing over the material and i am at peace for the first time in my life try an alternative vision yacoub dont be so fatalistic imagine yourself at home with abdullah his wife and your grandchildren on your lap try achieving that instead of your death and his incarceration i would if it wasnt such an absurd dream an impossible ideal javier said yacoub the boy is already a part of their organization he has no thoughts for girls wives children normal life has become a miserable existence to him he despises his carefree childhood he mourns the lost hours spent on his gameboy his whole adolescence is a tragedy of unconsciousness to him now theres no question of bringing him back the irony of it all is that in joining himself to this new world he has to me become a lost soul he wanders a world of death destruction and martyrdom while my stomach heaves at the thought of a market in baghdad with two hundred dead women and children the whole area a blackened smoking charnel house abdullah smiles beatifically at the imagined grace of the martyr who has committed this godless atrocity so youve seen him again since he went to this training camp a week ago asked falcon confused at how yacoub could have known all this the purpose of admitting me to the gicm in the first place was primarily to make one of their international attacks possible said yacoub inconsequentially buying himself some time this means as you know i have unprecedented access to the military wing of the gicm as soon as abdullah told me his news it was arranged for me to be shown his training camp i spent some time there we had a couple of evenings together in which i was able to see the profound change wrought in his young mind but you didnt manage to see the commander of the military wing no as i told you he wasnt there said yacoub turning his back on falcon to stare at the drawn curtains i had to convey my gratitude for this honour through one of his officers was that how it happened thought falcon as he joined yacoub by the window they embraced and he caught sight of his own confused face over yacoubs shoulder in the only mirror in the room my friend said yacoub his hot breath on falcons neck you know me so well do i thought falcon do i ave from madrid to seville friday th september hrs if on the train journey from seville to madrid hed been slightly feverish with paranoia then the ride back saw a serious multiplication of the uncertainty parasites in his bloodstream the darkness rushing past outside meant that all he could see was his disconcerted visage reflected back to him and with the movement of the train it seemed to tremble like his vacillating mind not only had yacoub forbidden him to talk to any of the intelligence officers from the cni but he had also already set in motion a plan for extracting abdullah from the ranks of the gicm yacoub had begged the senior officers in the military wing to ask their commander to send his son on a mission as soon as possible with the condition that he be responsible for its planning logistics and execution why did you do that asked falcon the one thing we need in this situation is time more important than time at this stage yacoub said is to show them how honoured i am that my son has been chosen delay would have meant that suspicion would have come down heavily on me and i would have been excluded from my sons future this was the only way for me to keep my foot in the door the high command were thinking about it yacoub had told falcon that the following morning he would be flying back to rabat where he expected to be told of their decision none of this was exactly calming but it wasnt the cause of falcons paranoia that had started with those cramps of fear in his gut hed tried to ignore them like the man with acute appendicitis whod convinced himself it was just wind but theyd made him very apprehensive one moment he was sitting in front of a man whod become his closest friend with whom he shared a level of intimacy hed only ever experienced with the man hed believed to be his father francisco falcon and the next there was a person he no longer completely trusted doubt had been interposed that last embrace in front of the closed curtains had been an attempt to reinforce the relationship but it was as if some impenetrable barrier like a kevlar skin had come between them perhaps that had been the fatal flaw the only other time hed experienced this level of intimacy it had been based on lies and fraudulence his father had tricked the fiveyearold javier into becoming the agent of his own mothers death but how could it have been so quick with yacoub suspicion had ripped through him but why he replayed the meeting in minute detail almost frame by frame to extract every nuance the haircut was part of it or had it become part of it was that retrospective suspicion yacoub had always liked to keep his luxuriant hair long maybe he was just getting into role in fact before the haircut was the apartment he hadnt asked him about it whose was it hed have to find that out he called an old detective friend from his madrid days who was in a bar on his way home falcon gave him the address told him to keep it to himself he wanted the owners identity and background and he was to speak to falcon only no messages left in the office im not even going to ask said his friend who told him hed probably have to wait until monday now headlights wavered in the blackness of the countryside and swung away someone across the aisle was studying him he got up walked down the train to the bar ordered a beer what else he took out his notebook jotted down his thoughts trust yacoub had kept on at falcon about how much he trusted him the only man i can trust you always have to be between me and them that was where the cramps had started and when hed first questioned yacoubs reliability youre a good friend the only true friend ive got it was that line which had allowed the ugliest thought to enter his head is he using me falcon rewound to a question hed asked so wheres this influence coming from the shrug had someone got to yacoub he knew the gicm didnt like his relationship with the inspector jefe were they breaking it up and using young abdullah to do it the notes streamed out of his pen the swearing the plan there was no plan but yacoub wanted him involved why youre my friend im in this because of you hed qualified that blame immediately but there was no doubt that he wanted falcon to feel culpable then there was yacoubs vision of his own death had he overdone the selfpity finally there was the slip was it a slip to reveal that hed seen abdullah since hed gone to the training camp yacoub was under pressure the stress of it created emotional extremes and mistakes were made he closed the notebook took a swig of beer he breathed back a sense of disequilibrium that he couldnt put his finger on how do you describe that feeling when it occurs to you that your brother might be exploiting you there was no word for it it couldnt be that it was so rare that they hadnt bothered to invent it people were always exploited and betrayed by those closest to them but what was the word for the feeling of the victim the americans have a good word suckered because the feeling was one of being drained having the marrow sucked out he took out his mobile and it wasnt just for the usual banal exchange that was played out in trains all over the world he needed to hear the sound of a voice that he believed in and who believed in him he called consuelo dario her youngest boy the eightyearold picked up the phone hola dario hows it going he said javiii screamed dario mama mama its javi bring the phone to the kitchen said consuelo are you good dario asked falcon im good javi why arent you here you should be here mamas been waiting and waiting bring that phone here dario he heard the boy sprinting down the corridor the phone changed hands i dont want you thinking im sitting around here like some lovesick teenager said consuelo darios been desperate for you to get here im on the ave and running late he wont go to bed until you arrive and were going shopping tomorrow new football boots ive got to see someone in town before i come out to your place said falcon its going to be after midnight before i get to you maybe we should have dinner out said consuelo thats a better idea i really want him to go to bed now ill take him next door hes in love with their sixteenyearold daughter lets do that javier tell him ill have a kick around with him in the garden tomorrow morning a hesitation you think youre getting lucky tonight she said quietly teasing they hadnt discussed his staying over it was part of the new coming together no assumptions ive been praying for luck he said has our lady been good to me another hesitation ill tell dario she said but once youve made a promise like that youve got to be prepared for him to jump on your head at eight in the morning where shall we meet she said shed arrange everything all he had to do was meet her in the bar la eslava on the plaza san lorenzo and theyd take it from there calm restored he nearly felt like a family man consuelos two older boys ricardo and matias hadnt been so interested in him they were fourteen and twelve but dario was still keen on the idea of a dad the boy had brought him closer to consuelo she could see that dario liked him and although she would never say it dario was her favourite he also distracted them from the seriousness of what they were trying to do made them feel more casual less anxious and with that thought sleep finally claimed him he woke up sitting in the carriage in the santa justa station with people shuffling out of the train it was just after he left the station drove to calle hiniesta falcon wanted to have marisa sleeping uneasily with the knowledge that after their chat this afternoon hed taken an anonymous threatening phone call and that he wasnt scared by it as he parked at the back of the santa isabel church he saw that the light was on in her penthouse apartment the plants were lit up on her roof terrace he pressed her buzzer im coming down she said this is inspector jefe javier falcon he said what are you doing here she said annoyed im on my way out we can discuss this in the street if thats what you want she buzzed the door open he took the small lift up to her floor marisa let him in closing down her mobile nervous as if shed just asked her date to delay his arrival unless he wanted to meet the police going somewhere special asked falcon taking in her long tight turquoise dress her coppery hair down to her shoulders the gold earrings the twentyodd gold and silver bangles on her arm an expensive scent a gallery opening and then dinner she closed the door behind him her hands were uneasy at her sides the bangles rattled she didnt ask him to sit down i thought we had a long talk this afternoon she said you took up an hour of my worktime and now youve moved in on my relaxation i had a call from a friend of yours this afternoon a friend of mine he told me to keep my nose out of your business her lips opened no sound came out it was a couple of hours after we talked said falcon i was on my way up to madrid to see another friend of yours i dont know anyone in madrid inspector jefe luis zorrita theres the confusion said marisa dredging up some boldness hes no friend of mine hes as interested as i am in your story said falcon hes told me i can dig away to my hearts content what are you talking about she said her brow puckering with fury story what story we all have stories said falcon we all have versions of these stories to suit every occasion weve got one version of your story which has put esteban calderon in prison now were going to find the real version and itll be interesting to see where that puts you even with the armour of her beauty her lithe sexuality encased in the aquamarine sheath he could see that hed got under her skin the fever had started the uncertainty behind the big brown eyes his work was done now it was time to get out tell your friends said falcon making powerful eye contact as he walked past her to the door that ill be waiting for their next call what friends she said to the back of his head i dont have any friends on his way out of the apartment he looked back at her standing alone in the middle of the room he believed her and for some reason he couldnt help but pity her too back in his car he wanted to hang on to see who turned up to take her out then he saw her on the roof terrace looking down at him with the mobile to her ear he didnt want to keep consuelo waiting he pulled away drove back home where he had a quick shower to try to wash off all that police work he changed his clothes and ten minutes later he was on his way to the plaza san lorenzo the cab dropped him off in the square which was full of people ambling about in the warm night under the high trees with the impressive terracotta brick facade of the church of jesus del gran poder behind his police mobile vibrated in his pocket he took the call without thinking resigned to his fate listen said the voice youll realize when youve gone too far with this because something will happen and when it does you will know that you are to blame you will recognize it but therell be no discussion and no negotiation because inspector jefe javier falcon you will never hear from us again dead no number he wrote the words hed heard in a notebook he always carried with him having just seen marisa hed expected that call but now that it had come he did not feel strengthened by it its psychology had unnerved him that was the calculation of the voice but his anticipation of it should have protected him it hadnt like a probing question from the blind psychologist alicia aguado the voice had lifted the lid on something and despite not knowing its precise nature he dreaded it coming to the surface the bar la eslava was packed consuelo was standing outside smoking and sipping a glass of manzanilla sevillanos were not known for respecting other peoples personal space but theyd made an exception for consuelo her charisma seemed to create a forcefield her short blonde hair stood out under the street lights she made the simple wild pink minidress she was wearing look even more expensive than it was and her high heels made her slim strong legs look even longer falcon was glad hed taken the time to shower and change he walked through the crowd towards her and she didnt see him until he was on her they kissed he tasted her peachy lipstick put his hands around her slim waist felt her contours fitting into his he inhaled her smell felt the sharp prick of her diamondstud earring in his cheek as his lips found her neck are you all right she said running a hand up the back of his head so that electricity earthed through his heels more than all right now he said as her hands travelled the outline of his shoulders and his blood went live her thigh slipped between his legs his stomach leapt cock stirred perfume shunted into his head and he became human for the first time that day they parted feeling the eyes of the people around them ill get a beer he said ive booked us a table across the road she said the bar was heaving and noisier than the trading floor of a metal exchange he fought his way in he knew the owner who was serving a guy he didnt immediately recognize grabbed him around the shoulders hola javier que tal the owner handed him a beer refused payment two women kissed him on his way through he was sure he knew one of them he squeezed back out into the street i didnt know you were going to madrid today said consuelo she knew yacoub but not that he was falcons spy i had a meeting with another cop about all that stuff in june said falcon keeping it vague but still stumbling around in the memory of his meeting with yacoub marisa that second phone call you were looking as if youd had a hard day he took out his mobile turned it off that helps he said sipping his beer how about you i had some interesting conversations with a couple of estate agents and i had a session with alicia hows that going im nearly sane she said smiling blue eyes widening hysterically only another year to go they laughed i saw esteban calderon today im not as nuts as he is said consuelo the prison governor called me on the way up to madrid to say hed put in a request to see alicia i dont know if even she could sort out his madness said consuelo that was the first time id seen him since it happened said falcon he didnt look good if what hes got in his mind has started to come out in his face he should be looking terrible she said are you moving he asked moving the estate agents said falcon youre not bored of santa clara already my business expansion plans seville not big enough for all your ideas maybe not but how about madrid or valencia what do you think will you still talk to me when youve been photographed by hola he said consuelo jimenez in her glorious home surrounded by her beautiful children and my lover the cop she said looking at him sadly i might have to let you go unless you learn how to sail a yacht that was the first time shed called him her lover and she knew it he finished his beer took her empty glass and put them on a ledge she took his arm and they walked across the square to the restaurant they knew her in the restaurant which despite its arabic name had a neoclassical feel to it all pillars and marble and strong white nappery with no such thing as a round plate the chef came out to greet her and two glasses of cava on the house arrived at their table there was a lull in the restaurant hubbub as the other diners looked at them recognized their faces from distant scandalous news stories moments later they were forgotten and the cacophony resumed consuelo ordered for both of them he liked it when she took over they drank the cava he wished they were at home and he could lean over and kiss her throat they talked about the future which was a good sign the starter arrived three tapas on an oblong plate a tiny filo pastry money bag containing soft goats cheese a crisp toast of duck liver set in sticky sweet quince jam and a shotglass of white garlic and almond soup with an orb of melon ice cream floating at the top and flakes of winddried tuna nestling in the bottom each one went off in his mouth like a firecracker this is oral sex said consuelo plates were removed with their empty flutes a bottle of pesquera from the ribeiro del duero was opened decanted and glasses filled with the dark red wine they talked about the impossibility of going back to live in madrid after the lotus life of seville shed ordered him duck breast which was presented in a fan with a mound of couscous consuelo had the sea bass with crisp silver skin in a delicate white sauce he felt her calf rub against his and they decided to forgo the dessert and get a taxi instead they practically lay down in the back and he kissed her neck as the street lights flashed overhead and the young people outside made their moves from the bars to the clubs the lights were still on at her neighbours house and the daughter let them in falcon lifted dario from the bed he was fast asleep as they walked across to consuelos house the boy came awake hola javi he said sleepily and thumped his blond head into falcons chest and left it there as if he was listening to his heart the trust nearly broke falcon apart they went upstairs where he poured the boy into his bed darios eyelids fluttered against the weight of sleep football tomorrow he murmured you promised penalty shootout said falcon pulling up the bedclothes kissing him on the forehead goodnight javi falcon stood at the door while consuelo knelt and kissed her son goodnight stroked his head he felt the complicated pang of being a parent or of never having been one they went downstairs she poured a whisky for falcon made herself a gin and tonic he could see her properly now for the first time that night those slim muscular legs a subtle line running down her calf he found himself wanting to kiss the backs of her knees there had been a difference in her touch tonight it wasnt as if they hadnt made love since theyd got back together after the seville bombing she hadnt been restrained in that department although what with the summer holiday and the kids being around there hadnt been much opportunity the first time theyd got together a couple of years ago it had been different theyd both been a little wild then after a long drought this time theyd been feeling their way around each other tentatively they needed reassurance that this was the right thing to be doing but tonight hed felt a difference she was letting him in maybe it was alicia her psychologist telling her she should let herself go not just physically this time but emotionally too whats going on in there asked consuelo nothing all men say that when theyre thinking dirty thoughts i was thinking how magnificent that meal was then they lie to you how is it that you always know what im thinking because you are completely in my thrall she said you really want to know what i was thinking only if its about me i was controlling a powerful desire to kiss the back of your knees a slow smile crept across her face as a thrill streaked down the back of her thighs i like a bit of patience in a man she said sipping her drink the ice cubes rolling and tickling the glass the trick of the patient man is to recognize boredom before it sets in she stifled a fake yawn joder he said getting to his feet they kissed and ran upstairs leaving their drinks quaking on the table she stepped out of her pink dress and a small pair of knickers it was all she had to do he wrenched at his hands caught in the cuffs of his shirt kicked off his shoes she sat on the edge of the bed with her hands on her knees tanned all over except a small white triangle after some ferocious moments with his clothes he was naked went over to her stood between her legs she stroked him looking up at his agony her lips were moist still with the vestiges of the peachy lipstick that matched her fingernails she reached up from his thighs over his abdomen to his chest her hands slipped round his back and she dug her nails into his skin as he felt her mouth on him her nails clawed their way down to his buttocks he was hanging on to his patience by the skin of his teeth she fell back on to the bed rolled on to her front looked over her shoulder at him and pointed at the backs of her knees his thighs shivered as he knelt on the bed he kissed her achilles tendon her calf the back of one knee then the other he worked his way up her hamstrings which trembled under his lips she raised her buttocks to him reached behind her for him patience out of the question now they shunted together his hands full of her she gripped the sheets in her fists and all the hell of the day just fell away from them they lay where theyd collapsed still joined the room lit only by the glow of street light coming in through the blinds youre different tonight said falcon stroking her stomach kissing her between the shoulder blades welded to her by their sweat i feel different it was like two years ago she stared into the dark her vision still green at the edges as if recovering from an intense light something happened he asked im ready she said why now he felt her shrug under his hands maybe its because my children are leaving me she said dario still needs you and his javi she said he loves you i can tell and i love him said falcon and i love you too what did you say i said i love you too always have done she took his hand from her stomach kissed the fingers and pressed it between her breasts shed heard those words before from men but this was the first time shed got close to believing them consuelos house santa clara seville saturday th september hrs morning began with football falcon in goal he had a spring in his legs so that he had to remind himself not to save everything he let dario send him the wrong way a few times and watched on his knees as the boy ran around the garden with his sevilla fc shirt over his head flying consuelo looked out from the sitting room in her dressing gown she was in a strange mood as if last nights admissions had made her cautious she knew she loved javier especially when she saw his mock dismay as another of darios penalties rifled past him and sizzled down the back of the nylon net there was something boyish about her cop and it made her ache as much as seeing her own son lying on his back arms open to receive the embraces of his imaginary fellow players she knocked on the window as if checking the scene for reality and they came in for breakfast falcon sat in the front of the cab on the way back to his house and chatted cheerfully with the driver about sevilla fcs chances in the uefa cup he knew it all from dario he picked up his car the morning traffic on the other side of the plaza de cuba screwed up by the ongoing metro construction today posed no problems for him he felt completely mended obsession had been cleared from his mind a crescendo of the fullness of life expanded his chest his paranoia seemed absurd decisions were easy he knew now that he was going to have to talk to pablo of the cni about yacoubs situation that was something he wasnt going to attempt to manage on his own it had come to him with clarity and accompanied by the words of mark flowers the cia agent who doubled as a communications officer attached to the us consulate in seville dont try to understand the whole picture theres nobody in the world who does just realizing the thinness of the slice of the world he saw was enough to persuade him that he needed another point of view nobody from the homicide squad was in yet he closed the door to his office and picked up the phone with the scrambled line which would connect him directly to pablo in the cnis offices in madrid it was a saturday and early but pablo was the new section head since juan had left and falcon knew hed be there it took half an hour to talk pablo through what had happened in the apartment in la latina yesterday afternoon and another fifteen minutes for pablo to ask all his questions the last of which was where did he say he was going and when rabat this morning the gicm high command were going to give him their decision long silence are you still there pablo im still here he said im wondering if theres anything that needs to be done immediately what do you mean yacoub is not in rabat hes flying there from madrid this morning thats the interesting thing said pablo he flew into heathrow last night it might not mean anything it might just be an omission on his part but we still havent found a flight into casablanca with his name on the manifest falcon felt that metallic coldness in his stomach again this is the problem i had yesterday he said i think im losing him trust is a strange thing in this game said pablo its more fluid than in the real world you cant expect someone whos constantly dissimulating to be as reliable as yourself look what happens to married people when they have affairs the first few lies are ok then as time goes on and the subterfuge builds the lying becomes an allconsuming activity yacoub is now having to pretend to be someone else almost twentyfour hours a day the gicm have racked up the pressure by invading his domestic situation which means that yacoub now has one less rock to stand on to remind himself of who he really is and im his last remaining rock without you hes in danger of losing that vital sense of self said pablo part of your job is to shore him up let him know that you are dependable that you can be trusted in every situation he told me not to talk to you said falcon he was obsessed with losing control to others hes trying to control me and yet hes putting himself beyond my control im not sure where i stand any more all i know is that it will be below his son abdullah you have to rebuild that trust he must feel that its you and him against the gicm you have to anchor him said pablo im going to get more information on what hes doing whatever you do now will expose me hell know that ive talked to you this fluidity of trust is a twoway thing said pablo he hasnt gone straight to rabat as he told you youve come to me for some advice on how to proceed nobodys been hurt just leave it with me for a while dont go anywhere else for advice especially not to that friend of yours mark flowers he hung up pablo didnt like falcons relationship with mark flowers which had started four years ago when falcon had earned the cia agents respect during one of his investigations since that time theyd exchanged information falcon letting him know what was happening in his police work and flowers helping out with specialist knowledge and fbi contacts cristina ferrera knocked and came into falcons office as he put the phone down whats happening he asked weve gone through all the disks in the russians briefcase and weve singled out sixtyfour individuals fiftyfive men and nine women all of them have been caught on camera with their pants down using drugs receiving money andor presents and how are you getting on with identifying these people vicente cortes from greco and martin diaz from cico have managed to identify all of the mafia guys and all but three of the socalled victims in the footage what are we talking about the usual local council people mayors town planners building inspectors health and safety utilities some local businessmen and estate agents guardia civil cortes and diaz werent surprised by any of it not even the child sex footage or the women with big black guys you look around at all these people youre supposed to be protecting said falcon eyes drifting to the window and you find theyre in it up to their necks ive isolated a still from one bit of footage that i want you to look at youll have to come next door to see it because inspector ramirez is making sure everything is confined to one computer we dont even want the stills on a lan in case they find their way out to our friends in the press falcon followed her out ferreras fingers rapped the keys as she sat at the desk an image came up on the screen of two people a man kneeling behind a woman whose bottom was raised face and shoulders on the bed the girl was looking directly into the camera ferrera tapped the screen im absolutely certain she said that this woman is marisa morenos sister i even went back to the police station and found the picture which had been supplied by marisa to her missing file shes only seventeen in the old shot but what do you think ferreras photo was of a girl with her hair unplaited afro style the eyes were innocent and wide her mouth closed tight with beestung lips the woman on the screen was in her midtwenties which would have been margarita morenos age now her hair was plaited which wasnt the only difference the eyes werent innocent any more but glazed unfocused out of it falcon held the photo marisa had given him yesterday up to the screen margaritas hair was plaited in the shot youre right cristina good work he said now were getting to it marisa arent we getting to what asked ferrera another version of marisas story said falcon the reason why she was having an affair with esteban calderon why that affair included more than just sexual duties and perhaps why ines was murdered in her own home marisa is in with the russians ive been to see her twice and each time ive had a threatening phone call within hours of our meetings said falcon has the man in this shot been identified not yet tell cortes and diaz that out of the three this is the first shot that they have to work on this guy will tell us where margarita is being held said falcon now lets go back to marisa both of us she doesnt like men said falcon i want you involved with her on the way to calle hiniesta cristina ferrera called inspector jose luis ramirez and vicente cortes the shot was accessible on ramirezs computer in padlocked files to which only he and ferrera had the password marisa was not at home they walked to her atelier on calle bustos tavera marisa answered the door in a scarlet silk dressing gown open to reveal bikini briefs she held a hammer and a wood chisel in one hand a chewed cigar stub in the other you again she said making eye contact with falcon before dropping her gaze to ferrera who is this i can perfectly understand why you dont like men now marisa said falcon so ive brought another member of my squad to talk to you this is detective cristina ferrera encantada said marisa and turned her back on them she put the hammer and chisel down on the work bench tied up her dressing gown sat on a high stool and lit the cigar stub resistant was a mild description of her attitude now she asked why can you understand it now inspector jefe because weve just found your sister said falcon the line was intended to shock and it did in the intense silence after its delivery falcon saw pain fear and horror flash across marisas beautiful features i distinctly remember telling you that my sister was not lost said marisa summoning all the selfcontrol she could muster ferrera stepped forward and gave her the printout of the still image taken from vasili lukyanovs disks marisa looked down at it pursed her lips her face was impassive as she reconnected with falcon what is this this was in the possession of a known russian gangster who died in a motorway accident yesterday morning said falcon maybe you knew him too vasili lukyanov how is this relevant to me asked marisa that name thudding into her with the force of a slaughterers bolt if my sister who i havent seen for six or seven years has chosen to take up prostitution chosen to take up prostitution said ferrera unable to contain herself of the four hundred thousand prostitutes operating in spain barely five per cent have chosen their profession and i dont think any of them are working for the russian mafia look marisa were not here to take you down said falcon we know youve been coerced and we know whos been doing the coercing were here to relieve your situation to get you out of it and your sister im not sure what this situation is that youre talking about said marisa not ready yet needing to keep it going while she weighed things up in her mind what was the deal did they say theyd let margarita go if you started up an affair with esteban asked falcon if you fed them information told them he was beating his wife got them a key to his apartment i dont know what youre talking about said marisa esteban and i are lovers i go to see him every week in prison or at least i did until you stopped my visits so they havent let margarita go yet said ferrera is that right is what right said marisa turning on ferrera feeling that she could loose off some of her fierceness at her what that youve got to keep up the aftersales service said falcon but how long for marisa how long do you think theyll keep you dangling a month a year maybe for ever as he said this he wondered whether he was the right man for this job maybe he was too personally involved this womans responsibility for iness death was perhaps making him too brutal giving her nowhere to turn but he had to show the full weight of his knowledge make her face the gravity of her circumstances before showing her that he was the softer option this he thought might not be achievable in a single visit esteban and i are very close said marisa setting off on another round of fabrication it might not look it from the outside you might think ive been using him in some way that he was somehow my ticket to a better life but im not ive heard all this before marisa said falcon maybe i should let you see esteban again now that youve poisoned his mind against me inspector jefe she said getting to her feet going on the attack with that cigar stub now that youve told him that he might not have to face twenty years in jail because you reckon you can shift the blame on to some black trash he was fucking is that it inspector jefe im not the one whos put you in your situation what fucking situation she screeched you keep talking about it but i dont know what it is your position between the gangsters holding your sister and the police investigating the seville bombing said falcon calmly were already close to finding where margarita is being held said ferrera which snapped marisas head round in her direction the man in the photo said falcon hell talk and if you talk to us marisa nothing will happen until margarita is safe marisa looked at the printout still not ready needing more time to make up her mind not sure who or what was going to be more dangerous for her sister ferrera and falcon exchanged a look ferrera gave her a card with her fixed line and mobile numbers they made for the door talk to us marisa said ferrera i would if i was you why why would you said marisa because we are not in the business of killing defenceless women in their homes planting bombs bribing local government officials and forcing girls into prostitution said falcon they went down the steps from her atelier and into the broiling heat of the courtyard they stood for a moment in the cool of the tunnel leading to calle bustos tavera we were that close said ferrera holding up her thumb and forefinger pressed together i dont know said falcon fear does strange things to people it can bring them to the brink of the only possible next logical step and then they veer off into the night because some perceived threat appears to be nearer and uglier she just needs time said ferrera time is the problem because shes alone said falcon under those circumstances the person whos going to kill you seems more powerful than the one whos holding out a helping hand thats why i want you involved with her i want you to make her feel as if shes not facing this on her own lets find margarita then said ferrera if we can get her safe marisa will follow back at the jefatura inspector jose luis ramirez was hovering over vicente cortes and martin diaz arms folded biceps bulging under his red polo shirt his brow was furrowed with fury the mahogany colour of his skin and his dark sweptback hair making him look even more thunderous they were looking at the footage from the disks taken from vasili lukyanovs briefcase the sight of young girls being defiled always made ramirez uncomfortable he didnt even like seeing his own teenage daughter hand in hand with her boyfriend even though his wife had assured him she was still innocent cortes and diaz had found a better angle of the face of the man having sex with margarita his features had been isolated from the footage blown up and sent out to every police station in andalucia the guardia civil and cico in madrid why just andalucia asked falcon all of the sixtyone men and women weve already identified come from towns on the coast between algeciras and almeria maybe the reason you cant identify these three men is that theyre outsiders said falcon i think you should at least send these shots to madrid and barcelona and have somebody take them round to the chambers of commerce this is a break if we can locate the girl and make her safe we have a chance of getting marisa moreno to talk and shes possibly the only person left whos associated with anybody who had a part in the seville bombing the phone rang in his office the scrambled line to the cni falcon asked ramirez to email the closeup shot of the unidentified male to his computer i spoke to mi about yacoub said pablo of course they knew about him coming in on that flight but theyve lost him lost him what do you mean they followed him he took the metro into london they lost him at russell square so yacoub realized he was being tailed and lost them which means he now knows or will assume that ive talked not necessarily its not the first time the british have taken an interest in yacoub what it does mean is that he didnt want them to know what he was doing said pablo weve now seen that his name has appeared on a manifest on a flight from london to malaga tomorrow evening what does any of this mean it might mean that we have a rogue agent on our hands on the other hand it might just be that he is having to behave in a certain way because of pressure from the gicm said pablo what we have to do now is find out in whose interests hes working how are you going to do that through you but were still thinking about it said pablo theres something else an unidentified male has turned up in yacoubs house in rabat he seems to be family but the moroccans havent been able to place him yet and they dont want to go in there and spoil our show cant they check his papers when he comes out of the house if he came out they would but he doesnt said pablo theres a shot of him on our website take a look you might know him from that holiday you took with yacoub down in essaouira by the way you havent communicated with yacoub through the cni website for three weeks he hasnt communicated with me but before that you were in regular contact given his domestic situation hes got to be more careful now thats what were thinking here said pablo anything else im working on a potential breakthrough in the seville bombing weve come across some disks in the possession of a known russian mafioso showing men having sex with prostitutes said falcon you remember the two ringleaders of the conspiracy lucrecio arenas and cesar benito benito was an architect for the horizonte group and arenas was the ceo of their bankers banco omni said pablo thats right we never managed to find anything in either company that linked them to the conspiracy but were equally sure they werent motivated by their catholic beliefs said falcon ive isolated a male from the disks we found in the russian mafiosos possession our two organized crime specialists from the costa del sol have been able to identify more than sixty people from these disks but not this guy and it occurs to me he may be an outsider and you think this may link the russian mafia to horizonte and banco omni it might do if this guy happens to be in the hierarchy of either company or of horizontes holding company an americanbased investment group called iit said falcon the problem is that i know from my earlier investigations into these two companies how camerashy their personnel are and that you probably have access to certain files that i dont he might even be a foreigner you want me to see if i can match him said pablo for you javier anything they hung up falcon emailed the facial closeup of the male having sex with margarita to the cni website and while there checked the photo of the guy staying at yacoubs house but didnt recognize him send me those shots of the other two guys you havent been able to identify from the russians disks falcon shouted through to vicente cortes in the adjoining office the three faces came up on his screen he inspected them carefully ramirez came in and stood by the window this guy unidentified b he doesnt look spanish to me said falcon no said ramirez flatly looking over his shoulder the other two could be spanish or hispanic said falcon but this guy looks american american said cortes appearing at the door how can you tell hes american from a grainy shot like that he doesnt look like a man whose face is burdened by centuries of history said falcon he has the innocence of someone whos spent his life embracing the future even if he is fucking a teenager in the ass said ramirez grimly you can tell all that from this shot said cortes leaning over falcons desk look at his hair said falcon we dont have hair like that any more in europe thats what i would call american corporate hair its very conservative you should see the full clip it doesnt even move during sex said ramirez looking out of the window by the time hed finished with that poor kid he should have had hair like a wrestlers and yet maybe its a rug possibly the phone with the scrambled line to the cni rang ramirez took cortes by the arm led him out ferrera leaned in and closed the door we want you to go to london said pablo i cant weve already spoken to comisario elvira ive just told you things are breaking here i feel as if im finally getting inside i cant leave now said falcon and if i go to london yacoub will know ive spoken to you hell see it as a breach of trust youre going to see the british counterterrorism squad so in new scotland yard a guy called douglas hamilton he will brief you when you make contact with yacoub youll tell him why youre in london which is to find out what the fuck he is doing losing an mi tail that is not the kind of behaviour we expect from one of our untrained agents said pablo you understand me javier and look youll be away from your desk for the rest of today only weve got you on to a scheduled flight in an hours time and well make sure you get an earlyevening flight back all right said falcon im sending you another two shots of men from the russians disks who we cant identify one of them im sure is an american dont talk to your friend flowers about any of this are you going to say that every time i say the word american mark flowers is a very experienced operative he has an instinct for when things are happening id be very surprised if you didnt hear from him by the end of the day so what is happening did you take a look at the mystery man who appeared in yacoubs house asked pablo ignoring the question never seen him before said falcon they hung up falcon stared grimly at the phone not wanting any of this other even more complicated stuff he called for ferrera im going to be out until this evening he said i want you to go back to marisa and work on her do everything you can to get her into your confidence she has to tell us who is putting pressure on her he sat back tried to breathe down the stress closed his eyes thought about consuelos goodbye kiss everything had been in that kiss the full complexity of a woman joining her life to his then he thought about football in the garden with dario and remembered the boys instinctive trust of him the night before his head on falcons chest the boy had done something for him brought back memories of his own trust in his mother those goodnight kisses in tangier it bound him to dario in a way that made him feel both strong and vulnerable he opened his eyes placed his hands on the desk squared his shoulders and as he raised himself to go to the airport he suddenly realized what was happening the process of javier falcon becoming a parent had begun and that was what was different in consuelo shed decided to let him all the way into her life you again said marisa seeing cristina ferrera through the door open a crack i dont know what the matter is with you people half seville could be robbed and raped and youd still come knocking at my door that would be because its my job to investigate murder said ferrera rather than anything else marisa looked her up and down her eyes were glazed maybe she was drunk or stoned specially selected said marisa for what asked ferrera sweat gathering under her eyes come in said marisa voice suddenly bored walking away from the door she was wearing bikini briefs only she picked up a cigar stub lit it leaned against the work bench and blew out smoke sweet and virginal she said i used to be a nun said ferrera maybe thats got something to do with it marisa snorted laughter which came out on a long plume of smoke from her nose youve got to be kidding ferrera stared her down saw the halfbottle of havana club and a can of coke behind her ill put on a top said marisa found a tshirt fought her way into it your boss she said and losing her way she rubbished the air with her cigar stub whatever his name is hes a clever guy that one you dont see many cops like him you dont see many sevillanos like him a clever guy hes sent you here on your own hes thinking all the time he comes in here looks at my pieces doesnt say a word thinking thinking and he works things out and thats why youre here isnt it the exnun everything is calculated i wasnt a great nun said ferrera cutting through the drunken babble no why not you look perfect said marisa i bet you only get guys you like coming after you whats that supposed to mean i get all sorts of people coming after me she said to herself tell me why things didnt work out for you as a nun i was raped by a couple of guys in cadiz one night said ferrera matter of fact i was on my way to see my boyfriend thats it thats all you need to know it wasnt working out for me as a nun i had weaknesses marisa spat out some tobacco from the ragged end of her cigar stub even thats calculated she said nastily the only thing that the inspector jefe has calculated is that you dont like men very much so he sent me a woman an exnun whos been raped he didnt expect me to tell you that so why did you to show you that im not the sweet virginal little woman you think you see said ferrera ive suffered maybe not as much or as continuously as margarita is suffering but enough to know what its like to be a piece of meat drink asked marisa as if ferreras words had signalled something no thanks said ferrera marisa poured herself a hefty measure of rum and topped it off with coke take a seat she said pointing at a cheap low stool you look hot ferrera sat in the smell of her soap and deodorant mixed with sweat do you always drink while you work she asked never said marisa relighting her cigar stub so youre not working id work if people didnt keep interrupting me other people asked ferrera apart from us marisa nodded drank some more its not just that he thinks i hate men she said pointing at ferrera with her cigar stub and i dont hate men how can i hate them only men can satisfy me i only fuck with men so how can i hate them you do you only fuck with men after what those guys did to you so what else is it asked ferrera feeling marisas drunken mind swerving away from her he thinks i killed her said marisa the inspector jefe thinks i killed his wife i mean his exwife estebans wife he doesnt think that did you know her ines asked ferrera shaking her head i dont know why your inspector jefe married that one said marisa pointing to her head blowing her brains out there was nothing inside we all make mistakes said ferrera some of her own and their consequences flashing through her mind she was right for esteban said marisa absolutely right why do you say that another empty vessel said marisa knocking on the side of her work bench a hollow man so why did you like esteban its more to do with why did esteban like me said marisa i was just there he came after me it didnt matter what i thought thats what sevillano guys are like they come after you they dont need any encouragement and cuban guys are different they seem to know when youre not right for them they see who you are but you didnt turn esteban down i tell you esteban is not my kind of guy said marisa and her face struggled against the alcohol into a sneer so what happened he pursued me you look as if youre old enough to be able to tell a guy that his interest is going to get him nowhere unless marisa said holding up her finger some tinny cuban music started up in the back of the workshop marisa staggered off amongst the clutter and picked up her mobile phone ferrera gritted her teeth the moment lost again marisa retreated into the darkness and listened intently without saying a word after some long silent minutes she dropped the phone and skittered away from it as if shed suddenly realized it was emitting poison into her ear consuelos house santa clara seville saturday th september hrs consuelo was having trouble getting dario out of the house and into the car she was on the phone talking to the estate agent in madrid whod found her the perfect property in the lavapies district of the city he was selling it hard because he was pushing something that was off brief dario was on the computer playing his favourite soccer game he was impervious to her occasional shouts to turn the damn thing off and he only complied when she appeared over his shoulder to wrestle the mouse from his hand the electricity demands at the airport were such that the airconditioning was not working at its optimum level looking out on to the taxiways where the aircraft unpeeled their tyres from the searing tarmac falcon held his jacket slung over his shoulder and put in a call to the only person he wanted to talk to im stuck in traffic said consuelo dario will you please just sit down this is javi hola javi shouted dario were on our way to the nervion plaza the only place in the world where were allowed to buy football boots you know the pilgrimage to sevilla fc im going to be out of town again today said falcon but i want to see you tonight do you want to see javi tonight yeees roared dario i think that sounds as if it would be acceptable i love you said falcon trying that out again seeing if she would react this time what was that you heard the lines breaking up i love you consuelo he said and it made him feel young and foolish she laughed lets go roared dario traffics moving she said hasta pronto the phone clicked off he was disappointed hed wanted to hear it from her lips but she wasnt quite ready for that yet admitting to love in front of her youngest son he put his hands up on the glass stared out into the wavering heat and felt a great sense of longing in his chest how the hell would you fall in love if you were blind thought consuelo phone in her lap traffic at a standstill again smell would be important not the quality of a mans aftershave although that in itself would tell you something but rather his musk nothing sharp or rancid and not soapy or fragrant but not too manly either voice too would have powerful effects you wouldnt want to listen to somebody whiny or booming nothing guttural or sibilant then there was touch the feel of a mans hand no limpness pudginess nor clamminess dry and strong but not crushing delicate but not effeminate electric but not furtive and then there were the lips the crucial mouth how his lips fitted on to yours just the right amount of give not hard unyielding nor soft and mushy kissing blind would tell you everything is that why we close our eyes mama said dario consuelo wasnt listening she was too engrossed in her imagination thinking how well javier scored on smell voice and touch shed never believed after her marriage to raul jimenez that she would ever think these foolish things again mama what dario youre not listening to me i am sweetie its just that mamas thinking too mama yes you missed the turning she squeezed his knee so that he yelped and made the complicated series of turns to get back to the nervion plaza parking mama said dario as they descended into the underground car park ground to a halt in the queue to go in what is it darling said consuelo feeling that the first three inquiring mamas had been a prelude to some big burning question dying to be asked do you still love me now that javi is with us she looked at him big eyes beseeching her felt her insides collapse how do we know these things even at eight years old he can tell something important might be swerving away from him she stroked his head and cheek but youre my little man she said the most important one in the world dario smiled that small confrontation with sadness instantly forgotten he pushed his fists between his knees and hunched his shoulders up to his ears as his world fell back into place the driver of the black jaguar didnt say a word the car sped along the m motorway into london falcon was cold underdressed for the season and he was feeling a spaniards uneasiness for silence in company until he remembered his father francisco telling him that the english liked to talk about the weather but as he looked out on to the dull grey flat landscape overhung by dull grey pendulous clouds he could find nothing to say about it couldnt imagine what anybody would find to say about it he put his face close to the window to help him perceive what a local person might see in such unmitigated dullness and thought it might be what you couldnt see when did you last see the sun shine he asked in perfect english his breath fogging the glass sorry mate said the driver dont speak spanish go to mallorca every year for my holidays but still dont speak a word falcon checked him for irony but could tell even from the back of the mans head and his quick glance at the rearview that he was totally goodnatured its not our strong point either said falcon languages the driver whipped round in his seat as if to check he still had the same passenger oh right he said yeah no youre pretty good where dyou learn to speak english like that english lessons said falcon well thats cheating innit said the driver and they both laughed although falcon wasnt quite sure why the traffic seized up as they came into the city the driver turned off the cromwell road twenty minutes later they went past the famous revolving sign of new scotland yard falcon introduced himself at reception handed over his id and police card he went through security and was met at the lifts by a uniformed officer they went up to the fifth floor douglas hamilton met him off the lift took him into a meeting room where there was another man in his late thirties this is rodney from mi said hamilton take a seat flight ok not your sort of temperature eh javier said rodney releasing falcons icecold hand finally the weather thought falcon pablo forgot to tell me it was already winter here he said this is our bloody summer said hamilton you ever been to the irish bar in seville down by the cathedral asked rodney only if someone was murdered there said falcon they laughed the room relaxed they were going to understand each other you run yacoub diouri said rodney but youre a police officer yacoub is a friend of mine he said he would supply information to the cni only on condition that i was his main contact how long have you known him four years said falcon we first met in september and when was the last time you saw him before yesterday we spent some time on holiday together in august and his son abdullah was with you it was a family holiday and how did abdullah appear to you then as i would have expected the son of a wealthy member of the moroccan elite said falcon spoilt brat asked hamilton not exactly he didnt behave any differently to a spanish boy of his age he was very attached to his computer bored by the beach but hes a good kid was he devout no more than the rest of the family who take their religion very seriously as far as i know he wasnt leaving dinner early to go and study the quran but then yacoub said his browser was full of islamic sites so maybe thats what he was doing did he drink asked rodney alcohol yes said falcon feeling the strange weight of this question yacoub abdullah and i would share a bottle of wine at dinner just one bottle between three said rodney whose top button was undone and the knot of his tie off centre there was a grunt of laughter from hamilton if i hadnt been there they wouldnt have drunk alcohol said falcon it was just to make me comfortable as their guest has abdullah ever joined yacoub on any of his business trips to the uk asked hamilton i think so i seem to remember yacoub talking about taking abdullah to the tate modern to see the edward hopper exhibition that was before i recruited yacoub did you know that abdullah was in london now no in fact yesterday yacoub told me he was in a training camp for gicm mujahideen back in morocco he also told me that he himself was returning to rabat pablo briefed us said rodney nodding have you found him yet asked falcon and rodney glared pablo said youd lost yacoub or rather yacoub had lost your we picked him up again about an hour ago said rodney it was just him abdullah stayed in the hotel its not the first time hes lost one of our tails you know that do you follow him every time he comes to london we do now said hamilton since the first time he lost a tail back in july july said falcon amazed that was only a month after i recruited him thats the question said rodney shifting in his seat pulling his tie back to centre how was an amateur able to take us to the cleaners so easily take you to the cleaners said falcon puzzled fool us said hamilton clarifying how could a fucking jeans manufacturer from rabat take on mi and make us look stupid said rodney and the answer is said hamilton not wanting rodneys testiness to get a foothold hes been very well trained said rodney and we dont believe he learnt that in a month if he did it was autodidactic said falcon you what said rodney selftaught said hamilton sorry my english sometimes only the spanish word comes to me said falcon didnt you or was it mi try to recruit yacoub before me and i heard the americans had a go too so asked rodney so you vetted him didnt you asked falcon mi said there was nothing unusual said rodney apart from him being a shirtlifter but no fucking phd from spy school if thats what you mean shirtlifter said falcon its nothing said hamilton maricon said rodney fixing him with a look so whats going on asked falcon giving rodneys aggression a quick sideways glance we were hoping youd be able to tell us said hamilton pushing over a piece of paper these are the five separate occasions where weve lost him falcon looked down the list of dates times and places holland park hampstead heath battersea park clapham common and russell square twice in july once in august and twice in september never less than three hours except this last time so you lost him in these places but where did he reappear we pick him up when hes on his way back to the hotel said hamilton browns always and after your briefing to pablo on what had happened between you and yacoub in madrid yesterday we wouldnt mind knowing what hes been up to said rodney youre his controller and hes lying to you hes not working with us but hes supposed to be on our side if hes operating in his own interests thats one thing if hes been turned then obviously thats another weve already got thirtytwo separate possible terror groups under some sort of surveillance here in the uk said hamilton seventeen of them are in london thats nearly two thousand people were watching nationwide obviously weve had to step things up since last year which means were stretched were having to recruit at the same pace as the terrorists so we can do without your shit on our doorstep said rodney to put it politely are any of these groups youre watching connected to any of the gicm cells in the rest of europe or morocco asked falcon lets put it this way said rodney we havent been able to match any known gicm players with any of the uk groups but thats not to say it hasnt happened the french are telling us theres already a live gicm cell here and how do they know that asked falcon they picked up a moroccan kid on a drugs bust in ales in southern france who gave up some stuff on a group in marseille in exchange for no jail this marseille cell were providing safe houses and documentation the dsg went in there and beat out some good intelligence the moroccan kid was found dead in the river gard a week later with his feet beaten to a pulp and his throat slit so the french reckoned theyd hit gold said rodney who recalled something else and the germans told us they saw yacoub meeting a devout turkish businessman at a trade fair in berlin at the beginning of this month what sort of businessman asked falcon theres plenty of cotton in turkey and yacoubs a clothing manufacturer thats why we werent too concerned said rodney the turk is a cotton manufacturer from denizli its just that when we couple that with other information we find its begging more questions what other information where does the turks money go asked rodney wealthy devout muslims regard it as part of their duty to the community rodney gave him the yapping hand you know how it is in turkey with this battle between the secular and the religious said rodney we could understand it if the turks money was being put into a local school but its finding its way to istanbul and political coffers there and theyre not secular coffers all right said falcon holding up his hands so what youre looking for from me is some clarification of yacoubs behaviour over the last few months dont get us wrong said hamilton running his tie between his fingers were very grateful to yacoub his observations back in june on the fourwheeldrive plot were invaluable mi were nowhere on that mission but the point was that then he was on your territory now hes on ours and were not taking any chances we dont think it was a coincidence that he turned down mi and the yanks said rodney and douglas hamilton gave him a hard stare and what do you mean by that asked falcon time for a smoke said rodney who got up and left the sports shop decimas on the first floor of the nervion plaza shopping centre was full of kids and parents everybody with the same idea the assistants were worked off their feet dario knew what he wanted black pumas consuelo cornered a salesgirl and got her working on the project her mobile rang ricardo her eldest boy was asking or rather telling her that he was going down to matalascanas on the coast for the afternoon she told him to be back for the family dinner with javier shed reached the shop entrance by the time she hung up two men looked in past her shoulders then directly at her one after the other they raised their eyebrows shrugged and walked off towards the escalators back to dario he had the boots on they were too small too small already his feet growing by the month the girl went back to the store room got waylaid by a couple who would not take the brushoff consuelos mobile rang again the estate agent from madrid working hard on a saturday trying to impress her the signal was weak in the shop started to break up the salesgirl came back with the next size up immediately got snagged by somebody else consuelo got the boots on to darios feet he trotted around the shop smiled they were perfect the girl came back boxed them up and took them to the cash desk three people waiting to pay the mobile went off again she left dario at the desk walked out of the shop went to the window overlooking the big openair plaza in the middle of the shopping centre the football stadium with sevilla fcs coat of arms loomed to the left she kept an eye on the progress of the queue from the main concourse two minutes cut off again went back into the shop tapped the desk with her credit card while dario turned the box round in his hands couldnt wait to get back home try them on put a few past javi this evening if he got back before dark consuelos turn to pay rammed the receipt in her bag out of the shop grabbed darios hand down the escalator mobile went off again thered be no signal in the garage so she went outside into the plaza in front of the football stadium the signal was good she talked real estate and walked up the ramp towards the ticket office of the stadium dario got bored wandered off consuelo paced around aimlessly making her points stamping her heel a group of kids streamed past her dario saw the sevilla futbol club shop under the stadium and went in she lit a cigarette sucked in the smoke turned to find dario turned again did a no dario saw the sevilla fc shop knew hed have been unable to resist she walked over to it finished the call folded away her mobile had a good look around a lot of space and too many people she went into the shop dario wasnt there despite some reassurances from douglas hamilton falcon was still feeling the weight of rodneys accusation when the man came back into the room with three mugs of coffee i put sugar in yours i hope that was ok said rodney it sounds to me said falcon still smarting that you think that we or rather the cni have been set up you reckon im just a channel for information that the gicm wants you to know that in fact were being disinformed by our own agent is that right we have to remain open to all possibilities said rodney staring him out over the rim of his steaming mug pablo told us youd lost confidence in yacoub i dont know whether id go that far said falcon finding himself irrationally defending his friend because he was thinking that he probably would go that far and it made him sick to his stomach all we can do is act on our uncertainties said rodney you meet him and well judge for ourselves you want to listen in rodney opened his hands as if nothing could be more obvious i cant have you listening in said falcon youre on our territory said rodney firmly when i go in there ill be talking to him as his friend not his spymaster so how were you talking to him when you were in madrid yesterday that was business said falcon he was under too much pressure to be able to talk to me openly and that was why he lied to you said rodney why should it be any different if you go in there as javier his close personal friend in his culture in business a certain amount of flexibility with the truth is permissible combine that with the paranoia induced by the new uncertainty of his situation after what hed just found out about his son and his evasiveness becomes understandable said falcon if i establish a different level of intimacy with him from the start and he still lies to me then i know we are lost and i cant do that if im wired up to you you wont even notice it said rodney falcon stared him out the two englishmen looked at each other in a complex communication that left falcon thinking that they would be doing exactly what they wanted regardless rodney nodded as if to give way falcon didnt like his look the man had a sort of unearned confidence about him that was not appealing the ugliness of the nervion plaza shopping centre became more apparent the harder consuelo looked for her son in its grey brutality she thought it must have been designed by an east german before the wall came down she stood in the empty space at its heart which was frequented by sprinting children and dazed adults above it there was a jazzy modern awning which cast geometric patterned shade on the area making it even more difficult to make out the childrens faces she could only assume that he had gone into the shop got bored and been drawn to the animation here there were a lot of ways in and out the shopping mall where theyd just been to buy his boots the street the stadium and the access to the cinema complex consuelo walked around this area four or five times darting down various alleyways to check for dario but always coming back to the centre in the hope of finding her blond boy clasping his cardboard box of football boots as she did this she called his brothers ricardo and matias and told them they had to come to the nervion plaza immediately to help look for him there was some protest especially from ricardo who was already on his way to the coast twenty minutes later they were all in nervion plaza consuelos sister had brought matias and the family ricardo had been with joined in the search the father went straight to the first security guard he could find and got them to involve the local police announcements were made car parks were searched toilets investigated every shop was visited the kids films showing at the cinemas were all halted for ten minutes while they checked the audiences the search was extended out into the streets and around the stadium local radio was contacted only after everybodys reassurances had stopped working and consuelo had retraced her steps a hundred times and shed ransacked her mind for the final image of the last moment that she could picture dario standing in that area in the godforsaken heart of the nervion plaza with the box of football boots in his arms did her paralysed brain think to call javier his mobile was switched off ramirez was still in front of the computer screen when consuelos call came through javiers not here he started where is he she asked his mobiles are switched off both personal and police hes not in seville today but where is he jose luis i need to speak to him its urgent we cant say any more than that consuelo can you get a message to him not even that at the moment i cant believe this she said whats he doing thats so so fucking important i cant say can you get a message to him as soon as hes back in touch of course tell him that my youngest son dario has has has what consuelo consuelo fought against the word in her throat the word that she had not permitted to enter her consciousness the word that had lurked low in some hideous dark corner of her stomach where all mothers cordon off their worst fears but which was now sickeningly illuminated hes disappeared browns hotel mayfair london saturday th september hrs the receptionist at browns an exclusive hotel consisting of eleven georgian houses joined together in the heart of mayfair had an appraising eye which was discernible only to those who did not meet his exacting standards falcon thought him polite but did not realize how restrained this politeness was until someone instantly recognizable but whose name escaped appeared behind falcons shoulder that was politeness or maybe a caricature of it whatever falcon was made to wait for no other reason than it was evident from his lightweight suit in autumn that he did not belong the call was eventually made to yacoubs room falcon whod already given his name twice was asked to repeat it as if he might be a purveyor of game birds to back entrances there was a lengthy silence while the receptionist listened then falcon experienced the fullyfledged form of british hotel politeness yacoub embraced him in the corridor outside his room he put a finger to his lips beckoned him in and shut the door from the state of the room it was clear that abdullah was staying there as well but was not present still with his finger to his lips he indicated that falcon should undress he went into the bathroom shook out a towel and laid it on the bed falcon stripped to his underpants yacoub indicated that they had to come off as well they went into the bathroom yacoub didnt turn on the light he ran the taps shut the door he minutely searched falcons ears and scalp and then made him take a shower and wash his hair he fetched a packet of cigarettes from the bedroom and sat back on the bidet while falcon dried himself off cant be too careful these days said yacoub they have devices the size of a nail paring good to know you still trust me youve no idea how careful i have to be i dont know whats happening any more yacoub one moment im swimming happily in the shallows the next im off the continental shelf ive got no idea who is with me or against me lets talk about trust first said yacoub stonefaced you spoke to pablo you told me abdullah was in a training camp back in morocco you spoke to pablo said yacoub pointing an accusing finger at falcons bare chest thats why youre out of your depth weve lost control of the situation they now control it the cni mi and mi probably the cia too if you hadnt spoken to pablo it would have been between us i dont have the experience in this game to let something like abdullahs recruitment go without getting advice from pablo said falcon i knew when i met you in madrid that at best you were being economical with the truth i thought that was a breach of trust so i spoke to pablo and he confirmed that youd lied to me yacoub hes my son said yacoub lighting a cigarette you will never understand that you gave me information not so that we could control the situation but so that you could said falcon i would always be in the dark because blood is thicker than water you told me that from the beginning my only motivation is to protect him well hes unprotected now isnt he said falcon leaning back against the cistern you knew that it would eventually get back to me that youd met up with abdullah in london and that i would then know that youd lied to me in madrid i spoke to pablo and found out a bit earlier thats all what we have to do now is reestablish the trust i can understand why you were in a state in madrid i can understand your wariness and your paranoia can you said yacoub derisively before i got into this i thought i could imagine it but i had no idea it would be like this so youve got there without even experiencing it impressive javier were talking now said falcon nodding at him im happy i can feel the old yacoub the old yacoub is long gone he said and smoked i dont think so said falcon but ive got to give the cni some answers now you knew it would come to this in the end you cant lose mi five times over the last three months and not expect questions to be asked you cant tell me that your son has been recruited to the gicm without giving any idea of his involvement the intelligence agencies are looking at you and asking themselves who is yacoub diouri what is his connection to that turkish businessman from denizli he met at the trade fair in berlin has he been making contact with an active gicm cell in london that theyve learnt about from the french who is the stranger living at his home in rabat and none of these questions has come about because i spoke to pablo its happened because youve been behaving like a maverick that is a perfect description of my situation said yacoub im in the goldfish bowl everybody is looking at me i have nowhere to go nowhere to hide i am as suspicious to my friends at the cni as i am to my enemies at the gicm are you surprised that i start to act alone that i am not as transparent as youd like you might be in the goldfish bowl but youve still managed to hide said falcon now i have to explain how an untrained agent of mine can lose the professionals of mi five times over the last three months on their own turf the first time barely a month after your recruitment they know youve been trained and i know it wasnt done by the cni so who did it if were going to get help for abdullah we have to rely on these people its the military wing of the gicm who are going to arrange a mission on which your son might well be killed not mi or the cni the water rushed out of the taps yacoubs head rocked back against the wall he smoked and stared at the sky beyond the high window for some time look at me he said look at what i have become what do you want me to say yacoub said falcon im sorry im sorry that we went into this not knowing nobody knows said yacoub viciously do you think these professional recruiters tell their victims what its like how many new agents do you think theyd get if they told them theyd be vivisected masterfully kept alive while all their structures are dismantled around them until all thats left is a mind with blood running through it seeing things hearing things remembering things photographing things reporting things i want to help you yacoub but i cant if i dont know anything if what youre telling me is only the partial truth and if i tell you who will you tell who will they tell theres no knowing where it will end well become chess pieces in a threedimensional game where the players are incapable of calculating the ramifications of each move until its too late its not just symbolic that im sitting here naked in your bathroom said falcon they wanted to wire me up i told them it wouldnt be possible for me to talk to you if i knew they were listening in with your precautions we know theyre not this is between you and me and i know im back with you this is different to what it was like in madrid so lets talk lets get it out in the open and then decide who should be told what yacoub looked across at him the dull light from the big grey outside turned one side of his head to pewter his eyes shifted and glinted in the dark their scintillas of light were like needles into falcons mind are you the right stuff they asked the reason why the gicm accepted me so readily when i crossed to their side of the mosque was that theyd wanted to recruit me for the past nine months said yacoub slowly despite my family history and connections to various movements in the past they had not made any approaches because there was nothing in my behaviour to indicate that i was of their mentality as i said before they were nervous of that half that wasnt moroccan and still are but the reason that i was taken in and elevated so rapidly that for instance i met their military high command within days of crossing the line was that theyd been watching me for a long time i had something that they wanted but you had no idea what they wanted or that they knew that you had something they desired no i was naive i thought it was my game said yacoub tapping his chest then grunting a laugh it was like going to meet your prospective wife in an arranged marriage expecting the demure virgin and discovering someone terrifyingly experienced and when did you find this out asked falcon when i came back from paris that time in june they were vetting me we all thought it was to do with our mission and the fourwheel drives filled with explosives going to london but it was nothing of the sort they were making sure i was clean that i didnt contact anybody and that nobody came anywhere near me so what did they ask you when you came back to rabat are you ready for this javier what do you mean once you know it youre a part of it you cant unlearn it said yacoub youll find yourself not just with knowledge but holding things in your power precious things like peoples lives my life abdullahs life the reason im here is so that you dont have to go through this alone said falcon we went into this together naive as we were and im not going to desert you now so tell me if i tell you youll be in my boat and that means you wont be able to tell anybody not your own people and certainly not the british or the americans lets hear what it is before we decide anything theres no well see about it javier said yacoub im as good as dead if anything i tell you goes out of this room youll just have to live with the knowledge and theyll interrogate you pump you for everything youve got spit it out said falcon yacoub ran his hands over his head prepared himself a short introduction he said as you know the primary design of the gicm was not international operations but to bring about a change in the moroccan government they want islamic rule with sharia law said falcon exactly and the situation in morocco is no less complicated than that other country which butts up against europes eastern border turkey there is a complex battle between the religious and secular in both countries and terrorism is used on both sides the situation is a little different in morocco because we have a monarchy of the alawite dynasty which can trace its ancestry back to the prophets soninlaw we also had a king mohammed v who identified himself with the nationalist struggle for independence back in the s and was exiled for it so the king had both religious lineage and political credibility which meant that after independence he wasnt pushed to institute parliamentary government he died early and his son hassan ii the hard man took over in he didnt believe in democracy leaders of political parties were exiled a whole apparatus of secret police informers and terror was installed his was a despotic regime but it did maintain a secular order mohammed vi took over in and there has been a general relaxation human rights power and freedom for women political pluralism the fundamentalists dont like these reforms but with the security system more or less dismantled they saw opportunities to get themselves organized for political disruption thats right but they needed help they needed money said yacoub nothing much seemed to be happening until but even by then important connections had been made to the people who would eventually become known to the world as alqaeda extremely devout moroccan muslims have been going to the middle east for centuries ostensibly to receive an education but since the s they started getting fired up by what was happening in afghanistan so there were already the right people around in morocco by who could plug themselves into the alqaeda network the gicm was like a little startup company looking for help from a larger corporation but if you want to make yourself attractive you have to be able to bring something to the table which is why they involved themselves in international operations but it didnt happen just like that said yacoub snapping his fingers its taken the gicm years to get into this position with peoplesmuggling routes in and out of spain networks of cells to facilitate surveillance of targets logistics of material id card and passport forgery and bombmaking so in trying to make themselves attractive prospects theyve become formidable players now they wouldnt even have to ask alqaeda for money said yacoub theyre involved in drugrunning bankcard fraud and internet scams all of which they see not as criminal but as legitimate attacks on the west all part of the jihad so like anybody whos become a power in their own right they start to think of themselves differently success brings a change of focus they start thinking globally why bother to overturn the monarch of some poor farflung kingdom when you could bring about the complete revolution return all lands from pakistan to morocco and maybe even andalucia to islamic government and law as we were over a thousand years ago the jihadis dream said falcon but how do you pull it off so far theyve had a limited impact by blowing up the world trade center killing commuters in madrid and london but theyre a long way from the dream and theyve realized that said yacoub all osama bin laden did was put them on the map he made them understand that they have power only then after did the real thinking start so go on how are they going to pull this off you see javier thats the fatal error of the west what you dont believe its possible you think its some ridiculous farfetched notion of a bunch of towelheaded fanatics sitting in mud huts making plans with sticks in the sand i dont underestimate the capabilities of these groups said falcon but what i do know is that the arab world has never been able to show a united front the leaders of the arab world said yacoub those people whove become the lapdogs of the west they cant show a united front with the disenfranchised palestinians the split lebanese the sinister syrians the undecided turks the occupied iraqis the impossible iranians but what about their populations with sixty per cent under the age of twentyfive who have nothing but belief and a sense of injustice the people are more ready than ever to show a united front all right said falcon but theres still a long way to go but there is a key said yacoub one arab country holds the key to everything not only is it the richest with fabulous reserves of the most desired commodity in the world but it also holds the keys to the holiest sites in islam saudi arabia said falcon your theory about why the americans invaded iraq with such haste was to protect that monarchy who are the guardians of their most valuable interest a very difficult relationship for most muslims to understand said yacoub why do the guardians of the holiest sites in islam embrace the most despised infidel on the face of the earth the one who upholds the rights of zion in the heart of the land of the prophet very tricky javier possibly more understandable if the saudis used their wealth power and influence to achieve justice for the most abject people of the arab world but they dont so nobody would cry if the house of saud came to an ignominious end said falcon but how do you achieve it first of all alqaeda might not be able to get rid of the americans from iraq but they will keep them so fully occupied over such a long time that when the moment comes and the americans have to respond they will be too weak or overstretched or lacking in will to do so and in the meantime there are more than six thousand members of the saudi royal family said yacoub their total wealth is greater than the gdp of many smaller nations all those people with all that wealth make the royal family a political monster every point of view is represented by its members from the utterly corrupt drugrunning friends of america to the reclusive ascetic profoundly devout wahabi fundamentalists some flaunt their wealth in tasteless displays of extravagance while others quietly channel funds into international terrorism so the gicm and other terrorist groups have realized that it could just be a question of tipping the balance in favour of the radical fundamentalists within the royal family combined with the support of a disgruntled population who will see more opportunities for equality in an islamic state than they ever would from an oldfashioned monarchy and there you have the makings of a new world order said falcon but its not something that will be pulled off easily how are the gicm going to do it and how do you fit in persuasion manoeuvring and if necessary assassination said yacoub one by one i imagine theres quite a considerable security apparatus attached to the house of saud said falcon uneasily very experienced very well trained said yacoub nodding staring at his feet did they train you yacoub he looked up at the wall above falcons head the light in his pupils seemed to be coming from a long way off like a traveller at night making slow progress over a moonless desert this is where you decide javier he said i wouldnt blame you if you went next door put your clothes on left the room and we never see each other again i dont want that said falcon why not asked yacoub lowering his gaze to meet falcons eye his curiosity genuine falcon thought about this for some time not because he was unsure but because it suddenly struck him how valuable this relationship had become to him his friendship with yacoub had all the complexities of the ties of blood but without there being any and he also knew there was no greater bond than that between parent and child this bizarre situation sitting naked in yacoubs hotel bathroom with a world of trouble seemingly on the brink of fulmination made him feel a terrible loneliness at the loss of his own parental relationships and the knowledge that he would always be secondary in the lives of others who were important to him if theres any doubt said yacoub theres no doubt said falcon youre the only person who understands what ive been through im close to my brother and sister but they still see me as the old javier theyve never grasped the extent of the change or perhaps they dont want to deal with it you know me in a way that nobody else does and im not going to give that up lightly then why do you look so desolate said yacoub because i think i might be destined for the ultimate loneliness of never being the most important person in anybodys life yacoub nodded he had no intention of lying to him but there are times he said when only a friend will do falcon said nothing yacoub knew the questions he had to answer and he was either going to do it or not he sighed as if this was going to be an enormous relief ive been in a relationship with well lets leave it as a member of the saudi royal family for the moment said yacoub we can call him faisal without fear of identification how long have you known him we first met in at the house of a friend in marbella said yacoub we became friends he does a lot of business in london whenever i had meetings or attended fashion shows we would always see each other lets be clear about it yacoub said falcon is he your lover yes he said when it became clear that this was serious and faisal being an important member of the family was suitably paranoid he had me vetted and then trained so that i could get to see him without bringing the world to his door his security detail is british trained theyve also actively helped me in the last few months when because of my successes mi have been a little more assiduous in tailing me so what does he know about you asked falcon if his security detail is helping you lose mi he must realize that youre not normal we share a lot of beliefs we know the world is not black and white we spend a lot of time talking about the grey it was faisal for instance who told me why the americans invaded iraq as if it had become a matter of extreme urgency quite a few of those six thousand members of the royal family live in a state of total paranoia and terror the least bit of trouble and theyre on their private jets and out of there taking the details of their swiss bank accounts with them quite said yacoub he despises them he and i both have an interest in what is happening beneath the surface youd like him we talk about you does that mean hes comfortable with your spying activities for the cni its to his advantage and as you know he tells me things too where does he stand on the integral line between friends of america and wahabi fundamentalist hes both and yet neither so hes an important member of the royal family who is in the balance said falcon the ideal target for the gicm someone they would like to see converted to their cause not quite said yacoub youre forgetting that the radicals in the gicm do see everything in black and white they dont like grey areas they cant stomach a man who holds conflicting opinions however devout faisal might be and he is very devout more devout than ill ever be he is still a very loyal family member however powerful the arguments are that any radical could put to him he would never betray his king how did the gicm find out about your relationship with faisal and do they know its full extent they do know its full extent and we are unsure how they got that information said yacoub i overlapped with another lover faisal often travels with a large entourage and other family members there are indiscretions there are servants however hard you try you cant hermetically seal yourself off from the world and something like the homosexuality of an important family member has a way of getting out salacious gossip can find a crack in any wall and this was what the gicm told you when you came back from paris in june yacoub had his feet up on the rim of the bidet his elbows propped against his knees his forehead in his hands he nodded and is this why the gicm have recruited abdullah asked falcon the only tie more powerful than a lover is that between father and son this is how they keep you close but what exactly do they want faisal can never be entirely and securely converted to the cause said yacoub they want him dead nervion plaza shopping centre seville saturday th september hrs im not going to talk to anybody except javier said consuelo not loudly but with such an edge to her voice that all the men stood back from her as if shed just unsheathed a sword they were in the office of the director of the nervion plaza shopping centre which looked out through thin slatted blinds on to the broad avenue of calle luis de morales it was cold in the room the sun was blinding and fierce outside white bars of intense light spectrum edged laddered the far wall on which hung a copy of a joan miro painting consuelo knew that this painting was called dog barking at the moon and indeed it consisted of a small colourful dog a scimitar of white moon and an unforgiving black background broken only by what looked like a railway track going to oblivion it turned her stomach to look at miros intention to show tiny forms in vast empty spaces where was dario now normally he was a large presence in a small space but now she could only think of his defenceless tininess in the larger outside world the thought of him came in waves one moment she was tough and assertive commanding respect from all the men in the room and the next she had her face in her trembling hands hiding that vulnerability pressing the tears back into her eyes this is not javiers kind of work said ramirez the only one who knew her well enough to raise any sort of objection i know its not jose luis said consuelo looking up from the sofa thank god for that but i cant i dont want to talk to anyone else he knows me he can get everything he needs out of me we dont have to start from scratch you should talk to the officers from the crimes against children squad said ramirez the grume have enormous experience with missing children and its important that we establish the possibilities and probabilities of what may have happened here immediately is this a case of a child having wandered off or has he been abducted and if so what could be the motives of abducted said consuelo her neck lengthening by ten centimetres dont alarm yourself consuelo said ramirez im not alarming myself jose luis youre alarming me this is what the grume do they look at the background they judge probabilities have you made enemies in business who hasnt have you noticed anyone hanging around your home she didnt answer that made her think what about that guy last june the gypsylooking guy whod muttered obscenities at her in the street then shed seen him again in the plaza del pumarejo not far from her restaurant shed thought he was going to rape her down a back street hed known her name hed known all sorts of things that her husband was dead and yes her sister later had referred to him as the new pool guy when shed been looking after the kids and had seen him hanging around the house youre thinking consuelo i am will you talk to the grume officers now all right ill talk to them but as soon as javier is available were trying to get a message to him now said ramirez patting her on the shoulder with one of his huge steadying mahogany hands he felt for her he had his own kids the abyss had opened up in him before now and changed him they were angry with falcon douglas hamilton who was on the brink of losing his usual calm was jabbing him with irony rodney had already called him a cunt falcon knew from his english lessons that this was the worst thing you could say to someone in england but to him a spaniard the worlds greatest insulters it was water off a ducks back they were mildly irritated by the fact that the listening device theyd planted on him hadnt worked but what was really incensing them was that falcon wouldnt tell them anything juicy from his meeting with yacoub you cant tell us where hes been on the five occasions hes lost us you cant tell us who trained him you cant tell us why his son is with him in london that i dont know said falcon cutting in on the litany he wouldnt tell me that maybe we should just shoot the fucker anyway said rodney who said falcon rodney shrugged as if it didnt matter it wont come to that said hamilton smoothly hes in a very difficult position said falcon oh fuck right off said rodney arent we all said hamilton youre talking to people with two thousand suspected terrorists under constant watch cant you at least throw us a bone javier i can tell you about the turkish businessman from denizli fuck that said rodney were listening said hamilton theyve signed a contract for the supply of denim to his factory in sale said falcon the first shipment was received bugger off said rodney you know what hes doing and youre not fucking telling us we dont give a shit about the turkish tosser maybe you knew that yacoub and the turk had a genuine business relationship said falcon and you were just using their mildly suspicious backgrounds to make them appear more threatening we know about the turk said hamilton holding up a calming hand what else can you tell us yacoub knows of no active gicm cell currently operating in the uk said falcon this doesnt mean there isnt one it just means he has never been asked to make contact with it and hes never heard any reference to one in any of his discussions with the military wing of the gicm brilliant said rodney lets at least get something straight said hamilton do you know what hes been up to when hes lost the mi tails not exactly all i do know is that its a private matter which requires toplevel spy craft in order to stay private yes said falcon all right said hamilton the person or group that hes met on these occasions youre saying theyre not an active gicm cell i can confirm that said falcon i can also confirm that they are in no way your enemies then why the fuck cant you tell us who they are said rodney in a crescendo because youll start to make assumptions said falcon ill tell you one thing and youll put it together with other perhaps unrelated bits of information about yacoub youll build a picture the wrong one then youll act in your own interests and not those of my agent and that will more than likely put yacoub and his son in serious danger whats yacoubs interest asked hamilton that everybody close to him gets out alive and he doesnt necessarily include himself in that number fuck me now hes giving you the sacrificial lamb shit said rodney why does he think that we wouldnt help him asked hamilton yacoub turned down approaches from both mi and the cia said falcon because he had very good reasons for thinking that they would quite quickly find him expendable lets just take him out said rodney bored by it all then we wont have to worry about him any more falcon had been waiting for this moment he needed to create a little scene and rodney had just given him the opportunity he took three steps across the room lifted rodney out of his chair and slammed him up against the door youre talking about my friend said falcon through gritted teeth my friend who has given vital information at considerable risk to himself which prevented an attack on a landmark building in the heart of the city of london containing thousands of people if you want to put yourself in the way of more information like that then youll have to be patient with him yacoub unlike you is not in the business of endangering peoples lives all right said hamilton grabbing falcons tensed bicep lets calm things down then get this triggerhappy imbecile out of my sight said falcon rodney grinned and falcon realized that the man had been playing a part all along getting under his skin trying to lever him open falcon still simmering allowed himself to be guided back to his chair just give us something to go on javier said hamilton thats all we ask all right said falcon whod been prepared by yacoub for this free gift a number of agencies including the cni have been concerned by the appearance of a stranger in yacoubs household in rabat thats where he lives rodney what the fucks that to us then that probably concludes our business said falcon coldly preparing to leave take no notice of him said hamilton tell us about the stranger hes a family friend his name is mustafa barakat he runs a number of tourist shops in fes which was where he was born in and has lived his entire life whats he doing in yacoubs house hes a guest its not the first time although it is probably the first time since foreign and moroccan agencies have taken an interest in yacoubs life well check him out said rodney as if that was a threat shell talk to you now said ramirez addressing the two officers from the crimes against children squad grume who were standing in the corridor outside the directors office whats her problem asked the younger one shes been investigated by the police before said ramirez thats how we know her we suspected her or rather i suspected her of murdering her husband raul jimenez and falcon didnt asked inspector jefe tirado the older grume officer is that why shell only talk to him theyre close said ramirez and cut off that line of questioning with his hand she didnt kill her husband did she asked the younger officer nervously just stick to the fucking point said ramirez ignoring him stay focused on her missing son dont try to broaden things out too quickly concentrate on the immediate facts and then work back slowly but thats not how we work said the young officer i know thats why im telling you said ramirez if you start rooting around in her private life her business associates her family album before youve gained her complete trust then shell clam up until falcon gets here and when is that going to be i dont know maybe ten or eleven oclock this evening i hear she lost sight of the boy when he went into the sevilla futbol club shop said tirado you know they dont have cctv out there its going to be hard going for us to establish whether he wandered off or was abducted you got any feeling for what might have happened jose luis i doubt the kid wandered off said ramirez youre going to find out that shes a complicated woman i dont even understand them when theyre simple said the young officer looking down the corridor ramirez made a short mental appeal to the holy virgin stick to the facts broaden out slowly he repeated the mantra we may have to wait for falcon anyway what does that mean it means falcons stirring a lot of pots at the same time and a fair few of them have shit at the bottom they opened the door consuelos voice barged out into the corridor what do you mean they dont have cctv she asked why dont you have cctv in england ive heard they have cctv everywhere even on roundabouts in the middle of nowhere this isnt england said the director feeling sorry for her but having to tamp down his irritation too as he was having to repeat himself again and again because not much was sticking in her mind but there must be something good afternoon senora jimenez my name is inspector jefe tirado said the senior grume officer as he entered the room we are from the crimes against children squad there is of course plenty we can do were going to check all the footage of every camera in the nervion plaza and that includes the internal shops cctv as you know there are cameras in the central area too and its possible that we will get sufficient angle on some of them to include the sevilla fc stadium and shop there are already officers conducting interviews with people in and around the shop and stadium i expect that we will find out very quickly what has happened to your son dario consuelo stood up and shook the mans hand at falcon was on his way back to heathrow douglas hamilton had told him hed make sure they held the flight but falcon wasnt sure the man liked him enough to actually do it despite the aggression from the two men falcon was relaxed yacoub had told him the truth they were back on track and he didnt mind doing some blocking for him there were still moments of panic when he thought about the ruthlessness of the gicm but he calmed himself with the thought of faisals saudi security detail he turned his mobile on without thinking it exploded with messages and missed calls he went into the inbox twelve messages from consuelo he leaned back in his seat the jaguar coasted along the raised section of the great west road past empty highrise office space he allowed some exhaustion to creep into his neck and back as he savoured the weight of the unread messages he smiled to himself thinking javier falcon the romantic hed never have believed it he shrugged and opened the first message dario missing help he clicked through all twelve messages hoping that this was just the first panicked text and that by number twelve hed get dario found see you tonight instead he pieced together the chain of events and the last message read where are you i need you here it was timed his insides felt hideously cold as ugly thoughts stirred at the back of his mind ramirez was still in the corridor outside the directors office waiting for news when he took falcons call he gave him the update told him that consuelo was with the grume officers im not going to get back until ten thirty tonight at the earliest said falcon let me talk to her in private hold on a second javier while listening to the extended muffled conversation at the other end falcon tried to think of consoling things to say to consuelo but he knew that no words of comfort ever worked in these situations cristinas found a couple living in an apartment block on avenida de eduardo dato they have a perfect view of the sevilla fc stadium and the shop said ramirez they saw two people dressed in black jackets black jeans and baseball caps with a small boy in between them who was wearing a sevilla fc scarf but appeared to be struggling and not particularly happy one of the adults was carrying a box when they arrived at a car parked in front of the couples block one of the adults got in the back with the boy the one carrying the box threw it on the ground got in the drivers seat and drove off they managed to see that it was a red fiat punto and had an old seville number plate cristinas recovered the box which contained a pair of football boots bought today from a shop called decimas take that news and the football boots in to consuelo and the grume officers said falcon and let me speak to cristina ferrera came on the line did you go and see marisa asked falcon this morning just after you left every time i went to see marisa i got a threatening phone call afterwards and you think theyve taken their threat one step further i know they have said falcon i went to see marisa late last night and i got a call just before i met consuelo for dinner about ten minutes after midnight the voice told me that something would happen and when it did i would know that it was my fault and i would recognize it these people know me they know my vulnerabilities whoever is coercing marisa has kidnapped dario its the next logical step falcon was talking to her in his usual measured way but for the first time in four years working for him she could hear a trembling at the edges of his voice that told her he was afraid she knew he was close to the boy he was always asking her questions about what her own son was like at eight years old what he was interested in what he liked to do her boss was learning how to be a father and hed just been thrown in the deep end ill go and see marisa again she said how was she the last time she was in a state drunk on rum she was just opening up to me when she got a call then she fell to pieces couldnt get rid of me quick enough go and see her now cristina he said as soon as possible get the pressure back on her tell her theyve kidnapped a child work on her emotions make her suffer do whatever you have to ill do it dont worry she said but what about the grume officers technically its their investigation were only involved because consuelo called ramirez when she was trying to find you wed already started a line of inquiry with marisa moreno she is a suspect in a conspiracy to murder case grume will obviously have to be kept informed but you are going to lose valuable time bringing them up to speed so you go to see marisa and i will explain our position to grume now let me speak to consuelo while ramirez is talking to grume about what you found out from that couple on avenida de eduardo dato said falcon that was good fast work cristina ferrera called consuelo into the empty corridor handed her the phone where are you she said hugging the phone to her cheek i cant tell you its not police business and i cant talk about it all i can say is that im a flight away and im on the road to the airport ill be with you before midnight cristina found witnesses who saw two people leading dario away ive seen the football boots theyre the ones i just bought for him she said the emotion constricting her throat having to squeeze the words past the barrier they were leading dario away javier consuelo was not prepared for this now that she was talking to him all the powers that made her such a formidable person to deal with in business that enabled her to run her complicated life that made people sit up in the presence of her personality deserted her she found herself in the same state shed been in with alicia aguado holding her hand the lost little girl the troubled teenager the adult gone awry the mature woman on the edge of insanity falcon after that little logistical exchange came to an unexpected halt in the face of his insurmountable guilt all that cold black hideousness that hed felt on reading her messages rose in his chest she was coming to him for help for comfort for solutions and all he could think of was that he was the cause of her terrible predicament he could feel her desperation her need to melt into him but having wanted that more than anything else in his life this morning he now found he was insoluble to her substance this is what you have to do said falcon whose only recourse was to the professional in him theres going to be cctv footage of the two people the nervion plazas cctv doesnt go out that far those two people will have had to come into the shopping centre to find you they will have been looking at you for some time before they saw their opportunity you have to look at all the available footage and find them then when youve found them you have to think where youve seen them before because consuelo those two people have been somewhere in your life they might have been at the very periphery of it but they have been there nobody can do what theyve just done without any planning without having watched you and dario for some time but maybe somebody else did all that and these people just did the the abducting thats possible but at some stage those people will have had to see their target you should talk to the school take inspector jefe tirado with you and talk to the teachers and other children not just the ones in his class i need you here javier she said and im going to be there but in the meantime this is the most important moment remember that the first hours are critical you have to clear your mind of everything and concentrate only on what can help us find dario a deep breath from consuelo youre right she said when you see those two people on the cctv footage and i promise you they will be there they might not be in their baseball caps or they might be in reversible jackets but they will be there consuelo you will have seen them ive seen them she said what do you mean i remember now two men they looked straight at me when i was on the phone in decimas waiting to pay for the football boots i noticed their look think about them when youre looking at the cctv footage ask the security people to play the footage from outside decimas first and when you see those two men look at everything about them the way they walk their size height clothes hands and feet jewellery anything that will give you a clue that will jog your memory of where you have seen them before thats all you do consuelo think about that answer the questions from inspector jefe tirado and nothing else ill be back tonight and well find him javier yes i love you she said you again said marisa face impassive rubbery with alcohol her eyes rheumy still havent found anything better to do she let the door fall back revealed herself in bikini briefs again a fat smouldering joint in her fingers the smell of rum was strong its sweetness mixed in with the hashish come in little nun come in im not going to bite you marisa walked extravagantly to the work bench swivelled and landed heavily on a stool she swayed backwards and managed to sweep up a glass of cuba libre and sipped it with distaste it was warm and sticky she licked her lips what you looking at she asked her face weak and evil by turns you marisa posed with her legs spread ran a finger under the waistband of her briefs fancy a bit of that she asked bet you had to do a bit of that in nun school or whatever they call it shut up marisa said cristina ill make some coffee your boss said marisa adopting a mock sexualized tone the inspector jefe he knows why he sent you here he thinks im into that hates men loves marisa stopped dead as cristina lashed her across the face with her open palm it knocked her off the stool she dropped the joint hunted for it among the wood shavings replugged it into her mouth got to her feet blinking tears streaking her cheeks cristina made the coffee forced her to drink water got her into a tshirt and a robe no amount of alcohol or dope is going to stop you thinking about what youve got on your mind marisa how the fuck do you know what ive got on my mind cristina got up close grabbed hold of marisas chin made those lazy eyes pop open she took the joint from her fingers crushed it underfoot every time the inspector jefe has come to see you hes taken a threatening phone call afterwards from the same people holding margarita she said he got a call last night they told him something bad was going to happen and this morning the inspector jefes partner is in the nervion plaza and what happens marisa are you listening to me she nodded cristina was hurting her they kidnapped her son eight years old they led him off stuffed him in the back of a car said cristina so now because you wont talk to us an innocent child is suffering and you know what these people are like dont you marisa marisa jerked her head back tore her chin out of cristinas grip paced the floor with her arms over her head trying to close it all out eightyearold little boy said cristina and you know what they said marisa they said that we would never hear from them again so because you wont talk the little boys gone and we will never get him back not unless you marisa stamped her foot clenched her fists looked up to an unseen uncaring god thats the point little nun she said theyd do anything these people you know they have guys who dont care one way or the other a girl a baby an eightyearold boy it doesnt make any difference to them and if i speak to you if i say one word we can protect you i can have a patrol car around here you can protect me said marisa you can put me in a concrete bunker for the rest of my life and that would give them pleasure because they would know that all id think about would be margarita and the terrible things they would do to her that is how these people operate why do you think theyve got her anyway an innocent teenager im listening marisa when my father died he had a debt on his club in gijon my mother scraped together money from wherever she could to pay them then she got ill they took margarita to clear the debt said marisa but you see we didnt really owe them money they had my fathers club they had made money out of him all his life even when he was on the sugar board in cuba but then they saw some helpless women and they invented a debt an unrepayable debt my sister will whore for them until shes finished and when shes dried out and gaping from the drugs and the endless fucking theyll kick her out on to the street and let her live in the gutter to them livestock has more value flight londonseville saturday th september hrs he hadnt been able to respond hed waited for those words all this time and when theyd come he couldnt say them back why not because the words that had so comforted her and elicited those heavily guarded and lockedaway sentiments had come from the office of inspector jefe javier falcon hed said those words to hundreds of people staring down the empty luge run that opened up when they learned that somebody close to them had been murdered it had been taught to him by a retired norwegian detective at the police academy back in the s when per aarvik had told them that the luge run was unavoidable for those closest to the victim hed had to start by describing what a luge run was its icy insanity sounded terrifying to a class of spanish twentyyearolds and as per aarvik said everybody went through it but if you wanted someone to be of use to you in your investigation you had to focus their mind steady their nerve point them in the right direction and by the time you let them go make them believe that you would be with them to the end if you said it right if you believed in it yourself they would love you as they would close family consuelo loved him for the course hed done at the police academy per would have been proud clear the mind this is avoidance thinking he could see what was happening to him the stress of the flight had been terrible even though with the plane full theyd had to put him in business class hed sipped a whisky and water gnawed on his thumbnail and writhed deeper into his luxurious seat at the thought of dario in the hands of strangers she would know as soon as she looked into his face that he was guilty that he was the cause of her most loved sons abduction if he told her she would not forgive him if he didnt tell her she would never forgive him there was only hope in the first course of action and hed have to find the boy he called cristina ferrera as he trotted through the arrivals hall at seville airport it was pm hed lost an hour to the time difference ferrera had stayed with marisa for two hours and the cuban hadnt cracked shed walked her home given her some aspirin and put her to bed marisa hadnt even been prepared to confirm that it was the russians whod taken her sister and who were putting her under such extreme pressure not to talk she wouldnt admit to knowing vasili lukyanov she wouldnt talk about the purpose of her relationship with calderon shed never got drunk enough to forget her fear you took her home said falcon thats good i think im all shes got what are you doing tonight im going to bed so that i can get up tomorrow to take the kids to the beach on the way down to cadiz for lunch with my mother of course you are and you i thought id do the first shift on a twentyfourhour surveillance of marisa moreno for which you have no budget said ferrera what about consuelo i dont think shell want to see me for very long youre going to tell her the alternative is not an option ill go and sit outside marisas apartment relieve me when you can what about the kids my neighbours good for a few hours but im not going to be able to get to marisas immediately she said i havent eaten as soon as you can falcon kept on the run to his car where he called inspector jefe tirado from the crimes against children squad theyd already spoken at heathrow tirado was on the road somewhere ive just left senora jimenez he said shes with her sister and her other two boys shes remarkably calm a doctors been round to check her out blood pressure that kind of thing shes fine hes given her some sleeping pills and something for anxiety which she says she wont take hows it going on your side the big news is that weve found them on cctv good footage not bad but not a lot of it senora jimenez has it with her shes looking at it any more witnesses we havent been able to add much more detail beyond what cristina ferrera found out this morning said tirado we have to hope that when they said they wouldnt make contact they were just adding a level of threat it would be unusual if they didnt make demands eventually but i reckon theyll make her sweat until monday what about the press it was too late for the sunday editions and i wanted to hold back on the monday papers give senora jimenez some time to collect herself it will be big news we made some announcements on local radio so theyre pushing for the story and ive a feeling that canal sur are already sniffing around the jefatura im going to mount some surveillance on marisa moreno cristina ferrera told me about her said tirado so you think the russians will make contact can you spare any manpower for the surveillance i thought you might ask me that he said look javier youve got a good theory about why the boy was taken but i cant give up on all other lines of inquiry just yet if theyd made contact and we were in negotiations then that would be different but ive got to find this guy who assaulted her near the plaza del pumarejo and according to her sister appeared later at her house i havent started on her business associates and i havent even looked at the enemies of raul jimenez and it is his son were talking about i never knew the guy but ive heard he wasnt everybodys friend you know what they say about revenge still close to c at pm falcon pulled away from the airport with the faint smell of jet fuel coming through the aircon it made him think of escape his palms were sweaty yes he wouldnt mind escaping now he tried to think of things to say to consuelo still nothing believable from the heart came to him that thoroughfare seemed to be blocked off barricaded with guilt cars flashed past him on the motorway hed slowed to just sixty kilometres per hour his reluctance for the next scene subconsciously finding its way to his foot he crossed the ring road the barrio de santa clara was just there an enclosed nest of wealth surrounded by industrial zones and the drug dens of poligono san pablo he parked rang the bell at the gate the front door opened a silhouette appeared he walked into her arms like an impostor felt her warm breath on his fraudulent neck some wetness touched his cheating cheek he held her she clung to him tightly he patted her back because hed been told that it reminded everyone of the comforting memory of their mothers beating heart from the womb we have to talk said falcon lets go upstairs she said theyre all in the living room shed set up a television in the bedroom there was a dent at the foot of the bed where shed been sitting taking time out from other people and watching the cctv footage it hasnt been on the news yet has it asked falcon not yet theyve kept it out of the press too once we saw this she said and pressed the remote black and white the same as the noir films that had drawn him to police work in the beginning but this was grey and uninteresting the camera static at a dull angle from above the flat glass of the sports goods shop was visible on one side the tiled floor was matt empty and then suddenly full of two darkhaired men one in a longsleeved shirt the other in a polo shirt both carrying other clothing they stopped looked and moved off away from the camera what about the other angle thats coming there they were again but caps on now heads down jackets on too hands buried in pockets moving away from the shop they know what theyre doing said falcon thats how they look in all the other footage said consuelo they only took their hats and jackets off to check us out in the shop what about footage from outside the stadium its coming she said its all been laid down on this tape anything from the people serving in the sevilla futbol club shop nothing the shop was full and busy they didnt even see dario said consuelo this is the confirmation of what cristina found out from the couple in their apartment on avenida de eduardo dato it was over in a fraction of a second rewind play rewind play rewind freeze frame consuelo circled the three figures in the background of the screen dario is wearing a scarf the guy on the right is carrying the football boots theyre the same men picked up by cctv in the nervion plaza jackets baseball caps thats all theyve got outside the shopping centre he sat down with her on the end of the bed leaned forward elbows on knees hands in prayer over his nose she rewound the tape played the footage again hoping that his police brain would pick something out that she hadnt herself talk me through your shopping trip he said turning off the television i want to know every centimetre and second of what you did from the moment we finished that call i made to you from the airport this morning every detail every minuscule unimportant detail that stuck in your brain every phone call you made and received youre never off that phone these days the reception isnt always good in these shopping centres you probably had to walk around what did you see i want you to talk without interruption falcon locked the bedroom door turned the lights off leaving just a bedside lamp glowing in the corner he took out his notebook consuelo started with the heartbreaking moment that had lodged itself in her chest when dario had asked her do you still love me now that javi is with us falcon couldnt bear to look up he nodded when he heard her reply she looked out of the dark window at their reflection with the lamp almost a cosy scene he let her talk only every so often did he break in to coax out more detail from her just so that her brain didnt get lazy and glide over what appeared to be unimportant he wanted the whole thing to play like a movie in her mind he wanted to see what her camera saw she took him through the moment she first saw the two men both spanish id say in their twenties one thick set conventional hair side parted eyebrows sliding off the side of his face nose a little fat as if he might have broken it clean shaven good teeth the other thin long hair two lines running down from his cheekbones to his jaw forehead creased how did you see his forehead if he had long hair he wore it tucked behind his ears what shirt was he wearing he was in the longsleeved shirt dark blue he wore it untucked the thickset guy had a lacoste shirt on the little crocodile dark green feet i cant see their feet in their hands the jackets yes i remember thinking jackets on a day like this the car computer said it was c when we went into the underground car park colour dark i cant say more than that he played the footage again he watched it on his hands and knees face close up to the screen she sat behind him on the bed he froze the frame just as the three figures came out of the shop theyll work on that shot get it sharp and publish it in the press he said then well interview all these people standing around but who are these guys she asked joining him on her knees tapping the screen they turned to each other and she saw it straight away in the light coming from the trembling image you know something she said blinking what do you know javier he couldnt bear to be so close to her he got to his feet she came up with him you dont know these men do you she asked you cant know them how can you know them i dont know them he said but i do know that my work is responsible your work how can your work be responsible you do your work you therefore are responsible how she asked he told her about his meetings with marisa moreno and why she was of interest to him the finding of the disks in the dead russian mafiosos briefcase the intensifying of his interrogations of marisa the phone calls the phone call hed had just before hed seen her last night so these people are watching you she said which means theyve been watching my house me my children thats possible you knew that she said and turned away from him to look out of the black window the lamp and the two of them reflected back to her but now transformed in her mind to a scene of gross betrayal ive been threatened before he said its a classic scare tactic a delaying tactic its done to slow me down to distract well this is a major fucking distraction she said turning on him my son she stopped something else occurring to her they did the same thing four years ago she said i dont know how i could have forgotten that because how could i forget that she walked away from him and turned back like a lawyer it was one of the reasons i broke it off with you four years ago she said the photograph the red cross on the photograph she said the red marker pen that crossed out my family people coming into my home leaving the television on and crossing out my family that was one of the reasons i couldnt carry on with you the last time how am i supposed to live with that you shouldnt have to said falcon they were russians too she said eyes fierce mouth stretched tight across her teeth they were but a different group the two men who sanctioned that are now dead who killed them she asked finding herself livid now all logic gone the stress of the day suddenly releasing itself into her veins her heart thundering in her chest or doesnt it matter who killed who people kill each other all the fucking time thats who you deal with javier killers they are your meat and drink this isnt a good idea he said i should go she was on him in a flash hitting him with both her fists high on his chest knocking him back against the wall you brought those people into my house the last time she said and now just as ive let you back into my into everything theyre back he grabbed her wrists she tore them out of his hands pummelled him about the head and shoulders until he managed to get hold of them again he pulled her to him the most important thing for you to understand consuelo he said looking into her livid face is that none of this is your fault that turned something in her switched something off he didnt like it the passion disappeared her blue eyes turned to ice she pushed herself away from him eased herself out of his slackening grip backed away into the centre of the room folded her arms i dont want to see you again she said i dont want your world in mine ever again you are responsible for darios abduction and i cannot forgive you even if you bring him back to me tomorrow you will never be forgiven for what you have done i want you to leave and i dont want you ever to come back she turned her back on him he could see its tense muscularity under the light top and could find no words to soften it and he realized what this was all about she was punishing herself she held herself completely responsible she had taken her eye off dario for the sake of some stupid phone call from an idiot estate agent trying to sell her something she didnt want and that was why hed been kidnapped and no amount of his taking the blame on to himself was going to change that he unlocked the door left the room went down the stairs and out into the suffocating night full of the uneasy susurrating of the trees and the low distant threat of the city grinding out its future cristina ferrera started at the appearance of falcon in the frame of the drivers window you told her she said seeing it in his face he looked off down calle hiniesta and nodded then im glad i didnt call she said whats happened nothing the lights on but im not convinced shes there she got out of the car they looked up at the apartment light shone on to the roof terrace illuminating the plant life growing around it i got here around eleven thirty and i havent seen anything move have you looked at the studio its in darkness lets call her he said and punched the number into his mobile no answer ring the bell asked ferrera they crossed the square in front of santa isabel past the bars on calle vergara which at am were now shut falcon pressed the buzzer ferrera stood back in the street i can hear it buzzing she said nobody home or too drunk dead to the world you didnt leave the lights on when you took her back home and put her to bed no saturday night she didnt look like she was going anywhere lets take a look at the studio he said when did you last check it about half an hour ago they headed down calle bustos tavera and found the arched entrance in profound darkness they turned on their pen torches and went into the courtyard where a hot breeze played lazily around the rusted remains of chassis and rejected white goods falcon led the way a dog barked some way off a torch beam picked up two small discs of reflected light the cat didnt move until it felt too exposed and then it turned and shrank away into the shadows the metal steps up to the studio shook under their weight the masked window had a crack in it he didnt remember he reached the landing in front of the door ferrera two steps below falcon pushed the door which gave way he put the pen torch in his mouth took out a packet of latex gloves and put them on this doesnt feel right he said marisas studio calle bustos tavera seville sunday th september hrs black and white again in the torch beam but this time the real noir liquid on the floor black as an oil spill with a grey flotsam of wood shavings the work benchs pylon standing in welled crude a sketch scratched across paper a bleached square on the lake of tar a foot grainy offwhite creased with grime stool on its side chrome legs the pitch lagoon sucking up to the silver pencils like a barge flotilla broken up in a harbour a foot his torch beam travelled back is that carved from wood the creases of toil and age meticulously etched falcon leaned in slapped the light switch two horror flashes two mind gasps the brain needing two attempts to transform the black and white to full technicolor then solid unwavering penetrative buzzing neon to show the full extent of the abattoir the blood had achieved terminal viscosity about half a metre from the door it wasnt a carving it was a human foot lying on its side sole straining against the encroaching tide marisas body was stretched out on the work bench the caramel of her mulatto skin now the only part of the picture that was grey her handless arm hung down straight as a drainpipe to the pool of blood she had no head the only detail which distinguished the meat as human were the bikini briefs which were soaked through the monster which had perpetrated this butchery was propped up on some blocks of wood further along the work bench the meat hook where it had hung empty above it the teeth of its chain were clogged with gore next to it stood the final horror the carving of the two men on either side of the young girl who now had a head eyes closed face slack coppery hair matted with blood marisa part of her own work the smell wafted out to them the metal of marisas blood the cess of her guts the sulphur of her incipient rot and on the back of this foetor came her terror wriggling like a live worm in the brain touching all the atavistic points twitching up the old fears of the unstoppable agony with only one possible exit falcon turned away with the slaughterhouse image burned into his mind the sweat stood off his face in beads the saliva thickened to an eggy slop in his mouth he sucked in the black night air thick as bitumen dont look he said too late ferrera had already seen enough for her to lose another rasher of her faith it had taken her off at the knees she slumped on the stairs holding on to the banister panting under her thin cotton blouse which now had the weight of a trench coat the torch hung slack on a loop of cord from her wrist its light wavered over the weeds and junk beneath them she stared mouth gaping until the torch light was completely still and only then did she regain her footing in the world the sweat stung falcons eyes as he called the communications centre in the jefatura and gave his report he hung up wiped his face with his hand and flung it out into the darkness he lowered himself down on to the top step reached out to cristina ferrera and squeezed her shoulder as much to comfort himself that there were still good people in this world she rested her face on his hand were all right she said are we said falcon because he was already thinking that the people who had done this were the same people whod taken dario the courtyard was frozen under the portable halogen falcon sat listing to one side on a broken chair the suited forensics did their work moving to and fro before him with their evidence bags and cases anibal parrado the instructing judge stood by looking down on the bristlecut head of the inspector jefe he spoke to his secretary in a low murmur falcons eyelids were heavy and his vision kept closing in on him ramirez came through the archway from calle bustos tavera carrying a black plastic bin liner we found this in some rubbish bins round the corner just off calle gerona he said which probably means that the forensics arent going to find very much up there still with latex gloves on he pulled out a white paper suit covered in dramatic slashes of blood which had already dried to a reddish brown match the blood to marisas first said falcon on automatic then send them down to the lab get what we can from the inside go home javier said ramirez get some sleep youre right he said i need more than sleep ramirez called up a patrol car stuck falcon in the back told the driver and his partner to see the inspector jefe all the way up to his bed falcon woke momentarily hanging like a drunkard between the two mens shoulders halfway up the stairs in his home then more oblivion the only place to be nikita sokolov had arrived at eleven oclock told marisa to get down to the street said they were going for a little walk she felt like hell not used to alcohol her stomach was sore and belching up cuba libre which filled the cavities of her face with the old sticky stink she puked in the toilet brushed her teeth slumped in the lift through the bars of the front door she saw his cigarette glowing from where he was leaning against the back wall of the church small wide dark horribly muscular and hairy with very pale white skin he revolted her they avoided the drinkers outside the bars he steered her by the elbow to the studio she stumbled over the cobbles in the darkness of the archway was nauseated by the shakiness of the metal stairway up to her studio she unlocked the door slapped on the light two flashes to bring her work to life she sat on the stool too weak to stand he stood in the doorway asked his questions his polo shirt was stretched tight over the muscles in his chest and shoulders dark patches under his armpits hair sprouted from the open collar of his shirt colossal quadriceps shrugged under his trousers shed been told nikita sokolov was a weightlifter before he got into slapping girls around she told him about the visits from the police the questions the stuff about the little boy what did they tell you about the little boy he wanted to hear what they knew everything she spoke her arms with nothing in them hung by her sides she couldnt seem to satisfy him she couldnt seem to find enough detail to make him believe her he told her to strip he went out on the landing to flick a cigarette into the courtyard pulling off her tshirt dropping her skirt left her exhausted she was still wearing the bikini briefs she could smell herself it wasnt nice the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs he blocked the doorway again and stepped quickly aside to let two men into the room panic seized her throat as she saw their white suits and hoods their masked faces blue latex gloves he nodded to her from the doorway or was it to them she had nothing in her legs now one of the men reached for the chain saw unhooked it checked its teeth and the chain oil he knew the work her tongue rattled in her head mouth dry as parchment more questions about what she had told them her answers no more than the clucks of a chicken beaking around in the dust more nodding from the doorway the one with the chain saw unravelled the flex plugged it in flicked off the safety ran the motor for a second the noise went through to her spine left her stomach quivering the other paper suit came for her turned her stretched her arm out on the work bench viced her head so that she had to watch the chain a blur coming down on her thin wrist had she given any names nothing came out of her throat she tried to shake her head the chain trembled above her skin she felt the arousal of the man holding her she lost control of her bladder no answer would save her now she shut her eyes wished shed talked to the little nun shoes off sweat in his shirt falcon came awake as if hed been defibrillated back into the world he hurt all the mental anguish had found its way into his muscles and skeleton time just after midday he showered no clarity from the cascade just vacillation between the two colossal problems which had landed on his shoulders in the last twentyfour hours he dressed in fresh clothes the patrolmen had taken the mobiles out of his pockets and turned them off so that he wouldnt be disturbed he sat on the edge of the bed and played them over each other in his hand action for the day of rest there was nothing to be done about yacoubs situation hed entered into a pact silence was the only game breakfast think about how to find dario resist the intrusion of all images of marisas terrible end sitting at a table underneath the gallery was pablo from the cni he had an empty coffee cup in front of him falcon had never seen him out of a suit he looked younger more approachable in his dark green polo shirt and white chinos although the scar running from his hairline to his left eyebrow demanded that he always be taken seriously out of his work clothes falcon could also see that the man was athletic and that his body hadnt been sculpted out of vanity but by repeated physical demands how did you get in asked falcon as they shook hands the patrolman at the door said pablo it took a direct order from comisario elvira youre under protection now it seems from who the russians id have thought what do you know about the russians after you asked me to look at those unidentified guys from the mafiosos disks we had a talk with our old friends at the organized crime intelligence centre in madrid said pablo another coffee pablo shook his head i dont think you came all this way to talk to me about the russians said falcon heading for the kitchen setting the percolator on the stove making toast the russians have given you a problem very close to your heart said pablo and that has an impact on my problem tell me about the russians vasili lukyanov was coming to seville to join forces with a fellow afghan war veteran called yuri donstov whos set up a successful heroinsmuggling operation between uzbekistan and europe he already understood the importance of reliable supply from his army service in afghanistan then he had to find a retail outlet which wouldnt offend anyone back in moscow he chose seville its thought that he lives in an apartment block in seville este but some say hes holed up in the poligono san pablo since the head of the russian mafia in spain fled to dubai after operation wasp in yuri donstov has begun to believe that he can control the whole of the iberian peninsula leonid revnik doesnt see it like that vasili lukyanov was being brought into yuri donstovs operation to run prostitution in seville cico think that donstov has also secured the services of another gangster with expertise in casinos yuri donstov it seems is gradually developing all the talent to run a successful criminal organization using seville as a base rather than taking on leonid revnik on his own territory in the costa del sol how old is this yuri donstov said falcon pouring olive oil on to his toast born his nickname is the monk which he has tattooed on his back beneath two angel wings and a crucifix he wears his head completely shaved and has a strong beard although that description is based on his gulag mug shot there is no recent photo of him he doesnt drink but he smokes upwards of sixty cigarettes a day what else he has only one kidney the other was damaged in a shooting incident and had to be removed the monk yuri donstov is a very religious man why seville este or the poligono san pablo theyre hardly upmarket he despises luxury a lot of the money he makes ends up going back to russia to finance various monasteries and churchbuilding programmes vicente cortes from the greco in the costa del sol didnt know about him said falcon why not seville is still not his area of expertise cortes is more concerned about leonid revnik and his righthand man viktor belenki who runs all their construction companies how long have you had this information about yuri donstov me since yesterday said pablo but these are all developments since the beginning of this year yuri donstov is a very quiet man nothing flamboyant about him any connection between him and lucrecio arenas from the banco omni not yet said pablo weve found no concrete link between yuri donstov and the bombing of th june nor with leonid revnik for that matter falcon sipped his coffee ate his toast now all we have is a further complication he said you dont know whether its yuri donstov or leonid revnik whos holding dario said pablo theyll tell you soon enough they said they wouldnt they said id never hear from them again said falcon and i dont like the lessons theyve given me so far yesterday i had a potential witness to a murder conspiracy and a woman who loved me now i have a dead witness a kidnapped boy and a woman who never wants to see me again the russians will call said pablo they have to did you have any luck identifying those men from vasili lukyanovs disks asked falcon as a matter of fact we did said pablo theyre businessmen the one having sex with marisas sister is juan valverde hes a madrileno and the chief executive officer of iit europe the one you spotted as an american is a consultant to iit personally appointed by cortland fallenbach his name is charles taggart two years ago he had to resign from his post as head of the fifth largest television church in america when some footage of him with three prostitutes appeared on the internet the fallen preacher said falcon an ideal recruit for the bornagain christian founders of iit the third man is antonio ramos he is on the board of directors of the horizonte group he is a civil engineer who was the late cesar benitos righthand man benito was the creative guy with the designs and presentation skills ramos got them built he now heads up the whole construction arm of horizonte was he in it from the beginning asked falcon didnt you go through horizontes offices and give them a clean bill of health we didnt but the barcelona police did and they found nothing said pablo if horizonte were in on the bombing conspiracy they kept it out of their offices falcon poured more coffee just as he seemed to be getting somewhere the new information presented more complications i know it doesnt help you make a clearcut case said pablo but at least youve got it more or less confirmed by the footage on vasili lukyanovs disks that the russians were somehow connected to the banco omni horizonte iit conspiracy and provided the violence for the seville bombing concentrate on that but which russians said falcon the disks were found on vasili lukyanov who stole them from leonid revnik but when was the footage of the men with the girls taken is there a date on it i dont know said pablo youve got the original disks in the jefatura was it before or after the seville bombing asked falcon that could be significant were yuri donstov and leonid revnik ever together as part of the same group before donstov broke away at say the time of operation wasp in thats not how it was explained to me you have no recent photographs of yuri donstov which probably means you dont know exactly what hes been doing said falcon is it significant that donstov was set up in seville where the bombing occurred who were lucrecio arenas and cesar benito in bed with yuri donstov or leonid revnik all right youve made your point said pablo youll have to leave it to the kidnappers they will make their demands theres a further complication because of the defections from revniks group to donstovs said falcon there are probably going to be members of each group who were responsible in some way for elements of the seville bombing and wanted to keep marisa quiet leonid revnik must be holding her sister margarita was having sex with the iit europe boss juan valverde on vasili lukyanovs disk right so there would have been contact between marisa and leonid revnik but what about any defections to yuri donstovs group before vasili lukyanov said falcon we have no idea whether lukyanov was the first given marisas terror and unwillingness to talk it wouldnt surprise me if she had been taking heat from both sides find margarita said pablo shrugging falcon checked him detected a flagging interest in his problems all right youve helped me pablo said falcon youve given me enough to go on so what do you really want to see me about the notes of your meeting with mi and so were sent to me yesterday said pablo id already heard about the kidnapping so i held off until today very thoughtful of you said falcon i realize that youre pledging your support to yacoub which is what i asked you to do its just that youre doing it blindly said pablo all you know is what hes told you that the gicm have recruited his son why would he lie about that you also know that yacoub would never do anything that might result in a family member being harmed or arrested said pablo this may mean hell want to put you off the scent what we can do is prevent that through corroboration of information and a broader view of the intelligence picture but you have to get us started you have to tell us what you know about yacoubs actions or intentions but that would endanger yacoub just out of interest said pablo what did yacoub tell you about the one piece of information he was prepared to give away the identity of mustafa barakat no more than i told the british said falcon hes a family friend he has a carpet business and tourist shops in fes and this is what yacoub told you to say its the information he gave me you said hed lived in fes all his life a lot has happened pablo i dont remember everything perfectly you probably dont know this but before i came back to the cni in madrid i ran agents in the maghreb for more than ten years im part of an enormous north african intelligence community said pablo if you give me a name like mustafa barakat i have access to all my friends archives as well as my own i put that name straight across to my moroccan colleagues who dont just look at their files but because they understand the complex nature of families in their country they get down on the ground as well they feed their informers into the termites nest of the medina thats a lot of manpower i can draw on and what did they find that there are very close ties between the barakat and diouri families since there have been thirtysix marriages between the families which have produced one hundred and seventeen children sixtyfour with the name diouri and fiftytwo with the name barakat eight of those barakats are called mustafa two of them are interesting because they were both born in the late s the other six are either too old or too young to be the barakat staying at yacoubs house of those two remaining mustafas one went into the family carpet business during the seventies and never left morocco but the other had a much more interesting life in he went to a madrassa a religious school in jeddah for three years from there he went to pakistan where nothing more was heard about him until he resurfaced in morocco in the word on the street is that he spent quite a few of those years in afghanistan now this is where theres a bit of confusion because in mustafa barakat died in a car accident on a steep road up in the rif mountains on his way back from chefchaouen where the family had opened a small hotel and tourist shop it was sad because hed only just settled back in his own country and which mustafa barakat are we talking about asked falcon thats where it gets confusing the interesting thing is after the accident on the road from chefchaouen the other mustafa barakat still ran the family carpet business tourist shops and hotels but having never left the country before he suddenly started an importexport business he would fly to pakistan to buy carpets since the afghan war all carpets in that area of afghanistan tajikistan uzbekistan even the eastern part of iran come to pakistan and are exported as pakistani carpets these carpets which he brought back from pakistan were then reexported to countries like france germany holland and the uk you think there was a switch there are no post mortems performed out there in the rif presumably the mustafa barakat whod gone to the madrassa in jeddah had also made the pilgrimage to mecca and was alhadji mustafa barakat whod only just started travelling in did the haj that same year said pablo detail is something were good at in the intelligence service so before you ask no dental records anything else that might help us identify which mustafa barakat were dealing with it would be nice if the mujahideen kept army records and let us have a look at them it would be better to have some dna a wave of paranoia swept through falcon he stared into pablos face like a poker player looking for tells is this true is this just a construct to get me back on side why would yacoub have given such a thing away exposing a family member to such scrutiny dont cut yourself off from that level of intelligence said pablo without at least giving it a second thought in the end consuelo had taken the sleeping pills left by the doctor shed watched the clock work its way round to am with her mind unable to hold steady on any logical path she was caught in triangular thinking flitting between dario herself and javier but unable to concentrate on any one of them even with her sister and her two other sons in the house she felt a terrible loneliness in between the bouts of rage that periodically washed over her she reluctantly identified a need for the one person shed banished from her sight for ever almost as soon as this came to her she was consumed by hatred for him then despair would crash in and she would sob at the thought of her little boy lost in the dark terrified and alone it was exhausting emotionally draining but the mind would not shut down and let her drift into sleep so she took the pills three instead of two she woke up at two in the afternoon with her head and mouth full of cotton wool feeling as if shed been embalmed the sleep had weakened her and she couldnt stand in the shower she sat and let the water fall on her pitiful shoulders she sobbed and raged all over again she drank water and her strength slowly returned she dressed went downstairs everybody looked at her she read their faces victims were always the stars of their own dramas and the supporting cast had nothing to offer this was sunday sitting with her arms folded waiting for the phone to ring las tres mil viviendas seville monday th september hrs his name was roque barba but he was known to everybody in the rundown deadend barrio of las tres mil viviendas as el pulmon because he only had one lung hed lost the other one two months after his seventeenth birthday at a corrida in a small village in the east of andalucia when he was still a novillero hed liked the look of his second bull of the afternoon and told the picador not to dig too deep with the lance because he wanted to show the crowd what he could do it was right at the beginning of the faena and the bull still had his head up el pulmon had two problems he wasnt quite tall enough and the bull had a little hook from right to left which he hadnt seen this meant that during the first pass the bulls horn instead of flashing past his chest caught him under the armpit and the next thing he knew he was up in the air there was no pain no sound life slowed down the crowd and the arena came to him in sickly waves as the bulls immensely powerful neck reared up and then shook him from side to side then he hit the deck felt the sand grind into his face and heard his collar bone crack in his ear the bulls horn broke two ribs and cracked another two it tore the lung apart and drove splinters of bone close to the heart the surgeons removed the ragged lung that night that was the end of his career as a torero not because he only had one lung the other expanded to compensate but he could no longer raise his left arm above shoulder height now he sat on the fourth floor of one of the many brutalized tower blocks in las tres mil viviendas there was a gun on the table which he had just finished cleaning hed bought it last week until then hed only ever used a blade he still had the knife which he carried in a springloaded mechanism attached to the underside of an ornately tooled leather wrist strap on his right forearm hed bought the gun for two reasons the highquality product hed started selling a few months ago had brought him a lot more clients which meant that he was now handling more money on a regular basis only he knew about this and of course his girlfriend julia who was asleep in the bedroom but el pulmon knew that people loved to talk and in las tres mil they loved to talk about the one commodity that was in short supply money hence the gun although that wasnt the full story the gun wasnt needed to control any of his clients they knew he had balls anybody who was prepared to get into a confined space with a halfton bull was not lacking in that department and he still had the reflexes no the gun had become necessary because although he was now receiving highquality product from the russians he hadnt stopped selling the gear that he was getting from the italians in fact hed started cutting the one with the other so not only was there the potential for trouble from outsiders interested in money but there was also an element of unpredictability in his suppliers now when he handed over his for the week he was never quite sure whether he was going to be given another package to sell or find himself hanging out of the window upside down with a fourfloor drop beneath him it had already happened once the weightlifter the one called nikita had dropped by to remind him that his supply was exclusive and if he didnt like the arrangement theyd install their own dealer four floors to a concrete pavement had been nikitas way of trying to make him see reason he hadnt enjoyed the adrenaline rush fucking russians this had never been a friendly business dealing in death was never going to be that but the italians spoke his language and he didnt know how long the russian product was going to last so he was going to play this tricky game until things got a little clearer and thats why he was tooled up his girlfriend sighed in her sleep he shut the bedroom door and looked around the living room he moved the table to a more central position between the window and the wall on which hung an oblong mirror with a screwdriver he put a fivecentimetre screw in the centre of the table he eased the safety off the gun and positioned it so that the trigger rested against the screw and the barrel pointed to the right of the mirror he inserted another couple of screws to maintain the line of the barrel he placed a copy of toros magazine over the handgun he put a chair by the table which when he sat on it would leave his good right arm free and his poor left arm close to the gun he sat and checked the view he got from the mirror it gave him angles on the two corners of the room behind him he dropped the blinds on the window shut out the sunlight and the view of the busy carretera de su eminencia he didnt bother with any other chairs the supplier with his cuban translator never sat down they did smoke even though they knew he didnt like it he was the drug dealer with one lung who didnt smoke didnt drink and didnt do drugs el pulmon breathed in slowly the way hed always done to control his fear ramirez was standing at the window in falcons office looking out ferrera was at her computer ive had the three mystery men in the russians disks identified said falcon the guy with margarita is juan valverde the boss of iit europe in madrid the american is charles taggart an extv preacher whos an iit consultant reporting back to the owner cortland fallenbach the last guy is antonio ramos who is an engineer and the new director of horizontes construction division i want you to find out where those three men are because i want to talk to them as soon as possible cristina ferrera nodded falcon went through to join ramirez in his office gave him the intelligence hed learned from pablo about the renegade russian gang set up by yuri donstov in seville ramirez said hed put detectives serrano and baena on a doortodoor starting in calle garlopa in seville este which was the address theyd found in the gps of vasili lukyanovs range rover they moved on to other matters the blood on both those paper suits we found in the rubbish bins on calle feria has been confirmed as a perfect match to marisa moreno said ramirez anything on the inside of them asked falcon both the hoods contained hairs and weve picked up some sweat patches from the suits said ramirez one of them even had a semen deposit sweat patches semen was he naked underneath this suit not if he stripped it off walked round the corner to calle gerona and stuck it in the bin said ramirez but it was a hot night maybe they had a car gangsters driving around in their underpants said falcon making for the door where are you going asked ramirez youve only just got here to talk to esteban calderon the judge on the marisa moreno case is going to want to see us at some stage said ramirez its the new guy anibal parrado hes all right hows consuelo holding up shes not all right said falcon were not all right so you told her about marisa and the threatening phone calls and she remembered those russians breaking into her house four years ago putting a red cross over a family photograph im sorry said ramirez i wasnt thinking when i told you about the semen deposit thats not a nice thing to know i mean given darios situation i have to know said falcon give me a call when you get the full forensics lets get the dna on the semen deposit to vicente cortes and martin diaz they can see if it matches dna on the greco and cico databases from any russians theyve had in custody and get everybody in the squad to remember that this is all connected the seville bombing the murder of ines the cutting up of marisa and the kidnapping of dario the only problem said ramirez fingers exploding up into the air is evidence today was delivery day but he wasnt sure when the russian was going to turn up all he knew was that he had four hundred grams of italian left which wasnt going to satisfy those of his clients who were already coming out of their dens all twitchy and gabbling with the first sweats and that clawing and gnawing in the blood theyd be looking for his boys on the streets the sign that the russian product had arrived and that all would soon be well el pulmon checked on julia still asleep should he wake her get her up and out before the guys came he shrugged it seemed a shame softly he closed the door she could sleep all day that one he had to keep an eye on her though make sure she wasnt sampling the product he sat down breathed slowly got the fear crouched down low in his stomach he was always scared these days what with the money getting bigger and these russians being so unreadable maybe he should wake julia keep calm just the nerves talking keep the fear he knew he needed the fear but it had to be where he wanted it low in the stomach not all up his throat and over his head hed seen that with novilleros facing their first fullsize bull the fear that paralysed and got you killed the knock came at pm first man in was the cuban translator behind him was the weightlifter head shaved with just a dusting of black showing through the white skin nose slightly flattened one cheekbone with a red scar he was smaller than el pulmon but twice his width his arms were very hairy and were covered in indiscernible tattoos his legs moved as if he had animals up his trousers el pulmon led them into the room felt their eyes searching his back took his seat by the table the cuban stood to the left of the mirror the weightlifter kept his back to the wall moved to the right of the mirror and had a good long look around with his dark deepset eyes el pulmon didnt like it he knew now that the russian was carrying a gun in the small of his back he wished hed woken julia he had the roll of money in his shirt but he didnt take it out he could feel some questions backed up against the wall over there he wants to know if youre still buying from the italians asked the cuban no i told you id stopped take a look said the cuban giving him a twist of silver foil el pulmon opened it up saw the white powder knew that he was in trouble he shrugged where did you get this he asked we bought it from one of your clients said the cuban paid eighty euros for it i dont know what the problem is its our product cut with the italian shit you told us youd stopped moving i still have some italian product left i didnt want to just throw it away you buy from the italians said the weightlifter his first words in rough accented spanish i didnt know you spoke spanish said el pulmon taking the opportunity for a bit of distraction he knows youre still buying from them said the cuban how does he know that one of your clients told us which one asked el pulmon theyre all junkies out there theyll do and say anything for a fix the flamenco singer carlos puerta is hardly reliable said el pulmon hes been looking to fuck me up since his girlfriend moved in with me thats why we kept an eye on your place to see the italians for ourselves said the cuban whod moved to the window and was peering through the blinds el pulmon looked at the russian and kept an eye on the cuban through the mirror we tell you the last time said the weightlifter the cuban came away from the window he had a large hunting knife in his hand he went to grab el pulmon by the hair el pulmon leaned forward and slapped the copy of toros the roar of the gunshot filled the room and el pulmons blade sprang into his hand he kept low and swung round driving the narrow length of steel into the cubans left side he heard nothing with the gunshot ringing in his ears but he felt the cubans body stiffen as he drove the blade in he grabbed the cubans right wrist with the hunting knife in it and whirled the man round so that he ended up between el pulmon and the weightlifter who was now on the floor lying on his back arm extended gun in hand another headringing bang inside the four hard walls of the apartment and the cubans rigid body leapt and jerked el pulmon forced him backwards on to another spinerupturing explosion he dropped his shoulder and shoved the cuban at the russian who grunted under the weight and el pulmon still with his blade was out of the door down the stairs and on the other side of the garages before he remembered julia asleep in the bedroom there was a taxi waiting in the prison car park engine running aircon roaring cabbie asleep head thrown back mouth open as falcon went up the path to the prison reception he took a call on his mobile from his old detective friend in madrid calling him about the apartment in la latina where hed met yacoub its not privately owned he said the whole block belongs to the middle east european investment corporation based in dubai was that apartment rented out to anyone its one of three in the block thats empty falcon hung up found alicia with her serene white face red lipstick under a jetblack bob waiting patiently in the reception area he greeted her they kissed she squeezed his shoulder happy to hear his voice he told her about her taxi ive been sitting here for twenty minutes she said annoyed whats the matter with these people hes a taxi driver from seville said falcon its their nature how are you she asked complicated he said that seems to be the default setting for people our age she said falcon told her that consuelos youngest son had been abducted and the effect on their relationship alicia was shocked said shed call her straight away she must be going crazy dont speak to her on my behalf said falcon of course not he walked her to her cab the heat cracked down on their heads he opened the cab door for her showed the cabbie his police card pointed at his meter with a long hard stare the cabbie zeroed it pulled away when the guards first brought calderon into the room made available to them by the prison governor he looked so shattered falcon thought he might send him straight back to his cell the guards got him seated and left the room calderon ransacked his pockets for cigarettes lit up sucked in a huge drag swayed in his chair what brings you here javier he asked are you all right esteban you look bedraggled crazy fucked up said calderon take your pick im all of them you know i hadnt really understood it before but theres nowhere to hide in psycho you wouldnt call it therapy exactly would you its more like extraction psychoextraction yanking rotten memories from the brain i just saw alicia in the car park she doesnt give much away that one said calderon i reckon psychoanalysis is no different to poker except that nobody knows what cards they have did she say anything interesting nothing about you shes very discreet she didnt even tell me why she was here said falcon maybe you shouldnt look at it as extraction esteban you cant extract memories nor can you hide from them without consequences you just illuminate them thanks for that javier said calderon dismissively ill see if that makes it any less painful doctora aguado asked me what i wanted from our sessions i said i wanted to know if id killed ines its interesting shes no different to a lawyer making a case she starts with a premise esteban calderon hates women me can you believe it then she starts wheedling the usual shit out of me about how i despise my stupid mother and how i fucked up a girlfriend who didnt like my poems your poems i wanted to be a writer javier he said holding up his hand its all a long time ago and im not going into it what are you doing here were getting somewhere on iness murder said falcon but weve also hit a brick wall come on javier dont talk shit to me ive been working on marisa that sounds like the wettowel treatment it probably was something like that for her and shes been getting it from all sides said falcon and went on to tell him about finding the footage of margarita the threatening phone calls and the kidnapping of dario you keep your inner turmoil better hidden than i do javier practice said falcon anyway i sent cristina ferrera to talk to marisa and while intoxicated she pretty well admitted that shed been coerced to start a relationship with you by whom the people holding her sister a russian mafia group calderon smoked intensely staring at the floor what i need to know from you esteban is how you met marisa said falcon who effected that introduction silence for a moment while calderon leaned back in his chair eyes narrowed shes dead isnt she he said youve come to me because she cant tell you any more she was murdered last night said falcon im sorry esteban calderon leaned across the table looking up into falcons head what are you sorry about javier he asked tapping his own chest are you sorry for me because you think i loved her and she was just fucking me under orders im sorry because she was a woman in an impossible position under immense strain whose only thought was for the safety of her own sister said falcon thats why she didnt talk to us a singular but very compelling reason that did something to calderons equilibrium he even wobbled in his chair and had to anchor himself with his hands flat on the table emotion rose in his chest and maybe it was because this conversation had come hard on the heels of his session with alicia aguado that he managed to see beyond his own selfinterest and realize that sitting before him was a man with a completely different moral centre to his own youve forgiven her havent you javier he said you now know that marisa was in some way involved in iness murder and yet it would be very helpful if you could remember who introduced you to marisa said falcon does this mean said calderon blinking back the tears that i didnt do it it means that cristina ferrera thought that marisa who was drunk at the time had been coerced into consorting with you said falcon marisa never admitted that it was the russians whod forced her we have no signed statement and no recording of the conversation theres no new evidence we have however lost marisa her words will never be heard we have to go back to an earlier level of involvement which means finding out how she met you were you introduced falcon could see quite clearly that calderon did remember he was staring at a point above falcons head and running his thumbnail up and down between his front teeth weighing something up and whatever it was it had weight it was at a garden party at the duchess of albas house said calderon marisa was introduced to me by my cousin your cousin that is the son of the juez decano de sevilla said calderon alejandro spinola he works in the mayors office outskirts of seville monday th september hrs on the way back from the prison falcon got the call two officers from the narcotics squad in las tres mil just called in a double murder in the apartment of a drug dealer called roque barba also known as el pulmon said the operator a cuban male called miguel estevez found in the living room shot twice in the back and stabbed in the side and a spanish female julia valdes believed to be el pulmons girlfriend found in the bedroom shot in the face falcon came off the motorway and on to the ring road he took the exit before the golf club and joined the carretera de su eminencia a road hed always thought ridiculously named given that it enclosed one of the grimmest public housing projects in seville in the s and s the municipality had lured gypsies from the centre of town out to this development of residential blocks on the edge of civilization years of poverty lack of community and selfrespect had transformed a halfhearted attempt at social engineering into a neighbourhood of drugs murder theft and vandalism this did not mean that the barrio was without soul some of the greatest flamenco voices came from here and quite a few of them had done time in the prison hed just come from it was more that the soul was not evident from the bare treeless landscape the grimy concrete blocks the cheap clothes hanging out to dry on metal bars over the windows and landings the rubbish collecting in the basements and stairwells the graffiti and the air of complete desolation that told anyone who was in any doubt that these were forgotten people in a place that had fallen off the back of the town halls mind the operator in the jefatura hadnt bothered with an address it was just a question of cruising around looking for the crowd of people the collection of police cars and the green dayglo ambulances which he soon found at the foot of an eightstorey block the patrolmen were nervous some of the people gathered around the metal security cage at the entrance of the block looked more desperate than the usual citizens of las tres mil some of them were crouched low on the grassless earth arms wrapped round their shins holding on to themselves and shaking the name of el pulmon reached his ears these were his clients and theyd just lost their supply a patrolman told him to watch his step going up there were blood drips circled in yellow on a number of steps going up to the fourth floor the stink of rubbish followed him no lift the apartment was full of the usual crimescene personnel the bodies were still in position falcon shook hands with the medico forense and the instructing judge anibal parrado subinspector emilio perez with his dark good looks of a thirties matinee idol and total devotion to detail was running the investigation they talked falcon through the scene were not sure of the sequence of events but were assuming that the gun found on the floor by the window was secured to the table by those screws it has been fired only once and the blood spatter on the wall beneath the mirror would suggest that were looking for a wounded man there is no other firearm in the apartment a hunting knife was found close to the cubans body which had not been used from the entry wounds the ballistics guys think that the same gun that killed miguel estevez also killed julia valdes in the adjacent room obviously given that two shots killed the victims they were not killed by the gun found on the floor which they think is of a different calibre anyway they will confirm that when they get the bullets out of the two victims an initial inspection of the gunshot wounds to miguel estevez suggests that he was shot by someone lying on the floor the body seems to have fallen on to the shooter which would suggest that someone was using him as a shield and pushed him back on to the killer judging by the blood drips on the threshold of the bedroom it is believed that the girl was shot from there by the wounded man over the medico forenses shoulder falcon could see the girls ruined face her upper body was slumped against the wall which was covered with blood and cerebral matter her neck was crooked over the low bedhead while her left hand was flung out towards the window her other hand had come to rest between her splayed legs but with the palm upwards it indicated the awkwardness of sudden death rather than the demureness of a final modesty she was naked but with her right leg caught up in the twisted sheet the cameo spoke of fear panic paralysis and finally violent death the blood drips leave the apartment and go down the stairs to the pavement where they disappear we assume the shooter got into a car and the stab wound to estevez the narcs say that el pulmon favoured a blade said perez and it looks as if hes taken it with him falcon inspected the gun on the floor the screws in the table the bullfight magazine on the floor in front of the mirror there are clear prints on the gun said jorge appearing from under the table with his custommade inspection glasses on weve got el pulmons prints on file from previous drug arrests said perez we have to assume that this gun did not belong to the cuban miguel estevez two men with guns are no match for a single man with a blade which means said falcon that this was the gun secured to the table and that el pulmon was expecting trouble he must have bought that gun recently said one of the narcs he was always a knife man before you know he was an exbullfighter have you seen this guy before falcon asked the narc pointing at estevez no but things have been changing around here the product is different to what it was last year we still havent been able to work out where the packages are coming from have you come across any russians he shook his head were you the one who found the bodies asked falcon me and my partner said the narc any idea what time this happened the guy upstairs said he heard the first gunshot at about one oclock said the narc did he call in the shooting nobody calls in a shooting in las tres mil said the narc what were you doing here asked falcon did somebody send you at a quarter past one we got a call from inspector jefe tirado asking us to find a junkie called carlos puerta who he wanted to question if we found him we were to call tirado and hed come down here did you find him hes downstairs with my partner waiting for the inspector jefe tell me when tirado gets here two of falcons young detectives serrano and baena appeared ready to do some doortodoor i want you and your partner to work with my two detectives here said falcon to the narcotics agent i want some ideas about where were going to find el pulmon before somebody else gets to him consuelo paced the long glass doors of her living room the aircon was too chill to sit for long a patrolman was slumped in the shade of the umbrella on the other side of the pool she thought he might be sleeping under his mirrored sunglasses his arm hung limply down by the side of his chair a sound technician whod come in to set up some professional recording equipment rather than the temporary stuff inspector jefe tirado had left on saturday evening was sitting in the kitchen he was talking to the family liaison officer there was another patrolman at the front door shed told him to come in from the heat he stared morosely out of the glass panel of the front door shed phoned her restaurant manager told him to contact the estate agents she was currently dealing with to ask them not to call until further notice shed taken only one call from alicia aguado shed yanked the wire out of her mobile which was connected to the recording equipment and taken the call upstairs in her bedroom alicia wouldnt say it but consuelo knew that the only reason she could be calling was that shed heard from javier the press and tv still had not been informed and the radio stations whod been involved in the initial stages had been asked to keep quiet for the moment inspector jefe tirado didnt want a media circus or to have to deal with hoaxers until thered been contact from the kidnappers or it became clear that there would be none aguados call had helped consuelo had started by venting her bile against javier and aguado had heard her out to the bitter end before asking her what had actually happened it was good for consuelo to talk to someone who listened it had calmed her down she began to get some perspective on her anger blame and guilt were natural rage was inevitable the call did not cure her of her animosity towards falcon or prevent her from replaying that moment when shed lost sight of dario over and over in her mind but it had allowed some resolve to harden inside her she felt stronger less jittery her mood swings from despair to fury were not so violent the tears still came but with some warning after the call consuelo had sent her other two sons away with her sister she didnt want the boys caught up in such an oppressive and potentially volatile atmosphere with everybody staring at the phone willing it to ring she didnt want them to see her hope and despair the possible joy and the probable disappointment despite alicias call she knew her emotions would be uncontrollable because she still felt exposed upstairs she had a small study next to her bedroom a chair a desk a laptop nothing more alicia aguado had encouraged her to pass the time writing her thoughts and feelings down to get them out of herself where they could be seen she closed the blinds and sat there in the dim light tried to purge her brain of all the unimportant white noise she booted up the computer and was automatically linked to the internet she saw she had new mail this address was different to the one in the restaurant and it was one only used by her family and close friends there was one new message sent today at entitled dario just seeing the name made her heart lift and her stomach cold the sender was someone called manolo gordo she knew no one of that name her hand trembled as she opened it if you want to see your son again call do not tell the police do not try to record the call use your mobile outside the house delete this email it will not help you find your son she read it over and over not many people knew this email address but her sons did it gave her hope an excitement gripped her contact had been made she looked over her shoulder as if she should be hiding this from someone she put the email in her spam folder closed down the computer and thought about how she was going to make this call inspector jefe tirado is waiting for you outside said baena falcon trotted down the stairs being careful to avoid the yellowcircled blood drips there was no shade outside and they had to stand in the stink of piss and rubbish in the stairwell whos this guy carlos puerta asked falcon hes the one who assaulted senora jimenez near the plaza del pumarejo back in june and was seen later snooping around her house by senora jimenezs sister said tirado i spent the morning tracking him down his friends in the plaza del pumarejo told me he was a junkie so i asked the narcs to help me out do you mind if i listen in no problem said tirado who beckoned to the narc he doesnt look much now does he but hes got a good voice as soon as i saw him i recognized him five years ago he cut an album made some money got fucked up failed an audition with eva hierbabuena to go to london and this is the state hes in now the officer pushed carlos puerta towards the apartment block he shuffled forward with little jittery steps like a comic actor his shoulderlength hair had seen neither water nor brush for a good six weeks it was bookthick matted and coated in dust from the wrecked building where hed been found he had a problem with his left arm which looked wasted the hand swollen his tshirt had white stencilling which had faded into the oblivion of the background material falcon could just make out that it was from the flamenco biennale of he was with a woman said tirado she was so emaciated the narcs called an ambulance for her tirado introduced himself and falcon puertas lean pockmarked face was a mass of tics he begged for a cigarette they found him one sat him down on a couple of breezeblocks you recognize this woman asked tirado holding a shot of consuelo in front of his face puerta peered from under black eyebrows angled sharply into his nose an eyelid fluttered at the smoke trickling up his face he shook his head you know her name carlos i dont think so said puerta who touched his chest and wheezed a laugh not my type you also know where she lives all the people i know live in las tres mil and she doesnt look like any of them said puerta not with those earrings that necklace that hair and makeup if she appeared like that in my world shed get picked clean you met her in the plaza del pumarejo said tirado she runs a restaurant near there you know it i dont eat in restaurants you also know about her husband raul jimenez he was murdered i know a few people whove been killed some more whove overdosed but i cant remember their names did he run a record label weve got witnesses who said you assaulted consuelo jimenez one night last june in a street just off the plaza del pumarejo what sort of witnesses asked puerta dredging up some derision if youre talking about those cretins in the plaza theyd tell you anything for a litre of don simon weve got another witness not a cretin this womans sister who saw you snooping around consuelo jimenezs house in santa clara the day after you assaulted her said tirado if you can tell me what that was all about i wont take you down to the jefatura and stick you in a cell until your last fix wears off im not sure what you mean he said listening intently senora jimenez doesnt want to press charges for the assault or for trespassing said tirado but if youve had anything to do with the abduction of her eightyearold son that got his full attention his head started shaking not in denial but with some sort of heroininduced tremor im a junkie he said so i recognize vulnerable people and i try to get money out of them i knew that woman and her story shes famous been all over the news id seen her around i thought there was something unstable about her then she turned up in the plaza del pumarejo one night a bit dazed possibly drunk and i bummed some money off her what were you doing around her house the day after looking for her again see if i could get something more out of her said puerta thats what junkies are like and i can tell you that i havent seen her since why didnt you keep after her asked tirado its a long way out to santa clara and i found some money closer to home tirado and falcon moved away from him to confer i think hes telling the truth said tirado it fits with what ive heard from senora jimenez and her sister more or less she told me she was depressed at the time and her sister said she started therapy soon after and neither of them have seen him since ill get one of my guys to show his photo around senora jimenezs neighbours just to make sure do you mind if i talk to him now said falcon see what he knows about this killing upstairs tirado clapped him on the shoulder went back to his car falcon found another cigarette and went back to puerta who smiled to reveal teeth with a brown scum line is el pulmon your dealer asked falcon handing him the new cigarette yes and my friend you know what happened up there puerta shook his head pawed at a spasm in his cheek someone shot his girlfriend julia said puerta who looked up with brilliant green eyes gone weak as slime shot her in the face puerta seemed to have difficulty swallowing the hand with the cigarette trembled to his mouth he coughed smoke came out in rags he hunched over rested his forehead on his good hand and sobbed himself silent falcon patted him on the shoulder why dont you tell me what you saw he said and then we can get the guy who shot julia before he shoots your friend so now were sure theres a russian mafia ingredient said anibal parrado the instructing judge pacing the window in el pulmons apartment but ive only got the word of a complete wreck of a junkie and not one bit of evidence said falcon marisa moreno didnt even tell us that the russians were holding her sister weve only surmised that from finding the disk in the possession of vasili lukyanov the narcs have never seen this cuban before dont know about any russian involvement ive got nothing to give you that you could use in court unless we find el pulmon so where are you going now theres nothing more for me to do here said falcon detectives serrano and baena are going to work with narcotics to find el pulmon subinspector perez is going to run this investigation inspector ramirez is looking after the marisa moreno murder we should all meet up this evening and compare notes where are you going now im looking for people whove had direct contact with the russians said falcon marisa moreno is dead its going to take time to find el pulmon ive got one other candidate falcon sat in his car making calls trying to find out where alejandro spinola would be at this time of the afternoon he was in a press conference in the andalucian parliament building falcon left las tres mil opted for the ring road rather than mess with the traffic through the centre alejandro spinola was as pretty as a man could get without slipping over the gender line he liked to run his hand through his longish black hair with offcentre parting and clench it in his fist at the back of his head he had the athletic body of a professional tennis player gone slightly to seed he wore a good suit with the cuffs of his white shirt shot beyond the sleeves and a light blue silk tie he talked easily and kept the press amused while turning a gold ring on one of the fingers of his right hand he didnt look like someone who had the intention of playing second fiddle to the mayor for the rest of his life there was too much vanity streaming from every pore he was a man whod learnt not to blink in flash photography and tapdanced to the percussion of lens shutters the press were thick around spinola all looking for an offtherecord discussion falcon shouldered through them and showed spinola his police id card cant this wait he asked careful not to use falcons rank in front of the political press corps probably not said falcon spinola took him by the arm and guided him out of the room casting jokes and compliments as he went they crossed the corridor spinola checked for an empty office found one he sat behind the desk pulled out one of the side drawers and rested his expensive loafers on the edge he sat back comfortable hands resting on his stomach which proved to have its first gathering of middleaged fat what can i do for you inspector jefe he asked vaguely amused by it all i want to talk to you about marisa moreno estebans girlfriend he said frowning i hardly know her but you met her first thats true i met her at a gallery opening he said nodding looking out of the window over the past few years esteban hasnt had much time for art he used to go to openings all the time he was always interested in paintings literature that kind of thing much more so than me then why did you go the people a good art dealer can always bring together an interesting bunch of people collectors tend to have money and influence and thats my job what is your job i work for the mayor thats what esteban told me said falcon im sure youve got more to add i make sure the mayor is in touch with the right sort of people to achieve his aims said spinola things dont happen on their own inspector jefe whether youre building a mosque in los bermejales or pedestrianizing the avenida de la constitucion or remodelling la alameda or tunnelling a metro under the city there are huge numbers of people to deal with angry residents disgruntled religious groups disappointed contractors furious taxi drivers to name but a few presumably there are happy people as well of course my job is to help the mayor convert those unhappy people into well maybe not totally happy people but at least quieter more manageable people and how do you do that you must know my father inspector jefe hes a lawyer said spinola i never had the temperament for sitting down and learning lots of stuff from books like esteban did but in my own way im like both of them im a very persuasive guy so what happened with marisa then said falcon smiling oh yes right exactly what happened with marisa said spinola giving him a delayed laugh i met her at galeria zoca do you know it just off the alfalfa she wasnt showing shes not a big enough name for that place but shes very nice to look at no so jose manuel domecq the owner always invites her to you know prettify the usual assembly of toads and trout with their crocodileskin handbags and wallets bulging with cash i already knew everybody there so i didnt have to work very hard and we all went out to dinner and marisa and i sat together and you know inspector jefe we got along we got along very well did you sleep with her spinola initially narrowed his eyes as if preparing to take affront but in the end decided on a lightness of touch he laughed a little exaggeratedly no no no que no inspector jefe it wasnt like that i see said falcon forgive my misunderstanding no we exchanged numbers and i called her the following week to invite her to the garden party at the duchess of albas house its an annual affair and i thought it would be exotic to turn up with a beautiful black girl on my arm as spinolas eyes travelled from the window back across the room they stopped for a beat to check how things were going down with falcon then carried on to the door for a persuasive man spinola was weak on eye contact so how did your introduction of marisa to your cousin come about well it wasnt so much an introduction as esteban arriving on my shoulder within seconds of my arrival and introducing himself to marisa i think you might have misremembered something i dont think so i can see it now esteban cutting her away from me while i got drawn into the crowd he hogged her the whole evening i think thats doubtful said falcon because esteban was married to ines and at that point in their relationship he was not in the habit of brazenly displaying his inclination for infidelity especially in front of his and her parents and of course your father the juez decano de sevilla who was his employer a pause for thought some rearrangement of the details falcon could hear the brain furniture scraping around in spinolas head then the mayors fixer suddenly shrugged and threw his hand up in the air these are just details inspector jefe he said think of how many parties i go to how many social situations i find myself in how am i supposed to remember the finer points of every meeting and introduction because as youve just told me said falcon its your job your job is to know what makes people tick what they like and dislike and people in social situations dont wear their needs and intentions on the outside especially i imagine when youre around and theyre very conscious of the impression they want to make on the mayors office yes i would have thought that under those circumstances it would all be in the detail and your reading of that detail is what makes you so successful finally the eye contact very level and sustained a mixture of respect and fear spinola now thinking what does this man know how does esteban remember it he asked in order to avoid another lie and to give himself a chance of building a different point of view on the rock of truth he remembers you pulling him out of a family group you were on your own at the time you told him that he must meet this wonderful sculptress that youd found at an opening the previous week he says you took him into the house to a room with some magnificent paintings where youd left marisa to wait alone he remembers you introducing her and the next thing he knows you are no longer in the room does that refresh your memory it did spinolas eyes drifted above falcons head as he tried to massage the facts hed just heard into something perfectly comprehensible how old are you senor spinola thirtyfour he said youre not married no perhaps you could explain why you a single man would effect an introduction to a very attractive woman also single to your married cousin something like relief passed over spinolas face and falcon realized a strategy had occurred to him im sorry to say this inspector jefe but marisa would not be the first woman id ever introduced to my cousin what does that mean exactly it means what ive just said ive introduced single women to esteban before and hes had affairs with some of them i was wondering if you meant that you had an arrangement like some sort of informal pimping service said falcon mildly but with calculated aggression i resent that inspector jefe then clarify the understanding you had with your cousin for me im younger than him im not married i meet young available women but what is the understanding has anything ever been said between the two of you about what youre doing as you said yourself inspector jefe my job is to know what people like in that case what was your purpose senor spinola my purpose inspector jefe is to build up favours in all walks of life so that in my own or the mayors crucial moments i can call on people for support said spinola local politics is only pretty on the surface and the surface is very important nobody ever asks for a bribe nobody ever asks for a nice young chick to blow him under his desk i have to know and then i have to make it look as if i didnt so that we can still look at each other at the next party spinola had taken the first round by a whisker falcon stood up he went to the door reached for the handle spinola lifted his feet off the drawer shoved it in you might not have heard senor spinola said falcon marisa moreno was murdered last night they used her own chain saw on her cut off her hand cut off her foot cut off her head the small triumph disappeared from spinolas face and what was left behind was not sorrow or horror but a very live kind of fear consuelos house santa clara seville monday th september hrs consuelo had found an old mobile phone but with a flat battery which she was now recharging she reckoned half an hour would give her enough juice voices reached her from downstairs she was nervous about making the call in the house if something happened and she had an emotional reaction they would hear her and that might affect darios safety the patrolman at the front door did not move as she passed him she saw that his head was resting on the wall he was asleep in the kitchen the sound man and the family liaison officer were having one of those endless sevillano conversations about everything that had ever happened to them and their families consuelo made some coffee served them and took her own into the living room she watched the second patrolman sitting by the pool he was slumped in his chair it was c out there he too must be asleep time leaked by until she could bear it no longer back upstairs the phone had recharged enough she entered the phone number from the email into the memory not sure in her emotional state that she could rely on her brain to remember it she called the service provider and set up a payasyougo account for twentyfive euros she changed into some flat pumps slipped back downstairs past the first patrolman past the kitchen and out through the sliding doors she walked the length of the pool the patrolman didnt move at the bottom of the garden there was a rough break in the hedge where a gate led to the adjoining property it was rusted and had never been opened as far as she knew she vaulted over it and found herself at the back of her neighbours pool house she called the number it rang interminably she breathed back her fear apprehension and rampant agitation but when the answer came it was still like cold steel in the stomach diga nothing came out of her paralysed throat diga my name is consuelo jimenez and ive been told to call this number youre holding my momentito there was muffled talk the phone changed hands listen to me senora jimenez said a new voice do you understand why we have taken your son im not sure who you are but do you understand why your son has been taken from you put like that she nearly broke down no i dont she said your friend javier falcon the inspector he is not my friend she said blurting it thats a pity she wasnt sure why he should have said that sad because theyd split up or a shame because he could be useful you need friends at a time like this said the voice why do i need him she asked he is the cause of all this its good that you understand that much but i dont understand why you have taken my son because of his investigations he was warned but why my son i am in no doubt that you are a good person senora jimenez but even you in your business must understand the nature of pressure the nature of pressure she said her mind blank direct pressure is always met with resistance however indirect pressure is a much more complicated business silence until consuelo realized that her response was required and you want me to apply some indirect pressure is that it there was a car accident on the motorway between jerez and seville a few days ago in which a russian named vasili lukyanov was killed said the voice inspector jefe falcon was put in charge of this accident because there was a lot of money in the boot eight million two hundred thousand euros and a number of disks which contain footage of men and women in compromising situations we would like the money and the disks returned to us if you are successful in persuading inspector jefe falcon to act for you then no harm will come to your son he will be released you have my word on that if however you decide to involve other agencies or your old friend calls on other resources then your son will still come back to you senora jimenez but piece by piece the line went dead consuelo vomited a horrible bilious liquid that burned her throat and nostrils she wheeled around under the big white sky and fell back against the pool house panting sweat streaming down her face and neck she wiped her nose coughed sniffed blurted out some more tears and frustration remembered the patrolman by the pool pulled herself together she got back into her own garden slipped into the house up the stairs she stripped and stood under the shower the first solid thought to form in her mind was had she just done something very stupid where are you asked falcon im with inspector ramirez at the jefatura said cristina ferrera were typing up the report on marisa moreno did you get anything apart from the paper suits a witness a twentythreeyearold woman saw three men in calle bustos tavera but shes a bit hazy about the time she thought it was around midnight which probably sounds about right she was going home early felt sick in a club on la alameda did she get a good look she lost her nerve didnt like the not so much the look of them because she couldnt see much down there at night its unlit but she didnt like the feel of the situation she made a detour to avoid them height weight frame two guys about the same height one eightfive to one ninety metres who looked around the hundredkilo mark the third guy was very short and stocky she said he was noticeably wide and muscular thick neck she thought he might have been a bodybuilder one of the taller guys was carrying a full bin liner the other thing was that although she couldnt see their features she knew they werent spanish something to do with their head shape the description of that last guy is very interesting said falcon that squares with a witness description ive got to the double killing in las tres mil we picked that up on the police radio tell ramirez that the two bodies in the drug dealers apartment in las tres mil are connected to what hes doing anibal parrado is the instructing judge for both cases well all meet within the edificio de los juzgados this evening time to be arranged what about those three businessmens names i gave you to check out juan valverde is in madrid right now and antonio ramos is in barcelona but where theyre going to be is a different matter their personal assistants have been told not to give out that kind of information said ferrera so i lifted all their data from their id files and sent it to a friend of mine in the comisaria general de informacion who works in counter terrorism theyve got access to airlines trains private jets and can find out if these people are moving around at all in the next few days assuming theyve made bookings theyll check out the american consultant charles taggart too i got his data from the visa office i couldnt find out where he is at the moment hes not directly employed by iit europe all i can say is that he wasnt in their office in madrid nor in horizontes barcelona office i didnt really mean for you to go into that kind of detail said falcon we need to talk to those men face to face i just didnt want to go to madrid and find they were in frankfurt i thought it was more sinister than that said ferrera still my friend will get all the information and you can use it against them if they start getting difficult inspector ramirez wants a word just to warn you javier said ramirez comisario elvira has been on the phone asking where you are and ive just seen your friend and mine the jefe superior andres lobo after giving me one of those fuck off salutes of his he also wanted to know where you were why dont they just call me in my experience they never do that when theyre going to give you a kicking said ramirez upset anyone recently have you heard of a guy called alejandro spinola that smarmy fucker so youve met him pause no said ramirez as if that was obvious i just know a smarmy fucker when i see one and i know he works in the mayors office and hes the juez decanos son so i dont call him a tosser to his face he introduced marisa to esteban calderon aha said ramirez as if the whole case had fallen open into his lap what the fuck does that mean we had a very interesting little fencing match said falcon hes a bit of a maestro im beginning to think it might mean that the june th conspiracy is still alive and moving on another front or that perhaps it was attempting to develop two spheres of influence parliament and the mayors office and they blew it with trying to control the regional politics so now theyre trying to infiltrate the mayors office said ramirez dont you think you might be reading too much into very little javier i can smell something on spinola said falcon that guy is an operator and hes ambitious i get the impression that in his family circle esteban calderon has been held up as the paragon of intelligence and capability and alejandro has spent his life trying to prove himself equal he didnt have the brains to become a lawyer but hes got other qualities and hes used them to fuck up his cousin it wouldnt surprise me hold on a sec said ramirez cristina has just told me youve been given the summons elvira does want to see you and it seems to be pressing and that in itself is a symptom said falcon the forces are gathering tell the comisario ill be there as soon as i can consuelo sat in a tshirt and pants hair wet face lit by the computer screen she had been stupid and impetuous now she was going to slow down consider her next move more carefully than her first she had written down the dialogue from the phone call as best she could remember it on the computer she read it over made adjustments each time her memory flung up another halfremembered phrase the work had a dampening effect on her hysteria after her shower shed got dressed with the notion that she would call javier go straight out to meet him and confront him with the latest development only when she reached for the phone did she realize that this was what was expected of her shed stripped off just in case the impetuosity struck again and sat down to start doing some serious thinking she began by answering the kidnappers question why had dario been taken because they didnt like the intrusion of javiers investigations in kidnapping dario they knew that she would call directly on javiers position and experience in criminal investigations perhaps they had expected that javier would not give her the reason behind darios kidnap and would become directly involved in trying to find the boy this would divert javiers attention from his investigation that so concerned them but javier had insisted on the crimes against children squad being involved in the kidnapping which meant that the russians application of indirect pressure had not had the desired effect now she was being used as their agent to draw javier into darios predicament they wanted her to use her considerable influence with javier who would be feeling profoundly guilty to induce him to corrupt himself by stealing back their money and the disks from the jefatura their strict condition that there should be no involvement of other agencies and resources or it would result in harm to dario might mean they had informers in the jefatura if javier was caught stealing evidence he would be immediately suspended from duty and that would be a good result for the russians this was the first logical chain of thought shed managed since dario had been snatched it gave her strength she felt her brain tightening around the problem so far ive done exactly what you expected me to do she thought youve sweated me for fortyeight hours until i was so desperate id do anything you asked now its my turn to show you what sort of an opponent youve decided to take on comisarios lobo and elvira falcons bosses the odd couple the beast and the accountant the former with his thin dark lips in a cumin complexion looked as irritated as if he had sand in his teeth while the latter restored even greater order to his already wellorganized desk what cases are you working on at the moment javier asked elvira mildly while lobo stared on leaning slightly forward as if it would take only the slightest provocation to make him violent the murder of marisa moreno is my primary concern as i believe its linked to the two murders in las tres mil you were seen recently in madrid where you spoke to inspector jefe luis zorrita about digging around in esteban calderons case said elvira which as you know comes up for trial here in seville at the end of the month whats all that about javier asked lobo unable to restrain himself any longer politeness politeness said lobo what the fuck has politeness got to do with anything i was telling inspector jefe zorrita that i was going to look at marisa moreno id read the case notes and listened to the calderon interview and there were some anomalies which merited attention i was informing him because it might have an impact on his case which as youve just and after the meeting with zorrita where did you go asked elvira the driver of the patrol car said you hid in the back seat i had some cni business which im not able to discuss with you you are and have been under a great deal of strain said elvira wanting to move things along to the conclusion he already had in mind we have an agreement with the cni about your secondment to their duties said lobo who wanted to run this meeting without elvira if you do i dont know what it is the essential element is that your work for them must not have a deleterious effect on your duties as the inspector jefe del grupo de homicidios said elvira if it does then we have to decide where your resource would be better concentrated so that you can be relieved of some of that pressure the cni have made inquiries as to the work stress youre under here said lobo have they you mean pablo has spoken to you higher than pablo said lobo as your commanding officer said elvira i am in possession of your career records where it is clearly documented that you suffered a serious nervous breakdown in april and did not return to full duties until the summer of which was four years ago and i think youll agree that not only were the circumstances extremely unusual but also that ive made a full recovery to the point of successfully conducting one of the most complex and demanding investigations in the history of the seville jefatura that of the seville bombing three months ago said falcon and i might add at the same time i made some very delicate interventions for the cni which resulted in the prevention of a major terrorist attack in london we also understand that your partner consuelo jimenez has seen her youngest child kidnapped two days ago said elvira which reminds me you can take the police guard off my house in calle bailen i dont need protection said falcon it was a temporary measure said elvira dont tell me javier that all this isnt enough stress for even such a man as yourself to bear said lobo we all know the promise you made to the people of seville on tv last june and whilst we dont know the ins and outs of the cni work they have made inquiries to us about your mental reliability added to that three murders for your department to investigate and the kidnapping of dario jimenez and what if i tell you that its all connected said falcon the intelligence work as well asked elvira that is an inevitable development from the situation that occurred back in june said falcon pressure is being applied in the most inventive way possible to get someone to do what is against their nature i am responsible for that person being in that position i cannot desert him but what has it got to do with what is happening here in seville asked lobo im not sure other than that the same situation exists here pressure is being applied to all sorts of people to get them to perform said falcon and i include this meeting lobo and elvira looked at each other and then at falcon this meeting said lobo with the threat level in his voice close to red youre just transferring to me whats been applied to you said falcon if you mean by that that the cni have been in touch with us not just the cni i dont understand why youre resurrecting the calderon case said elvira his discomfiture making him testy is it because of your exwife it seems said lobo irritated by elviras departure from the script that its not just the cni who are concerned about your mental state i had a call from the juez decano complaining about your interruption of a press conference in the andalucian parliament in order to question his son about how exactly he introduced marisa moreno to esteban calderon he seems to think and i agree that it was unnecessary harassment my methods have been questioned before said falcon but never the results we think youre doing too much javier said elvira two comments about your mental state from different sources on the same day said lobo that rings alarm bells with us javier given your history added elvira what you mean is that the juez decano who by the way i did not see was persuaded by his son that my behaviour was unstable said falcon do i appear mad to you have any members of my squad who are the people closest to me and most able to observe any changes expressed concern about my behaviour even i can see youre tired said elvira exhausted were not taking any chances with you javier so whats the deal the deal said lobo any further comment about concerns for your mental state and youll be suspended from duty said elvira and for my part said falcon i promise not to talk to alejandro spinola on any matter relating to marisa moreno or esteban calderon the two men looked at him eyebrows arched wasnt that the purpose of this meeting asked falcon it was early evening and the temperature had just dropped below c for the first time since am inspector jefe tirado sat in consuelos living room preparing to give her a short report on the developments in her sons kidnapping he was disconcerted by her poise most women whod been made to sweat for more than fortyeight hours without hearing a word from the kidnappers would be on the verge of a breakdown by now most mothers hed dealt with had been reduced to a state of tearful exhaustion by the constant oscillation between hope and despair within the first twelve hours theyd look at him with begging eyes pleading with every cell in their bodies for the thinnest sliver of good news consuelo jimenez sat before him dressed and made up even with her toes and fingernails painted with red varnish he had never encountered a woman under these circumstances whod shown such total composure even refusing support from family members she made him nervous he talked her through the interview with carlos puerta her stalker back in june he said that said consuelo outraged but remembering her instability at that time he put his hands up my skirt stole the money from my handbag and then kicked it down the street at the very least it was a mugging i found a shot of this man ive been around the neighbourhood here and nobody has seen him in santa clara certainly not recently said tirado the narcotics guys down in las tres mil say hes been a permanent fixture down there for the last two months so you dont think hes involved in darios kidnapping he was also in very poor condition said tirado flipping through his notes i understand from the sound engineer that there have been no communications here consuelo shook her head the strain of keeping what she knew from tirado was making her absurdly conscious of the functioning vertebrae in her neck she realized in that instant that the phone call shed made to the kidnappers had transformed tirado into someone she could no longer trust tirado looked up when he heard no reply no she said nothing ive also been to darios school said tirado and conducted a number of interviews with the teachers and children im afraid i have nothing to report from there although they asked me to give you this he handed over an envelope she opened it and drew out the handmade card the drawing on the front in coloured crayons showed a boy with standingup hair in the sunshine with trees and a river behind inside it said dario is all right we know he will come home again soon it was signed by everyone in his class only then did tirado discover what was going on underneath consuelo closed her eyes her mouth crumpled and two silvery rivulets crept hesitatingly down her face plaza alfalfa seville monday th september hrs la galeria zoca was owned by a venerable old gentleman for whom the word senorial had been invented he had impeccable manners superb conversational skills perfect tailoring precision coiffure and goldrimmed halfmoon spectacles which hung from his neck by a cord you would be in no doubt just from the look of him that this man came from lengthy and outstanding lineage but that he would be the last person in the world to tell you anything of the sort although falcon had known jose manuel domecq for many years he had not seen him this century they sat in an office at the back of the gallery where domecq had led him after a genuinely warm welcome two small coffees were brought in domecq shook the sugar sachet empty over his and stirred it in for a length of time for which only an old man would have the patience i know you dont have anything left of your fathers to sell javier he said i heard you burnt it all under his orders yes yes yes he said sadly a travesty and a tragedy so what brings you here i just wanted to know if youve ever seen this woman said falcon handing domecq a photograph hed printed off his computer after his meeting with lobo and elvira domecq settled his specs on his nose and leaned forward to inspect shes very lovely marisa isnt she he said did you know her well she came in here asking me to represent her once but you know wood carving ethnic stuff its not really my thing he said but she was very attractive so i asked her to some openings and sometimes she came and lent a somewhat exotic atmosphere to the proceedings a mango amongst the oranges or rather a leopard amongst the er reptiles might be a more accurate description of some of my collectors they liked her found her rather interesting about what asked falcon thinking some of those words and phrases had sounded very familiar the work said domecq although i didnt like her stuff she knew how to talk about art when did you last see her not for a while at an opening said domecq but she didnt live far from here so shed drop in every so often to say hello i probably saw her three or four months ago thats very good jose manuel thank you for that said falcon taking the photograph back some minutes later falcon walked back to the treelined leafy square got into his car and sat at the wheel with the photograph still in his hands the plaza alfalfa was quiet the heat too oppressive for anybody to be sitting outside the bar manolo the captivating woman in the photo stared back at him with dark wide eyes domecq was right she was lovely but it was a picture of the american actress halle berry hed shown to the gallery owner not marisa moreno it was clear that alejandro spinola had moved fast first getting his father to complain to comisario lobo of all people changing the story only a little so that it had come out as falcon interrupting a press conference just to talk about calderons old girlfriend that could be construed as unstable behaviour and now here he was covering his tracks at la galeria zoca domecq must have a need for spinolas social and professional network to have to lie for him like that his mobile vibrated cristina ferrera diga he said my friend in the cgi just came back to me she said i thought you might be interested to know that charles taggart is booked to fly into madrid from newark tonight antonio ramos is flying in from barcelona also tonight and this is the interesting thing iit has chartered a private jet to fly down to seville tomorrow the pilot has logged his flight plan with a takeoff time of five pm are they staying the night or flying back the pilots flight plan indicates a takeoff time of eleven am on wednesday th september destination malaga which meant that my friend being a very thorough person checked all the upmarket hotels in and around seville and found four suites booked in the company name of horizonte at an exclusive countryhouse hotel called la berenjena which is just off the road to huelva four suites there must be someone else invited to the party thats a pretty good contact youve got at the cgi said falcon you might have to marry him for doing all that for you my friend is a she said ferrera you dont think youd get that kind of detail from a man do you inspector jefe there were too many people for the meeting to take place in the judges offices so theyd had to wait half an hour for the conference room in the edificio de los juzgados to come available at the end of the table sat the instructing judge anibal parrado to his left were subinspector emilio perez vicente cortes and martin diaz opposite them sat falcon and ramirez falcon introduced cortes and diaz whom the judge hadnt met before he then gave an introduction to the three murders they were about to discuss and sat down anibal parrado asked for an update on developments in the marisa moreno case ramirez described the sighting of three men down calle bustos tavera by the young female witness his description of the third man as a bodybuilder earned an interruption from cortes you mean a weightlifter he said you know someone built like that asked falcon because i have a witness from las tres mil carlos puerta who gave a similar description of the possible shooter in el pulmons apartment nikita sokolov said cortes just missed out on a bronze medal at the barcelona olympics middleweight class which means around seventy kilos although he must be heavier than that by now but certainly no taller and he still trains we havent seen him in the costa del sol for a few months not since may or june what did he do down there he was an enforcer when the old russian gang leader fled to dubai after operation wasp he carried on working for leonid revnik said cortes his job was to make people pay or perform and if they didnt want to do either hed kill them ill get back to you with more information on him a photo would help said juez parrado only one witness in the marisa moreno investigation inspector ramirez theres not much residential around there the courtyard was closed off from the street the chain saw was electric and therefore quiet it was pure luck that we found this witness forensic information we found two paper suits in some rubbish bins around the corner just off calle gerona they were in a bin liner which is what our witness described seeing in the hands of one of the three men she saw in calle bustos tavera the blood on the suits was matched to marisa moreno and some dna has been derived from hairs found on the inside of one and from a semen deposit in the other the data has been passed to cico headquarters in madrid to see if they can find a match on their database that could take some time said diaz computer matches have to be confirmed by human inspection these days well be lucky to have anything on that by tomorrow if they exist in our database if they dont we have to pass the samples over to interpol and that might take weeks so we have a sighting of three men but dna from only two said parrado nikita sokolov wouldnt do dirty work like that said cortes hed shoot a guy but he wouldnt get actively involved in cutting up a woman he wouldnt lower himself to that lower himself asked parrado these guys keep male company women to them are a lower form of life theyre good for preparing food sex and beating sokolov is a real vorvzakone which means a thief with a code of honour when he came back from the olympics he served time in jail for murder most of the russian mafia guys on the costa del sol these days have just bought the right to be voryvzakone but sokolov actually earned it in jail he would have overseen marisas killing but he wouldnt have done the work do we have sokolovs dna on file asked juez parrado thats what im not sure about said cortes i wasnt involved in the case but i think sokolov and this guy who was killed on the motorway vasili lukyanov were friends and they were both being processed as a result of an assault on a local girl blood samples would have been taken for dna purposes prior to the girl dropping the charges and the men being released ill check with the sex crimes squad in malaga to see if theyve still got them that was a rape charge said falcon i remember comisario elvira mentioning it when i gave him my first report on vasili lukyanovs accident so sokolov was into sexually assaulting women on that occasion said ramirez i think he was more interested in violence against women said cortes ill check the case history and get back to you well thats progress on marisa moreno said parrado if we can match the dna and find the suspects weve done some limited work on that said ramirez before the incident in las tres mil occurred our two detectives serrano and baena were in seville este trying to find out where one of these russian groups are holed up why seville este we believe that vasili lukyanov was defecting from leonid revnik to join a renegade gang run by yuri donstov the gps in lukyanovs range rover had an address in calle garlopa in seville este any sightings of yuri donstov asked falcon or any russians there are a lot of apartment blocks on calle garlopa and so far no russians and no reports of having seen any it was probably just a meeting point said cortes i cant see him putting an address into his gps theyve been more careful since operation wasp i have a source who tells me that yuri donstov could be in the poligono san pablo said falcon they dont advertise their whereabouts said diaz lets move on to the two murders in las tres mil said parrado subinspector emilio perez is the investigating officer i believe im not in possession of a fully confirmed ballistics report yet said perez starting off in his characteristic fashion but you have what we need to know emilio so tell us that said ramirez oh right inspector the autopsy revealed that the two dead bodies were killed by ninemillimetre rounds which we assume were fired from the same gun but this has not been confirmed yet ramirez tried to speed him up with quick turns of his fingers the weapon found at the scene was a beretta fs cheetah this is acalibre weapon and only one round had been fired which was found embedded in the livingroom wall opposite the window i have the plan here keep going emilio said ramirez it is believed that this round wounded the assailant holding the ninemillimetre weapon preliminary findings from the autopsy reveal that the trajectory of the bullets entering miguel estevez the cuban victim meant that the gun was fired from the floor which encourages us to believe that the shooter has been injured the first bullet smashed estevezs spinal column at the sixth vertebra the second hit his fourth rib and penetrated his heart blood said ramirez three blood samples were recovered from the apartment one belongs to miguel estevez the second to julia valdes who was el pulmons girlfriend and the third is unknown but corresponds to the samples found on the floor and wall of the living room where the round was found the threshold of the door to the bedroom from where julia valdes was shot the stairs up to the apartment block and the pavement outside theyre working on generating the dna now we have not had time to derive el pulmons dna from hair and bristles found in his bathroom but we believe that he wouldnt shoot his own girlfriend said ramirez what about the beretta ballistics say that it was fired lying flat on the table with the screw within the trigger guard there were other screws holding the barrel in place they think it was covered by the magazine the recoil had sent the gun back to the window the knife the hunting knife had estevezs fingerprints on the handle the knife which stabbed him was not found conclusion the first shot from the beretta injured the shooter estevez tried to stab el pulmon who in turn stabbed him and then turned the cuban so that he was between el pulmon and the injured man on the floor the shooter hit estevez twice powder burns on the shirt suggest that the second shot was fired as estevez was pushed back on to the shooter el pulmon escaped the shooter then killed julia valdes and left the apartment himself good said ramirez any witnesses just the one said perez carlos puerta one of el pulmons clients who the inspector jefe mentioned earlier four gunshots go off in an apartment in the middle of the barrio and we have only one witness said juez parrado its las tres mil said perez hopelessly the only person who was prepared to say anything was the tenant above el pulmon who told us hed heard the gunshots at about one pm when it comes to seeing people running around with blood all over them especially when drugs are involved then everybody is suddenly deaf and blind in las tres mil so what did carlos puerta see he saw two men pull up in a dark blue car he didnt notice the model or the number plate they went into the building one fits the description of the cuban miguel estevez and the other this person we now know is the russian weightlifter nikita sokolov said perez he heard three shots puerta saw el pulmon run out wearing a tshirt covered in blood and heard a fourth gunshot then the weightlifter came out got into the car and drove off and carlos puerta didnt report the shooting asked parrado hes a junkie said perez by way of explanation what about el pulmon asked falcon he being our most valuable witness of all i spoke to serrano and baena before i came here and theyve come up against the same brick wall said perez el pulmon was late with his product so there would have been plenty of his clients out on the street hed also have been running and with estevezs blood down his front there must have been fifty people who saw him only carlos puerta has come forward so why was puerta prepared to talk asked parrado he said he was a friend of el pulmon said falcon he was very upset about the girl julia valdes getting killed theres more to his story than hes prepared to admit but getting it out of him is a different matter ill go back to him later this evening or tomorrow with the narcs said perez so puerta is unreliable which means we have to find el pulmon said parrado if i was el pulmon i would go to ground as far away from my regular haunts as possible said ramirez we do know he owned a car said perez but its not in las tres mil any more traffic are looking for it in that case he could be out of seville by now said ramirez he used to be a novillero said falcon find the name of his sponsor and see if he has any old friends in that community he hasnt been in the bullfight game for years said perez work back emilio said falcon hes not going to go anywhere near his drug contacts family is equally unlikely so its old friends and the ones from the bullfight game are the most likely to stick by him in his hour of need especially if theyve got gypsy blood as well said ramirez id like the dna from the blood samples belonging to the ninemillimetre shooter said cortes if as im hoping weve still got sokolovs dna on file and we can get a match that would put him at the crime scene in las tres mil and then the girl who saw him in calle bustos tavera would put him at the marisa moreno scene too im not sure the witness weve got who saw him and his two comrades in calle bustos tavera is reliable enough for court said ramirez why not asked parrado saturday night shed been using drugs if we can put sokolov there it will at least inform us said cortes both marisa and el pulmon had direct contact with russians we believe that marisa had been coerced through threats to her sister who was working for the russians as a prostitute to start a relationship with esteban calderon and fulfil certain tasks related to the th june bomb conspiracy said falcon and el pulmon i dont think theres a connection between him and the th june conspiracy said falcon this was just business but it looks as if nikita sokolov the weightlifter was involved in clearing up the loose end of marisa moreno and hes now made a mistake in failing to kill el pulmon if we can find el pulmon we can use him to locate nikita sokolov and if we can charge sokolov with the two killings in las tres mil that will give us some leverage in the case of marisa moreno matching dna from the paper suits to unknowns on a database is going to take longer than seeing if we have a dna sample for sokolov and matching the samples from el pulmons apartment said parrado so lets do that first weve still got the problem of finding either of them said ramirez nikita sokolov will be very keen to find el pulmon hes the only credible witness we might get whod be willing to place him in his apartment as the shooter said falcon ill talk to my brother paco as well after his own accident in the ring hes always tried to help injured toreros the meeting broke up while parrado was called out for an urgent consultation on another case everybody turned on their mobiles went to the windows to make calls falcon called his bullbreeding brother worked through the excuses for not having gone out to the farm for months paco a question for you on your specialist subject said falcon hurrying things along do you remember a novillero called el pulmon roque barba you mean el pulmon was the name they gave him after his accident said paco i remember it got a horn in the chest when they moved him back to seville after his initial surgery i went to see him i told him if he needed any help to call me that was three years ago i saw him a few times in the months after he first came out of hospital i tried to persuade him to come up to the farm to work then we lost touch a lot has happened since then paco and not much of it good said falcon he became a heroin dealer in las tres mil a dealer shit thats bad the thing is we need to find him this sounds like trouble he is in a lot of trouble but not from us said falcon hes gone into hiding after a russian gangster tried to kill him ive just seen something on canal sur about a shooting in las tres mil two people dead said paco that was the incident and now we need to find him before the russian gangster does well hes not here if thats what youre asking i want you to use your contacts to find out if he still has any friends from his novillero days somewhere he could hole up and get watered and fed said falcon thats all i want you to do i dont want you to talk to him paco thats important i just want some ideas about where he might be and well do the rest he didnt kill either of those people in his apartment did he no said falcon the gangster did that whats the worst that can happen to him that the gangster finds him first and from your side we want to protect him because we want him to testify against the gangster the worst charge against him will be possession of an illegal firearm ill see what i can do falcon went back to the table the others finished their calls parrado came back into the room the meeting resumed anything else we should talk about now asked parrado ive just heard that the hair and semen deposit from the paper suits does not match any of the russian dna we have on our cico database said diaz that was quicker than you thought said parrado the database is smaller than i thought said diaz i spoke to the sex crimes squad in malaga and nikita sokolov was definitely vasili lukyanovs partner in the assault on that local girl he beat her up and held her down but insisted he did not have sex with her said cortes the good news is that they do have a sample of nikita sokolovs dna felipe in forensics has confirmed that hell have the dna from the blood samples of the unknown in el pulmons apartment generated by eleven pm tonight said perez good get that together with cortes said parrado now we know the direction were heading in lets find nikita sokolov and el pulmon before they find each other santa maria la blanca seville monday th september hrs they were sitting outside in the square in front of the church of santa maria la blanca which had just turned golden in the late evening light jackets were on the back of their chairs top buttons undone ties loosened beers stood in frosted glasses in front of them and a girl offloaded plates of jamon fried anchovies patatas bravas in a piquant tomato sauce and some bread and olives the talk was of nikita sokolov but it was vague amused slightly fatigued after a working weekend and a long monday ok so lets think about this scientifically said ramirez how tall do you think sokolov is hes small one metre sixtysix said cortes the closer you are to the ground the less distance you have to lift the weights and hes probably at least ten kilos heavier than he was in his olympic days id say closer to ninety kilos i think a is the bare minimum youd need to knock someone like that over how high is the table in el pulmons apartment emilio seventyfive centimetres add two for the gun thats seventyseven said ramirez where would a bullet have hit a guy one metre sixtysix tall in the leg or hip if youre normal said falcon but carlos puerta didnt describe sokolov as limping when he got into his car after the shooting puertas not reliable he could have been hit on the hand or wrist said falcon but would a hand or wrist injury have knocked him over asked cortes he might have dropped to the floor as a reflex action to the shock of the noise said falcon it was hot no aircon in the apartment el pulmon would have been in a shirt nowhere to pack his gun so he hid it under the magazine all he wanted was a bang to distract everybody in the room and make his move sokolov hit the deck as an evasive action but he was hit said ramirez a wrist or a hand shot is a better explanation of the dripping blood bleeding from the leg would get soaked into the trousers the drips wouldnt be so consistent in the room or going down the stairs all the drips were on the righthand side of the stairs going down said emilio ok right hand or wrist maybe right leg or hip said ramirez the next question is who is nikita sokolov working for if hes a friend of vasili lukyanov and we think lukyanov was defecting from leonid revnik to yuri donstov then said falcon and we havent seen sokolov on the costa del sol for a while my intelligence source told me that yuri donstov had set up a heroinsmuggling route from uzbekistan to europe and chose seville as his centre of operations said falcon el pulmon was a heroin dealer the narcs say that the heroin coming into las tres mil always used to be italian product then things started changing it looks to me as if nikita sokolov was trying to create an exclusive market for donstovs product in las tres mil and for one reason or another el pulmon was not in agreement they worked on the tapas for a few minutes drank beer ramirez ordered more do you think it was revnik or donstov who was involved in the th june bombing asked cortes cico in madrid think yuri donstov has been operating since september which is about nine months before the th june bombing said falcon im not sure thats long enough to develop a conspiracy of that complexity all they had to do was plant a small bomb said perez but a lot had to be put in place beforehand think about the political element the fuerza andalucia party the creation of their new leader said falcon i dont think a businessman like lucrecio arenas would have allowed anybody into the conspiracy who he hadnt been doing business with for quite some time i always thought that he was dealing with people whose money hed moved around the world while he was working at the banco omni but maybe im wrong so you favour leonid revnik as the perpetrator asked diaz except that hed only been in place since his predecessor fled to dubai in june i suppose i do theres no reason why revnik and his predecessor shouldnt have been in contact with each other said falcon but having just learnt about yuri donstov im beginning to think he might have found a role for himself in a new conspiracy that has its roots in the th june bombing that was an attempt to gain political power in the whole of andalucia now i think the sights have been lowered donstov seems to be shaping up to run a major criminal enterprise the delivery of the disks by vasili lukyanov was a crucial element not just in the enterprise but in a more localized project the disks are going to give him leverage especially with iit and horizonte whose executives had been filmed in compromising situations what is this project asked diaz i dont know said falcon but i think this time its not about political power but more about money we didnt talk about the money said ramirez i forgot to mention that this afternoon prosegur took away the money found in the boot of vasili lukyanovs range rover its in the banco de bilbao now how much asked diaz seven million seven hundred and fortyeight thousand two hundred euros said ramirez i was there when elvira signed it off you know javier if youre looking to nail the russians for the june th bombing i doubt youre going to be able to do it through nikita sokolov said cortes i dont think hes the sort of guy whos going to talk you might be able to stick him with the murders in las tres mil but thats not going to help you hes a vorvzakone and their code like the sicilian mafias omerta is silence and the big names were talking about theyre invisible men said diaz we only got a photograph of revniks predecessor at the beginning of we have no shot of leonid revnik and only the old gulag shot of yuri donstov all these guys could walk past us in the street and we wouldnt know and not one of the current charges against revniks predecessor is murder said cortes he was arrested for moneylaundering falsifying documents fraudulent bankruptcies and being a member of a criminal organization no drugs no peopletrafficking no extortion no murder a mobile vibrated perez took the call do you have anybody on the inside of revniks gang said falcon looking at cortes and diaz we have informers said diaz how high up the ladder said falcon all these gangsterowned businesses must be run by local people but none of them get anywhere near revnik said cortes diaz exchanged a look with cortes whose shake of the head was barely perceptible in the dying light in the square that was traffic said perez theyve found el pulmons car in calle hernan ruiz theres a bloodstained tshirt on the back seat id better get down there take felipe from forensics with you said ramirez sighing ill come too its on my way falcon paid the bill exchanged phone numbers with cortes and diaz who were still finishing their beers he headed back to the palacio de justicia to pick up his car they caught up with him in the murillo gardens sorry about that javier said cortes we just had to get clearance before we talked to you about our informers and we didnt want to do it in company we have just developed an informer close to leonid revnik said diaz shes a twentyfiveyearold woman from malaga who is completely fucking gorgeous said cortes she could be having the time of her life with any footballer or film star youd care to name but she the poor stupid bitch has chosen a gangster by the name of viktor belenki ive heard that name before said falcon remembering pablo from the cni mentioning him hes revniks righthand man and runs all his construction companies in the costa del sol so why does the girl inform on him were still right at the beginning of developing her said cortes last month we found her brother on a yacht with some of his stupid friends and seven hundred kilos of hashish and hes not the sort of kid whod last very long in a highsecurity prison does she have a name at the moment were calling her carmen said diaz the light was out over the doorway to falcons house on calle bailen he reversed up and left the car on the cobbles between the orange trees as he went up to the door he stumbled and a streak of fear flashed through his guts as someone came from the shadows and caught him by the arm steady on javier said mark flowers been drinking ive had a couple of beers but not nearly enough said falcon i was wondering when youd come crawling out of the woodwork to see me well here i am said flowers shall we go in falcon never knew where he stood with mark flowers but then that was the way flowers liked it he wanted to be unreadable what was the point of being a communications officer in the american consulate in seville if the whole world could tell that you were really a cia operative reporting to madrid flowers was a handsome fiftyfouryearold much married and divorced his hair had thinned dramatically over the last couple of years so that hed had to resort to the combover the hair should have been grey too but he dyed it and falcon suspected that during a long vacation in the united states flowers had resorted to some plastic surgery around his eyes and neck are you in mourning mark asked falcon now realizing the reason why he hadnt been able to see flowers outside was that he was dressed completely in black it makes me look slim said flowers shaking the loose shortsleeved shirt out over his thickened stomach you get to my age and weight and you need all the help you can get they came into the patio of the house the bronze boy was running across the fountain the water was as flat as a mirror shall we sit out said falcon youll want a whisky i suppose youve already eaten you know me javier im all done by six thirty glenlivet thats a nice change from the usual peat bog you serve as you know i went to london said falcon and im always thinking of you ice no water said flowers falcon went to the kitchen came back with the drinks a cold beer for himself some olives a bowl of crisps ive had some long days recently said falcon handing him the tumbler of whisky lost track of where i am what time is it flowers was just about to look at his watch remembered youre not going to catch me out that easily javier it was their little joke since falcon had noticed flowers looking ostentatiously at his watch one day a patek philippe at the time it had meant nothing to falcon until he saw in an inflight magazine that it retailed for hed brought this up with flowers whod said you never actually own a patek philippe javier you merely look after it for the next generation later falcon had found out that flowers had quoted him the strap line from the patek philippe advertisement and hed started teasing him one of the reasons falcon did this was to feel more relaxed in the company of a man he did not entirely trust long days said flowers setting his tumbler down on the table in london and here whats happening here consuelos youngest child was kidnapped on saturday while i was in london flowers nodded he knew that which meant that hed spoken to the cni im sorry he said thats a big pressure what the fuck is that all about javier falcon recited the litany about marisa moreno and the threatening phone calls from the russians flowers wanted to know how the russians got into the mix and falcon began at the beginning with lukyanovs car accident the money the disks and ferrera making the link to marisas sister margarita that is some heavy police work javier ive got a very good squad theyre all prepared to do that little bit extra and thats where you get your breaks said falcon you might be interested in the identity of one of the guys we saw on the disks dont tell me it was somebody in the american consulate i have to look them in the eye every day a guy called juan valverde flowers didnt react should i have heard of him asked flowers if hes a soccer player im lost javier you remember that company i asked you to investigate for me back in june iit owned by cortland fallenbach and morgan havilland juan valverde is their chief executive officer in europe said falcon do you know if they have any investment plans for seville or in southern spain i just got the information you asked for back in june said flowers im not following their stock javier theres another guy on those disks you will have heard of try me charles taggart the fallen preacher hes a consultant for iit on what asked flowers brutally religious matters said falcon and they both laughed i thought you were supposed to be a reformed sinner to be a part of iit once a sinner always a sinner said flowers i dont believe in this redemption shit confess your sins clean your slate get out there and commit some more just keeps the church in work what do you do with your sins mark keep them to myself said flowers if i confessed them all id age a priest and myself by a hundred years what was your line mark said falcon it takes a profound moral certitude to behave immorally in the spy game javier said flowers they drank flowers breathed in the heavy night air and crunched ice with his teeth london said flowers you know how it happened i got a call from my station head in madrid telling me that youre running a rogue agent and the brits are what was that expression they use hopping mad i like that i said how can he be running a rogue agent if an agents gone rogue nobodys running him so what the fuck are you doing javier i have an agent lets call him yacoub so we dont get confused said flowers he is your only agent yacoub is under extraordinary pressure what did he expect going into this business said flowers pressures what weve lived on since the beginning of time since weve felt the need for our genes to survive since the first cavewoman saw her man asleep on the floor and thought he should be out hunting pressure is a constant its like gravity without it wed drift aimlessly i know what pressure is mark said falcon if your station head is talking to the british then youll know that the gicm have recruited yacoubs son abdullah as a mujahideen thats almost standard procedure for an agent like yacoub said flowers a group like that wont expose themselves to an outsider with questionable friends and lifestyle without getting some insurance i didnt see it thats because youre an amateur said flowers a raw recruit who was doing the recruiting the senior cni guy juan he would have seen it even if pablo didnt they just wouldnt have told you about it didnt want to confuse your mind you mean they didnt want me to fail in my recruiting mission flowers shrugged throwing up his hands as if it was all so obvious it wasnt worth talking about this is the problem ive got with yacoub said falcon he doesnt trust anybody any more he describes himself as being in the goldfish bowl with all these agencies and his enemies looking on maybe more like a murky aquarium said flowers i hear hes good at keeping himself out of sight when he wants to wouldnt you ive got nothing to hide you still hide it look javier yacoub is a valuable asset hes the perfect agent who has got to the heart of the enemy we all have a vested interest in keeping him and his son alive and happy we want the sort of intelligence he can give us said flowers we more than anybody else understand what hes going through theres no reason for him or you to stop talking to us its the only way we can help when i was about to recruit yacoub you told me that he didnt like americans thats why he wouldnt work for you and whats so different about you and the cni he wont talk to the cni hell only talk to me because he trusts me does he said flowers fixing him with a look across the table why didnt he tell you that hed already been trained probably the same reason that juan and pablo didnt warn me about the sort of tricks the gicm would play on yacoub not distrust just omission said falcon and anyway this previous training was limited to making sure he wasnt being followed and losing a tail if he was not full spy craft how would you describe yacoubs state of mind since you met him in madrid the fact that you know we met in madrid supports the goldfishbowl theory said falcon youre all looking at him and you dont trust what you see this is the war on terror javier its called pooling resources he was distraught in madrid nervous desperate evasive he alarmed me hed thought hed lost his son and it had made him in my estimation unreliable so how did he get to be so much more persuasive in london hed come to terms with his situation it had made him calmer he lied to you in madrid not so much lying as the paranoia giving him the inclination to mislead what happened to you between madrid and london said flowers keeping the questions coming thick and fast one moment youre nervous enough to seek advice from pablo the next youre so relaxed youre going it alone and giving yacoub a free rein but i had told pablo a limited amount only what i knew but i had told him said falcon that was already a betrayal of yacoubs trust but given his volatile state and my inexperience i felt it was a necessary step so telling pablo gave you some comfort i can understand that said flowers but why wouldnt you let the brits listen in on your conversation with yacoub in browns hotel i wanted to reestablish trust i couldnt do that with mi listening in and how did yacoub persuade you that he was still trustworthy instinct you know there are a lot of people out there who can make you believe that they love you said flowers especially when its so important to them that they believe it themselves what can you do about it let other people take a look said flowers people who are capable of total objectivity but not people who are paid and sworn in by a government which has interests so yacoub is protecting his son said flowers changing tack and how many others just one other person is that person a lover youre not going to wring it out of me mark said falcon i know youre clever yacoub does too youve carefully reminded me that yacoub has lied to me that ive already betrayed him because i needed the support of the cni so whats one more little betrayal and the answer is possible death yacoub will lose control because all the intelligence agencies will set about protecting their interests and that will create more unknowns a decision could easily be taken that despite yacoubs intelligence coups he is expendable youre making this sound very serious said flowers as if there could be grave geopolitical consequences youre making it sound like something we really have to know but not yet we talked about pressure earlier said flowers the one thing i can tell you javier is that i know about pressure i am an expert in pressure exerting it i mean the thing about pressure mark is that its always exerted in order to cause pain the gicm keep yacoub under control by embracing his son the russians want to stop me from investigating their role in the th june seville bombing so they kidnap consuelos youngest child even we do it in the police force we encourage a woman to inform on her criminal lover by threatening her brother with a heavy jail term thats right javier were all in the same business the good guys and the bad guys so whats your point try offering solutions instead of threats said falcon what could i do for you that would make you feel sufficiently indebted to me that you would tell me what yacoub is up to if you could get consuelos son back for me said falcon that would engender an enormous sense of gratitude in me flowers nodded the light in the patio meant that only half his face was visible the other half was completely opaque the one seemed to inform the other thought falcon threats were always a lot easier to pull off than solutions falcons house calle bailen seville monday th september hrs it seemed later than it was flowers had only just left falcon sat in the patio slumped in his chair feet spread wide he had been exhausted by the day and its lack of progress and followed by the relentlessness of the cia mans questions hed felt his lids growing heavier and his shoulder blades tightening now he felt as empty as that husk of a plant hiding in the corner of the patio but with dario in the centre of his consciousness his mind was alive with the horror of the boys situation and his helplessness beside it he began to wonder whether it was his particular fate to be haunted by abused traumatized or persecuted children ever since hed discovered how ruthlessly his father francisco falcon had exploited him as a small boy he seemed to have become a magnet for these most vulnerable members of society it did not escape him either the appalling irony of his compulsion to discover what had happened to raul jimenezs missing son arturo then having found that hed been brought up in morocco as yacoub diouri to exploit him by making him an agent of spanish intelligence the cni the patio was dark hed turned off the light wooden beams groaned somewhere far off in the large old house he leaned forward pinched the skin between his eyes trying to tear out this ghastly nexus but all that came to him were images in the chain of events of the last few years an orphaned child being carried away by his aunt two teenagers used as sex slaves buried in a shallow grave four dead children covered by their pinafores after the th june bombing had destroyed their preschool he slapped his legs stood up cleared away the empty glasses and remains of crisps and olives took them back to the kitchen he hoped this mild activity would stop the fever in his brain this is the blight of modern mankind he thought a world so full of accessible information lives so crammed with work and relationships people so constantly connectable that weve all developed what alicia aguado would probably call tachyrumination nothing meditative about it just a feverish mental grazing a bell rang followed by three blunt thuds on the huge wooden door mark flowers coming back with more questions the afterthoughts he made his way back through the house under the gallery around the patio more thuds on the door like a dull ache followed by a sharper tapping he slapped on the lights opened the smaller door within the massive oak gates consuelo was standing there on one leg with her shoe in her hand i couldnt seem to make any impression with my fist she said slipping her shoe back on you should get the bell fixed or have a knocker fitted the bell works fine said falcon it just takes time to get from one end of the house to the other are you going to invite me in please he said they kissed formally on both cheeks manoeuvred around each other awkwardly and headed for the patio she settled herself at the table he offered her a drink shed take a small manzanilla sherry he brought two and some olives they sat in silence staring at the same point exquisitely aware of each others presence but behaving as if there was some performance going on in which they could take no interest because of the vastness of what had come between them im surprised to see you here after what happened the other night said falcon i didnt expect to have to come and see you she said to have to come and see me weve been thrown together javier it seems we cannot avoid each other she said its the only explanation ive got for what is happening when we first met i was your suspect then i became your lover then you left me he said but i came back javier she said thanks to alicia i came back a different person and now said falcon do we have alicia to thank for you coming here this evening not this time she said i spoke to her she listened its made me feel stronger and that didnt no i forgot you had to come back said falcon i know why youre here because i cant stop thinking about dario myself but who or what particularly has thrown us together this time this time javier its our enemies they looked each other directly in the eye for the first time since shed appeared at the door does that mean youve heard from the russians she nodded but i told inspector jefe tirado to call me if there were any developments said falcon he assured me nothing had happened no phone calls i called them falcon blinked she told him about the email and the call shed made from the bottom of nextdoors garden and we have no record of this conversation said falcon she handed him two sheets of a with the transcript of the dialogue as best she could remember it i was not calm when i made that call she said i realize now that i was stupid i reacted in a state of excitement and panic which was how they expected me to react falcon nodded read the transcript several times talk to me javier she said unable to bear the silence any longer tell me what you make of it ask me questions every detail from the top when did this happen he asked the email was timed two pm but i didnt see it until after four then i had to charge the phone and open an account i made the call at around five five hours ago he said i didnt want to call you you can see how complicated it is she said i only wanted to do this face to face ive been waiting outside for the american to leave tell me about the voice said falcon was there only one voice the first voice was foreign i dont know what spanish sounds like spoken by a russian but im certain it was a foreigner all he said was diga and momentito but i could tell so the second voice was the one you had this conversation with and he was spanish yes definitely spanishspeaking but not from spain id say south american or cuban said falcon a lot of cubans still speak russian that must be it i wasnt listening to the finer points of accent i was concentrating on what he was saying and his tone he was quite gentle with me the second time he asked whether i knew why dario had been kidnapped he put it a different way he said do you understand why your son has been taken from you said falcon he said it like a doctor who wanted to explain the necessity of darios quarantine as if he had a contagious disease and it was better for him it made me very emotional the next bit about thats about you isnt it she said i was angry and i cant deny it javier i still am just remember consuelo that i am your friend said falcon whatever this has done to us i am still your friend i want to get dario back as much as you do i did not kidnap him and its not me threatening him with harm and i will do everything i can to bring him back safely thats why i said its our enemies whove brought us together this time said consuelo i only understood that by working on the transcript they are trying to do something very tricky here they want to remind you that i am responsible for all this not them said falcon but they also need me to be your friend because they know that what youre asking of me is very difficult i realize that they want me to corrupt you said consuelo they believe that by holding my son they will have reduced me to their own moral level and that i will make you my friend or even my lover in order to corrupt you for my own purposes you dont need to talk me through this consuelo i do i need you to understand that i know exactly what theyre doing said consuelo theyre making me a whore in the hope that i will entice you to corrupt yourself and i hate them for it i could kill them for that let alone taking dario and in that moment he fell for her all over again if hed thought that he loved her in the airport on saturday hed been mistaken because what filled him now was an admiration so complete that he wanted to kiss those lips that had spoken such words he knew then that he would do anything for her the one thing that is not established here and given the stress of the call you were unlikely to think of it is whether they have dario or not said falcon you mean i didnt ask for some proof that he was alive not exactly im sure that dario is being held by russians were just not sure which group said falcon he explained how leonid revnik had taken over the russian mafia on the costa del sol after his predecessor had fled to dubai and how yuri donstov had arrived in seville he also laid out his theory of russian mafia involvement in the seville bombing but why would the russians involve themselves in something like that asked consuelo because they were invited to do so by the conspirators said falcon lucrecio arenas and cesar benito didnt know how to plant a bomb they needed men of violence to do it for them they had access to these people presumably because they were doing some moneylaundering for them the idea was that the russians would be rewarded in the political fallout after the bombing it didnt happen and not only that their whole criminal organization was put at risk the russians did the only thing possible and assassinated the catholic conspiracys ringleaders before they could implicate them and this huge amount of money and the disks they represent a complication they came into our hands because of a defection from revnik to donstov by a gangster called vasili lukyanov said falcon it means that men in both groups were possibly responsible for the seville bomb and also that both groups will want to get their hands on those disks because they will give them the leverage they need what exactly is on those disks they show powerful people having sex with prostitutes the most important people on those disks as far as my investigation is concerned are the ones who are representatives of the two companies who i think originally initiated the seville bombing an american corporation called iit who own a spanish holding company in barcelona called horizonte and those companies are now excluding the russians because they no longer need or want their brand of violence i have no proof of any of this said falcon all i know is that the original idea behind the seville bomb was to take political control of the andalucian state parliament and i can only assume that there would ultimately be economic rewards for those involved whats happening now is smaller scale its just business im not sure what the business is but its probably something to do with construction in or around seville i think the russians got their foot in the door with lucrecio arenas and cesar benito and they still want their reward for the dirty work theyve done so whichever mafia group holds the disks can exert pressure on iit and horizonte my guess is that dario is being held by yuri donstov who was expecting delivery of the disks from vasili lukyanov when the car accident put his whole strategy in jeopardy does leonid revnik know that lukyanov has disappeared with the disks we assume so because lukyanovs best friend was found shot dead in the woods behind estepona so it could just as easily be revnik holding dario trying to get back in the game if lukyanov had the foresight to ensure that he had the originals and there were no copies then yes said falcon if i was him id have made sure of that said consuelo that money and the disks were probably in the same safe and he stole both lukyanov ran puti clubs he controlled the girls so he was probably responsible for the secret filming of what they did with these men said falcon tapping the transcript and the money im thinking about that said falcon theyre asking for the return of million but ramirez told me there was only million accounted for lightfingered guardia civil on the motorway said consuelo or the russians are lying or they dont know theyre guessing falcon paced slowly around the patio youre very calm he said suddenly i dont know how because in making me their agent theyve given me power said consuelo i know nothing will happen to dario while i can still do things for them a further complication said falcon ideas occurring to him all the time the reason we need proof that whoever were talking to is holding dario is that they could both say that theyre holding him so far ive only been contacted by one group said consuelo and they used an email address that is strictly for friends and family you think only dario could have given them that address asked falcon do you have any protection on that computer its a family pc you probably dont even need a password to use it anybody could have found that out all right said consuelo thinking desperately theres been no media coverage yet so only the group thats performed the abduction will know about it thats in the perfect world said falcon but these mafia groups have connections everywhere the corruption is deep theyve penetrated the guardia civil and it wouldnt surprise me if they had someone in the jefatura so they would know if you called on other resources too said consuelo alarmed falcon nodded feeling the box they were in getting tighter and darker what what about their demands said consuelo the earlier calm beginning to dissipate now that she could sense their isolation the first obstacle is the money said falcon we cant get our hands on the cash its already in the banco de bilbao and i have no authority over it that lies with comisario elvira and we dont want him involved in any of this the russians probably know that or have guessed it said consuelo hopefully they probably felt they had to ask for the money especially that amount of money or theyd have made the disks look too important theyll be understanding about the money theyll have to be said falcon its not a possibility if the russians have their people in the jefatura why dont they just lift the disks themselves no thats true were not exactly a highsecurity institution said falcon the disks are in a safe in the evidence room which during office hours is heavily used and manned especially as the money was kept there until it was moved this afternoon only two people have the key and the combination of that safe elvira and myself and there are only the originals in existence no there are copies of parts of the disks on the homicide squads computer and to access it youd need not only the passwords to the system but also the encryption software to unscramble the shots they fell silent again falcon focused on the problem if as consuelos business brain had intuited iithorizonte were excluding the russians from whatever this new deal was then it could be crucial for the russians to know that juan valverde antonio ramos and charles taggart were going to be in seville tomorrow evening and night youve gone quiet on me again javier falcon reached for his mobile called ramirez how did you know that the money from the lukyanov accident had left the jefatura he asked him because youd signed the money into the jefatura it was technically homicide squad evidence so i had to accompany comisario elvira to the evidence room and sign it over to him so that he could sign it over to prosegur for delivery to the bank said ramirez was the money in the safe as much as they could fit in said ramirez there was still one block in the prosegur box did you see inside the safe when elvira opened it sure we took the money out together what was left in there the disks from the car accident did you see the safe locked afterwards elvira locked it no other copies of those disks were made the guy from the jefaturas it department came to our office he took one sometimes two images from each piece of footage which best showed the faces of the participants and thats all we have on the homicide computer what about the images you sent to me which i emailed to the cni they were cropped faces only no visible fucking if somebody could access your computer those shots wouldnt be much use to them said ramirez whats bothering you just making sure said falcon how did you and perez get on with el pulmons car his bloody fingerprints were all over it and there was a bloody tshirt on the back seat all blood samples in the car correspond to the cuban miguel estevez said ramirez that was as far as we got on site the vehicles been taken down to the jefatura so that the forensics can go over it tomorrow consuelos mobile the one shed used to call the russians rang falcon glanced at her she looked at the screen the restaurant she said and took the call did anybody see el pulmon leaving the vehicle asked falcon not leaving the vehicle but weve found an old guy who saw a man stripped to the waist with a red stain over his chest and a dark stain on the front of his trousers running down calle heroes de toledo towards the centre of town work on it jose luis said falcon we need el pulmon ive got serrano and baena on it they were getting nowhere with the narcs i think this is a better bet theyll be at it tomorrow morning first thing falcon hung up consuelo finished her call thats not the mobile that inspector jefe tirado is supposed to be recording its the one i used to call the russians was that them i gave the number to my restaurant manager before i came out havent you got your regular mobile with you the russians arent going to call me on that one i left it at home who knows youre here nobody what about the people in your house they think im in bed said consuelo i went into my neighbours garden out through the front and took a cab here you dont trust the good guys any more i cant she said looking desperate all right said falcon holding his hands up to keep her calm what did your restaurant manager want somebody came in off the street a few minutes ago gave one of the waiters an envelope and said he was to make sure that it was given to me tonight consuelo jimenezs restaurant la macarena seville monday th september hrs the envelope lay on consuelos desk she locked the door to her office and booted up the computer while falcon put on latex gloves the envelope was a jiffy bag with sra jimenez written on it in black felttip pen inside was a white envelope with the flap folded in not stuck down on a piece of white card was written to speak to dario call he held it up to consuelo who had now accessed her home email account and opened the single message in the inbox this is timed at about an hour after i left home she said it says our patience is not infinite call so both players at the table now said falcon one bluffing well call the new people first said consuelo see what they want and how they ask for it we might get an idea which group theyre from make a demand said falcon you should ask to speak to dario first thats what theyve offered but they probably wont allow it they wont want to give away too much too early in a kidnapping such as this information will be released by degrees do this and well tell you something about him do the next thing and well let you hear his voice then theyll send a photo and finally theyll let you speak to him we want to establish who is holding him so we must ask for reasonable proof is there something about dario that no ordinary person would know he has a red birthmark on the underside of his left arm near the armpit we call it his strawberry she said tell them to ask dario about his mark and what he calls it said falcon have you got a dictaphone she dug out a small digital dictaphone they tested it she turned it on wiped her damp palms with tissues picked up the phone switched on the loudspeaker dialled the number she took a deep breath summoned the performance of her life diga said a voice my name is consuelo jimenez and i want to speak to dario wait the phone changed hands senora jimenez i received a message telling me to call this number if i wanted to speak to my son dario would you put him on the line please there are some things we have to discuss first said the voice in perfect castilian spanish what things you have my son i have nothing of yours there are no things to discuss apart from the return of my son and that can be done after ive spoken to him listen to me senora jimenez i can understand that you are very anxious about your son you would like to speak to him that is natural but there are certain things we must establish first you are absolutely right may i say senora jimenez that i admire your calmness in this situation most mothers i know would be incapable of speaking to me like this on the phone i would cry beat my breast and vomit with grief if i thought that for one moment it would make any impression on you said consuelo but if you think im made of strong stuff i know youre made of crueller stuff and so human emotion is unlikely to move you to return my son so this is what you get now lets establish something before we go any further i want to talk to my son that is not possible at the moment you see you are already going back on your word said consuelo your message is clear it says i know what the message says senora jimenez said the voice with a bit of steel in it now i wrote it but you must be patient dont talk to me about being patient you will never comprehend the impatience of a mother who has had her child taken from her so dont use that word again said consuelo if you wont let me speak to my son which i regard as the ultimate proof that he is safe and well then you must go to dario and ask him about his mark and tell me what he says his mark ask dario he will tell you all you need to know to convince me one moment please a long silence is there anybody there she asked after some minutes please hold the line for a moment longer senora jimenez said the voice this is something for which permission is required permission there is a higher authority in this matter we are in contact with them now more silence after five long minutes the voice returned senora jimenez do you understand the nature of the people you are dealing with here if you mean do i know you are members of a russian mafia group then the answer is yes which group i dont know perhaps your friend inspector jefe javier falcon knows said the voice yes we know youre there inspector jefe we saw you enter the restaurant together are you associated with leonid revnik asked falcon that is correct said the voice senor revnik has been away in moscow since he took over the operations in the costa del sol some structural problems have developed in our organization in the iberian peninsula you mean yuri donstov has assumed control of certain pieces of business in seville and had poached vasili lukyanov senor revnik was in moscow for a meeting of the supreme council of the five most powerful russian brigades with soldiers on the ground in spain said the voice they found that yuri donstov was responsible for the murders of two senior members of one of the brigades and has moved into trades where we have agreements with our italian and turkish friends about how certain things should be done we cannot allow that it was the unanimous decision of the supreme council that yuri donstovs operations be stopped and his group disbanded this is all very interesting said consuelo but what about my son you have to understand the geopolitical situation before we can get down to the discussion of the detail said the voice and there is also the question of the seville bombing silence im listening said falcon and he was with every cell in his body we are holding the men responsible for the making of that bomb and the positioning of it in the mosque falcons heart rate doubled he could feel it ticking in his throat something like greed came over him and he had to stop himself from snatching at what the voice was holding out to him he reminded himself that everything is calculated nothing comes free this was just bait and why would you be holding those men you are the police inspector jefe said the voice you operate from the outside trying to find your way in we are on the inside where everything is much clearer youre implying that donstov was responsible for planting the bomb and that you disapproved of it for an operation which would change the political landscape and destabilize a region which has been a safe haven for a number of organizations for many years donstov would have needed the full backing of the supreme council he did not have it it was something done to his personal advantage and senora jimenezs son dario said falcon where is the boy in all this what is your purpose in holding him i think theres been a misunderstanding here inspector jefe said the voice we are not holding the boy we vehemently disapprove of the involvement of civilians in our foreign operations it brings unwelcome publicity and unnecessary attention from the police youre not holding dario said consuelo unable to dampen the shriek in that negative so why are we talking to you certain things had to be established before we could proceed to look at the situation with your son said the voice you said i could speak to him if i called this number one of the most important things to establish is the nature of the people you are dealing with said the voice senor revnik has rules senora jimenez he has a code of honour it may not be the same as yours or the inspector jefes but it is the reason why he is such a respected man in the world of voryvzakone yuri donstov has no respect for these rules he is an outsider he does things which are only to his advantage he is the sort of person who gives no thought to the nature of a man such as vasili lukyanov but lukyanov used to work for senor revnik said falcon perhaps you are not aware of the extent of the disagreements between senor revnik and vasili lukyanov said the voice giving a man a beating when he is unable to repay a debt is permissible but we draw the line at raping and beating a mans daughter it proved very costly for senor revnik to extricate lukyanov and his friend from that situation senor revnik is even more furious now that he has returned from moscow to find more than eight million euros and other property missing you may not know this inspector jefe but nobody steals from a vorvzakone there is only one punishment for that which in this case has been carried out by the ultimate power this is all very well said consuelo who could feel herself being sidelined but if youre not holding my son then i am unclear as to what you are proposing we do have a proposal said the voice firmly the most important part of this proposal from your point of view is that you do not enter into negotiations with yuri donstov he is probably offering to return the boy if the inspector jefe can get his hands on the money and some disks which were stolen by lukyanov the money is impossible its already been banked said falcon we know whats on the disks they will be happy with the disks they contain substantial bargaining power extortion is a core business said the voice there was an omission there that falcon did not miss the disks were a lot more than just an ordinary business tool as you know said consuelo i am a businesswoman normally in business i negotiate with someone who has something i want i might use a broker if they bring specialist knowledge but in our situation here you are trying to become the broker when i am already in direct contact with the person who has what i want i dont think youve listened to me very carefully senora jimenez not only have i explained what sort of a person yuri donstov is a man with no code of honour and no rules who has turned his back on the very people who made him a vorvzakone but also that he is running an operation which will very soon cease to exist i doubt you are in the habit of doing business with bankrupts said the voice the other advantage to you senora jimenez is that you dont have to do anything we will get your son back for you you just have to sit and wait but i still have to call yuri donstov he has already sent me an email saying that his patience is not infinite as if mine is you tell him that there are complications first of all you cannot get the money because it is in the bank and secondly you have been approached by another group who say that they are the ones holding your son you no longer know who to believe and he must give you incontrovertible proof of your sons wellbeing before you do anything im sure with your experience that you are an expert at playing for time in a negotiation but how are you going to get my son back you are all men of violence if youre going to fight this out killing each other i do not want my son to be in the middle of a war believe me senora jimenez this is not a unilateral action pressure can be applied in all sorts of ways that sounds like a slow process said consuelo i dont have that sort of time my son is in the hands of a monster im not going to wait while you gradually squeeze this this infected boil out of your organization do not expect me to be explicit senora jimenez said the voice the inspector jefe has a personal interest in all criminal activity even if it is for the general good i dont know what to think any more were going to hang up now said falcon we need some time to make a decision promise me one thing inspector jefe said the voice that you will delay in any way you can your negotiations with senor donstov if you are unsure of our capabilities in this matter please come back to us so that we can take the opportunity to convince you one last thing said consuelo what do you want out of this a small reward said the voice and cut the line falcon leaned back in his chair consuelo stared into the desk you did a brilliant job said falcon i dont know what to think any more said consuelo repeating herself trying to force some logic past a gigantic emotional obstacle think about the two parties youve spoken to said falcon how do you feel about them at least these people didnt threaten me or threaten to harm dario but then again theyre not holding him maybe theyd be more unpleasant if they were said consuelo what did you think when they asked you to hold and started talking about getting permission from a higher authority they were discussing a change of approach said consuelo initially they were going to play a game with us pretending they had dario but when i asked for the simple proof they realized the hopelessness of their gambit they are being persuasively reasonable because they are weak we have access or rather you have access to what they want but they cant give us what we want so they make us believe that we are dealing with a monster and offer to intervene and be strong on our behalf the only problem for me is what theyre planning to do by the sound of it theyre going to kill yuri donstov hes muscling in on their territory breaking all their codes of conduct and they will use guns and i dont know rocketpropelled grenades to take him out im beginning to think that lukyanov was very important to donstovs organization said falcon the voice told us that donstovs operation will soon cease to exist which probably means that donstovs supply lines of heroin will be cut or already have been that is if we believe everything the voice tells us said consuelo lukyanov with the eight million euros was bringing cash flow to the game and his expertise in prostitution and because were talking about girls rather than heroin the supply can come from anywhere then there are the disks that lukyanov was supposed to deliver said consuelo but you dont know what theyre planning to muscle in on one of the guys on the disks is a civil engineer who heads up the construction arm of horizonte said falcon i also know that one of these russian groups has their claws dug into the mayors office and that a crucial meeting will take place in seville very soon probably between the iithorizonte consortium and the mayor and other relevant departments is time becoming an important factor for them the meeting is due to take place within the next twentyfour hours businessmen consorting with prostitutes is that such a terrible thing these days asked consuelo shrugging raul went whoring some of the people i do business with especially in property and construction take cocaine go to orgies were not mired in catholicism any more but iit is an american corporation owned by two reformed addicts who are bornagain christians theyll take you in as a sinner but you have to reform they would not tolerate the sort of behaviour youre talking about by any executives in any of their companies those guys would be out of a job that probably pays more than a million euros a year and puts them in a position to make double that in the black economy in that case the one thing the voice was not quite straight about said consuelo was the disks they are very important to leonid revnik a further admission of weakness would not have looked good said falcon theyd be saying we dont have the boy and were desperate for what youve got would you give them the disks javier asked consuelo that question burning inside her too hot for her not to let it out dario is my responsibility have you noticed that said consuelo cutting in suddenly unable to bear hearing his response neither of the russian groups has mentioned the original reason for abducting dario which was to get you to stop your investigations into the seville bombing theyve effectively done that by killing my best witness marisa moreno said falcon and the voice did offer me the men who planted the bomb he certainly knows what i want they lapsed into silence looking at each other too much going on in their heads falcon checked the time ten minutes past midnight nearly two hours since the email was sent from donstov you have to talk to the other side he said play for time consuelo looked suddenly exhausted the years piled into her face the muscles in her jaw tensed she reached for the phone this call more difficult now that she knew for certain they were holding dario she gritted her teeth and dialled the number you know javier dont you that if anything happened to dario i wouldnt be able to live with it even after all alicias work he still means too much to me hes not just dario my baby hes the two i lost as well i think it might be the end of me this is consuelo jimenez she said into the phone and id like to speak to my son youve taken your time thereve been complications all right tell me your complications senora jimenez but dont let them be from the inspector jefe he is the whole reason behind this if he hadnt stuck his nose into our business none of this would have happened the first is the money said consuelo hunched over the desk her whole body tensed against the simmering violence coming down the line the money has already been transferred from the jefatura to the banco de bilbao the inspector jefe has no authority over it only his commanding officer can get that money out that is very simple not complicated at all said the voice and consuelos shoulders relaxed a notch you will raise the money yourself senora jimenez silence do you seriously think i can lay my hands on eight million euros in the space of eight million two hundred thousand euros senora jimenez said the voice that shouldnt be a problem i know two of your restaurants here in seville are leased but the other two you own outright theres been a property boom those two buildings are easily worth three million euros now so theres only a further five million to raise be creative we know youre good at that i cant you can senora jimenez eight million two hundred thousand for your childs safe return i really dont think thats too much to ask consuelo blinked this was not going according to plan her left hand started to tremble it will take time she said were in no hurry we can afford to keep your son alive for a week said the voice your friend though the inspector jefe he will have to bring us the disks today yes today it is today already he will bring us the original disks by midday today as a demonstration of good will the original disks why do you need the originals why not copies because we want the originals said the voice all understood no more complications there is one more complication said consuelo dredging for all reserves of strength i need proof that you are holding my son proof i need you to ask him about his mark his mark roared the voice ask him about his mark he will tell you everything you need to know to prove to me you want proof said the voice total threat we have been approached by another group who claim that they are the ones holding my son i therefore need you to prove to me ill prove to you senora jimenez listen a childs voice distant but in the same room as the phone mama mama mama dario screamed consuelo a blurt of foreign language listen senora jimenez mama mama no no no the voice was muffled a hand placed over the mouth there was an audible clipping noise like shears going through the bones of a roast chicken and then screaming piercing horror screams of a child not just in pain but in terrible shock at what had just been done that was the small toe senora jimenez we wont bother to send that to you only later the bigger parts if you decide to make that necessary consuelo jimenezs restaurant la macarena seville tuesday th september hrs consuelo fell off her chair slid under the desk as if shed been dragged there by some unseen riptide she hid in the footwell held on to her face squeezed her eyes shut clenched her body she strained against the pain until a creaking sound developed in her throat but however hard she tried she could not get those horror screams out of her head they were in there now for eternity and theyd torn something in her that connective tissue which holds us together and binds us to others had just been slashed at with a hooligans mindlessness falcon crawled towards her dont touch me she screamed kicking at him with her heels she didnt want loving she didnt want tenderness or pity what she wanted was someone to string her up by her ankles slit her throat and bleed her into oblivion she wanted to take the violence meted out to her child on to herself an immense silence settled in the room it was so quiet that for the first time they heard diners off in the restaurant beyond the soundproofed door like faint choral singing they sat on the floor the chair fallen on its side consuelos hands clutched to her chest knees up to her face falcon on the outside looking in no tears from her this was beyond tears she stared into the wood grain for an age the voice was right she said quietly we have no idea who were dealing with no rules no code no reason its like trying to negotiate more time from death and the voice wanted us to find that out for ourselves said falcon the voice is cruel she said but not quite as cruel as the other voice the other voice is speaking from a position of weakness im talking about the voice inside my head said consuelo i am beyond reason javier you cannot hear what weve just heard and stay reasonable what chemicals those screams have released into my bloodstream i do not know but i am not the same i have irrevocably changed in the space of quarter of an hour dont let it make up your mind youre used to this javier nobody gets used to this he said thinking about marisa moreno the grey foot in the black lake the head on the wooden statue the only way to deal with a monster like donstov said consuelo fists clenched knuckles white with rage is to set the dogs on him and dario i cant think that hed be in any more danger than he is now they stood she brushed herself down sat on the edge of the desk ill get hold of the disks said falcon she could see the damage it was doing him to go against the grain but that he was willing from her side there wasnt a scintilla of doubt you know that once weve taken this road theres no going back said falcon and there might be no coming back either youve got two other sons to do you want me to sign a release form she said eyes locked on to his im not going to fail you consuelo said falcon i would corrupt myself i would even hand over the money if i had it i would ruin my career id let them drum me out of the force to spend the rest of my days in jail and ignominy if i could be certain that dario would come out of this all right she held his face kissed him so we call revnik said falcon righting the chair sitting her down im sorry javier i know what this is costing you she said and dialled the number put the phone on loudspeaker with the dictaphone running diga said the voice we spoke to yuri donstovs people said consuelo and he said i would have to raise the money myself how long did he give you a week interesting said the voice he must be suffering what about the disks he wants them by midday and he insisted on the originals of course things can be cut out of copies said the voice did you speak to your son when i asked for proof of my sons welfare he responded by cutting off his toe it was probably just a bit of theatre said the voice you didnt hear the screams does this mean you would like us to act for you in this business some questions said consuelo do you know where my son is being held not yet but we have our people on the inside and they dont know donstov is being very careful about who knows what all we know is that the boy is not being held in donstovs headquarters in seville once we get inside we will find the answer what is the small reward you mentioned before asked consuelo the original disks wait said consuelo she put the call on hold clicked off the loudspeaker clenched her fists and rested her forehead on her wrists the torment of impossible decisions i know that im being given three options she said before falcon could get a word out the monstrous donstov the impenetrable revnik or the slow indecisive forces of law and order the first one is unacceptable the third is precluded by the first because we have been given less than twelve hours that means we have to go with the second option with all its unpredictabilities we can agonize but it wont change anything they looked at the phone she hit the hold and loudspeaker buttons well bring the disks to you when youve made dario safe said consuelo we would need the disks in advance said the voice unacceptable said consuelo hold the line the phone went dead theyll need the disks featuring the iit and horizonte people prior to six pm said falcon without them they cant affect whatever the deal is between the consortium and the mayors office offer them a random selection of half the disks see what they say the voice came back each disk is numbered in felttip pen from one to twentyseven we will accept half the disks from one to eight and twentytwo to twentyseven inclusive when do you plan to act asked falcon call this number again in fifteen minutes the line went dead they sat back exhausted whats on the disks theyve just asked for ramirez was in bed when falcon called he told him all he could remember was that the first unidentified guy was on the first disk and that the final two disks were locked requiring a password and encryption software the techies were working on it he hung up falcon and consuelo mused about the nature of the valuable data locked up on the last two disks and lapsed into silence again the tension so unbearable that talk was becoming an irritation the restaurant noise reasserted itself like a subliminal tease reminding them that this was the life they should be having her mobile rang in her handbag it must be donstovs people she said and took the call any progress senora jimenez youll have the disks by midday so youve already been in contact with inspector jefe falcon hes here now senor donstov would like to give you an incentive to act quickly said the voice if you can bring us the disks before dawn today senor donstov will release your son on receipt of just four million euros and you still have a week to raise the money will i be able to see my son falcon scribbled on the pad shoved it in front of consuelo yes said the voice you have to understand too that at such short notice we might not be able to supply all the disks the last two are in a different department which the inspector jefe does not have access to hold consuelo tugged a tissue from a box on the desk wiped the sweat from her eyes and face when can you get hold of the last two disks earliest time asked the voice falcon wrote on the pad underlined an earlier question she hadnt yet asked ten am said consuelo and where shall we meet hold they held for what seemed like an interminable amount of time they didnt speak life was suspended consuelo imagined herself as a foetus with no concept of time waiting to be born without even understanding that this was what waiting was once you have the first twentyfive disks in your possession said the voice you will make your way north of seville on the road to merida there is a petrol station where the n branches off in the direction of the sierra de aracena and portugal you will wait for further instructions there the car park was empty the jefatura dark and silent the heat of the day still radiated from the tarmac as falcon let himself into the back door of the building he ran upstairs to his office booted up all the computers took the key to the evidence room and went back downstairs he brought all the disks up to the homicide squads offices and started burning copies five at a time on all computers reasoning that donstov wouldnt know the difference between the original and a copy of any of the disks he hunted down a black felttip pen time having been unbearably stationary when he was with consuelo now raced past at an ungovernable speed he found a pen in elviras secretarys office and sprinted back down to the homicide department nearly lost his footing on the stairs slowed himself down didnt want to end up with a cracked skull lying on the landing for the cleaners to find in the morning thirtyfive minutes later and he was on the fourth set of copies why wasnt technology faster he numbered the disks sweat poured off him no aircon and the nighttime temperatures still in the thirties there came a point when all he could do was wait he swore horribly at the unconcerned computers he gripped the arms of his chair wondered what had happened to him one moment he was drinking beers in the square outside santa maria la blanca and the next he was going against everything he stood for but with no gunman holding a barrel to his temple no lunatic with a knife to his ribs no fanatic with a bomb strapped to his waist and yet hell seemed to be imminent his mobile vibrated where are you asked consuelo nearly there final copies he breathed down the stress got the numbers right with the felttip pen back down to the evidence room put the originals back in the safe locked it pocketed the evidenceroom key ran out into the car park threw himself into the car hands slick with sweat slipping over the gear stick and steering wheel he turned up the aircon the cool blasted into his chest he drove back into town pulled up outside the restaurant consuelo tore open the door got in he pulled away what he said to her questioning eyes what have you been doing she asked youre soaked to the skin theres a shirt in the back seat he said revnik the voice what did they tell us to do they came back with a different plan said consuelo fortunately the same as ours they wanted us to offer donstov the disks early i told them it had already been done they took it well theyre on the move falcon drove alongside the river with the old expo site on the isla de la cartuja just across the water they do know that weve been sent to this petrol station precisely so that donstov can make sure were not being followed revniks voice told me that he has two exkgb men working for him said consuelo and four years ago the russian interior ministry disbanded a group called the sobr a special rapidreaction unit all these highly trained guys were suddenly out of a job on a small pension revnik has three of them working for him now you had quite a conversation with the voice he opened up when i told him youd left to get the disks said consuelo i got a guided tour of the russian mafia you know its not so different to seville if you have friends in the right places it all works the town hall hasnt got round to killing people yet but most of the marbella town council are in jail for corruption did the voice tell you anything practical like how they were going to follow us he said they had listening equipment with my mobile number they can pick up my signal and listen in said consuelo doesnt it make you despair when you see such contempt for the forces of law and order he didnt answer she squeezed his arm falcon turned left crossed the river over calatravas harp bridge headed away from the lights of the city past the olympic stadium and into the darkness barely any traffic the odd truck the new motorway bypassing las pajanosas was smooth and empty the lights studding the tarmac were an odd comfort a show of someones concern consuelo sat with her legs crossed at the ankle hands in her lap playing with her rings she had her head tilted back against the headrest eyes open drinking in the illuminated road occasionally she took a deep quivering breath i can hear you thinking said falcon what is said and demanded in business negotiations is one thing said consuelo but theres always a subtext you mean why did the brutal donstov suddenly become a reasonable human being half an hour later asked falcon is there any significance to him getting those disks seven or eight hours earlier than he originally asked said consuelo why have they halved their demand to four million euros why is he being weak maybe the money is much more important to donstov than we realized said falcon revniks man thought so and its much closer to the amount of money that he knows i can raise said consuelo which is why im thinking why did donstov release the pressure on me this doesnt feel like a release to me if anything hes racked it up hes making us act quicker hes given us less time to plan what about this when i told him that another group had claimed they were holding dario it made him suspect that wed formed the sort of relationship we have so he gets us to speed up said falcon and at the same time he confirms that we still believe him and havent fallen for the other sides bluff they arrived at the petrol station where theyd been told to wait falcon filled up and extracted a couple of cafe solos from the machine took them back to the car they parked in front of the neighbouring hostal he changed his shirt they stared out into the dark and sipped coffee if we get through this im never going to the costa del sol ever again in my life said consuelo nothings changed in the costa del sol for the last forty years why withdraw your custom now because its only now that ive faced up to what these people have being doing said consuelo almost every apartment building every development every golf course marina fun park casino every source of recreation for visiting tourists is built on the profit from human misery hundreds of thousands of girls being forced to work in the puti clubs hundreds of thousands of addicts sticking themselves with needles hundreds of thousands of brainless decadent fools snorting white powder up their noses so that they can dance and fuck all night long and thats not counting any of the migrants who are washed up dead on the glorious beaches it makes me sick and im not going to do it any more im not going to do it any fucking more she jabbed her heel down in the footwell with each vehement syllable falcon reached out to calm her down and it was then that the mobile rang she grabbed it off the dashboard the irritating sound of an sms arriving filled the car donstovs man sending a text theyre telling us to go north direction merida falcon pulled away from the hostal with a squeal from the tyres and crossed the hot road turning left do you think our friends can hear a text asked consuelo nervous sneaking a glance at falcons impassive face technology is not my strong point he said suppressing a sense of the complete madness of what they were doing we have to believe that they know their work after ten kilometres they were told to leave the main road north and following endless instructions from texts sent on the mobile they drove down narrow rough roads with patched tarmac through small villages with just a couple of street lights up hills with deep blackness on either side while the smell of the rock rose the stone pines cooling the wild herbs and the dry earth wafted through the halfopen windows consuelo writhed in her seat staring out of the front and side checking the rearview mirror if revniks men were following us and we could see them theyd be visible to donstovs people too said falcon so keep calm consuelo look ahead where the hell are we the tyres rumbled over the roads a sign castelblanco de los arroyos turn left darkness again how long have we been driving she asked forty minutes she rested a hand on his forearm theres nothing out there theres nobody with us there cant be anybody in this blackness theyd see any headlights coming from kilometres away she said losing heart were going to have to prolong this thing as much as we can itll take time for them to go through the disks said falcon the mobile rang this time it was a call donstovs man youll see a sign to the embalse de la cala on the left take it and tell me when you get there four minutes were here take the second track on the right they came off the tarmac on to a dirt road handpainted sign granja de las once higeras follow it they followed the signs through the tall grasses and low widespread holm oaks it went on for kilometres until they came through an open gate to a singlestorey house the headlights brushed over the whitewashed walls the shuttered and barred windows the door with red paint peeling off it put the car in the barn said the voice leave the keys in the ignition come out with your hands up hold the disks on your head stand in front of the garage legs apart in the barn was a yellow rusting digger consuelo felt the warmth of its engine radiating towards her she and javier stood a few metres from the back of the car hands on heads two men in baseball caps indiscernible behind their torch beams approached the car they had kerchiefs pulled up over their faces one went into the garage while the other gave falcon a thorough patdown put a sleeping mask over his eyes he heard the boot pop open and a few seconds later close the man came out of the garage closed the doors the second man moved over to consuelo crouched down behind her she should have worn trousers he started at her ankles pen torch in his mouth you can see im not hiding anything down there she said no response the hands went up her skirt she gritted her teeth as fingers and thumbs reached up to her crotch over her buttocks came back down again small of the back stomach cupped her breasts a little grunt at her shoulder he slipped a sleeping mask over her eyes too come with me he said and took consuelos arm the other man took care of falcon they headed for the low farmhouse their heads were pushed down as they entered the low doorway sit they were pressed down into chairs the one doing the talking was the cuban theyd spoken to on the phone falcon had the small box of disks on his lap now he did not like the sleeping mask had not been prepared for it i dont know how im going to be able to see my son with this thing on said consuelo so im taking it off wait said the cuban careful consuelo said falcon im not doing this blindfolded she said and ripped off the mask falcon removed his as well just so that the men in the room had too much to do at once made them indecisive two of the russians already had kerchiefs over their faces the other two pulled down balaclavas with eye and mouth holes one of these men stepped forward with a handgun which he put to consuelos forehead his hand trembled slightly but with rage rather than fear he had his finger on the trigger and the safety was off consuelos eyeballs shivered her neck tensed and ducked into her shoulder as she felt the barrel touch her skin the cuban spoke in russian there was a brutal exchange and the man stepped back if you want to stay alive to see your son then you have to do as youre told said the cuban these men do not care one way or the other whether you survive this or not to them killing you would be no more trouble than lighting a cigarette the cuban came round to stand in front of them he was the only one of the men in the room who was not physically intimidating he had spectacles above his kerchief do not do anything of your own accord if i ask you to do something move slowly most important keep calm the four russians ranged behind him were all heavily built and falcon knew just by looking at them that his fist even if delivered with maximum force would make no impression they had the solidity of labourers there was nothing gymbuilt about their physiques even though two of them were wearing track suits with no vests underneath so that chest hair sprouted out over the zips their muscle looked as if it had been generated over decades of not just giving but also taking punishment they all wore heavy gold watches on thick wrists and had messily tattooed hands that looked hardened by the breaking of facial bones are we going to meet senor donstov asked falcon he will arrive in due course said the cuban first we must take a look at the disks before you do anything i want to see my son you will see your son as soon as we have established that these disks are genuine said the cuban you can understand that the cuban pulled out one of the four raffiaseated chairs sat at the table and opened a laptop falcon handed over the disks there was a room behind where the cuban was sitting door closed and another room behind the four russians who were all now smoking there was no electricity the room was lit by an assortment of gas and kerosene lamps which gave off a harsh white and oily yellow light under the wooden roof the floor was of unglazed clay tiles some light and smooth others dark and roughened from saltpetre coming through the walls were thick and had not seen whitewash for a few years so that they were flaking and the tiles below were powdered white the cuban worked his way through the twentyfive disks making notes on a pad as he went he had the volume turned down so there were no accompanying grunts and groans as he played through the footage fastforwarding playing fastforwarding again whats going to happen here asked falcon whod taken in every detail of the russians including the fact that they kept themselves completely separate from their captives he couldnt put his finger on the meaning of this distance but he knew it made him feel uneasy patience inspector jefe said the cuban all will be revealed in due course my son isnt here is he said consuelo hysteria rising in her voice theres something thats telling me hes not in this place where is he what have you done with him your maternal instinct is wrong he is here said the cuban looking at the room beyond where the russians were standing hes under sedation we had to give him a small injection you cant keep a boy like that still or quiet let me see him then youve got what you want youre going through all those disks but you know youve got it all im just doing what ive been told to do said the cuban if i deviate from my orders things will go wrong im going to see him said consuelo and she was up and off her chair and across the room the russians threw down their cigarettes the one closest to the door drew his gun from behind his back two closed in on her she battered at them with her fists kicked with her feet they were impervious didnt even close their eyes to her swatting or so much as wince with annoyance the cuban spoke in russian they picked her up off the floor her legs flailed they brought her back across the room thumped her in the chair one raised his terrible hand to her the cuban spoke again in russian im asking them to be gentle with you he said in spanish now if he slapped you i doubt youd wake up before next week or he might just accidentally break your neck they dont know their own strength these people i dont like this she said fear in her eyes for the first time and not for her own skin i dont like this at all the only reason youre upset is that you are trying to fight against it said the cuban i know its difficult but just relax then tell us whats going to happen said falcon shell calm down if you tell her how youre going to proceed i will check the disks im more than halfway through them now said the cuban when i am satisfied i will make a call and senor donstov will arrive to pick them up at that moment you will be able to see your son before he is taken away by senor donstov your son will then remain with him until you comply with the rest of the agreement is that all right falcon and consuelo exchanged a look her head without the slightest shake told him that it was not all right that this was all very very wrong the cuban glanced up from the screen he knew what he had on his hands hed been in this situation before he knew there was nothing a human being intuited better than the approach of their own demise he knew how all the killing had been done in the worlds civil wars people from the same village killing each other people whod known each other and their families since birth killing each other what they did was herd them together stick them in pens and thereby diminish their humanity so that they became nothing more than sheep to be slaughtered the cuban saw the same realization dawning on falcon whod been looking at the russians trying to understand them what they were doing over there now falcon understood their separateness the distance was so that the slaughtermen didnt smell the sweetness of their humanity and the animal caught no presentiment of the blade why are you doing this asked falcon what dont make me say it be calm inspector jefe all will be well said the cuban lazily as if speaking from a hammock he made a call on his mobile spoke in russian did you know marisa moreno asked falcon the cuban shrugged closed down the phone he nodded to the russians started boxing the disks closing down the laptop a hard day at the office and now the final unpleasantness what about the money said falcon you dont want the money thats going to be too complicated now said the cuban and the locked disks with the encrypted data he asked as they came for him we dont have the means to crack that code said the cuban two russians one on either side took falcon out into the night consuelo ran at the door where they were holding dario under sedation one of the russians caught her around the waist lifted her bodily off the ground whirled her round brought her into his chest the other grabbed her thrashing legs and they carried her out they walked around the house torches came out there was no moon the darkness had such a palpable thickness it surprised falcon just by giving way to each of his faltering steps there was the smell of water on the breeze they were near the lake the torch beams lit the ground and occasionally swept ahead over two mounds of freshly piled earth at the edge of the long grass he couldnt quite believe that this was happening to him to them how could he with all his experience have allowed this madness to take place the pit was deep the digger in the barn it all made ludicrously cogent sense now what do you do with this sort of brilliant hindsight they stood him at the far edge then turned him so that he had his back to the lake and was facing the low farmhouse the other russians arrived with consuelo now passive they righted her and stood her next to him he grabbed her hand entwined it with his kissed the back of it im sorry consuelo he said resigned now im the one who should be sorry she said i got too involved in the game i cant believe i let this happen and i didnt even get to see dario she said her distress weakening her what will they do with him now what have they done with my poor sweet little boy he kissed her a fumbling bumping kiss but it planted his shape on her and hers on him the russians pulled them apart pushed them to their knees at the edge of the pit their hands were still locked together the two men whod brought consuelo to the pit were already back at the house the remaining torch was dropped to the ground where its beam played over the pit lighting up the dark soil moist from the lake the slides on the two handguns were racked heavy hands were placed on the crowns of their heads they squeezed each others hands until the bones cracked an owl hooted its mate responded with a little titter was that the last sound of this life no there was just one more granja de las once higeras tuesday th september hrs the shots two dull thuds simultaneous first consuelo then falcon fell forward their positions on the edge of the hole too precarious to avoid it their reluctance gave them a slight advantage over the russians who had no choice they fell like two beef carcasses their knees knocking into the backs of their erstwhile victims taking them to the grave the torch beam still cast its light across the dark hole and lit up the black gaping wounds in the back of the heads of the two men who had landed face down in the pit consuelo trapped under the legs of the inert russian was struggling and whimpering with panic a man landed on his feet next to them his face was covered in dark paint and his camouflage outfit was just visible in the torch beam he heaved the slack limbs of the executioners away so that falcon and consuelo could roll out the man put his fingers to the necks of the dead russians how many inside he asked in heavily accented spanish two russians and a cuban said falcon stay here in the hole he said and scrambled out other men rushed past it was impossible to say how many it was too dark one of them kicked the torch into the pit falcon pulled consuelo silently towards him he sat with his back to the wall of the pit she crouched between his legs his arms encircling her the smell of earth was as thick as chocolate sweet as life they heard nothing they waited the stars emitted their ancient uncertain light the smell of the lake filled the hole with the promise of further days he kissed her hand perfume and dirt her knuckles wriggled on his lips a loud bang consuelo started dropped her head on to her raised knees muffled shots silence after a while an engine started up the digger in the barn it reversed out headlights illuminated the night on the other side of the farmhouse the diggers engine farted up and growled forward it stopped for a minute or two and then continued slowly the beams of light swung round settled over the pit crawled forward narrowing falcon stood up the silhouette of a man approached walking in front of the digger its safe now said a voice a hand came down falcon lifted consuelo towards it and she was hauled out she started running immediately the hand came down again falcon walked up the earth wall of the pit and out he moved to one side as the digger came through consuelo had fallen down twenty metres away the digger tipped its bucket and two bodies fell into the pit on top of the inert russians consuelo scrambled to her feet and ran again the man shouted an order in russian two men came out from behind the farmhouse caught hold of her held her there she struggled but didnt seem to have much left in her the man turned to him his painted face unreal in the harsh light from the digger the boy is there room on right as you enter but they said he was under sedation hes not breathing pillow on face maybe two hours ago said the man look before her not good they killed him you knew the boy asked the man nodding they smothered him with a pillow said falcon again completely mystified hours ago before you here nothing you could do why would they do that asked falcon the inspector jefe whod never seen the logic of murder whose job it was to return sanity to the grossly illogical was dumbfounded they had no reason to do that these people not think like that said the man go now she very unhappy consuelo was screaming herself helpless in the arms of the two men she wasnt fighting them all her fight had gone into hysterical wounded animal screaming he ran over to her they laid her down on the ground she stopped as if choked when falcons face came into her vision whats happened she said weakly what have they done im going to go in there now to have a look at things said falcon when im ready in a minute or two then you come in all right she looked at him as if he was a doctor whod just told her that she was going to die but there was a good chance of it being peaceful tell me she said too emotionally exhausted to speak properly im going to take a look he said stroking her face ill call for you two minutes count the seconds he trotted over the rough ground to the farmhouse ducked through the low front door off to the left the laptop and disks still on the table three chairs blown over the remains of a stun grenade in the corner beyond the table through the door the cuban stripped naked tied to a chair arms hooked over the high back ankles secured to the legs thighs apart genitals exposed wild animal fear in his eyes not for you said a heavily accented voice to his right in here he went to the door wiped the sweat out of his eyes tried to calm himself down he searched for that professional distance nothing there the door was hanging ajar a beefy russian with painted face and a handgun thick cylindrical silencer attached beckoned him he forced himself through it found his throat clogging with grief which only a moment before had been breathing in the damp earth with relief as he crossed the threshold playing soccer in the garden with dario flickered through the gate of his mind and he wasnt sure whether he could cope with this the room was lit by a kerosene lamp the light was a slow fluid yellow there was a single bed metal frame pushed up against the wall the windows were shuttered and had a metal bar across them padlocked dario was lying face up head still under the smothering pillow bare chest his right arm lay by his side his left arm formed a rightangle fist closed by his head a sheet lay over his torso legs awry underneath the feet sticking out his right foot was bandaged there was a dark stain on the sheet where the blood had soaked through skinny kid thought falcon pushing himself forward always on the move falcon felt for a wrist pulse but he knew a dead body when he saw one he set the legs straight brought the arms down by the boys side reorganized the sheet over the body and that was when he saw it a large scar as of a messy appendix operation he checked under the armpit for the strawberry that consuelo had talked about but the light was not good in the room and for the first time he brought himself to look under the pillow even now he peeled it back slowly flinchingly as if he was going to see something he didnt want to the face staring up at him wideeyed purplelipped was not darios bring me a torch he said the big russian came in falcon pointed at his belt he handed the torch over falcon shone it in the boys face still not dario what asked the russian its not the boy i dont understand falcon went out into the night this time he was angry almost insanely angry he called for consuelo and they released her lifted her to her feet she stumbled towards him over the uneven ground he caught her its not dario he said dario is not dead who is it she asked utterly confused a dead boy said falcon a nameless dead boy they ducked in through the doorway went into the room falcon shut the door behind him with his foot it slammed to consuelo knelt by the bed held on to the boys arm and shook her head and sobbed as she stared into his inert face falcon undid the bandage on the boys foot they cut off his toe he said beside himself with rage they cut off the poor boys toe consuelo sat on the floor with her back to the bed and started crying huge racking sobs came up as if from her pelvis physically lifting her off the clay tiles it lasted for a few minutes until she got a hold of herself i cant take any of this in she said youll have to explain it to me they didnt have dario he said they never had dario they played a game to see if they could get what they wanted but revnik doesnt have dario either said consuelo we know that hes told us that was why donstovs man called us back said falcon you were right he was nervous youd enraged him by telling him that revnik claimed to have dario which was why he cut off this boys toe then he calmed down came back with the incentive just in case you were bluffing him he had nothing to lose by trying to pretend that he had dario and it worked he brought everything forward made everybody work under pressure and there is of course the possibility that he still has a friend in revniks group but whos got dario said consuelo i dont know the sound of a muffled scream came from the other room take me away from this place she said these are hells people in here they went out into the main room the spanish speaker was back what is the problem he asked the boy is not her son said falcon we dont know who he is he must be he said looking at the door i know my own son said consuelo stay there dont move the spanish speaker went into the room where they were interrogating the cuban who was still tied to the chair but face down on the floor and bloody with a wad of cloth in his mouth the door shut questions in russian muffled screams of pain then a dry indiscernible whisper the door opened he says they never had the boy they cheat you said the spanish speaker im not sure i believe him anyway we work on it you go now wait he reached into his combat trousers pulled out two disks in their sleeves these are exact replicas of the locked disks numbers and but with different encrypted data change these for the originals they require the same password and encryption software to unlock and unscramble them as the ones youve got in the jefatura bring those originals to us now you go she stays what she stays as security he said shrugging we dont have the boy any more no said falcon im not leaving her here she stays i stay you wont get your disks wait you dont need her as security said falcon you know where to find us the russian went out of the farmhouse three minutes the cubans punishment continued consuelo had to put her hands over her ears the front door opened again the russian beckoned them out senor revnik agrees less complicated for us he walked them to the car the digger worked away in the distance consuelo got in the passenger side the russian took out a pen torch slid under the boot of the car came back out with a small black box in his hand nearly forgot he said tracking device you took your time said falcon we had to cover the last three kilometres on foot he said but our timing was perfect no not too early so we get nervous and not too late so that you he left it unfinished said adios went back to the farmhouse falcon joined consuelo in the lit cockpit of the car they set off down the track on to the rough road they passed a car parked in the long grass headlights masked with black tape so that only slits were visible they thumped back up on to the tarmac falcon drove hunched over the wheel he stopped in castelblanco de los arroyos took his police mobile out and ran through the numbers its a bit too late for the police said consuelo i cant blame you for forgetting that i am supposed to be the police said falcon still in a rage ive nearly wiped it from my own mind who are you calling now the head of the it department hes got to crack the encryption code on those two disks as quickly as possible leave it javier its six in the morning said consuelo youre going to have to do a lot of ugly explaining to some guy youve just woken up and i can assure you youll come out of it badly sort it out when you get into the office what about revnik do you want him after you i dont care lets just go revnik will have to learn to be patient you can delay him somehow with the disks in police possession youre in control she said i know you want to do something positive after all that horror but my advice to you now is not to call anybody because the repercussions will be serious back in the car driving through the night after the tension a colossal tiredness he drove with one hand his arm around consuelo her head in his chest she changed the gears when he needed it they were silent for some time i know youre angry she said im angry with myself i feel as if ive ruined you she said im not ruined he replied but he thought he probably was i know what that cost you having to walk away from the dead boy she said because its cost me too theyll bury him in that pit with those people theyll bury him like a bird thats broken its neck flying into a window and his mother will never know ill face that in the morning he said i need the light of day and a mirror for that i want to come home with you she said i dont want to be alone tonight not even for a few hours he held her tight to his chest but he couldnt stop his brain from picking over the mangled wreckage of events where had he gone wrong from the moment hed started working on marisa moreno the russians had been on to him with their telephone threats then theyd contacted consuelo and that had confirmed it but hed done what mark flowers had warned him never to do put uncorroborated bits of information together to make the picture fit the one he had in his head he was going to have to remember those phone calls what time theyd happened what had occurred before and in between each one and what was said what exactly had been said youre thinking said consuelo this is no time for thinking javier you said it yourself wait for the light of day things will be clearer then he parked outside his house in calle bailen still not light time closing in on seven oclock they went straight upstairs stripped off and got into the shower they washed the filth off each other the water disappeared black and grey down the drain she washed her hair he soaped her shoulders kneaded the muscles back into life they sat on the floor of the shower she between his legs his arms wrapped around her the water cascaded down he kissed the back of her neck they got up wordlessly turned off the water dried themselves with towels in the dark bedroom lit only by an oblong of light from the empty bathroom door she threw the towel away his dropped to the floor after the night theyd been through he had no idea why his cock should be so massively swollen she didnt understand why she felt a desire for him so strong it made her feel twenty all over again the whole night had been illogical they came together like fighters wrestling for position she bit his shoulder so hard he gasped he rammed into her with a shuddering vehemence that riveted her to the bed their skin slapped together with each questing thrust she dug her nails into his back spurred him on with her heels in his buttocks he couldnt seem to get deep enough inside her it maddened him so that he quickened his pace and she sensed a great trembling inside her as his heart thumped wildly in his throat and she clung on with the thrill welling in her body and he reached a shuddering collapse and she lay underneath him crying and beating the mattress with the flat of her hands he rolled to the side drew a sheet up over them gathered her quivering back to his chest where she fluttered against him like a rescued bird they slept still as stone effigies on an ancient sarcophagus in a moonlit chapel falcons house calle bailen seville tuesday th september hrs outside the world broke about them as falcon and consuelo slept on only at midday did a call on falcons mobile crack open their sedation he came to as if from some coma life where fantastic goings on were now reduced to the dullness of reality late night asked ramirez you could say that said falcon panting into the phone his heart walloping in his chest whats going on i got a call from perez about ten thirty he was in las tres mil with one of the narcotics guys following up on carlos puerta they found him in an empty basement still with the needle in his arm overdose i told him not to disturb you and to handle it himself falcon ran his hand down his face tried to rub some feeling of reality into it he just called me again about ten minutes ago said ramirez hes been doing some hunting around talking to people with the narc remember julia valdes el pulmons girlfriend who was shot yesterday in his apartment she used to be carlos puertas girlfriend they worked together she was a flamenco dancer he sang they bust up in june and she started going with his dealer closer to the source i suppose are we looking at a suicide asked falcon still not quite with it had puerta taken the bustup badly very badly he went downhill fast said ramirez his junkie friends said he got some royalties from a recording contract and put the whole lot up his arm by the time you interviewed him with tirado he was at the end of a threemonth binge how much money did he get asked falcon three months is a long binge good point said ramirez for some reason i dont think weve quite got the full story on puerta falcon nodded said he would get into the office as soon as he could they hung up consuelo called her sister spoke to her sons ricardo and matias told them shed be with them in an hour no news breakfast was a stunned affair conducted by automatons in wordless understanding she wore a shirt of his and a pair of boxer shorts the toast soaked up the green olive oil the fresh red tomato pulp the thinly sliced jamon they ate and drank small cups of bitumen coffee the sun was bright in the patio the water in the fountain flat as glass birds swooped between the pillars they could not eat slowly enough for this to last longer than twenty minutes the cars windscreen framed their view of the city a documentary so dull of people going about their business that its audience could not believe that this was what it had all been about there must be more to it than shopping having your hair done and painting a door did it happen asked consuelo it happened he said and held her hand what now i have to think where i went wrong said falcon i have to retrace my thoughts to find the deviation point what do i tell inspector jefe tirado let him carry on said falcon hell have his own way of doing things and hes probably got as good a chance of success as we have he might be concentrating too much on the russians ill put him right about that he came off avenida kansas city and went into santa clara found her street i cant stop thinking that ive ruined you she said you said that last night consuelo and i told you you corrupted yourself because of me she said i forced you to join hands with gangsters and made you complicit in the kind of aberration youre paid to investigate and i cant tell you how francisco falcon and i used to play chess together he said i remember one time when he forced me into a position where the only move i could make would get me deeper into trouble and having made the move his response meant that again i had to do something which made things even worse and so it went on to the inevitable checkmate thats whats been happening here once id made the mistake of believing that the russians had taken dario i drew us both into a series of inexorable moves you didnt ruin me i ruined myself with a blinkered approach i panicked because because dario means almost as much to you as he does to me said consuelo and i think it brought back the horror of what happened to rauls child arturo too that was the first time i fell for you four years ago when we asked each other what happened to that little boy and thats partly why you did it all that terrible stuff came back to you falcon put his foot on the brake the car eased to a halt in the middle of the road he stared vacantly down the shaded street the street where consuelo lived how could i forget it he said to himself how could i possibly have forgotten that a car pulled up behind them and when its driver saw that nobody was going to get out honked its horn falcon pulled over it happened in the plaza san lorenzo he said i got the call just before we met at the bar la eslava the voice said something will happen when it does you will know that you are to blame because you will recognize it but therell be no discussion and no negotiation because youll never hear from us again youll recognize it she repeated and what did you think they meant by that at the time i dont know that i did think about it that much said falcon it was just another threatening phone call id had several youd been somewhere that night madrid on the train i had a call on the ave telling me to keep my nose out of other peoples business what was the business you were going to do in madrid yes he said slowly police business and other business the same business you were on when you went to london and dario was abducted exactly that said falcon i thought the call i received on the ave was because i was pushing marisa moreno to talk to me so when i got back to seville i went to see her again before i went to meet you just so that she knew i wasnt scared by the calls i even told her id be waiting for a call from her people so when i got that call just as i came into the plaza san lorenzo i didnt think about it my brain made the automatic connection back to marisa but they werent marisas people and by going to london i disobeyed their instructions to keep my nose out of their business and who are they im not quite sure said falcon let me use your mobile but do you know why dario was taken i think said falcon punching out a text to yacoub that it was done so that my attention would be diverted elsewhere youre saying things without saying anything javier because i cant he said and sent the text need to talk call me j but you think you know who took dario asked consuelo im not precisely sure who would have done the job but i know the group who ordered it and they are said consuelo grabbing his head turning it towards her you dont want to tell me do you javier what could be worse than the russian mafia this time im going to get my intelligence right said falcon im not making the same mistake twice crawling along avenida kansas city looking for a public phone the heat oppressive falcon alone now the text back from yacoub had told him that he was in a hotel in marbella and gave the telephone number of a spanish mobile to use falcon gave up looking went to the railway station what are you doing in marbella asked falcon business i mean clothes said yacoub its a small fashion show but i always pick up a lot of work for the factory here is abdullah with you no i left him in london hes going back to rabat said yacoub why all the questions theres been a development we need to talk face to face i dont know whether i can get all the way to seville said yacoub thats three hours in the car how about half way im on the road to malaga now could you get to osuna asked falcon thats about a hundred and fifty kilometres from malaga when ill call you with a time i havent been into the office yet as he was leaving the station he picked up a message from mark flowers asking for a meeting in the usual place falcon was desperate to get to the office but the river was on the way ten minutes later he parked by the bullring crossed the paseo cristobal colon and trotted down the steps to their bench flowers was waiting i havent got much time said falcon nor have i said flowers these russians holding the boy what are you looking at them for i thought you wanted to find consuelos kid right said falcon needing to think about flowerss relationship to this before he told him anything important a lot on my plate mark long nights i need some help does that mean youve been given permission to help me i dont always need permission said flowers falcon briefed him on the power struggle between leonid revnik and yuri donstov only giving him as much detail as pablo of the cni had told him and not touching on any of the developments of last night he couldnt afford to have that knowledge swimming around in flowerss head and you dont know which group has the boy either or neither said falcon but the threatening phone calls were about what exactly initially they wanted me to stop investigating marisa moreno and thereby make a connection through her to them and the seville bombing said falcon but then they identified me at the scene of vasili lukyanovs accident and saw an opportunity to get their disks back which would allow them to pressurize iit and horizonte in whatever business theyre doing said flowers so why neither you said either or neither the threatening phone calls are unidentifiable ive been guessing that its the russians but it could just as easily be something to do with other things yacoub you mean said flowers immediately and youve heard nothing since the kidnap one of the calls said i would never hear from them again can you get me copies of these disks what for you as an inspector jefe cant be seen to be negotiating with criminal gangs but theres nothing to stop me in my line of work is this your profound moral certitude coming out again asked falcon i wish id never said that the disks are evidence just copies javier copies you want me to start making copies of certified evidence in a busy jefatura its dead in there at lunchtime said flowers if you want me to find the boy youve got to give me the tools ill see what i can do said javier who was feeling a strong desire to get away from flowers something smelling very bad about his request it was pm by the time he got to the jefatura cristina ferrera was alone in the office he told her hed heard from ramirez about carlos puerta and asked if thered been any developments on the various murders we picked up some further sightings of el pulmon after he left his vehicle yesterday afternoon said ferrera he bought a bottle of water on avenida ramon y cajal and was seen washing himself off in the street he was spotted again still stripped to the waist running down calle enramadilla the last sighting was in the bus station in the plaza san sebastian that sounds as if he was getting out of town theyre still working the bus station but at some point he must have got a tshirt because were not picking up any more sightings of someone stripped to the waist he got her to check the arrival time of the iit private jet in seville and went down to the computer room no natural light banks of computers young faces lit by grey light coming from the screens the inspector jefe told him that theyd been working on the disks since eight thirty that morning at eleven thirty theyd brought in a couple of mathematicians from the university by midday they were in touch with interpol to see if theyd cracked any russian mafia codes recently they hadnt heard anything back how urgent is this asked the it chief theres a late afternoon meeting between a spanish business consortium and the town hall which we believe the russian mafia are trying to influence said falcon we assume this because some of the participants in that meeting feature in the sex footage on the disks we think that the two encrypted disks youre working on contain associated material and wed like to know what it is before the meeting takes place back up to his office ferrera with news of a revised flight plan logged by the pilot of the private jet it was now due to arrive at seville airport at this evening falcons mobile vibrated his brother paco el pulmon he said are you still interested in finding him youve had a tipoff not exactly said paco but ive managed to find out that the only guy hes kept in touch with in the bullfight business is another gypsy a brilliant horseman who looks after the animals on a finca in the serrania de ronda falcon took down the address hung up began to plan his afternoon wheres ramirez he asked lunch with serrano and baena said ferrera ask them to come back here as soon as they can we might have a lead on el pulmon the mobile vibrated again he put it to his ear without checking the screen i hope you havent forgotten about us said the voice you said youd call ive been waiting said falcon going into his office closing the door youve got the disks no theyre in use theyre being examined i dont have access to them youll never crack that code said the voice we have the resources to pay for the best minds in the business youll be doing better than mi if you crack it and theyve been working on it for three years the process is not in my hands said falcon and even if it was and i could access those disks id still be waiting for you to deliver on your promise our promise i delivered those disks but you havent kept up your end of the deal but there was no boy said the voice and we saved your lives if you wanted to get your hands on those disks you were always going to have to do that said falcon now you have what you want and i have nothing youre negotiating with us asked the voice perplexed you want those two remaining disks said falcon i want the seville bombers that means the two men who masqueraded as building inspectors and the three electricians who planted the device i also want to know where i can find nikita sokolov youre being very demanding inspector jefe and i want the person who murdered esteban calderons wife in her apartment early in the morning of th june this year the judge murdered her himself said the voice hes confessed i dont know where you heard that from said falcon maybe your source in the jefatura is not so reliable that was the prime reason why marisa moreno was murdered wasnt it why do you think we had anything to do with that nikita sokolov said falcon and left it at that hoped that would be enough to persuade the voice that he knew more than he did sokolov is not one of ours but he was ill have to get back to you and before you deliver on sokolov you can ask him where his two friends are the ones he used to cut up marisa moreno with a chain saw this is a lot of people said the voice this is two five six seven nine people you want in return for the two disks ill have to come back to you but i can assure you that senor revnik will not be happy about this theres no rush i dont follow you if as you say well never crack the code on those two disks then we have all the time in the world on the road to the serrania de ronda tuesday th september hours they took two cars falcon ramirez and ferrera in the lead car serrano and baena behind only perez was left in seville still working on the murders in las tres mil and carlos puertas suicide falcon was anxious about taking all his men off their various cases but el pulmon was an important witness and the intelligence theyd had from the local guardia civil who they were going to meet in cuevas del becerro about twenty kilometres northeast of ronda had been promising he needed all this manpower because the farm was in an area protected by high mountains to the north there were a lot of horses on the farm and if the two gypsies got wind of their approach they could ride into the sierra in minutes and once up there theyd never find them falcon had arranged to meet yacoub in osuna at as close to five oclock as possible just as he was leaving the jefatura hed bumped into inspector jefe tirado of grume but hadnt been able to think his way round all the complications of warning him off the russians hed just told him what hed mentioned to flowers either or neither and to keep an open mind tirado didnt think that was helpful his investigation was stalled he was doing a lot of work around the nervion plaza for nearly no return the heat was more brutal out in the open country where the bleached sky and the bare chalky brown earth seemed drained of all vascular circulation the ridge of mountains they had to cross to get to the village where they were meeting the guardia civil was lost in the afternoon haze the endless hectares of olive trees ranked like ancient armies ready for battle on some vast uncontested plain were the only evidence of civilization in this arid deserted landscape on the way he briefed ramirez and ferrera on the situation with alejandro spinola his involvement with the mayors office and his relationship with marisa moreno and therefore very possibly the russians he also told them what had happened when he went to see comisarios elvira and lobo so what are we going to do about spinola when we finish this business you two are going to the airport to see who comes out of the iit chartered jet and follow the car to wherever it takes them serrano and baena are going to track spinola but theyre all going to end up in that fancy hotel la berenjena said ferrera why dont we just go straight there it looks like the russians want to influence the outcome of whatever this deal is between the mayors office and the iithorizonte consortium said falcon we just dont know how or when theyre going to do it and we cant touch spinola because of lobo and elvira said ramirez and we cant mount an official operation at la berenjena either said falcon who knows it might turn out to be a completely legitimate deal with no mafia involvement and we can all go home and sleep easy on the other hand with the intelligence weve gathered i think we have to be available in case things go wrong can we at least do some preparation work said ferrera like get a list of the other guests warn the manager that were coming and get some idea of the security setup at the hotel what do you know about this place asked ramirez the website says that its an exclusive celebrity hangout that royalty has stayed there and that its not just an ordinary countryhouse hotel they have a head of security and the management is willing to consult on additional security arrangements its important that elvira doesnt hear about any of this said falcon so if it can be achieved in total secrecy then go ahead we might need some help in identifying the players we dont know said ferrera there are four suites booked at la berenjena so who is this extra person on the iithorizonte team and how do we recognize the mafia men there are no existing shots of leonid revnik and only an old gulag shot of yuri donstov said falcon the rest should be on the cico database well have to take shots of them when they arrive and send them to vicente cortes and martin diaz for identification said ramirez ill bring a laptop said ferrera youd better brief cortes and diaz said falcon and ill talk to the cni they crossed the main road climbed the ridge and dropped down to where the guardia civil were waiting for them on the outskirts of cuevas del becerro they had a largescale map of the area and some further intelligence el pulmons gypsy friend had been seen in ronda buying clothes and shotgun shells the owner of the farm was touring up in the north and the place was being run by a manager who had gone down to the coast with his family there was a stable for twenty horses and the gypsy lived in a small cottage adjoining it his job was to look after the animals he was well known in the area and he knew the country like the back of his hand where do you think theyre most likely to be at this time of day asked ramirez with any luck theyll be having a siesta said the guardia but they could be thats a point at the back of the stables theres a practice bullring for training the horses with bulls is that what the horses are used for asked baena yes hes one of the best rejoneadors in the business fantastic horses he goes all over spain and portugal with them said the guardia they wont be out in the fields not at this time of day in this heat said the other guardia those horses are going to be pretty valuable said baena so said serrano taking out his revolver checking that it was fully loaded wed better not shoot any of them by accident fuck no said the guardia you do that and youll have to find at least a hundred thousand euros per animal and the rest said baena do you know the practice ring asked falcon how many ways in or out the guardia shrugged falcon decided theyd go in their two unmarked cars and not risk taking the guardia in their greenandwhite nissan patrols with them when we get there said falcon serrano and baena will go into the stables and check them out ramirez and i will search the cottage ferrera will stay outside and keep watch if theres no sign of them well move to the practice bullring the three of you will man the entry points and ramirez and i will go into the ring toro said one of the guardia and they all laughed the guardia led them out into the country and pointed out the entrance to the finca de la luna llena the farm buildings were not visible from the road there was a long twokilometre slope up from the entrance gates and the main building could be seen at the top of the rise if theyre out and about theyre going to see us coming over this rise said ramirez thats if theyre looking out for us said falcon el pulmon isnt expecting anybody to find him out here shotgun shells said ramirez thats the minimum hed need to take on nikita sokolov said ferrera the two cars coasted down the track engines idling into the farm buildings the stables were behind the main house and the cars came to a halt in front silence no movement too early in the afternoon even for cicadas they got out guns ready nobody slammed the car doors baena trotted up to the far end of the stable block checked round the back held up his thumb went into the building at the far end serrano took the door next to the cottage ferrera moved silently between the buildings listening for voices and movement the cottage was open ramirez took a quick look around just three rooms empty falcon pointed to the ceiling went upstairs nothing there outside ferrera was waiting told them shed heard voices in the practice ring serrano came out of the stables and the four of them headed for the practice ring guns out falcon stood in the middle of the main entrance to the practice ring there was a stone staircase on the outside wall of the ring where spectators could go up to watch from a roofed seating area above the main gates ramirez went right serrano left two minutes ramirez came back at a trot serranos positioned at the entrance for the animals just in case theres a small bull in there he said the only other way out would be to run up the seating in the ring and then down the stone staircase here an animal snort came from inside the ring theres at least one horse in there said falcon lets take a look said ramirez ramirez went up the staircase crawled the last five steps came back down two guys both gypsylooking one horse the horse is tied up its got padding around it one guy who looks like el pulmon has a cape the other guy is holding a mockup of some bulls horns el pulmon practising his old moves theres a lance leaning up against the wall of the ring and theres a shotgun next to it this is the only way out on a horse isnt it said falcon theres no way to manoeuvre a horse in the bullock pen all right said falcon cristina you go up to the seating area above and cover us fifteen seconds and we go in ferrera crept up the steps falcon nodded to ramirez who opened the door they slipped in closed the door behind them the two men were facing away from them the horse seemed to acknowledge their entrance with a nod of the head and a snort roque barba shouted falcon gun out pointing directly at the man with the cape police it happened at lightning speed the gypsy dropped the practice horns and in one leap was on the back of the horse el pulmon threw his cape up in the air and it came spinning towards ramirez freeze shouted ferrera from above the gypsy slapped a button on the barrier and the main door to the practice ring sprung open he slipped the rein and picked up the picadors lance the shotgun was too low down for him el pulmon hesitated thinking about reaching for it the gypsy put the horse between el pulmon and falcon dropped his head low to the horses neck tucked the lance under his arm el pulmon grabbed the padding at the side of the horse and kicked his feet up in the air with a jab of the gypsys heels the horse took off out of the open door falcon and ramirez scrambled to one side the steel tip of the picadors lance flashed past at face height ferrera let off a shot over their heads it didnt stop them in the space of twenty metres el pulmon got his leg up over the rear of the horse the gypsy chucked the lance and hauled his friend up behind the saddle el pulmon grabbed hold of his waist the horse galloped the length of the stable block falcon and ramirez ran out of the practice ring in time to see the horse getting into its full stride kicking up dust and heading for the fields above the farm what a fuckup said ramirez i didnt want to risk shooting the horse said ferrera from above they were all watching the galloping horse when from the far side of the stable block came another rider on a black stallion the gypsys horse was badly encumbered by its protective padding and the black stallion which was a beautiful beast had no difficulty in catching up fuck me said ramirez thats baena baena was ducked low by the horses neck arse up in the air looking every bit the professional rider he reached out and grabbed el pulmons fluttering shirt and yanked it hard el pulmon had no stirrups and came straight off the back of the horse baena pulled up and was on him gun in his face his other hand hanging on to the stallions rein el pulmon had landed on his back and was badly winded rolling around and cycling his legs in the dust trying to get some air into his remaining lung the gypsy reined in the padded horse which came up on his hind legs while its rider stood up in the stirrups and did three or four complete turns as he looked back ferrera ran for the car picked up falcon and ramirez and they joined the gasping el pulmon baena calmed the stallion which had been alarmed by the rush of the arriving car i didnt know you could ride julio said falcon i went to riding school for years when i was younger he said i fancied myself as a rejoneador but you know what happens not many people make it i did a couple of years in the mounted police but it was too boring i tell you when i saw that stallion already saddled up i thought ive got to have a go thats a quartermillion euros worth of horse there they lifted el pulmon into the back seat of the car cuffed him face down the gypsy on the padded horse was still there pacing his animal to and fro what about him asked ramirez he came at us with a lance we havent got time for that said falcon weve still got a long day ahead of us take that horse back to the stables and lets get on with what we came here for they drove back to the farm buildings while serrano and baena walked the stallion to the stable block ramirez righted el pulmon sat him up in the middle of the back seat falcon got in the other side im not talking to you said el pulmon fucking narcs you dont have to talk to us said ramirez were taking you back to seville and throwing you to the russian bears youll talk to them your old friends theyre the ones who supply you with dope let you make a lot of money and kill your girlfriend what you didnt hear about that said falcon they killed her said el pulmon were homicide cops said ramirez were looking for the guy who shot the cuban miguel estevez said falcon hes the same guy who went into your bedroom and for no reason at all shot julia valdes in the face said ramirez his name is nikita sokolov said falcon he used to be a weightlifter stocky guy very muscular legs remember him youll be glad to know roque that you winged him said ramirez with that shot from your beretta you drew blood i used to get my product from the italians said el pulmon at least i knew where i was with those guys they spoke my language then back in march this stocky russian turned up and started giving me different stuff very pure the cuban miguel came along to translate so why did they come to see you yesterday asked falcon i was due a delivery what about the gun your beretta asked ramirez i was still selling italian product i didnt want to drop my old suppliers because i didnt know how long the russian stuff was going to last the russian wanted me to sell his gear exclusively a few weeks ago the big guy hung me out of the window to make his point warned me that he would install his own dealer if i didnt stop selling the italian shit so i got myself prepared didnt clear your girlfriend out though did you said ramirez i didnt think theyd come to kill me said el pulmon it was just a delivery but i was nervous enough to take precautions and fuck i wish i had got julia out of there so what happened one of my clients ratted on me said el pulmon told the russian i was still selling italian product aha said ramirez now we get the full story was carlos puerta the rat how do you know that we picked him up on some associated business said falcon he described the russian for us he saw the whole thing from outside your apartment block that fucker hes still crazy about julia and then he got himself badly strung out needed more dope and his money ran dry and the russian stepped in with a little bribe said ramirez puertas dead committed suicide this morning happy joder said el pulmon head bowed we need to find nikita sokolov said falcon how did you make contact with him i called miguel the cuban that was my only way in you know how to catch a russian bear said ramirez el pulmon shook his head honey said ramirez were going to cover you in honey and tether you out in the sun and wait for nikita to turn up el pulmon looked from ramirez to falcon to see if he was going to be more friendly when we bring sokolov in said falcon more reasonably youre going to identify him youre fucking kidding its either that or the honey treatment said ramirez and youd like to get the guy who shot julia wouldnt you said falcon el pulmons shoulders dropped he stared into the footwell and nodded a quarter to five and falcon was making his way up to the main square in osuna a strange town which looked unassuming from the outside but the low tiled whitewashed houses gave way to opulent sixteenthcentury mansions from the time when new world wealth had found its way into deepest andalucia the plaza mayor had colossal palm trees which shaded the few bars the s casino and the empty square yacoub was early and falcon watched him sitting alone in the heat at a table on the pavement he had a cafe solo and a glass of water beside him he was smoking and looking remarkably unperturbed compared to their last two meetings pleasantries over falcon sat at the small round metal table and ordered a plate of squid and a beer with a coffee to follow youre looking more relaxed said falcon ive passed another loyalty test said yacoub the gicm say abdullah isnt ready yet they put him through his paces in training and his platoon commander says he needs to toughen up mentally they dont want to lose someone of his intelligence and potential through poor preparation they wouldnt think of giving him any sort of mission for at least another six months your strategy worked then thats how you have to be with radicals if you dont show the same fervour as they do youre suspect will they involve you with the mission when he is ready i dont know ive been told i will be involved but who knows with these people said yacoub whatever it doesnt solve my problem ive still lost a son to radical islam im just in a slightly better position to stop him getting killed weve got time now said falcon and what is time going to do for us you think im going to be able to change his mind and even if that were possible then what hide him for the rest of his life hide myself said yacoub no javier youre not thinking straight what ive come to terms with over the last week is that this is a lifelong commitment thats why i suffered so much ive been thinking short term i couldnt see beyond the horror of abdullah being drawn into this organization because i have the mentality of a dabbler i was kidding myself that there was still a way out now i know there isnt and ive started to think much longer term not years but decades my western mentality has always tempted me into the belief that there was a quick fix as the americans like to call it and of course there is one but it always breaks so now ive gone back to my arab way of thinking and ive retaught myself the art of patience my purpose is different now i will crush them but in the end what about the immediate problem you had with your saudi friend faisal yes i wanted to thank you for being so discreet with the british said yacoub they put me under a lot of pressure said falcon theyve even brought in mark flowers dont go near him said yacoub he has the smell of rot about him tell me how things went with faisal that was part of the test that was why the gicm sent me to london they want to see where my loyalties lie said yacoub one of the things they feel sure about the western mind is that it has grown soft soft as in sentimental they believe that westerners no longer have the necessary endurance for duty they attribute it to a decadent culture in which love money family all the things that a westerner would betray for now have greater value than political patriotic religious and moral beliefs the westerner has become a victim of the importance of self in their minds and so they wanted to see where on my integral scale did my son and lover appear compared to what they consider to be more manly beliefs were there any surprises said falcon theyve forced me to think said yacoub its been humiliating and exhilarating the food arrived the waiter set down the plate of squid some chips and salad bread and a glass of beer youre looking stricken javier said yacoub is what im saying bothering you if weve gone soft and as you say lost sight of our beliefs why are you fighting for us what are you fighting for thats a good question any soldier needs to know what hes fighting for said yacoub before i went into this i thought i knew its only having been on the inside by concentrating on what im fighting against that ive understood and its not saddam hussein and osama bin laden theyre like phantoms now but is it what bush tried to replace those ogres with that ultimate western ideology so while i watched young men blowing themselves up killing their fellow muslims because of an intense religious belief i asked myself am i fighting for freedom and democracy isnt that part of it you know who soldiers fight for said yacoub each other the guys in their platoon they dont crawl out to a wounded comrade for democracy they dont mount an assault on an enemy position because of freedom of speech and you asked falcon you dont have a platoon i only have those closest to me and i realize that in this respect i am a westerner ideology breeds fanatics and fanatics compete with each other to be more fanatical until all the original clarity of their ideology has gone said yacoub the fanatics have damaged me by taking away what is dear to me and i will hold them to account for it i know my enemy now ive lived with the narrowness of their minds seen their vision of the future heard their uncompromising views ive had to absorb their ruthlessness too and now im beginning to make it my own falcon finished the food downed the beer yacoub made his every action seem banal the waiter came over with the cafe solo and a glass of water took away the detritus of the meal youve changed said falcon as i said you can intellectualize as much as you like when youre on the outside but i only found out the emotional truth by being on the inside said yacoub this feeling of purpose i have is from knowing that im fighting for those i love not revenge revenge too but its not the only driver said yacoub the disturbing and unsettling reality is that love is the other driver im not sure that love and revenge arent inextricably entwined but what about you javier what are you doing here you didnt bring me here to talk about this maybe the gicm are right and we westerners have gone soft said javier last night i turned my back on all my principles i negotiated with criminals stole evidence allowed myself to be corrupted and finally i walked away from murder why not revenge said falcon just love whose love consuelos and because i love her son dario and what has the boy got to do with any of this hes been kidnapped yacoub stiffened on the other side of the table and leaned slowly across to look at falcon who told him everything down to the whole horror of the previous night which came back to him with surreal intensity so if the russians havent got the boy who has asked yacoub i think hes in morocco why because one of those threatening calls i took after seeing you in madrid told me that something would happen and when it did i would understand my responsibility for it and that i would recognize it and now i do recognize it dont you arturo asked falcon using yacoubs longforgotten spanish name when did they take him when i was with you in london said falcon they took him from a football club shop in the sevilla fc stadium while his mother was on her mobile phone the two men were staring at each other alive as hunting hawks not daring to blink and you think the gicm are responsible asked yacoub i dont know they could be what would they gain from it to mess up my head to put me under pressure to make sure that my attention was diverted elsewhere said falcon so that they could achieve what they wanted with their new recruit and go on say it to screw up my relationship with you said falcon because i would know that the only reason it had happened was because of our involvement with each other so theyre testing your resolve too said yacoub and what have they found that while love and family ties can be considered soft and sentimental said falcon they have also throughout history driven us to as savage a ruthlessness as any ideology or religious fanaticism listen to me javier said yacoub fixing him from across the table with his dark eyes you must not reveal under any circumstances what i told you in london it is vitally important if you do i can guarantee that you will never see dario again what the hell does that mean said falcon i thought your strategy had worked and this saudi thing was over it is over for the time being but the intelligence services still want to know what happened said yacoub and believe me they will set everyone on you to find out what ive told you but you must not tell them so you know where dario is no i dont but i think i know what this is about and i will find out where he is said yacoub standing up they embraced at the table yacoub kissed him on the cheek one thing i dont understand said falcon is why you told me all that stuff in london when you knew it could be so dangerous to you first of all you are my only true friend said yacoub and strange to say there are some things that can only be safe in the hands of a good friend secondly it was imperative to me that you would be the one person who would know and understand the whole truth on the road from osuna to seville tuesday th september hrs driving back to seville falcon talking on the mobile to ramirez the sun low in the sky the glare so penetrating that it hurt even through sunglasses or was it something else twitching in the back of his mind alongside dario making him uneasy where are you jose luis im in the control tower at the airport the private jet hired by iithorizonte is due in around five past seven said ramirez the flight plan out has just been logged for tomorrow theyre going to malaga taking off at midday el pulmon in the cells detectives serrano and baena theyre parked outside the andalucian parliament building waiting for alejandro spinola to come out said ramirez subinspector perez is in a car outside the town planning office on the isla de la cartuja because one of my contacts in the town hall told me that the mayor has a meeting there at seven thirty and youve been in touch with the manager of the hotel one minor development there horizonte called earlier today and dropped one of the ordinary suites and booked the presidential suite instead yours for two thousand five hundred euros a night said ramirez thats got to be for someone important said falcon theres a dinner booked for eleven oclock ten people in a private room again under the name horizonte what about the other guests theres an american couple under the name of zimbrick a german couple under the name of nadermann and three booked in spanish names sanchez ortega and cano said ramirez two of those have already notified them of a late arrival whos made a booking in the last fortyeight hours sanchez and ortega said ramirez and horizonte made that alteration anything else i should know horizonte have also reserved the conference room and cinema before dinner for one hour and asked for dvd projection facilities to be available so it looks as if were right about it being a big new construction project said falcon first theyll have the site inspection then the video of what its going to look like followed by the celebratory dinner and maybe even the signing ceremony horizonte have specifically asked that six bottles of cristal vintage champagne be made available after the dinner this isnt just another stepping stone in the negotiating process said falcon this is the big moment and its why the contents of vasili lukyanovs briefcase were so crucial but without the disks what can the russians do asked ramirez falcon winced behind his sunglasses was he going to start lying to his righthand man this was what he told suspects the first lie begets a hundred others and nothing sticks in your mind like the truth the meeting ive just been to in osuna was about the abduction of dario he said i dont think the russians have him im nearly certain that hes in morocco cni business said ramirez inspector jefe tirado of the grume told me theres still been no contact from the abductors and if the russians were trying to influence the outcome of this meeting with the mayor tonight theyd need those disks which are still in our safe which could mean that at least one of the mafia groups has copies said falcon so we have to assume that is the case he was appalled at the smoothness with which hed plastered over that little crack if the russians are going to muscle in on this deal said falcon theyre not going to do it in the business park on the isla de la cartuja with all its security if it happens itll be in the hotel maybe we should get backup said ramirez fuck comisario elvira we cant put our own people backup will involve elvira and well still be briefing him by the time the meeting takes place in a couple of hours time said falcon and besides the russians arent going to go in there guns blazing this isnt gang warfare theyre going to put pressure on the horizonteiit consortium these are civilized people who scare very easily we also have to keep our strategy quiet because if the russians have informers in the guardia civil im sure they have them in the jefatura as well i was thinking more in terms of securing the hotel so that the mayor can have his meeting and sign the deal in peace said ramirez the mafia dont get a look in none of our people have to take any risks perfect as long as the deal is totally legitimate said falcon alejandro spinola has created a question mark over that how do you think comisarios lobo and elvira are going to take it when a corruption scandal of this magnitude hits the press badly said falcon but the attraction of this scenario to me is that its likely that the extortion will be done by senior mafia group members viktor belenki and possibly even leonid revnik himself for once we might actually catch some major players committing serious crimes rather than picking them up for moneylaundering or running illegal businesses said falcon and in the fallout i think were going to find answers to the seville bombing too right i forgot its all connected said ramirez where are you now on the outskirts of seville im going into the jefatura just keep me informed of any developments he hung up continued driving into the sun something about his conversation with yacoub still bothered him but there was too much going on for him to pick it out of his memory and anyway it was less to do with words and more to do with a feeling about yacoub there was a lot of traffic on the ring road taking him from east to west seville he suddenly had to concentrate and it was at this moment that the voice chose to call how are you getting on with our last two disks im just heading over to the jefatura to see what progress the it department are making on them they might be available now weve been able to comply with all your requests said the voice what round up all the perpetrators of the seville bombing including nikita sokolov and his two friends said falcon incredulous i find that hard to believe as we told you yuri donstovs operation was in the process of being closed down and whats happened to yuri donstov himself he has disappeared are you sure you dont mean terminated said falcon remember i had a very special insight into the workings of your organization yuri donstov saw the way things were going and decided that disappearing was more advisable than the alternative although the alternative is only a question of time were going to have to interview all these people youve brought together for me interview them why theyll be arriving with signed confessions we have to establish that youre sending us the right people said falcon their confessions have to satisfy a court of law youre not just being demanding now inspector jefe said the voice youre being impossible the jefaturas it department have been hard at work deciphering those disks theyve brought in some mathematics professors and interpol and it wont be long before theyll be approaching the intelligence community back at the jefatura he went straight to the it room the two disks were still in use so far theyd made no significant progress theyd contacted the cni who were sending someone down to take a look he went upstairs to his office sat at his desk the wall chart my god he was looking forward to tearing that down it depressed him thats what alicia aguado had said in his later sessions with her contemplation of the past induces depression but who are you without a past falcon had always thought that if you had a past full of joy you wouldnt mind contemplating it aguado countered if you only had joy to contemplate youd learn nothing until you reached the point where you questioned your relative happiness hed thrown up his hands the unexamined life is not worth living she quoted is this the philosophical inspector jefe said pablo leaning against the door jamb of his office i was wondering what had happened to you said falcon ive been spending too much time on the ave i came down from madrid with our softwareencryption specialist said pablo you dont call us any more javier so i have to seek you out and force you into facetoface meetings im not avoiding you said falcon im just busy not helped by having to drive out to osuna this afternoon are you following him or me him of course said pablo you dont represent a threat nor does yacoub said falcon who briefed pablo on his rogue agents mental state and his resignation to a future of longterm dissimulation agents like yacoub have to go through this phase said pablo were trained for it in the service and plenty of people fall at that fence this isnt a game that you pack up and put away its not suspended reality like a good novel or a great film its a whole life to lead in a certain way and very few people are suited to it and even those who are suited to it necessarily go through this well its almost a grieving process i suppose saying farewell to the simple life involves anger despair sorrow anxiety depression all those emotions that we associate with the loss of something or someone important to us and the only way out of it is to replace it with something that gives us purpose and what happens to people like yacoub when this purpose hes so carefully cultivated disappears do you mean been accomplished thats the easier question to answer said falcon what i mean is that now he is setting out with this new resolve but he is just one man surrounded by numerous enemies he will be constantly tested hes already resigned himself to the loss of his family now all he has is his purpose which given the need for constant pretence and lying must inevitably get whittled away inevitably because were not talking about a job pablo this isnt professionalism acumen or managerial skill this is about who you are soul you mean said pablo smiling yes that probably is what i mean if i could be certain what soul was but whatever it is it needs nourishment and that normally comes from the people around you who you love and who love you thats finished for yacoub so its a question of how long his soul can last on a nourishment of say revenge a long time until you go mad said falcon falling back in his chair suddenly tired of all this dialogue where did it get him words and language had such constraints as their use of the word soul had just demonstrated do you know where his son is asked falcon hes still in london whats he doing there what youd expect any kid of his age to be doing said pablo eating out bars night clubs mi even sent some of their girls to talk to him they danced all night had a great time not exactly islamic behaviour from abdullah he has his cover said pablo even the terrorists went to bars drank beers and talked to girls is that all hes doing no other activity six months is the minimum wed expect for an agent of his age to become active said pablo it would make mis job a lot easier if they knew abdullahs proposed target there is no target any more said falcon this was all a test of yacoubs loyalty to the cause once a target always a target said pablo if yacoub and his target are out of danger you shouldnt mind telling us we didnt discuss that what did you discuss he said he was going to help me find consuelos son how can he help you with that because i think the gicm have got him said falcon and regretted saying it instantly they would only kidnap dario to put pressure on you said pablo coming fully into the office for the first time his curiosity piqued why would they want to do that the kidnapper said i would recognize it said falcon in other words i would see the similarity between dario a son of raul jimenez being abducted and arturo another son now known as yacoub also having been kidnapped thirty years ago when he was a similar age the caller said we would never hear from them again which was something that happened in the original arturo case too thats in your personal context said pablo im interested in what it means in our context thats the point though its meant to be personal but why i dont understand why even on a personal level said pablo what is the point youre not even sure yourself are you i mean i can see the similarities between arturoyacoub and dario in that they share the same father but i dont see the motive apart from putting pressure on my relationship with yacoub said falcon that hasnt worked you seemed to be closer than ever in osuna according to our surveillance what about hes punishing yacoub by recruiting his son and hes punishing me by taking dario the closest ive ever come to having a son he who is he i mean the gicm do you know him asked pablo suddenly suspicious the person who is doing this no how could i he knows you said pablo but the fact is you are not concentrating on yacoub your attention has been diverted am i right i think i am since london last saturday the only time hed thought about yacoub was as he drove consuelo back to her house early this afternoon when it finally occurred to him what the phrase you will recognize it might mean in the landscape of his mind over the last seventytwo hours the foreground had changed but the background had been constant whenever the foreground lapsed dario sprang immediately to mind youre right said falcon and now its changed the pressure is off yacoub is it said pablo to himself again has it changed abdullah is in london having a great time yacoub is at a fashion show in marbella he was calm you said completely why do people whove been very anxious suddenly become calm because what was making yacoub anxious is no longer imminent said falcon but it also happens to people when theyve been decisive said pablo when theyve finally made up their mind falcons mobile vibrated on the desktop creeping towards him with each ring tone he took the call there were only two men on the private jet which just landed said ramirez our old friends from the disks juan valverde and antonio ramos but no sign of the american consultant charles taggart were following their mercedes back into town now any movement on alejandro spinola hes already arrived at the town planning office said ramirez and i presume thats where were heading ill be there in ten minutes said falcon and hung up pablo had lapsed into silence and was hunched over thinking with a frightening intensity ive got to go pablo said falcon but i need some help from you what help i might want to send some shots through of people we need to identify pablo scribbled an email address on a scrap of paper ill call them make sure its ok thanks ill see you later said falcon its not finished javier i know its not finished you have to tell me falcon came right up to the brink and got into a struggle with his old self the conservative dutybound bythebook inspector jefe all he had to do was say the word saudi and it would all be over he knew who would win there had never been any doubt in his mind it was just a small test hed set himself theres nothing to tell he said and left the office seville airport tuesday th september hrs the large black mercedes containing the men identified by ramirez as juan valverde boss of iit europe and antonio ramos the chief engineer of horizonte drove directly from the airport to the isla de la cartuja lying across the river from the old city this was where the expo had taken place it had now been transformed into an area of prime commercial real estate the car waited at the heliport where it was joined by another mercedes the two drivers got out smoked and chatted four minutes later a helicopters faint rhythmical beating could be heard coming from the south the clatter of blades grew louder and the drivers turned their faces as the helicopter swept in dipped momentarily and amid a violent thrashing and rucking up of dust settled its runners delicately on the painted yellow h as the blades came to rest an employee from the heliport trotted up and opened the door to the helicopter two men got out one was a corporate spaniard in a light grey suit white shirt blue tie the other clearly american in jeans a blue buttondown shirt with a light sports jacket folded over his arm in the thirtymetre walk to the cars ramirez got four good closeups of both men with his digital camera the two men got out of the mercedes shook hands with the new arrivals who had an air of seniority about them they accompanied them to the second mercedes the heliport employee handed over a couple of suit carriers and two small cabin cases to the driver who had the door to the car already open the two men got in juan valverde and antonio ramos returned to their mercedes the drivers got behind their steering wheels the cars took off while ramirez drove ferrera sat in the back and downloaded the images from the camera on to her laptop the mens faces meant nothing to her when they came into the wifi area near the townplanning management offices she sent the shots and her mobile number to the email address that falcon had phoned through some minutes ago ramirez pulled up outside the town planning office on avenida carlos iii just next to the heliport picked up falcon who got into the passenger seat ferrera handed him the laptop with an image of the two men he shook his head they looked out at the two mercedes nobody moved until the double doors of the town planning office opened and alejandro spinola led three people out the first was the mayor who was followed by a man and a woman shes the head of agesa the company responsible for the isla de la cartuja said ferrera hes the head of town planning everybody got out of their cars there were warm insincere greetings all round the unknown american smiled with perfect teeth and treasured any hand offered to him in both of his he didnt seem to have any trouble speaking spanish after a few minutes they dispersed to their cars and the mayors mercedes joined the convoy which headed down calle francisco de montesinos the cars pulled up at the spanish discoveries pavilion from the expo site the group gathered in front of the building walked around it and then down to the river going as far as the puente de la cartuja the cars met them again outside the monasterio de santa maria de las cuevas picked them all up and drove into the secure fencedoff area of the business park they arrived at a vacant lot in a prime location again the group gathered and walked around what do you think theyre doing asked ferrera theres nothing to see its like some papal delegation come to bless the site more like corporate jackals come to spray their territory said ramirez ive read something about the pavilion that they want to convert it into a museum and build apartments down by the river said falcon and my sister who knows everything there is to know about property in seville told me that the site were looking at now is the prime piece of real estate on the isla de la cartuja and is reserved for a bank to build a twentystorey office building on it the cars left the secure business park and crossed the camino de los descubrimientos and pulled up next to the pavilion of the future the delegation got out and walked the full length of the pavilion heading away from the isla magica amusement park towards the auditorium on the way back they cut through into some parkland on the other side at this point there was much armspreading and genuine excitement at the prospect of superb views of the river this is where theyre going to make a lot of money said ramirez all this belongs to the isla magica amusement park but they dont use it said falcon theres been talk for years of making this into an area for offices shops and hotels well theyve just given us a tour of the biggest building project to happen in seville in the last fifteen years said ramirez the sun had set by the time the delegation went back to their cars detective serrano followed spinola and the mayor ramirez stuck with the two mercedes containing the members of the iithorizonte consortium within minutes the two mercedes had crossed the flood plain heading out of seville and were on the road towards huelva ferrera took a call on her mobile serrano says the mayors delegation has split up back at the town planning office he should stick with spinola and he can tell perez to go home twenty minutes later the two mercedes pulled up at the gate to the hotel la berenjena whose emerald sprinklerkissed lawns stuck out in the brown sunburnt countryside ramirez glided past turned round in a petrol station a hundred metres further on give them a quarter of an hour to settle and well go and introduce ourselves to the manager said falcon another call for ferrera she listened jotted things down hung up that was the cni theyve confirmed the id of the helicopter occupants the spanish businessman in the grey suit is alfredo manzanares the new chief executive officer of the banco omni the american is cortland fallenbach one of the coowners of iit in the usa they also thought wed like to know that it was announced just an hour ago that the banco omni have acquired a controlling stake in the banco mediterraneo which has five million customers and will be transferring its headquarters to a site in seville in fucking hell said ramirez this really is coming together when lucrecio arenas and cesar benito were alive they must have promised the russians a slice of this construction project in return for their dirty work on the seville bombing that was probably just part of it said falcon yuri donstov was gearing up lukyanov was being brought in to run the girls another guy to run casinos while donstov himself already controlled the drugs and sokolov would be running the protection rackets for the shops and restaurants they were preparing to claim the russians reward for providing the violence in the seville bombing which was a large slice of the income from tourists recreational activity and if the right political party had taken power it probably wouldnt just be seville but the whole of andalucia can you imagine how much money would be involved in running gambling prostitution drugs and protection throughout the whole of the andalucian tourist industry so the russians are very disappointed that their partners are not in control of the andalucian state parliament said ramirez but what are they hoping to get out of this situation here lucrecio arenas and cesar benito the people they had agreements with are dead and we reckon the russians themselves were their executioners now weve seen the projects that the banco omni and horizonte have got on the isla de la cartuja we know theyre legitimate they have to be the press will be all over them after the public relations disaster that lucrecio arenas dragged them through banco omni are going to make sure everything is whiter than white horizonte might have had to pay some backhanders to get the work but thats no different to anywhere in the world how are these russians hoping to fit themselves in blackmail i think thats a fairly standard mafia ploy said falcon here we are a few hours before the signing ceremony and some big guys pay you a visit in your hotel room show you a dvd of yourself having sex and taking drugs and say this is the subcontracting agreement youre going to sign or well spoil your show maybe worse how do you think alejandro spinola is involved asked ferrera i know he introduced marisa moreno to esteban calderon and that connection was an important element in the seville bombing conspiracy said falcon im sure he was put up to that by the russians as far as this building project goes hes in a unique position working for the mayor to be able to give the russians or horizonte valuable inside information we dont have any proof that spinola was a friend of arenas and benito said ramirez but he clearly knows juan valverde and antonio ramos hopefully tonight well prove that hes the link between the russians and the iithorizonte consortium said falcon but youll notice that there are two important people missing from all this dodgy dealing alfredo manzanares from banco omni and cortland fallenbach the owner of iit said ferrera and one of the projects in the contract is the construction of banco omnis highrise presumably with banco omnis money said ramirez manzanares will want everything above board said falcon which is where it will probably all go wrong for spinola and therefore the russians which could result in violence or spoiling the show said ferrera i dont want to repeat myself said ramirez worried but we could really use some backup for this operation lets look at the security arrangements when we get there said falcon and we have to remember jose luis its quite possible that nothing will happen at all they checked their watches ramirez pulled out of the petrol station and drove back to the hotel entrance falcon phoned ahead the gates opened as they arrived and they drove up to a large senorial house a bell boy told them where they could park the car out of sight they got out stretched their legs expensive cooking smells wafted out of the kitchens the bell boy took them through the kitchens and into the managers office behind the reception area the hotel manager was with his head of security they laid out a plan of the hotel the main building had a large patio in its centre around which was the reception area a restaurant with three private dining rooms a set of toilets a conference room a cinema with another set of toilets two shops one for perfume the other for jewellery an art gallery with a further set of toilets and the main security office in the grounds were the nine suites and the presidential suite each suite was a flatroofed bungalow with a large bedroom and bathroom a living room with dining facilities a sauna and minigym outside each suite was a car port a private terrace and a small swimming pool there was another larger swimming pool in the palmerie which was the centrepiece of the garden on the other side of that was the presidential suite which was a twobedroomed house with bathrooms dining room living room kitchen and full staff outside it had its own gym sauna hot tub swimming pool terrace and bar this is where the king and queen stay when they come said the manager the head of security showed them the extent of the perimeter fence which consisted of fivecentimetrethick steel bars two and a half metres high topped with razor wire there was a threemetrewide dog run on the other side and a further fence every metre of the perimeter fence was filmed by cctv cameras which were under constant supervision in the screen room of the main security office we provide the minimum requirement said the head of security but if we have ministers or heads of state they will usually bring their own people have this horizonteiit group brought any of their own people with them or made any special security requests the security man shook his head if you want to move around the hotel without drawing attention to yourselves you should wear the staff uniform said the manager black trousers white shirt black waistcoat for men and a black belted dress for women do you know what the mayors delegation are doing after the event asked ramirez theyre all going back to the city the car bringing them will wait how many security guards patrol the grounds four in the grounds two in the main building one of whom looks after the cctv screens said the head of security all armed what could go wrong asked ramirez cheerfully the manager looked at him nervously they shook hands and the head of security took them on a tour of the main building he described what the mayors group would be doing where and when drinks and canapes at ten oclock in the conference room a halfhour show in the cinema at ten thirty followed by dinner in a private dining room at eleven they inspected the projection room at the back of the theatre and were introduced to the technician who had just been briefed by antonio ramos the chief engineer of horizonte as to what was required and been given the necessary dvd showing the proposed construction project theyd completed the soundsystem test and were ready to go outside in the lush gardens privacy was the theme of the nine suites once inside or out on the terrace there was no sense of there being a neighbour a good thirty metres separated each suite at night security guards were told not to walk in the lit areas but to keep to the dark theres camera entry to each suite said the head of security and light sensors if you approach the front door or terrace falcons team went back to the security office and changed into their staff uniforms in the toilets the only problem was for ferrera who had nowhere to put her gun in the simple black dress falcon and ramirez tucked theirs down the backs of the trousers and covered them with the waistcoats ferrera left her revolver in the security office went to reception to check on the changes in the reservations saw taggarts cancellation and fallenbachs booking of the presidential suite on the way back she took a call on her mobile alejandro spinola has just left home in a taxi said ferrera coming into the security office hes heading out of the city on the huelva road looks as if hes coming early detective serrano wants instructions i dont want any more people in here or itll look too crowded said falcon they should wait down the road in that petrol station we were in they went into the cctvscreens room with the head of security why are all these screens on the right dark asked ramirez they only light up if the sensor on the terrace of any of the suites is triggered said the screen supervisor nobodys sitting out at this time of night so theyre all dark how does it work with guests arriving asked ramirez when they make the booking they give their car registration model and colour and the number of people who will be staying when a car arrives at the gate we check it against our list and if it complies let it in if we have vips staying and they bring in other guests well ask them to roll down the window and identify themselves to the camera our guest list today have not asked for anything unusual so well admit everybody on the vehicle registration of course we have another opportunity to check the people in the car when they arrive at reception in fact heres a car arriving now a dark bmw had pulled up at the gates the guard at the screens checked it against his list let it in this is the guest party registered as sanchez he said the car came up the drive parked in front of the main building a young woman got out of the passenger side of the car she was tall with extraordinary long legs and was wearing fourinch heels her hair bounced on her shoulders as she made her way to the reception no secret cameras in the bedrooms asked ramirez ferrera hit him on the arm names asked falcon isabel sanchez and stanislav jankovic shes spanish hes a serb said the guard the woman appeared on the screen at reception handed over her id and her partners passport can we isolate her face asked falcon download it and send it back to our organized crime experts cortes and diaz in the jefatura who do you think it is on the basis of cortess description of viktor belenkis girlfriend as fucking gorgeous i thought she might be worth checking out said falcon ferrera went to take her laptop out the guard at the screens told her not to bother he downloaded the image pasted it into an email and sent it off to diaz thirty seconds later diaz was on the line confirming isabel sanchez as their informer known as carmen so this serb stanislav jankovic is in fact viktor belenki righthand man to leonid revnik said ramirez do you have any cameras outside the front doors to the suites so we can pick up his face once inside the car port they have total privacy said the head of security but of course they can check the identity of someone coming to their door with the camera entry system this must be alejandro spinolas taxi arriving at the main gate said ferrera what do you do in this scenario asked ramirez he has to identify himself and state his business said the head of security alejandro spinola got out of the cab and pressed the buzzer identified himself to the camera he was told to go to reception they opened the gates isabel sanchez had her room key by now went back to the car which moved off to her suite and reversed out of sight into the car port alejandro spinola arrived in reception the cab returned to the front gate we can do voice in reception as well said the guard that being where were most likely to have conflict the guard at the screens flipped a switch they heard spinola ask to speak to antonio ramos the receptionist put a call through spinola spoke to ramos inaudibly the receptionist summoned a bell boy any ideas what this is about asked ramirez i should think it means that the russians have got their hooks into spinola possibly some time ago said falcon theyve told him who appears on the disks and hes going to use that information to the best of his ability to blackmail the iithorizonte consortium round to the russian way of thinking said ramirez hes leaving it late in the day nothing like an imminent contractsigning to speed up the process said falcon hes giving them fortyfive minutes to agree to the russiansw demands with fallenbach breathing down their necks i think you could call that brinkmanship the bell boy appeared leading spinola down the path viktor belenki came out of his suite and lit a cigarette got spinolas attention nodded go in close on belenki said falcon send a shot of him back to diaz just to check even in black and white belenki was impressive with blond hair and high cheekbones and an animal muscularity under a white shirt and black trousers he paced in leisurely fashion up and down outside his suite smoking all the while taking the night air spinola went into ramoss suite several minutes eased past diaz called to confirm that the socalled serb jankovic was viktor belenki look at the state of valverde said ramirez juan valverde the iit europe boss came out of his suite fists rammed into the pockets of his towelling robe which gaped to show a pair of brief swimming trunks his jaw was set and he looked thunderous under knitted eyebrows he walked across to antonio ramoss suite hes had at least some of the bad news said ramirez viktor belenki started on his third cigarette suddenly he stood still a development juan valverde came out his towelling robe now done up tight looking less ominous more scared antonio ramos followed him staring into the path as if he couldnt quite believe this was happening to him they walked quickly over to alfredo manzanaress suite i wouldnt involve the banker at this stage would you asked ramirez we dont know how spinola has put the russians proposal to them said falcon valverde and ramos must have a good relationship with their bankers if not manzanares personally theyre either going to try talking him round or invoke the earlier agreement whatever that was between his predecessor lucrecio arenas and the russians viktor belenki seemed content with the way things were going he dropped his cigarette crushed it underfoot and hands in pockets kicked it on to the grass are you seriously expecting violence here asked the head of security reacting to the tension in the room by all accounts were dealing with some very unpredictable people said falcon but hes just one guy isnt he we dont know said falcon there is no existing photograph of leonid revnik and only a gulag shot of yuri donstov although he does have extensive tattoos if we can get that close the only instantly recognizable mafia man we can identify is nikita sokolov an exweightlifter another party at the gate said the guard at the screens this is the ortega couple the car came through the gates and up to the main building a man and a woman got out went into reception they were both in their late forties obviously spanish senora ortega had an extensive list of demands which she elaborated during the checkin process you cant invent a woman like that said ramirez so only the cano party still to arrive and alejandro spinolas dinner companions the mayors delegation did you see the zimbricks or the nadermanns when they came in asked falcon sure said the man at the screens they looked like tourists do you have copies of their passports on the screen over here said the head of security falcon clicked through the nadermanns but his hand faltered at the second american passport belonging to a nathan zimbrick staring out of the screen was mark flowers have you got anywhere on the property which would do as a lockup asked falcon clearing the screen unable to compute what the cia agents presence meant weve got some staff buildings down by the perimeter fence where drivers can sleep said the head of security theres a room there we could use to keep people until the guardia civil can come and take them away fifteen minutes passed viktor belenki went inside came back out in an expensivelooking suit and tie valverde and ramos left manzanaress suite on their own hunched not talking body language declaring their complete failure they headed off to the presidential suite so alfredo manzanares told them to fuck off said ramirez and then called their boss to tell him his senior executives have been compromised cortland fallenbach knew about this said falcon im sure of it he was only booked in when charles taggarts suite was cancelled said ferrera i dont think this evening was originally a part of his schedule valverde and ramos have been the main contacts for the mayor and the town planning office for a long time so fallenbach probably sees the value in keeping them in place until the deal is signed said falcon then theyre out of their jobs ten more minutes they stared at the entrance to the presidential suite where theyd seen the two men disappear nothing look at belenki said ramirez the russian was leaning slightly forward and staring into the night as if he was beginning to suspect theyd all somehow escaped over the perimeter fence he turned and went into the car port at that moment alejandro spinola came out of ramoss suite at a sprint hed obviously been waiting for belenki to disappear and as ramoss suite was the furthest bungalow from the main building he had a good hundred metres to cover spinolas realized or been told that manzanares has rejected the deal and he doesnt want to get caught in the open said falcon he wants to be safe in a public space to give the russians the bad news belenki came out of the car port crossed the path and headed across the grass to cut spinola off lets go said ramirez wait said falcon lets see where they end up no sense in running around the hotel when we can see it all here the cameras showed two men crossing the patio belenki had his arm around spinola hugging him tight spinola was terrified they went into the toilets by the art gallery no cameras in the toilets said the head of security cristina go and stand outside belenkis suite with your weapon said falcon i dont want him to have a chance of getting back in there ramirez and i will go to the toilets can you back us up the head of security nodded they left the room the shops and art gallery were empty apart from an assistant ramirez told her to go and wait in reception for a few minutes they took out their weapons falcon eased open the door to the toilets ramirez closed it silently behind them no sign of belenki or spinola a harsh guttural voice speaking good spanish came from the last cubicle it was the widedoored disabled toilet i dont know how to impress upon you the importance of this you little piece of shit said belenki did you tell them that this is the deal or there is no deal and they get this no answer apart from a kind of grunting noise they moved towards the cubicle falcon stood poised gun at shoulder height in both hands ramirez readied himself what said belenki a spitting gagging sound from spinola what were both going to do now is pay a visit to alfredo manzanares and explain to him the nature of our earlier agreement said belenki alfredo manzanares is not the only problem said spinola gasping for air cortland fallenbach the owner of iit is here hes the one who has to be persuaded is he said belenki do you think he could be persuaded like this more grunting heavy nasal breathing falcon nodded ramirez took four steps and kicked the door with such a savage blow that it cracked back into the tiled wall with the sound of a rifle shot belenki a hank of blond hair over his forehead was in the middle of the floor he had spinolas tie wrapped around his fist and the man was dangling his knees just brushing the tiles belenkis gun a thick silencer attached was forced hard into spinolas mouth so that his adams apple jumped belenki dropped spinola who fell to his side as if the noise hed heard was the shot that had gone down his throat because his tie was still wrapped around belenkis fist his head hung about a halfmetre from the floor police drop the fucking gun said ramirez his weapon pointed at belenkis chest with intense iceblue eyes belenki looked from ramirez to falcon weighing up all the violent possibilities he let spinolas tie slip slowly from his grip as if preparing himself to move you want to lose an arm viktor asked falcon silence and then the gun clattered to the floor the room seemed to exhale come here said falcon beckoning to belenki face down on the floor hands behind your head belenki got down ramirez frisked him thoroughly found a small firearm in an ankle holster hands behind your back said ramirez and handcuffed him hauled him to his feet they called in the head of security falcon checked belenkis pockets for disks nothing whos with you viktor apart from isabel asked falcon no answer you didnt come alone did you no answer is leonid revnik with you no answer but a slight widening of the eyes take him down to the lockup said falcon start questioning him jose luis see if you can get anywhere ill look after this one hotel la berenjena tuesday th september hrs alejandro spinola was still lying on his side in the disabled toilet shaking the image of the accomplished networker from the mayors office gone for good his mouth was connected to the tiled floor by strings of bloody saliva he was dryretching and crying falcon knelt beside him patted him on the shoulder all right alejandro asked falcon glad to see me this time a nod his fists jammed between his thighs like a little boy whod taken his first bullying on the playground good said falcon lets get you cleaned up spinola stood at the sink looked at himself in the mirror his lips were cut up and swollen and hed lost one of his front teeth an incisor he buried his face in his arms and sobbed wash your face alejandro pull yourself together we have to talk before this little event gets under way falcon helped spinola out of his jacket the shirt underneath was so drenched in sweat that the cotton was transparent while he washed his face falcon asked the receptionist to bring a white shirt spinola lifted the tie over his head and unpicked the dense knot he straightened the material with trembling fingers a girl arrived with a shirt he put it on reconstructed the tie around his neck combed his hair back into place and staring into the mirror touched his tender lips with the tips of his fingers im finished he said and his stomach started juddering with emotion youre alive and viktor belenki is out of the game said falcon patting him on the shoulder when did he first talk to you about his plans for russian involvement in the isla de la cartuja construction projects in august said spinola thighs shivering uncontrollably we met in marbella what did he tell you that he had valverde ramos and the american taggart on film fucking whores and taking drugs said spinola all i had to do was line up the iithorizonte consortium to make sure it tendered the best possible bid and he would sort out the rest which meant that you leaked information about the other bids to whom antonio ramos horizontes head of construction he was the guy who was putting the building project together couldnt they have sorted all this out before today alfredo manzanares has only been in charge of the bank for a fortnight the whole financing of the horizonte deal was being discussed with other parties from dubai then the big boss in the us cortland fallenbach stepped in and said he wasnt going to have a project of this magnitude being financed well he said by the middle east but we all know he meant muslims you know how they feel about nonchristian religions in iit he told antonio ramos that he was going to have to use the banco omni when was this the beginning of this month were the russians involved in the financing from dubai i think they must have been but i dont know said spinola they were furious when it was taken away from dubai so the russians lost their way into the building project through the financing laundering their money in the process and had to try a different tactic alfredo manzanares as the financier wanted all contractors on the job to have pristine track records hes hardline opus dei and after the seville bombing with all its associations with lucrecio arenas and the catholic kings shit he wasnt going to allow anything that had the faintest stink about it so telling him he had to use viktor belenkis construction companies was never going to work i dont know how valverde and ramos put it to him but that in effect is what they would have been asking him to accept this evening all right that gives us some vital background detail on tonights event said falcon now i just want to clarify why you introduced marisa moreno to your cousin esteban calderon last year i was told to said spinola i didnt understand what it was all about at the time i couldnt have known the implications except that you knew youd been asked by members of a criminal organization to introduce a woman to the leading instructing judge in seville said falcon you might not have known about the intended bombing or iness murder but you knew you were giving gangsters access to a very important person in the justice system why did you do it did they have you on film with your pants down a single guy no i dont think so he shook his head sniffed falcon rummaged through spinolas jacket rammed his hands into his trouser pockets spinola put up no resistance found it a sachet of white powder coke spinola nodded is that it said falcon you did all this for some coke spinola stared into the sink choked up again he blurted out a few more sobs as the sudden vision of his collapsed career and spoiled life came to him again i dont get paid very much he said what little i make i gamble you know what gambling is like inspector jefe anything else asked falcon sensing there was more how do you feel about your cousin the brilliant lawyer spinola doubled over as if in agony rested his head on the edge of the sink ive lived in that fuckers shadow all my life he said do you have any idea what its like to have your father holding up this guy all the time as someone to aspire to when you know that hes been a firstclass bastard all his life ok said falcon calming him down lets think about tonight youve done something illegal leaking information on the construction tenders to the iithorizonte consortium is a criminal offence and youre going to have to explain that to the mayor unless he was in on this no no no que no said spinola emphatically he knows nothing nor do agesa or the town planning office right said falcon im going to take you to the security office where youll wait for a guard to take you to the mayor as soon as he arrives tonights event cannot continue under these circumstances and youve got to do the right thing they looked at each other via the mirror spinola nodded they went back to the office together falcon asked the screen supervisor if the mayors delegation had arrived no sign running late falcon needed to get into the sanchezbelenki suite and the head of security might be required for that he got the screen supervisor to call him up and get another guard to take care of spinola anybody else arrived yet senor and senora cano regular types a spanish couple in their sixties the head of security came back they went to the sanchezbelenki suite picked up ferrera standing guard outside on the way falcon pressed the buzzer no answer pressed it again nothing the head of security opened the door as soon as the air in the room touched falcons face he knew they were in trouble blood does something to an atmosphere electrifies it so that other humans know to tread with care the living room was unlit and empty the terrace doors were open the night had moved in moths fluttered and batted against the bedroom door which showed a crack of low light the television was on in the next room falcon drew his gun took four paces across the floor nudged the door open with his foot a reading lamp was casting light on to isabel sanchezs body from the chest down she was wearing bra and panties only perfect figure legs so long and slim they reminded him of a foals her head was in darkness he stepped fully into the room she didnt move he turned on the light that was what was wrong the vision of beauty theyd seen on the cctv screens had gone a hideous black hole where her nose and mouth should have been the light was on in the bathroom too the sound of the shower falcon stepped to his left leaned in there was a hole in the glass panel of the shower cabinet which had several long hairline cracks in it beyond was a man slumped against the marbletiled wall blood still oozing from a hole in the back of his grey head the water from the shower cleaned and recleaned the constant rivulets of blood that ran down his back who the fuck is that asked the head of security on his shoulder this is probably leonid revnik said falcon he must have been hidden in the back seat or the boot when they came in said the head of security cristina ask one of the security guards to take you down to the lockup and get viktor belenki to confirm who this is in his suite be careful have your weapon at the ready theres a killer out there and given the way hes shot isabel sanchez i think its nikita sokolov bring ramirez back with you meet in the security office the head of security sent out an alert to all guards in the grounds falcon gave him a oneline description of nikita sokolov using some toilet paper he turned off the shower over revniks inert body he came in from the back terrace said the head of security but cant have triggered the light sensor back in the security office they went straight into the screen room the screens on the right were all dark the supervisor had seen nothing if you hug tight to the side of the building its possible you wouldnt trigger the light sensor he said run the footage on suite number six said the head of security the supervisor took it back ten minutes the outside light hadnt come on they looked closely and could see only a vague dark movement nothing more has the mayors delegation arrived asked falcon yes they went straight into the cinema said the guard what do you mean spinola was supposed to talk to the mayor as soon as he arrived said falcon and whats happened to the guard looking after him i dont know ive been watching the screens said the supervisor i cant the head of security held up his hand radioed the guard asked the question listened he never showed up he thought responding to my alert about the weightlifter was more important and hes out in the grounds looking for him find spinola you must have him on those screens somewhere i cant believe you didnt see him leave this office said falcon why didnt the mayor have drinks and canapes before the viewing they were running late said the supervisor theres a dinner afterwards all i know is that they were met in the reception area by the guests from the horizonteiit consortium and they went straight into the cinema ramirez and ferrera came in panting and sweating belenkis confirmed its leonid revnik said ramirez is belenki secure asked falcon ive handcuffed him to the bed and the door to the staff quarters is locked theres not much else i could do said ramirez were going to the cinema now said falcon tell us when you find spinola the cinema doors were shut the faint sound of the film presentation came through the wooden soundproofed doors the head of security tapped falcon on the shoulder pointed at the projection room the lock had been shot out they all took out their guns ramirez shoved against the door it wouldnt open there was something jammed up against it on the other side between them they forced it open apart from a dead body on the floor there was another man sitting quite calmly with his legs crossed by the projection equipment mark said falcon nodding flowers said nothing looked tired bags heavy under his eyes the dead man had fallen on his side face turned to the corner of the room whos this asked falcon i dont know said flowers sighing as if this killing had taken something out of him falcon knelt over the dead man who had taken a bullet to the temple falcon fingered his hair felt it was false he eased up the hair piece saw that the man had a head shaved down to the skin what happened here mark the projectionist set the film running and i told her to get out i locked the door after her a couple of minutes later someone tried the door theres no peephole so i couldnt check who it was i stood behind the door he shot out the lock the first thing that came in the room was a gun i recognized it as a ninemillimetre makarov given that sequence of events i didnt bother to ask questions as soon as his head appeared i shot him falcon pulled up the mans jacket yanked his shirt out of his trousers and revealed his naked back which was covered in tattoos some russian lettering a crucifix and angel wings this must be yuri donstov also known as the monk judging by these tattoos said falcon checking the mans pockets which were empty not even a set of keys i assumed from his weapon that he was russian said flowers his exhaustion making him preternaturally calm those tattoos must make him mafia youre going to have to give me your gun mark said falcon flowers reached across to a low shelf under the projection equipment and handed over his silenced gun stand up said falcon handing the gun to ferrera he searched flowers found a disk where did this come from i found it on our russian friend said flowers you know whats on it i think it contains the material we talked about the other night falcon turned to the people behind him mount a guard on viktor belenki look out for the weightlifter nikita sokolov find spinola cristina get some handcuffs and come back here ill talk to the mayor when were ready everybody left falcon nudged the projectionroom door to moved in front of flowers what time is it mark you got me there javier you dont wear the patek philippe when youre working breitling for ops said flowers and that was how you got paid by cortland fallenbach it was an opportunity said flowers shrugging you know were public servants we dont get paid very much and i have a number of exwives i think ive spoken to you about them american exwives are more demanding than european ones and then theres the kids thats a lot of outgoings why do you think i came out of retirement you dont think i prefer fucking around with

what youd call soldiering is it mark what can i say but needs must javier youre here at cortland fallenbachs invitation im his security consultant we got together after you asked me to research iit in june i told him he was going to need help and he agreed what happened tonight he told me that under no circumstances was anybody to interrupt the showing of the iithorizonte presentation movie said flowers but he gave me no indication that it was going to come to this you were armed people calm down when you point a gun at them said flowers and if theyve got one themselves youre even were going to have to put you in the cells until we can speak to the american consul a knock on the door cristina came in handcuffed flowers to the projection equipment stand time for an announcement said falcon you must be a nice guy javier said flowers if it was me id play the dvd and listen to the bastards howl time had flown by and the film at that moment ended falcon raised the lights and shut flowers in the projection room the double doors to the cinema opened and the group filed out led by the mayor who was talking to the banker alfredo manzanares falcon showed him his police id card tried to usher him into the conference room where they were supposed to have had their drinks earlier valverde and ramos intervened blocked the doorway started some vociferous protesting open the projectionroom door cristina said falcon the woman from agesa screamed at the sight of the dead body cortland fallenbach saw mark flowers turned to stone i think youll agree that this needs some explanation said falcon close the door cristina take these people to the private room where they were supposed to be having dinner nobody is to leave that room under any circumstances as you can see there is a killer on the loose detective ferrera is armed the sight of a dead body had subdued the group completely and they went into the private room like a flock of sheep into a slaughterhouse holding pen falcon took the mayor aside into the conference room and had just embarked on his devastating introduction to the evenings events when his mobile went off belenkis been shot said ramirez shot dead there was a hammering on the door a security guard said he was needed up in the main office falcon took the mayor to join the others in the private room where ferrera was standing guard lock the door let nobody in or out he said and left in the security office the supervisor was tapping one of the screens showing the thickset stocky weightlifter nikita sokolov gun in hand striding up to the main building he doesnt care now said the supervisor hes not hiding from the cameras any more hes heading towards the main building so hes not bothered about getting away just yet said falcon he must have come back to meet up with his boss yuri donstov keep the other guests in the restaurant clear the reception area turn the lights off inside keep them on outside whatever happens i do not want this man shot unless its absolutely unavoidable wheres spinola he got out over the main gates said the supervisor hes on the run and we dont have the manpower to go after him falcon called detective serrano who was still waiting with baena in the car in the petrol station nearby he told him to find spinola who would be out on the main road somewhere be careful with him hes in a state you have to make sure he survives no accidents by the time falcon got to the reception area the lights were out in the patio the shops and art gallery were in darkness between him and the main door were two thick marble supporting pillars beyond the pillars were four panels of plate glass two of which were double doors the mayors delegation mercedes was parked outside no driver falcon hid behind one of the pillars he didnt have to wait long nikita sokolov came out of the night his colossal quadriceps straining against the material of his trousers biceps with a thick cord of vein bursting out of his polo shirt which flapped at his waist he had a thick white bandage around his right forearm where el pulmons bullet had grazed him the gun silencer attached was in that hand he tried the door to the mercedes locked he looked through the drivers window swapped his weapon to his left hand and dealt the glass a savage blow with the butt of his gun it bounced off now that his work was done revnik and belenki shot dead his mission completed he was thinking about escape he checked the unlit main building didnt like it he jogged off to his left disappeared back into the darkness falcon told the head of security to stay in the reception area while he sprinted across the patio down a corridor to the kitchens which were totally silent on the outside and a cacophony of brutal swearing hollered orders clattering pans and sizzling fat on the inside he ran down the corridors of stainlesssteel work surfaces diminutive sous chefs with large knives flaming pans blow torches and cleavers glanced over their shoulders as he tore past them he asked after the mayors driver nobody answered he found a plongeur asked if there was a staff dining room the man walked him past boiling cauldrons and flat metal griddles crackling and spitting with hot oil he pointed him to a door with a porthole window at the end of a short corridor said there was an outside entrance as well whats out there the bins falcon looked through the porthole the mayors driver was sitting at the table in the empty room eating there was a window barred on the outside and a door both to the drivers right falcon knelt down crawled into the room the drivers food stopped on its way to his mouth police said falcon carry on eating dont look at me he crawled under the window was just about to get to his feet when the door out to the bins burst open and sokolov came in blue polo shirt hairy arm outstretched white bandage gun safety off finger on the trigger keys he roared hed seen the driver on his own eating wasnt prepared for falcon coming up on his right side who chopped down with his revolver on sokolovs bandaged arm a shot a dull thud and a crack as the bullet went through the wooden table before the silenced gun dropped from sokolovs deadened hand falcon lost grip of his own weapon which scuttled off into the corner the russian turned and crouched and falcon found himself precisely where he didnt want to be facing off against the former olympic weightlifter sokolov charged him caught falcon in the midriff with his shoulder wrapped a steelreinforced arm around his back and lifted him up as if he was nothing more than a cardboard cutout hit him over the head hard falcon yelled at the driver sokolov hefted him to shoulder height and slammed him down on the wooden table the mayors driver jettisoned himself out of his seat reached behind him picked up the metal chair and brought it down so that the edge of the seat made horrific contact with the back of sokolovs head the noise it made was violently musical a pianists mad discord sokolov turned and the driver thought for a moment that hed made a terrible mistake but the light went out of the russians eyes and he crumpled to the tiled floor falcon too was on the floor staring bugeyed at the unconscious russian trying to remember how to breathe the porthole door opened and the plongeur charged in with a shining stainlesssteel cleaver in one hand and a rolling pin in the other damn he said as if hed just missed out on the ultimate culinary experience alejandro spinola was out on the huelva road running towards seville the velvet night air on his sweaty skin the smell of hot dry grasses in his nostrils occasionally he looked behind him but each time he found he was only running away from the dark he wasnt moving very quickly because he was in no condition to his head was full of the junk of his life the wreckage of tonights events he couldnt have faced the mayor he couldnt have faced approaching the mayor and the people from agesa and the town planning office with his bruised lips and missing tooth saying that he had to speak privately to the boss he couldnt bear even the thought of the mayors disappointment in him then there was his father hed have to face him too the whole messy business was going to come out right down to what hed done to his cousin esteban calderon it was going to be intolerable and he wasnt going to face it he was going to run he was going to run and run and not stop until headlights came up slowly behind him stopped he looked back couldnt see anything behind the blinding lights until a man stepped out from behind them running after him who the fuck he tried a sprint but he had nothing in the tank and slowed to a lolloping jog the car started up again pulled alongside him the window down alejandro were the police said the driver come on now just stop and get in the car no sense in this he could hear the other mans footsteps behind him it gave him a surge of panic he saw headlights coming the other way something shrill and exciting rose in his throat he thumped his foot down stopped turned back ducked under the arms of the policeman following him shoved past him slipped round the back of the car and stood up straight between the oncoming headlights the trucks horn blew the night open for three seconds a white light covered spinola from head to toe and the black grille with thirtyfive tons behind it gathered him in with a sickening crunch hotel vista del mar marbella wednesday th september hrs lying on his back on the firm expensive bed pillow supporting his neck phone to his ear yacoub diouri was talking to his sixteenyearold daughter leila they had always got on so well she loved him in the uncomplicated way that a daughter loves her protective father leila and her mother was a different story that was to do with her age but shed always been able to make her father happy and yacoub was laughing but tears were also leaking out of the corners of his eyes trickling down the sides of his face and coiling around the curlicued passages of his ears hed already spoken to abdullah in london whod been annoyed because hed never been so popular with the girls before and hed had to stand outside a club in the dark and cold listening to his father prattling on about matters that could easily wait for when they were back in rabat but he indulged him yacoub was sorry for this not because he would have liked a better conversation but because he knew that abdullah would always remember his irritation and exasperation as the prevailing sentiment of this particular conversation with his father leila said good night passed the phone to her mother whats going on asked yousra its not like you to be calling home while youre away and youll be back here on thursday i know its just that i missed you all you know what its like business madrid one day london the next marbella the day after the endless talk i just wanted to hear your voices talk about nothing hows it

it like outside he asked its dark yacoub its eleven oclock but whats it like is it warm it cant be much different to marbella just go outside and tell me what its like youre in a funny mood tonight she said stepping out of the french windows on to the terrace its warm maybe twentysix degrees what does it smell of the boys have been doing the watering so it smells of earth and the lavender you planted last year is very strong she said yacoub yes are you sure youre all right im fine now he said i really am its been wonderful to talk to you id better go to sleep now long day tomorrow a very long day tomorrow i mean today were two hours ahead here of course so its today already goodbye yousra give a kiss to leila from me and take care of yourself youll be all right in the morning she said but she was talking to no one hed gone she went back inside and before she closed the doors took one last breath of the lavenderinfused night air yacoub swivelled his legs off the bed sat on the edge and buried his face in his hands the tears ran down his palms he wiped them on his bare legs he breathed deeply got his head back together he put on a pair of black stretchcotton jeans a black longsleeved tshirt black socks and a pair of black trainers he wrapped a black sweater around his shoulders he lit a cigarette looked at his watch he turned his bedside light off let his eyes get used to the dark he rested the cigarette on the ashtray went to the window slipped out on to the balcony and looked down into the street the car which had been there for days was still there the driver still awake he shrugged went back in he checked his pockets nothing but the photograph from the side pocket of his suitcase he removed a single ring with four keys he looked around him knowing there was nothing else he needed now took one last drag of the cigarette stubbed it out and left the room he had a powerful sense of relief as he closed the door the corridor was empty he took the stairs down to the ground floor came out into the hotel and immediately went through the door marked staff only it was quiet he walked past the laundry and down a small flight of stairs to the kitchens voices they were wrapping up the dinner service he waited gauging the different sounds then stepped into the corridor ducked underneath the portholes of the double doors and went out into the night and the stink of the rubbish bins he climbed up the metal bin closest to the wall and checked over the top a complication had arisen here on his return from his meeting with falcon in osuna hed been told that the cni had put a car in the street at the back of the hotel as well as the front the car was there now and almost directly opposite the rear exit of the hotel he was going to have to drop over the wall into the street at the side of the hotel and this involved a leap of some two and a half metres he made the jump hit the wall messily smacked his chin but clung on to the top of it with his arms and shoulders cracking under the strain he swung his leg up lay flat on the top gasped looked down empty as he lowered himself the strength drained from his arms and he dropped heavily into the narrow alleyway went over on his ankle and limped to the corner he checked out the car only a driver with his head resting against the window no movement yacoub looked left and right nobody around he ducked and ran along the line of cars found a gap squeezed into it held on to his ankle and waited blood trickled down his chin a car turned into the street headlights swept the tarmac as it passed he crossed the street running low and went straight up the narrow alley opposite he hopped to the next street the vespa and the helmet were locked to a lamp post he used one of the four keys to unlock the heavy padlock and unthreaded the chain from the wheel and helmet he used the second key to start the vespa he wiped out the helmet with his hand put it on it was sticky with the hair gel of the kid whod left it there there was little traffic in the town he set out west heading for a small bay along the coast which was protected from the sea and had shallow waters on the other side of estepona he turned towards the sea he hid the vespa and helmet by the side of the road and limped two hundred metres down to the waters edge where the boat was waiting for him the only light came from the tower blocks of tourism set back from the road above nobody could accuse the gicm high command of having no sense of humour the power boat theyd bought for this mission was called the executioner it was dark blue ten metres long and had twin mercury horsepower engines capable of speeds in excess of kilometres per hour it looked sleek almost flashy as it rocked gently against the small wooden jetty where it was moored he unclipped the awning over the rear of the boat and dropped himself into the cockpit he inserted the third and fourth keys in the ignition panel on the righthand side of the dashboard but did not turn them on he threw the sweater off his shoulders into the passenger seat he opened the hatch leading to the cabin which had been stripped out and a false wall installed yacoub felt his way around to the side peeled back the edge of the carpet he ran his fingers over the wood until he felt the metal ring inset and lifted out a thirtycentimetre square of wood he found the pen torch first turned it on put it in his mouth blood on his hands from his chin he lifted out a compass and a mobile phone which he turned on and a pair of binoculars all that was left was a switch mechanism from which two copper cables emerged he could now see the five jerry cans of fuel strapped to the bulkhead two fivelitre flagons of water and a tupperware box of food the phone was ready one message he opened it nodded turned off the phone and threw it in the cache he checked his ankle fat and soft as a ripe mango back outside he rolled up the awning threw it in the cabin checked the stern lockers more jerry cans of fuel he opened up the two engine hatches he stood in front of the drivers seat and familiarized himself with the gauges switches and controls in the middle of the dashboard was the satnav screen which he would not deploy until he was outside spanish territorial waters he turned on the battery switches and flipped on the blowers he gave them five minutes checked that the shift handles were in neutral and the throttles down all the way he armed the safety switch he turned the ignition keys one click clockwise indicator lights and audible alarms came on for a moment he turned them on to the start position and released the engines came alive with what seemed like a colossal noise in the silent bay the pressure gauge told him that the water flow through the engine was normal and he glanced over the side at the exhaust tips while the engines warmed up he checked the bilge and engine compartments made sure there were no leaks or weird noises he closed the engine hatches he raised the throttles slightly to check response good checked shifters he slipped the moorings pushed himself away from the jetty he put the shifter into forward gear and at very low throttle moved out into the open sea which was almost as flat as the coves protected waters it was warm but he continued sweating even with the gentle cooling breeze the first part of this mission had its difficulties he had no satnav and no moon he had to find a bearing out to sea and get himself out of spanish territorial waters the compass could be illuminated by pressing a button and he did this once a minute to check his course there were a few lights out on the water fishing boats which he had to avoid he himself was unlit he maintained low revs the coastline of the costa del sol gradually revealed itself the lights of estepona appeared to the west it took him more than an hour to get three kilometres from the shore and only then did he open up the throttles a little feeling the eagerness of the two big engines beneath him he scoured the blackness for fishing boats checked his bearing looked back to the east at the lights of fuengirola torremolinos and malaga the danger was different now he wasnt so scared of being picked up by the coastguard but he was entering one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world colossal container ships which could rise forty or fifty metres above the sea coming in from the atlantic or massive liquefied natural gas carriers sailing from algeria to sines on the portuguese coast if they hit him they wouldnt know it he listened and searched the darkness thirty kilometres out he switched on the satnav to see where he was he was supposed to be heading for a point fortyfive kilometres southeast of estepona and about the same distance northeast of the monte hacho just outside the spanish enclave of ceuta on the northeast tip of morocco he was further east than hed anticipated the current much stronger than hed allowed for he was more than fifty kilometres from his rendezvous point with around two and a half hours to go before first light he had to have faith in his instruments there was no longer any coastline to guide him he turned the vessel direction southwest and gave it few more revs he checked all the gauges was puzzled to see the fuel had dropped to threequarters hed been told the tank had a capacity of six hundred litres that the extra jerry cans strapped to the cabin bulkhead and in the stern lockers were just for emergency as he fussed over this new problem a cliff of black metal loomed out of the darkness and he heard the rhythmic thump of massive engines he swung the wheel to his right opened up the throttles put a hundred metres between himself and the towering hull of a dry cargo ship eased back shaken he didnt feel competent in this situation had no real knowledge of the sea or boats couldnt even name things properly what was a cleat he calmed himself desperate for a smoke his ankle throbbed panic rose again as he battled disorientation a sudden queasiness and a tremendous desire not to be out in the middle of a black ocean on what seemed to be a matchstick surrounded by mobile skyscrapers his boat canted and rolled as the vast unseen wake of the ship passed beneath him get the breathing going again dont hyperventilate look at your instruments get back on course proceed as he increased power he winced at every slight modulation of noise coming to his ear every variation in tone of the blackness coming towards him his nerve trailed behind him like a frothy bubbling wake he tightened his grip on the wheel forced himself into a routine he stared at the fuel gauge below threequarters now this boat went through litres an hour at a cruise speed of kilometres per hour he doubted hed been over fifty kilometres per hour the entire trip so how had he gone through a hundred and fifty litres he looked at his watch hed been on the water just over two hours maybe that consumption was normal ignore it dont get obsessive he checked his course raised the throttles the boat surged the darkness parted before him the thought occurred to him that he didnt want to be on a boat with a dead engine and an lpg tanker bearing down panic quivered below his diaphragm he should have worn a nicotine patch couldnt remember when hed last been six hours without a cigarette dont look at the fuel gauge the fuel gauge was at the halfway mark he rapped it with a knuckle there was a problem three hundred and fifty litres in three hours at the speed he was going he pulled back the throttles centred the shift turned off the engines and the battery switches silence the waves slapped at the sides of the boat which lolloped on the water he got down on his hands and knees and sniffed he plugged the torch in his mouth and opened up the engine hatches sniffed was he seriously going to be able to fix a fuel leak he didnt even know if there were tools on board he checked the bilge for the smell of fuel until he wasnt sure what he was smelling any more this had not been part of his training refuelling the boat in mid ocean he turned off the fuel valves closed the engine hatches found the funnel in the stern lockers heaved out a jerry can located the fuel fills on the right of the cockpit slow down think what was he going to gain by this was he just going to pour fuel into the ocean he checked his watch plenty of time the boat rose and fell lets do it he jammed the funnel in fitted a nozzle to the jerry can poured the fuel in looking about himself crazily for approaching walls of metal listening trying to hear above his tinnitus for the distant thump of marine engines hed never felt such physical vulnerability as the fuel chugged into the tank he began to think that what was happening to him now was just a physical expression of his mental condition over the last three months the sense of powerful forces ranged against him happy to crush him without a second thought yet he was unable to see them just living inside his head his tiny inner world desperately clinging to the bits and pieces of his life that made him feel human he changed jerry cans a larger wave jogged the boat fuel cascaded down his leg damn this was dangerous he reconcentrated his efforts poured the last of the second jerry can into the tank thatll do at least he would be able to see if this had made an impression on the fuel gauge he took off his soaked trousers threw them overboard he hosed down the deck reasoned that mid ocean would have aired the cockpit of fumes he washed his hands heart in his mouth he turned on the battery switches he didnt burst into flames he let the blowers run again he looked around spooked himself leapt for the ignition started the engines nothing shit he had just poured fuel into the ocean wait calm down open the fuel valves the engine started he couldnt see with the light of the pen torch still burning faulty images on to his retina he switched it off jammed it in his underpants looked at the fuel gauge had it gone up he checked the satnav hed drifted off course again the currents so strong out here filling up with fuel had cost him nearly two kilometres should he put another two jerry cans in he listened again stared hard into the grainy darkness which rather than remaining stationary seemed to be approaching him how had he talked himself into this insane plan turned off the ignition back to the jerry cans pen torch back in the mouth where was the funnel hed left it sticking out of the tank it must have gone overboard his eyes roved the side where the fuel fills were and it was then that he saw the words saddle tank and main tank he nearly burst into tears with gratitude as he remembered something from his training he knelt down crawled back to the rear bench seats switched the fuel from main tank to saddle tanks engines sounded off to his right he nearly coughed out the pen torch until he saw the container ship pass four hundred metres away he envied those men high up standing in the green light of the bridge having a smoke and a coffee while their radar told them everything back to the satnav he was going southeast fast he started up the engines wheeled the boat round opened the throttles making headway towards the straits of gibraltar he glanced at his watch first light must be coming soon he was desperate for an end to this blindness this sense of impending steel hulls the current must be immensely strong theyd told him it was what did for most small boats full of african immigrants hed seen the bodies once lined up on a beach outside tarifa the guardia civil standing back from the stink he gripped his forehead banished these morbid thoughts the current hed have to overshoot the target by a couple of kilometres and drift back into position he reined in his galloping mind first light would come and all would be well he looked behind him for a glimmer still uniformly black he breathed back another rush of what he thought was panic but then he was laughing giggling uncontrollably as if hed smoked some weed and suddenly seen the hidden absurdity of everyday life he sat back in his seat the hysteria trembled inside him his thoughts quivered on the margins of sanity and with that came an extraordinary calm his trepidation vanished it was as his fatherinlaw had told him before undergoing his heart op in paris you push your fear like a rock up a mountain in the days beforehand and then suddenly they come for you and you deliver yourself into their hands and hope that allah is with them it is the calmest you will ever feel in this life and it happened just when he hadnt been looking for it first light the miracle of the planets the glow spread along the seam of the world ships revealed themselves against the gathering light he would have loved to see land even after a few hours he missed it enormously he couldnt imagine how those lone yachtsmen who circumnavigate the globe could bear the solitude with the endless great unknown beneath them more light twenty minutes to sunrise his fear long gone torn away from him and replaced by the confidence of illumination the target should have left tangier nearly two hours ago he smiled to himself this was going to work the horizon blushed magenta crimson pink and violet glowing yellow and white before creeping into blue which became anil and made his chest ache at the thought of what he would miss a thin streak of grey cloud parallel to the perfect line of the horizon like a stiletto piercing the flesh of a blood orange made his jaw tremble with emotion he was at the rendezvous point he dug out the binoculars surveyed the sea five ships now to the west a tanker to the east a splashing sound ahead caught his attention and he lowered the binoculars a school of dolphin within ten metres of the boat diving and surfacing leaping and plunging he shouted at them for joy the sun came up at the horizon quivered as if a meniscus had to be broken for the red orb to push up into the sky he spread his arms like a jubilant conductor before his orchestra and then turned his back on it surveyed the straits of gibraltar again with the binoculars he was looking for a boat not a big ship although this vessel was sizeable given that it wasnt cargocarrying it was forty metres long about twelve metres high had a moroccan flag and was called the princess bouchra but he still wasnt sure of scale out here even a onehundredandfiftymetre tanker looked like a toy on the water the boat had drifted he manoeuvred her back into position just seven hundred metres northwest he scanned the ocean once more seven ships now to the west four to the east the princess bouchra must be visible by now theyd worked it out meticulously he knew everything about that boat she must have left tangier late he released the binoculars held on to the windscreen of the cockpit checked the satnav perfect position the sun was fully up and out of the water now its heat on his back he stripped off his shirt and threw it behind him he closed his eyes for a moment relaxed them hed worked them hard in the dark he brought the binoculars up to his face opened his eyes one two three four ships stopped went back between three and four a smaller vessel he throttled up moved forward a hundred metres two hundred picked up the moroccan flag at the back moved along to the hull princess bouchra he suddenly needed to piss he throttled back went down into the cabin lifted up the cache turned the switch degrees a red light then a faint wheezing sound came from the point of the hull and a click the red light changed to green primed back in the cockpit binoculars to his face there she was five hundred metres away now he rested the binoculars on his chest reached for the photograph in his back pocket wanted to kiss the memory of yousra abdullah and leila it was in his trousers which hed thrown overboard no matter he kissed them anyway he opened the throttles gradually taking the boat up to full speed the power wanted to force him back into his seat but he remained standing hanging on to the wheel the princess bouchra was getting bigger more to scale hundred metres to go now yacoub wasnt thinking any more he was concentrating on nothing but the porthole in the middle of the starboard side of the boat which he aimed to hit at one hundred and twentyfive kilometres per hour the sea beneath his hull seemed as hard as tarmac the bow smacked the surface juddering his organs the vessel was huge in his vision its white superstructure towering above him he smiled at the wind in his face the thought of being on the other side of going straight through to another dimension shivering through the transparent wall that would make all his suffering appear suddenly absurd his hull and the porthole met he slipped through the fissure of time while the princess bouchra broke in half with a sound that wasnt loud enough for him to hear falcons house calle bailen seville wednesday th september hrs there was something about the intensity of the two vibrating mobile phones on the marble top of his bedside table that seemed more alarming than usual they kissed and came apart like molluscs engaged in some mating ritual falcon wiped his hand down his face asked himself was anyone completely innocent killed last night isabel sanchez he shook his head levered himself up on an elbow grabbed a phone and clamped it to his ear diga finally said pablo dont bother to pick up the other one its me as well i had a late night last night with four murders and two arrests in the space of about one hour and that doesnt include the suicide on the huelva road so i hope youre not going to ask anything complicated of me said falcon ive got a lot on my plate today probably starting with a very ugly interview with comisario elvira theres no easy way to break this to you javier said pablo so ill tell it to you straight yacoub diouri drove a power boat packed with high explosives into the side of a saudi royal family vessel called the princess bouchra at around eight forty this morning silence falcon blinked the captain and crew abandoned ship and were picked up by a passing dry cargo vessel the princess bouchra went straight to the bottom were not sure who was left on board are you sure it was yacoub were absolutely positive said pablo how do you know asked falcon this happened less than an hour ago how can you be so positive listen to the news i just wanted to warn you before you saw it its the only story on all channels said pablo well talk later when youre in the office falcon threw off the sheet sprinted downstairs in his underpants turned on the television sat back in his chair the captain and crew have been taken by helicopter to algeciras where they have been admitted to hospital uninjured but suffering from shock the princess bouchra sank immediately it is believed that four members of the saudi royal family were on board two with government portfolios and two provincial governors we are still awaiting confirmation of their names zap the suicide bomber who has been named as yousef daoudi is believed to have set off from the coastal town of mertil about ten kilometres from the northern moroccan town of tetouan zap the explosion was first reported by the captain of a gas tanker called the inigo tapias at eight fortytwo the position was confirmed later by the coastguard just out of the straits of gibraltar about fortythree kilometres due east of la linea it is believed that there were no survivors encarnacion his housekeeper appeared at the door of his study whats going on javier just trying to get some news the ship that blew up off the costa del sol said encarnacion crossing herself they said on ondacero that it was alqaeda that gave him the idea to try the al jazeera channel encarnacion handed him the post shed picked up by the front door a crew member of the dry cargo vessel which picked up the survivors of the princess bouchra said that he saw the power boat take aim at the luxury cruiser and hit her amidships there was an explosion a massive ball of flame and the princess bouchra broke in two and sank immediately we are still trying to get confirmation who was aboard the vessel it is believed that there were six members of the saudi royal family who were travelling from tangier to marbella a moroccanbased terrorist organization called the gicm the moroccan islamic combatant group have claimed responsibility they have named the assassin as yacoub diouri who we understand is owner and director of a clothes manufacturing company based in sale near rabat in morocco and here to talk to us about these developments is falcon turned off the television let the remote drop to the floor the mail encarnacion had given him scattered across the tiles he leaned forward elbows on knees head viced in his hands trying to force some logic into his stunned brain cells if last night had gone badly this was disaster on an epic scale he felt hollow black and hideously cold inside grief and the horrific repercussions of yacoubs act fought for supremacy in his mind as he stared into the clay tiles and noticed a hotel envelope on the floor the vista del mar in marbella with his address in yacoubs handwriting he picked it up it was stamped with yesterdays date marbella september dear javier by the time you open this you will already have been told about what happened last night in the straits of gibraltar or you will at least have seen it on the news al jazeera is my recommendation for this kind of thing although because it took place out at sea there will inevitably be some confusion the confusion is deliberate and an important part of the plan but rather than starting with confusion let me begin at the beginning and hopefully make everything clear for you first of all i am sorry javier that i have lied to you abdullah has not been and now never will be recruited by the gicm you will remember what i told you in madrid about their ruthlessness i learned about it the hardest way through practical experience i also told you that they were nervous of my nonmoroccan half that was q uite true they did not completely trust me not from the very first moment but they wanted access to faisal so the first thing that happened was that they declared their intention to recruit abdullah to the cause they said he would be proud to join his father in the jihad and they would train him up to be a great mujahideen fighter i was not acting when you saw me in madrid i was completely horrified at this prospect it would of course have been impossible for me to prevent this from happening without revealing myself as an enemy to their cause they having proposed this idea then did nothing about it but rather started talking to me about faisal they approached the subject as if they already knew faisal and that he was if not an active supporter of their cause then at least an ideological supporter and to a certain extent that is true except that faisal has a much broader mind over the weeks this attitude gradually changed and they drew my attention to some of faisal s less likeable traits as far as they were concerned they also started to grill me about his security arrangements when he was travelling the threat of abdullahs conversion was meticulously maintained by a person whose capability to successfully recruit him i did not doubt the worst of it all was that they infected my mind from the moment they first mentioned his recruitment i started watching abdullah looking for changes checking his computer his friends where he went they made me spy on my own son i had already told them that faisals security arrangements were impregnable nobody was allowed to see him without being searched this was not q uite true i was never searched but his security detail watched me checked my movements made sure i was clean even before i got to see him but i didnt want the gicm to think that they had any chance of getting someone close to faisal that would be an unpredictable situation this was when the marine navigation training started they were clever they trained three of us at the same time none of us was given any clue of the mission i was getting increasingly nervous the pressure on me has been enormous i told faisal everything sorry javier but he was the target after all and as you so rightly said you had no experience in these matters he could have saved himself a lot of trouble by just getting rid of me but he feared for my safety and of course abdullahs future he was that sort of man our only resort was to counteract the gicm plan by hatching our own i told the gicm of faisals travel arrangements which included his annual trip from tangier to marbella they already knew about this which was the reason for the marine navigation training then i struck the deal with my closest contact in the gicm i volunteered to ram the princess bouchra and in return he would guarantee that abdullah would never be recruited to the cause i explained that it was not a life i wanted for him it was q uickly apparent that this had been their aim all along i wont bore you with all the details about how we planned to get faisal and his fellow royals on to the boat and then off it again in tangier suffice to say that the idea was to create a big confusion with lots of people and in the end the princess bouchra would set sail with the captain and a slightly larger crew of highly trained marines on board the ship by the way was fifteen years old and in need of a complete refit they were going to trade her in for a new one but now the insurance will take care of that the saudis will delay their press release about those on board for at least twentyfour hours youll understand why later in the original plan i was going to jump from the boat before the fatal collision but only james bond can get away with that sort of thing and anyway i would have been condemned to a life without my family living in secret in saudi arabia and after my childhood this was not what i wanted the other alternative to tell abdullah everything would have put an intolerable strain on the boy and because of his close relationship to the gicm recruiter would have left me constantly exposed and i didnt want to be a spy any more javier i found that out very quickly the way i had imagined it contained nothing of the horror of the reality believe me when i tell you that i am completely at peace my vision which i told you about in madrid beneath the cotton shroud is where i am some final requests you must show this letter to abdullah but it must not remain in his possession it is of course vital that he does not see me as a martyr to any terrorist cause which is why i have penned this in my own hand you must do this as quickly as you can he will be in rabat on thursday but given the developments possibly before i would also like you to go to fes and find mustafa barakat he should be there until friday when he is scheduled to fly to germany if the cni are any good at their job you should know more about him by now there are very strong ties between the diouris and the barakats he has been like a brother to me and this is why i could never do what i am going to ask of you i want you to find mustafa barakat and kill him he has been my main contact with the gicm and is a very dangerous man he recruited me specifically to carry out the assassination of faisal and he is responsible for the abduction of dario he might argue that he did this to distract you so that you would be less likely to discover his plan to ram the princess bouchra however i know that it was done as much out of spite as anything else and this has made me very angry he has also committed the unforgivable transgression of threatening a family member and for these reasons he must die the saudis will delay their press release until they hear from you i am sure you will find dario in the diouri family home in fes be careful of the woman there who lives apart from the rest and is probably the one holding the boy she is mustafa barakats mother and is both vicious and in my opinion clinically insane if she hears that her son is dead she will kill dario immediately this is the challenge you must kill mustafa barakat and rescue the boy straight away do not do this in a way that threatens your safety or your future however i do not want you to contact the moroccan intelligence services through the cni they will have no compunction about torturing mustafa barakat and it will be to the death because he will reveal nothing i do not want that to happen i am afraid that a conscience may come with me into the afterlife one final mystery for you because i know that it is in your nature you might be interested to check mustafa barakat s dna from that you will understand his story you are no doubt in a state of shock i am sorry my friend to have done this to you i was very touched by what you told me in browns on that grey afternoon in london you must believe javier that you will never be alone you have far too great a heart for that i wish i could embrace you again i was very glad to be able to say goodbye in osuna that afternoon do not be sad for me i am free now your friend yacoub diouri falcon folded the letter put it back in its envelope he called consuelo and told her to pack and be ready to leave for morocco before midday jefatura seville wednesday th september hrs the square reinforcedglass window set in the door of interview room number four perfectly framed nikita sokolov who was considered sufficiently dangerous to be held in handcuffs hands behind his back ramirez was waiting for the translator and was dismayed several minutes later to be shaking hands with a small middleaged cuban woman have you done this before he asked translate she said giving him the eyebrow for us he said with criminals whats he done hes a particularly nasty murderer and youre going to hear some ugly stuff to do with women she had to stand on tiptoe to see through the glass thanks very much for being so considerate inspector she said but i used to live in miami there the ugly stuff happened in your living room did they cut women up with a chain saw there too only if they were feeling kind she said guess what said ferrera appearing on falcons shoulder comisario elvira wants to see you when asked falcon probably since he got a call from the juez decano de sevilla at around two oclock this morning she said ramirez is about to give sokolov his first interview is inspector jefe tirado from grume in the building ill find out said ferrera by the way last night juan valverde gave me the name and address of the puti club where theyre holding marisa morenos sister margarita or at least where he had sex with her youd better get out there then said falcon contact the local guardia civil and take subinspector perez with you ok detectives serrano and baena are going through alejandro spinolas apartment looking for evidence of his involvement with the russians and sending inside information to horizonte falcon went up to elviras office the secretary sent him through elvira looked barricaded behind his desk and didnt even let him sit down i cant believe you mounted an operation like that without getting my approval normally i would have done but you told me i was not to have any contact with alejandro spinola on pain of being suspended said falcon not only did i realize that spinola himself was in danger but i could also see that he was potentially drawing other people into a dangerous situation in the hotel la berenjena i therefore had to act without your approval of the plan the plan the improvisation said falcon correcting himself there hasnt been much time for planning do you know what the juez decano told me last night said elvira that youd hounded his son to his death his suicide you mean said falcon remember detectives serrano and baena were present and the truck driver was emphatic well see alejandro spinola told me he was into belenki and revnik for gambling debts and cocaine and that hed leaked confidential information about competitors bids for the isla de la cartuja development to antonio ramos horizontes chief construction engineer hed also betrayed his own cousin by introducing him to marisa moreno who was being coerced by the russians said falcon that was a guy i didnt hound nearly enough i can only hope that with belenki revnik and marisa moreno dead and antonio ramos keeping his mouth firmly shut we can gather enough evidence to prove you right said elvira who looked at his watch as it is inspector jefe falcon i am going to have to suspend you from duty with immediate effect pending a full inquiry inspector ramirez will run the investigation from now on you will leave the building by eleven oclock that is all falcon left the comisarios office went down to his own where inspector jefe tirado was waiting for him chatting to ferrera falcon told him the latest intelligence about dario being held in morocco and that it would probably be a matter for the cni working with the moroccan authorities he also told him about his own suspension from duty and that he would ensure that the cni contacted comisario elvira with news of dario tirado left ferrera looked at falcon shook her head in dismay he went into his office closed the door and called pablo whod just arrived in the jefatura and was on his way up the stairs to his office he took out yacoubs letter reread it this was going to be a hard sell ferrera let pablo in said she was leaving for the costa del sol pulled the door shut pablo put his briefcase down sat he was angry falcon decided to let him start weve just heard from saudi intelligence said pablo theyve been in touch with the british too confirming that no members of the saudi royal family were on board that vessel and there will be no press release for at least twentyfour hours on the matter how much did you know pretty well nothing except that there was a saudi connection yacoub didnt even tell me his real name that was a very dangerous game you were playing there javier said pablo he was an assistant to the saudi minister of defence think how you and the british would have behaved if youd known that last week said falcon and if the americans had been informed im not sure that blowing a ship up on the high seas is what i would call a contained intelligence operation said pablo did saudi intelligence come directly to you or higher what do you think said pablo ive been made to look an arsehole on my own territory as soon as yacoub got off the plane in malaga i had a man on his tail after you met him in osuna i had two agents front and back of the hotel and still a gicm logistics cell can put a power boat packed with high explosives at the disposal of an amateur to complete a fucking impossible mission we were nowhere how could i have helped you said falcon i didnt know about the power boat or the princess bouchra pablo grunted looked out the window into the hot car park ive got a problem said falcon and im going to need your help i dont know why it seems that amateurs have just as good a chance as the professionals said pablo is this about dario partly said falcon but in order to get to dario i have to kill someone first silence pablos brain ticked over the problem is said falcon continuing this person is someone that both you and the moroccans would very much like to interrogate but yacoubs last request was that while he wants this person killed he does not want him tortured to death this isnt what you talked about in osuna said pablo it couldnt have been hed have had to tell you he was going to die so somehow youve heard from yacoub but not by email did he write you a letter you can read it in a minute in the meantime you want me to agree to facilitating a mission in a foreign country in which you assassinate an anonymous but valuable intelligence source said pablo fuck off javier thats all i can say i thought that might be your attitude youre in no position said pablo let me read the letter falcon handed over the letter sat back while pablo read it i want a copy of this and im going to have to make a call said pablo would you mind waiting in the outer office falcon left the room ten minutes later pablo called him back in it seems that assurances were given to the saudis from higher up said pablo ministers of defence and those close to them are very powerful people especially when they buy military equipment i have been instructed to make the necessary arrangements for you but are you the inspector jefe del grupo de homicidios really going to do this not that it makes any difference but ive been suspended from duty pending an inquiry into the events of last night i wont ask i have to admit its not my preferred method of meting out justice but not only is it my friends last request its also the only way to rescue dario with barakat alive on the outside we wouldnt get near the boy said falcon and i know you used to run agents in morocco before you were given the madrid job and you can help me i can arrange a firearm for you give you some men on the ground and i can clear it with the moroccans after the event said pablo or i can get a professional to do it as you can tell from the letter theres something personal about this i have no idea what it is but i dont think yacoub would ask me to do it unless he had good reason and what about the boy first of all you have to contact comisario elvira and tell him that you believe dario is in morocco and he will relieve inspector jefe tirado from the search for him here said falcon as soon as ive dealt with barakat your men have to seal off the information that hes dead until ive rescued dario im not sure how im going to get into the house in fes unless yousra yacoubs wife or abdullah maybe could help me get in there how are you going to get to fes drive to algeciras ferry to ceuta i could be in fes by this evening well book you a room in the hotel du commerce its quiet out of the way and you wont draw attention to yourself as you would if you were in the palais jamai or the dar batha its still in the old town but in fes el djedid rather than fes el bali where barakat has his shop and the diouris have their house said pablo what about yousra ill call her shell meet me in fes leave your car in meknes meet her there the hotel bab mansour has a garage well organize a room for you take a taxi from there said pablo dont turn up in a spanishregistered vehicle barakat will have his informers in fes consuelo will be coming with me really theres no question of her staying here why tell her i already have call me from ceuta said pablo go to the hotel puerta de africa and ask for alfonso tell him youre a great admirer of pablo neruda and hell look after your border crossing falcon went down to the forensics lab picked up some dna swabs and continued to the observation room to see ramirezs first interview with nikita sokolov he was waiting for the right moment to interrupt but was also fascinated to see how ramirez would play the russian they were still working their way through the preliminaries the translator sat well back from the table between the two men sokolov leaned forward a large white bandage around his head his huge bulk made him look like a figure from a cartoon his face bent down was oddly sad as if remorse could potentially take up residence occasionally when hed become a little stiff hed hook his arms over the back of the seat and sit up straight then his face would lose that look of sadness and become devoid of any recognizable human emotion im just going to summarize that for you said ramirez concluding a fairly long opening statement there are five murders that we can charge you with today there are no questions about any of them we have witnesses and we have your weapon with your fingerprints on it and in the case of the first two murders we also have your blood at the scene these killings are miguel estevez and julia valdes in the apartment of roque barba in las tres mil viviendas on monday th september and leonid revnik ramirez paused as sokolov spat a contemptuous globule of sputum at the floor leonid revnik continued ramirez isabel sanchez and viktor belenki in the hotel la berenjena on tuesday th september you will be charged with all these murders later this morning do you understand the translator did her work sokolov turned his mouth down and nodded as if this was a reasonable summary of a couple of days work he did not look at the cuban woman as she spoke his eyes were fixed on ramirezs forehead as if this was where he was planning his first assault on his way out of the room ramirez was extraordinarily calm his interview style normally tended towards the aggressive but hed decided on a different approach with sokolov although the russian did look impervious to aggression given that these five murders will put you behind bars for the rest of your life i was wondering if there were any other killings youd like us to take into consideration at the same time sokolovs response was very surprising i would like to help you inspector he said but you must understand that this is my job i was an enforcer for a number of years on the costa del sol with leonid revnik and his predecessor before i joined yuri donstov in the same capacity i was given the names of people i was required to kill but i did not always remember them it was just business if you can be specific and remind me of the circumstances i might be able to help ramirez was momentarily wrongfooted by the tone of this reply hed been expecting a belligerent silence it made him concentrate on his adversary falcon began to think that inside sokolovs brutal frame there must be a young man with a briefcase a set of pens and an eagerness to please then it occurred to him that the last thing this sort of work needed was craziness what it demanded was discipline calmness attention to detail and a clear uncomplicated mind maybe weightlifting wasnt such bad training for the work i was thinking of marisa moreno said ramirez jogging himself back into the interview you knew her of course yes i did she was cut up with a chain saw as youve probably already gathered that is not my method said sokolov sometimes i have to satisfy the needs of others the two who did that were animals but they were brought up on brutality they know nothing else where are they now they are dead they were captured by revniks men on monday night and taken away to be processed was that why you and yuri donstov were in the hotel la berenjena last night asked ramirez was that just revenge i will tell you things inspector but i would like you to guarantee me one thing im not sure i can offer you any guarantees just this one said sokolov i want everything i tell you to come out in court any reason there are people in moscow who should know the sort of a man leonid revnik was i think that can be arranged leonid revnik had the backing of the supreme council of voryvzakone in moscow to terminate yuri donstovs operations in seville he was given this because hed told them that donstov had killed two directors on the costa del sol this was not true revnik had executed them himself you do not kill a vorvzakone without repercussions said sokolov very quickly our supply lines of heroin from uzbekistan were cut then vasili lukyanov died in a car accident last thursday on his way to seville so it was revenge in the hotel la berenjena last night i did you a favour killing revnik whys that he had agreements with people politicians said sokolov hed keep seville clean in return for big favours on the costa del sol why did you have to kill marisa moreno she was at breaking point she could not be relied upon to keep her mouth shut what did she know she knew people by face and name if she found out that i was not working for revnik any more she might have felt that her sister was safe enough and would start talking to you said sokolov she would also reveal that shed been forced to have a relationship with the judge esteban calderon him why did she have to do that information i thought it was so that she could provide you with a key to the judges apartment you might be right did she supply you with the key yes what was done with that key on the night of june thjune th this year it was used to get into the judges apartment but the judge wasnt there was he sokolov glanced over at the observation panel his wife was there he said were you the person who gained access to the judges apartment that night yes did you murder the judges wife ines conde de tejada if that was her name yes why did you do that because i was instructed to do so by leonid revnik did you know why you were instructed to kill her of course i had to make it look as if the judge had murdered his wife so that he would be removed from the investigation of the seville bombing said sokolov one thing we didnt expect was for him to try to get rid of the body fortunately id left a man watching the apartment and he was able to report the judge to the police otherwise he might have got away with it and that would not have been fair would it inspector ramirez and sokolov looked at each other across the table the translator stared mesmerized no that wouldnt have been fair said ramirez and his next question came out with his heart in his throat do you know who was responsible for placing the bomb in the mosque on calle romeros in the barrio of el cerezo in seville on th june which exploded the following morning i know that it was organized by leonid revnik but i dont know who put the bomb there what about the building inspectors i dont know anything about that said sokolov that was not my work what about the murders of lucrecio arenas and cesar benito i killed cesar benito in the holiday inn near the real madrid football stadium said sokolov another of revniks men shot lucrecio arenas at his home in marbella name and where can we find him i dont know who did it but youll probably find him in the puti club near estepona which was run by vasili lukyanov said sokolov you were a friend of vasili lukyanov said ramirez he was coming to join donstov when he was involved in an accident he had money and some disks with him it was all stolen from revnik said sokolov we were having cashflow problems so the money was to get us through the next few months the disks vasili thought we could use them to get involved in the building project here in seville was that all asked ramirez there were a lot of people on those disks more than sixty there were also a couple of encrypted disks which we havent been able to unlock with the disks that vasili was bringing yuri said wed be able to force revnik out into the open so that we could kill him i dont know the people who were filmed said sokolov the encrypted disks contain the real accounts of all revniks businesses on the costa del sol they were very important to him that was valuable information for the tax authorities id like to thank you for being so cooperative in our first interview said ramirez as you say inspector its all over for me now but normally you people dont talk to the police those two directors that revnik shot were voryvzakone they should have been paid off not killed once revnik had done that and put the blame on yuri donstov in my eyes he forfeited the right to the terms of voryvzakone i will tell you anything you need to know about him falcon left the observation room and knocked on the door of the interview room ramirez came out with the translator who excused herself great interview jose luis said falcon not your usual style pure luck javier i was going to go in hard about cutting women up with chain saws and shooting them in the face but you know the translator so i was gentle he could have been mistaken for civilized if he hadnt confessed to seven murders said falcon what else do we want from him said ramirez he seems keen to talk dont look at me this is your investigation now jose luis i have to be out of the building in three minutes said falcon telling him about his suspension what you should do is go through all those faces on vasili lukyanovs disks with cortes and diaz and get them to identify all the building inspectors then look into the backgrounds of all the other men and see if any of them were trained electricians possibly even army trained interview them and see if they crack i think that was one of the things lukyanov was bringing with those disks the answers to the seville bombing conspiracy they shook hands clapped each other on the shoulder falcon went to the bottom of the staircase and one other thing jose luis ferrera and perez are on their way to lukyanovs puti club to pick up marisa morenos sister he said from what sokolovs just said theyre dangerous people out there they should have full backup before they go in youll be reinstated javier said ramirez theyre not going to be able to not this time jose luis said falcon and with a quick salute he went up the stairs ceuta wednesday th september hrs the hotel puerta de africa was a new fourstar hotel in the gran via of the spanish enclave of ceuta a short taxi ride from the ferry terminal under a later instruction from pablo falcon had left his car in algeciras on the spanish mainland which meant they could take the quickest hydrofoil across the straits of gibraltar on the way over he had told consuelo almost everything of the contents of yacoubs letter but had not let her read it there were things that werent for her eyes he left her in the taxi and went into the gleaming white hotel atrium which looked as far from africa as you could get he asked for alfonso and was pointed across the marble floor to the concierges desk he hit the bell a man in his forties with a heavy moustache and matching eyebrows came out falcon told him he was a great admirer of pablo neruda and was taken into his office you didnt bring your car said alfonso making a call were in a cab good its less complicated ill get you through the border in a few minutes therell be a car waiting for you on the other side dont worry theyll find you theres another cab outside transfer your bags and get going that was it there was a fiveminute drive to the moroccan border the cab went straight through to the moroccan side without stopping the driver took their passports got them stamped came back and told them to go to the customs guy with their bags at customs they were taken to a peugeot and given the keys not a word was spoken they got in eased through the crowds and drove along the coast to tetuan he called yousra from there and asked her to meet him in the hotel bab mansour in meknes abdullah had already flown in from london he would drive her there through the rif mountains was a beautiful drive but exhausting so falcon took the route via larache and sidikacem it took three and a half hours but they gained a couple of hours in time difference so it was just pm when they parked up in the garage of the hotel bab mansour in meknes yousra leila and abdullah were waiting in the bar area drinking coke the women were dressed in black abdullah in charcoal grey yousra looked composed until she saw falcon he went over hugged the three of them to him he introduced consuelo told yousra he needed to speak to abdullah alone for a while in the bland businessmans hotel room falcon handed over yacoubs last letter which abdullah read sitting on the edge of the bed until now abdullah had been holding it together playing the man of the family the letter destroyed him he went into the reading experience as an eighteenyearold boy and its initial effect was to reduce him to a child he lay on his side on the bed and bawled silently with the face of a starving baby then he sat himself up wiped his tears from his eyes and rebuilt himself into a twentyfiveyearold man there and then falcon burnt the letter in the hotel waste bin we wont talk about that letter now said falcon just let it sink in when i heard his name on the news in london i couldnt believe it said abdullah i could not believe hed done that so that letter was terrible but it was a relief too abdullah stood up and embraced falcon youve been a good friend javier my father would not have entrusted these things to you if you had been anything less he said if ever you need me you can count on me and i mean that even in the same way as my father dont even think about it abdullah thats not something i need to think about he said i know you can count on me i do need your help now said falcon has your mother ever been to the diouri house in fes of course she goes there every month she saw that as one of her duties as my fathers wife said abdullah she mustnt know what you are going to do though she is very fond of mustafa as my father said mustafa was like a brother to him and that was how she treated him and he was an uncle to you said falcon but an impostor said abdullah looking falcon in the eye what my father didnt tell you in the letter is that mustafa is very charismatic apart from anything else he sells a lot of carpets the tourists love him even as he despises them my advice to you is not to engage i need yousra to get me into the diouri house afterwards that is perfectly possible it will be quite natural for her under these circumstances to go to fes and mourn with the other women there they will expect it of her said abdullah the woman with you consuelo is this boy her son falcon nodded stunned by the transformation of abdullah from the slacklimbed teenager hed known on the family holiday a month ago to this focused young man hed become in the last halfhour its better that neither my mother nor leila are told about the boy these women in the diouri house know each other very well and my mother is not an actress said abdullah she will have an audience with mustafas mother as soon as she arrives and that woman is frightening she might be mad but she doesnt miss anything all right so how will i get into the house i will be accompanying her but i will not be party to their conversation i will stay downstairs and let you in do you know the house i know everything about that house when leila and i were children we were left to play and you know what children are like we discovered everything all the secret passages and back staircases dont worry javier everything will be fine i think its best we go our separate ways now we will arrive in fes as the grieving family said abdullah writing down his mobile number call me when you are ready and ill make sure everything goes smoothly in the house in fes they embraced again abdullah went to the door fitted his feet into his barbouches falcon could see his mind still working nothing will change my mind javier he said but remember abdullah your father sacrificed his life so that you would not suffer what he went through said falcon youve just read his letter he did not want to be a spy and he did not want that life for you either as they set off for fes the clouds in the western sky were aflame with the reddening sun already low on the horizon falcon drove in silence i can nearly hear whats going on in your head but not quite said consuelo after half an hour the usual problem said falcon trust i dont know whether ive just made a big mistake in assuming that abdullah is as his father believed a friend falcon nodded turned on the headlights as the sun disappeared behind them the light in the car was strange with the flamingo sky behind dark night ahead and the dashboard glowing in his face i just witnessed an extraordinary transformation from a boy into a man in the space of fifteen minutes said falcon this is what intelligence work does to you you question everybodys loyalty abdullahs response to that letter it just didnt quite ring true it did and it didnt said falcon thats what you could hear going on in my head for us to gain access to the diouri house in fes i must rely on him i had to tell him everything ive made myself vulnerable to him was there an alternative originally i was going to ask yousra to let me in abdullah advised against it for perfectly plausible reasons but when things matter so much theres always a question youre not giving me the full story javier i can tell he should have known in order to make dario safe i have to kill a man first abdullahs uncle she looked at him his profile the jawline the cheekbone the ear the eye what had she done to this man no javier you cant do that i cant let you do that it has to be done have you ever killed a man before twice but youve never assassinated someone she said in cold blood theres no other way consuelo im doing it for yacoub as much as anyone else it will happen said falcon firmly abdullah knows this said consuelo and if hes not a friend when you go to kill this man you might be walking to your death we need an alternative plan in case ive been wrong about abdullah the hotel du commerce was on the place des alaouites they parked nearby and went up to their room it wasnt a class of hotel that consuelo was used to staying in but it was right in front of the golden doors of the royal palace they had a shower changed clothes neither of them was hungry they lay on the bed consuelo with her head on his chest falcon stared at the ceiling there was a knock at the door one of pablos agents identified himself looked nervously at consuelo its all right said falcon introducing her she had to know the agent took out a light brown burnous from the small cabin bag he was carrying put this on he said it has a hood to cover your face falcon wrestled into the long anklelength cloak put the hood over his head checked himself in the mirror the pockets of the burnous went straight through to his trousers the agent screwed a silencer on to a ninemillimetre glock handgun gave it to falcon he showed him that it was fully loaded with one in the chamber and where the safety catch was falcon put it in the waistband of his trousers the agent laid out a largescale map of the medina of fes el bali on the bed showed him the gate where he would come in where the shop was and the best route from the shop to the diouri house he gave him a recent photo of barakat let him look at it for a minute took it back you will go into mustafa barakats shop at eight thirty said the agent there will be one other person in the shop a spanish tourist as you enter another agent will man the door from the outside he will be moroccan you will shoot mustafa barakat hand the gun to the spanish tourist and leave the premises do not look back the moroccan will close the shop behind you ill need a gun for when i go into the diouri house said falcon we will make sure you have one said the agent its just a precaution that after the killing you walk away from the shop unarmed i want you to show consuelo where the diouri house is said falcon shes never been to fes before and the medina can be confusing i want her to see it for real and memorize a route if anything happens to me and i do not show at the gates of the house you must knock at the door and ask for yousra and what will consuelo do asked the agent you will give her the weapon intended for me she will ask yousra to take her to barakats mother what do you think might happen to you asked the agent i have had to inform abdullah diouri of this plan that was not what we were told said the agent it was unavoidable the agent looked at his watch i have to take up my position now he said i will talk to pablo if we are to abort the mission you will get a oneword text on your mobile telling you just that consuelo and the agent left falcon looked at his watch still some time to go he remembered the dna swabs put a couple in his pocket he took the gun out put it on the bed paced the room he lay down with the gun on his chest had to get up again too hot stripped off the burnous time got stuck wouldnt move on forty minutes later consuelo returned he locked the door behind her and went back to pacing the room you saw the house he asked its not far she said youre tense javier youre still thinking about abdullah weve got to clear your mind tell me everything that worries you about him was the transformation too quick was it too complete did it feel rehearsed was there something playing behind his eyes when he said the words you can count on me why did he offer his services when his father had just sacrificed his life for him did he pledge his loyalty a little too quickly and too hard is he acting youre too wired for this its just the paranoia talking ill be all right once im moving your shirt is soaked through take it off put this on he looked at his watch for the hundredth time not quite he peeled off the shirt she rubbed him down with a towel he put on a tshirt got back into the burnous he checked the gun slipped it into the burnous and down the waistband of his trousers he walked around comfortable its time he said she gripped his shoulders slipped her arms around his neck kissed his face he held her almost delicately feeling the individual ribs with the tips of his fingers this isnt it javier this isnt the end i know it this is the new beginning believe me she said and squeezed him hard do you believe me i do he said but his eyes said something different over her shoulder they parted he held her hands looked into her eyes when you came to see me that night before the negotiations with the russians you could have lied to me you could have easily drawn me into their corruption that you didnt that you were so furious at what they were trying to do even at the risk of your own child was magnificent and i fell for you all over again he said and let her hands fall from his whatever happens i want you to know that i do not regret any of this its taken me all my life to find you javier she said and i know youll be coming back falcon pulled the burnous hood with its elfin point over his head the door closed after him and she immediately wanted him back didnt believe her own words now that he was gone she wondered what she would do with herself if this was to be the last time she saw him she went to the window he came out of the building beneath her walked towards the royal palace turned at the end of the street raised his hand and was gone falcon walked swiftly now that he was on the move his mind was clear he felt a tremendous solidity in his torso as if he was wearing an armour of clean and shining steel as light as his own skin he called abdullah on his mobile and told him he was on his way he passed through various gates the bab semarine up grand rue des merenids to the bab dakakan it was only a matter of taking a right at the bab es seba and a long walk by the boujeloud gardens and he was in fes el bali he was in his stride now walking towards the bab boujeloud more activity here more tourists full of hustlers the burnous did its job nobody came near him he went through the gate into the medina the tourist traffic became more intense the shops were heaving with people brass trays glowed in the yellow light next to motherofpearl inlaid furniture camelbone framed mirrors silver jewellery colourful scarves his hood trapped the cinnamon smell from the pastilla food stalls he dodged some mule droppings the streets were clogging up with slowmoving gaggles of tourists he tried not to look at his watch not a moroccan thing to be too concerned about time he would get there the timing would be perfect wood smoke shunted out the food smells the stink of curing leather old men sitting out drinking tea fingering their worry beads a boy crouched sweating as he fanned the flames of the fires beneath the massive blackened boilers of the hammam the hiss of steam the ponderous clopping of a donkeys hooves on cobbles he turned left at the cherabliyin mosque the streets were darker and emptier here he joined up with another main thoroughfare the carpet shops he saw his destination his hand gripped the butt of the gun he stopped took a deep breath glanced at his watch for the first time do not think do not engage two shots would be enough he crossed the street heading for the door to the shop pulled the gun out of his waistband thumbed off the safety catch under his burnous just as he reached the doorway a figure in a pale blue jellabah flitted in front of him slipped over the threshold so that they were in the shop together what the fuck too late he was committed now the spanish tourist was coming up off his cushion mustafa barakat was standing and spreading his arms wide he was smiling even as falcon pulled out the gun he was going to embrace the figure in the pale blue jellabah then he was not his eyes widened over the pale blue cotton shoulders of the man whose right arm punched in once twice three times barakat fell back on a pile of carpets the word on his lips never made it into the air the killer put his foot on to the pile of carpets next to barakats face and drew the knife across the dying mans throat he said something in arabic and stood back barakats white jellabah was already blossoming with a vast shining bloom of blood his throat gaped and gargled blood leaked on to the carpets the arterial pressure already gone from the ferocious stabs to the heart abdullah turned to falcon held out the knife in his bloody hand despite his closeness to barakat in his death throes his pale blue jellabah had only a small smear of blood across the arm the cni agent playing the tourist was in a state of shock at this development falcon spoke to him quickly in spanish as he knelt down and dipped a dna swab into barakats blood take the knife carry on as planned any water the agent took the knife handed over a bottle of water hed been carrying falcon put the gun back in his waistband washed abdullahs hand threw the bottle to the agent and left the shop the metal blind rolled down behind them abdullah led the way off the street and down into the alleyways of the medina he was crying his shoulders were shaking abdomen trembling why did you do that asked falcon abdullah stopped threw his back against a whitewashed wall tears streaked his face ive loved that man all my life he said since i can remember mustafa has been a part of our family i used to fall asleep on his chest in the back of the car he rescued me when i nearly drowned in the sea at asilah he took me to marrakech for my sixteenth birthday he is my uncle but you knew i would kill him you didnt have to do that he has betrayed us all i can hardly bear to speak his name he has disgraced us i dont care if i go to jail for the rest of my life said abdullah at least i have restored some of our family honour falcon grabbed him by the arm told him they had to keep moving the news of barakats death might leak out they jogged through the empty streets it was no more than a few hundred metres to the house the door was open a crack abdullah went in consuelo appeared out of the darkness wearing a headscarf startled him is it done she asked falcon nodded they left consuelo by the main door abdullah led falcon across the first patio of the house womens voices came from one of the upstairs rooms in the second patio abdullah ducked into a doorway and went down a long unlit passage to a stone spiral staircase at the end it was only just big enough for a single person to pass theres no electricity in this part of the house said abdullah when we get to the door at the top i will go through and leave the door ajar you must stay behind nobody comes to this part of the house without being invited first think about what youre going to say to her im not going to take any nonsense said abdullah determined shell know i mean business just by the fact im in her quarters without her invitation you mustnt give her the slightest chance theres nothing she can do javier are you sure said falcon after all this i dont want anything to happen to the boy shell be on her own up here the boy will be kept elsewhere ill ask her where shes keeping him and if she doesnt tell me ill beat her until she does abdullah took off his shoes they crawled up two floors in the narrow staircase at one point the womens voices in the patio were as clear as if they were next door abdullah reached the door at the top it did not appear to have a handle or a lock but he felt up and down the stone wall near the door jamb and pressed the door sprung open silently the room had a floor of heavy wooden planking covered with carpets the windows had broken latticework over them and the smell of jasmine from the garden below had come in with the warm night air a floorboard creaked as abdullah went in a womans voice in arabic asked whos there it is me abdullah my great aunt he said approaching her im sorry to come here without your invitation but i wanted to talk to you about my fathers death i have already spoken to your mother she said i was sure that you had been told but i would like to talk to you about it as well said abdullah you know that your son my uncle and my father were very close my son she said mustafa and my father they were like brothers come here she said step into the light where i can see you why are you wearing these clothes these are not mourning clothes and what is that mark there was a sharp intake of breath the silence of shock before the comprehension of pain falcon opened the door the woman was dressed completely in black which made the curved blade of the knife stand out in the oily yellow light the sight of falcon distracted her from abdullah who was holding his right arm with blood oozing through his fingers he grunted with pain the woman tipped a lamp on to the wooden floor the oil spilled caught fire immediately and flames spread across the carpets and floorboards the hem of abdullahs jellabah was alight as he staggered backwards the woman opened the door and disappeared into the darkness falcon used a small rug from the floor to slap out the flames climbing up abdullahs legs he used one of the other larger carpets to smother the fire creeping across the floor he ran to the door shed locked it he kicked at it once twice on the third savage blow it came open no light his sight still a wavering green from the flames his hands found a door across the landing a top stair to his right the rest of the stairs could have been a lift shaft for all he could see he went down the stairs right hand on the wall a landing no door more stairs another landing two doors a window faint light coming from outside he listened at one door then the other went back to the other door tried it it opened on to an empty room he turned ran at the other door and shouldered through it into the room crashing into some furniture and landing on his front the door kicked back against the wall and slammed shut again behind him still no light movement in the darkness a faint whimpering sound of a small animal cowering in a dark corner he got up on to his knees no higher than that he was aware of the window behind him didnt want to stand out something flew over his head with a swish like a low flying bird he rolled to one side feet in light slippers padded across the floor falcon crawled deeper into the room turned lay on his back he could just make out some of the broken latticework across the window his eyes searched for a silhouette somebody was coming down the stairs abdullah recovered or the woman getting away his eyes improving all the time he lay still by the door he was aware of a denser mass there was a twitch of silver he felt around him a small table came to hand he sat up brought his knees to his chin rocked forward and in one movement came to his feet and ran full tilt table out in front of him at the black mass there was a collision the woman cannoned backwards and hit the window frame the rotten latticework did not hold the window frame cut her midthigh her centre of gravity toppled and she was out and into the night before falcon could grab at anything a shout more of surprise followed by a compact thud and a crack then silence a long silence which was broken by that whimpering in the room abdullah said falcon im here he said on the landing she cut me with a knife i cant let go of it im bleeding too much wheres the light youll have to find a candle or a lamp womens voices raised down below theyd found the body abdullah yelled some arabic out of the window uncertain light and footsteps came up the stairs a lamp came into the room falcon turned to look at the corner where the whimpering was coming from there was a childs cot with bars around it behind the bars he could see a childs back completely still falcon stumbled through the furniture in the room at the foot of the cot curled in a tight ball was a small black trembling dog next to it was dario inanimate there was a strong smell of faeces and urine the boy was naked in the hopeless light he could not tell whether the mad crone had killed the boy out of spite as yacoub said she might after that night with the russians outside seville he could barely bring himself to do it but he reached out a hand touched the small naked shoulder let his hand slip into the crook of the neck and felt the pulse ticking under the warm skin there was no lingering on that hot night in fes the women in the diouri household did not seem unduly troubled by the death of barakats mother they were far more concerned about the injury to abdullah and confounded by the presence of a child and a small dog in the house when abdullah told them hed been knifed by the mad woman and they found the bloody blade still in the womans hand they were appalled falcon looked at the wound it was a deep cut in the shoulder muscle and although bloody the blade had not severed anything serious the women brought alcohol and bandages he dressed the wound but said it would need stitches given the circumstances he told abdullah this would best be done in ceuta yousra and leila would stay in fes they were led to the car through the back streets of the medina consuelo would not let falcon carry the boy she was frightened by darios total lack of animation but encouraged by the steadiness of his pulse they left for ceuta at pm on the way falcon called alfonso the concierge at the hotel puerta de africa and told him they would be arriving at about am moroccan time at the border and would need help to get through abdullah had changed out of his bloody clothes and back into mourning he had his id card but had left his passport in rabat consuelo had had the foresight to bring darios documents falcon also told alfonso theyd need a doctor on arrival at the hotel and a couple of rooms for what was left of the night at the border they were walked through to the spanish side with no official inspection a taxi was waiting dario had still not stirred he had the distressing feel of a large ragdoll the doctor was waiting at the hotel and they went straight up to the room abdullah insisted that dario was seen to first the doctor lifted darios eyelids shone his torch into the pupils he listened to the heart and lungs he minutely inspected the boys body and found needle punctures in the crooks of his elbows he declared there was nothing wrong with him apart from having been heavily sedated he took one look at abdullahs wound and said hed have to come with him to his surgery and have it properly cleaned and stitched falcon and consuelo washed dario in the bath and put him to bed they slept with the boy in between them and were woken just before midday by his crying he had no recollection of what had happened to him although he vaguely remembered being taken away from the sevilla fc shop he could not recollect how it had happened or who had done it it was decided that abdullah would travel with them and stay in seville with falcon until the barakat murder and the death of the mother had been dealt with by the authorities they took a cab to the hydrofoil and were across the straits by pm they drove back to seville where falcon left consuelo and dario in santa clara with her sister and the boys ricardo and matias he and abdullah went to the jefatura where he gave barakats dna swab to jorge in the forensics lab and asked him to check it against samples on the jefaturas database you know comisario elvira is looking for you said jorge hes always looking for me im going home to bed said falcon you havent seen me he and abdullah went home encarnacion fed them falcon turned off all his mobiles and disconnected his phone he slept the rest of the afternoon and whole night without waking in the morning he inspected abdullahs wound and redressed it he took a slow breakfast out in the patio staring at the marble flagstones at midday he called jorge and asked if hed run the dna test there was a match to raul jimenez said jorge the dna you gave me would probably have belonged to his son does that help you interesting you might also be interested to know that your squad are on a high last night they arrested two building inspectors in torremolinos who theyd identified from those lukyanov disks theyve already charged them with conspiring to cause an explosion said jorge this morning they picked up the owner of a small hotel in almeria who also happened to be an electrician and was trained by the army in the use of explosives hell be arriving in seville this afternoon ramirez has been trying to call you and comisario elvira is still very eager to know where you are ive said nothing falcon hung up called consuelo dario was playing with his brothers and some friends in the pool he seems untouched by it all she said amazed i was going to get alicia to talk to him but im not sure whether it will just make him unhappy see what alicia says you dont have to rush said falcon he told her about the dna match from barakat to raul consuelo couldnt understand how raul jimenez her exhusband came to be mustafa barakats father the reason raul suddenly had to leave morocco back in the fifties was because hed made the twelveyearold daughter of abdullah diouri senior pregnant diouri senior had demanded that raul marry the girl to preserve the family honour raul couldnt because he was already married so he fled diouri took revenge by kidnapping rauls youngest son arturo and for whatever reason guilt or because he loved him diouri gave arturo the same status as his own sons with his family name so arturo jimenez became yacoub diouri but because diouris twelveyearold daughter had brought shame on to the family her son by raul was not allowed to bear the family name however diouri senior didnt totally reject him the close ties between the diouris and the barakats meant that the boy was introduced into that family to become mustafa barakat that sort of knowledge in the wrong mind could breed a special kind of hatred said consuelo and how do you think mustafa barakat would feel about yacoub diouri imagine the bitterness that poor girl must have felt at her own rejection for being defiled by raul only to have to witness yacoubs smooth integration into the diouri family while her own son is kicked out profile of a terrorist consuelo invited javier to dinner that night asked him to bring abdullah falcon drove out to the prison in alcala de guadaira hed called ahead so calderon was already waiting for him in a visiting room he wasnt smoking he had his hands clasped in front of him on the table to stop them from fidgeting he still looked haggard but not as reduced as he had been when falcon had last seen him the supreme selfconfidence had not been recovered but he seemed more solid youve heard said falcon my lawyer came to see me yesterday said calderon nodding im still going to face assault charges but he trailed off looked up at the high barred window youre going to get your life back in the end he said but itll be a different one im going to see to that hows it been going with alicia aguado hard said calderon leaning back hooking his hands around his knee i spend a lot of my day thinking about myself and not much of it is good you know alicia told me in our last session that it was rare for a male patient to turn on himself as comprehensively as id done i told her this last week has been the longest sustained period of facing the truth that ive ever been through in my life a lawyer speaks javier they grunted laughter at each other i also spend a lot of my time thinking about you i feel i owe you an explanation its not necessary esteban i know but you started me on this journey with alicia and we have this curious relationship thats entwined with both ines and marisa so i want to clarify a few things if you can bear to listen to me its not going to make me look very pretty but then youre getting used to that they sat in silence for a moment while calderon prepared himself as you know four years ago i nearly lost my career i needed all my family connections and iness to maintain a foothold in the edificio de los juzgados ines was fantastic throughout she was strong i was weak and as you know from your murder cases javier the weak man is full of selfhatred and develops a bottomless pit of savagery which by rights he should unleash against himself but inevitably he turns on the person closest to him is that when it started the beatings no the hatred yes when ines became my wife and the balance of power shifted in my favour i started breaking her down with my extravagant philandering said calderon by the time that bomb went off on th june we were both primed for violence by that i mean i was ready to give it and she was ready to receive it i was feeling sufficiently strong and angry and she was sufficiently fragile and humiliated im not sure there wasnt something sadomasochistic in the state of our relationship when i came back from marisas that morning we could have had just another row but this time she wanted it to be taken further she goaded me and i inexcusably complied she was goading you to violence it probably wasnt as clear as that in her mind wed shouted and screamed thrown things at each other and i suppose it was the only possible next step you know how important iness public image was to her she couldnt walk away from a second failed marriage and i would have found it hard to split from her what she wanted was for me to hit her then for me to be filled with remorse and in that softening she would bring us back together i surprised her and myself i didnt know i had that pentup rage inside me did you feel any remorse at the time no i realize this sounds pathetic but i felt immensely powerful said calderon to have beaten a fiftykilo woman into terrified submission should have appalled me but it didnt then later after marisa told me about her confrontation with ines in the murillo gardens i became incensed once again and gave ines an even worse beating still no remorse just madness and rage what happened after that beating i walked the streets telling myself it was all over there could be no going back but you already knew how difficult it would be for you to split from ines said falcon so did it occur to you then that little joke you had with marisa about the bourgeois solution to complicated divorce yes it did not quite in that way i was in a rage i just wanted to get rid of ines and what fall into the arms of marisa no he said shaking his head why did you give ines the most savage beating of all for badmouthing a woman you didnt care about in calling marisa the whore with the cigar ines had pointed out to me what i thought of her said calderon marisa was an artist but that never interested me throughout our relationship i treated her like a whore much of our sex was like that and marisa despised me in fact looking back on it she hated me and i have to admit my behaviour was loathsome so what are you saying about ines and marisa now you know when you came to see me last i told you that alicia had accused me of hating women me esteban calderon the greatest lover of women in the edificio de los juzgados yes well thats what i found out i treated marisa like a whore and ines worse than a dog and thats what ive been finding hard to face up to falcon nodded stared at the floor the first real glimmer of the truth that i could remember one that really shook me to the core was when i regained consciousness after my faint to find ines dead in the kitchen that was when i saw the damage from my earlier beatings and it was what made me panic because i knew my evident abuse of her would make me the prime suspect in her murder said calderon whenever id recalled that night id always concentrated on my lack of intent to murder her because that would be your defence in court said falcon exactly but what came back to me during my sessions with alicia was having come into the apartment seen the light on in the kitchen and been annoyed at the possibility of another confrontation and wished her gone from my life i then saw her lying there in that vast pool of her own blood that was when it came to me that i might as well have killed her to see her there in such hideously bright light was like being confronted with the image of my own guilt i fainted at the thought and sight of it in the early evening falcon went to the jefatura the whole squad was in the office the atmosphere was upbeat theyd had two very successful days serrano put a cold beer in his hand guess what said ramirez elvira wants to see you youd think this guy doesnt have my phone number said falcon hes going to reinstate you i doubt it first of all spinola said ramirez tell him emilio we went through his apartment and found seventyeight grams of cocaine forty grams of heroin and a hundred and fifty grams of cannabis resin said perez so hes a drug user said falcon shrugging and copies of all the rival bids in the isla de la cartuja development which have also been found in the possession of antonio ramos horizontes head of construction finished ramirez that was lucky said falcon nodding taking a pull of the beer the juez decano appointed the instructing judge who was present throughout the search of the apartment and hes totally accepted our findings what about margarita falcon asked ferrera shes in hospital in malaga she said shed been given a very severe beating by one of leonid revniks men when they found that vasili lukyanov had gone to seville was she his girlfriend not exactly she was special to him thats all she would admit but she was in very bad shape theyre going to call me when shes recovered enough to talk properly broken jaw left arm and two cracked ribs el pulmon hes identified sokolov were in discussion over the knifing and the illegal firearm and what are they going to do to mark flowers theyre not going to press charges for killing yuri donstov but hes finished here in seville said ramirez theyre putting him on a plane back to the states and hell face a disciplinary hearing there and the big question for me said falcon what about cortland fallenbach was he involved in the original conspiracy theyve taken away his passport said ramirez and hes got a team of lawyers fighting to get it back i dont know without lucrecio arenas and cesar benito around that might be a difficult thing to prove the phone rang baena took it held the phone to his chest guess what all right said falcon im going up there tell him i just wanted to see the most important people first great work everybody comisario elvira didnt keep him waiting his secretary offered him coffee this almost never happened im writing the press release said elvira whats that for the final charges have been made relating to the planting of the seville bomb the final charges all right the people who planted the device have been apprehended and theyre going to face justice what about the chain of command from the suspects weve had in custody since june through to horizonte and iit we cant make any announcements relating to that are you going to work on it well have to take a view on that said elvira anyway this evening theres going to be a televised press conference the mayor and comisario lobo want you to be there to read out the statement that im preparing for you im suspended from duty pending a full inquiry said falcon you were reinstated last night when we determined alejandro spinolas involvement in leaking information about the isla de la cartuja development project what about my unapproved improvisation in the hotel la berenjena look javier ive really got to get down to these press releases and statements said elvira id like you to join me in my car in an hours time to go to the state parliament falcon nodded left the room the secretary brought the coffee he drank it standing in front of her he went back down to the homicide office theres going to be a press conference in the state parliament in about an hour and a halfs time said falcon id like you all to listen to that he went into his office and was about to close the door when he saw the wall chart he lifted it off its hook and took it back into the outer office you can strip this down and file it he said were finished with it now the phone rang it was the scrambled line used by the cni he went into his office closed the door answered it i got a full report from my agents in fes said pablo and alfonso has briefed me on the aftermath you got the boy hes in good shape considering doesnt remember a thing about it for the moment said falcon how have the moroccans taken it they got a call from the saudis as well so theyre philosophical oil has a very loud voice said pablo still all is not lost the germans have uncovered a network related to barakats export business there the moroccans are pursuing two very strong leads into the gicm from other connections theyve made to barakat there was also an algerian link and mi are working on that cell the french told them about which it seems was connected to barakats carpet business in london so although we didnt get the man what about you asked falcon did you get anything out of it yacoub had left all the details of the gicm logistics cell he was using on the costa del sol with the saudis said pablo and two more hed heard about in madrid and barcelona were all happy im glad i wanted to ask you about abdullah said pablo he had to have twelve stitches in his shoulder would he be interested in helping us you how could he help you hes been exposed maybe and maybe not said pablo i just wanted to know how hed feel about you know playing the game that letter has left him a lot to think about said falcon and you javier me said falcon the amateur think about it said pablo and hung up falcon went to the window looked out over the car park in the late evening light house martins were ducking and diving weaving in and out scribbling the air with their antics he felt empty and immensely lonely police work did this to him when it was all over there was nothing left but disappointment mystery gone quest terminated all that remained was an overwhelming sense of loss and pointlessness as he stared into the inane ranks of cars each within their neat lines of demarcation he found himself searching for a reason and what came to him was an image that had first come to him as hed driven back from fes yacoub in the middle of the ocean on a small boat in complete darkness with the power of sacrifice in his hands to rescue his son from fanatics and in doing so restore some nobility to the human race he sat and let the world grow dark around him until ferrera knocked leaned in and told him that elviras car was ready he went down got into the back seat with the comisario who handed him the press release and his statement he read them and looked out at the lights of the city and the faceless people going about their business the press conference was packed it hadnt heaved like this since the day comisario lobo had announced that calderon had been found trying to dispose of his wifes body in the guadalquivir river and was being replaced as the instructing judge in the seville bombing the long tedious process started everybody had to have their say and bask a little in the afterglow of success lobo elvira the mayor normally the juez decano spinola would have been there but given the circumstances that did not seem appropriate falcon tuned out of the proceedings looked back at the avid faces staring up at him blinked at the flash photography his turn came it was the last word but in this case the least important he read elviras prepared statement and then added his own nobody in this room should forget that everything that has been said here today could only come about as a result of some extraordinary and in many cases unpaid dedication from people who are unknown never seen and rarely heard they work tirelessly under dangerous circumstances to keep the people of seville safe removing murderers and gangsters from the streets so that men women and children can live in this city without fear for once i think their names should be heard they are inspector jose luis ramirez subinspector emilio perez detective julio baena detective carlos serrano and detective cristina ferrera and id like to thank them all he sat down comisario elvira was annoyed at the departure from the script a couple of journalists clapped four more joined in and then the room rose as one and applauded the unseen and the unheard elvira smiled and basked in some partially deserved adulation as they filed into the mayors private rooms where drinks were being served falcon asked for a quick word with comisario elvira it lasted a matter of two minutes they parted and rejoined the gathering a dinner had been planned afterwards and falcon was duly invited but he politely declined the powers that be were quite glad about that the presence of the taciturn inspector jefe seemed to imply some unspoken criticism falcon went home he showered and changed abdullah declined consuelos dinner invitation it would be a celebration and he was still in mourning falcon drove out to santa clara where they had a family dinner consuelos sisters family were there as well it was a welcome home for dario consuelo had baked him a cake it felt like his birthday they ate and drank people left others went to bed at a little after one in the morning consuelo and falcon lay naked in each others arms their contours smoothed out by a light sheet i want you to come and live with me javier said consuelo i will said falcon but it might have to be somewhere different whats wrong with here nothing he said its just that tonight i resigned as inspector jefe del grupo de homocidios de sevilla did you jump or were you pushed i jumped he said thats a big jump when did you decide it first occurred to me when we drove back after that night with the russians then when i went out to kill mustafa barakat i realized how much id changed and that i couldnt do the work any more he said you should be happy i know you never liked it i cant pretend im sad she said what are you going to do with yourself i havent got that far sell your house live on the proceeds paint maybe ill learn how to sail a yacht he said squeezing her shoulder so youll still have me we could live by the sea in valencia she said the estate agent called again today i can already smell the paella on the beach and rather than thoughts of the future he remembered what hed done before coming out that night hed found that dried husk of a plant skulking in its dark corner under the gallery taken it by the scruff of the neck and marched it to the bin
