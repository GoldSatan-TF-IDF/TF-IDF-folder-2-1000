john lescroart the first law and we are here as on a darkling plain swept by confused alarums of struggle and flight where ignorant armies clash by night matthew arnold dover beach part one at a little before two oclock on a chill and overcast wednesday afternoon moses mcguire pulled his old ford pickup to a grating stop in front of his sister frannies house and honked the horn twice he waited blowing on his hands which he couldnt get to stay warm the heater in the truck didnt work worth a damn and the driverside window was stuck halfway down but he knew it wasnt the weather it was nerves he blew into the cup of his hands again lay on the horn another time the door opened his brotherinlaw dismas hardy walked briskly businesslike down his porch steps and the path that bisected his small lawn normally he was good for a smile or some wiseass greeting but today his face was set his eyes cast down he carried a ropewrapped package under one arm wore jeans and hiking boots and a heavy coat into the pockets of which hed stuffed his hands the coat mcguire thought was a good idea not so much for the cold as to disguise the fact that he was wearing kevlar and packing hardy at fiftytwo was two years younger than mcguire the two men had known each other for over thirty years since theyd been in vietnam over there hardy had pulled mcguire to cover and safety in the midst of an intense firefightboth of the men had been hit both awarded the purple heart but hardy had saved mcguires life and that bond had held would always hold when hardys first pass at adult life fell apart hed worked for years at the bar moses owned the little shamrock and eventually when hardy was ready to risk life and commitment again he became a quarter partner in the bar hed married mcguires sister was godfather to one of mcguires daughters as moses was to his family hardy slid in and dumped the package onto the seat between them theres your vest i did have the extra saying it aloud seemed to cost him some energy he drew a deep breath and took a last look back at his house as the truck moved into gear turning back to his brotherinlaw he asked what are you carrying mcguire motioned over his shoulder indicating the truck bed i got fifty shells and my over and under wrapped in the tarp back there twelve gauge yeah and in theremcguire pointed to the glove boxi got my sig automatic he caught hardys tone of disapproval they dont always jam he said only takes once i expect ill be using the shotgun anyway the truck turned a couple of corners the men riding in silence until they were rolling on geary mcguire blew on his hands again finally hardy spoke you okay with this mcguire looked across the seat his dark eyes flat completely you not hardy worked his mouth shook his head i dont see another choice thats cause there isnt one i know i know its just theres always another choice usually not this time mcguire bit it off impatient he accelerated angrily through a yellow light you already tried all of them maybe not all thats what i worry about this would be a bad time to get pulled over dont you think mcguire touched the brake slowed a hair he slammed his hand on the dashboard come on heater kick in fuck hardy ignored the outburst i just think he said we do this then what then were alive how about that we dont were not its that simple the next light was red and he had to stop took the moment to make eye contact how many people do these guys have to kill diz how many have they already killed allegedly dont give me that you have any doubt at all reasonable or otherwise no so dont give me allegedly you dont believe it yourself okay but maybe abe could bring in the feds him going in alone to arrest these guys now hes not going to be alone were backing him up hardy chewed at his cheek were not the cops truer words were never said theres no time to call in the feds diz theres no time to convince any bureaucracy to move you of all people should know that im just saying if we had a little more time mcguire shook his head times up diz they decide youre nextthe good money bet by the waythey pull up to you maybe today maybe tomorrow theyre not going to care if frannies in the car with you or the kids youre just gone like the others i know i know youre right damn straight the light changed mcguire hit the gas and lurched ahead listen you think i want to be here i dont want to be here i keep thinking the law mcguire snorted the law your precious fucking law its gonna protect you right like it has everybody else its my life mose ive pretty much got to believe that dont i the laws not your life its your job your life is something else entirely the first law is you protect your life and the people you love hardy stared out the window mcguire was riding his adrenaline these guys dont give a shit diz isnt that pretty clear by now theyve got the lawthe cops in this town anywayin their pocket its unfair and unlikely okay but thats whats happened so now all thats left is they take out you and your meddling friend abe and its all over they win life goes back to normal except you guys are both dead and maybe my sister with you and im not willing to take that chance his eyes ticked across the seat youre telling me after all thats gone down you dont see this you dont know for a fact this can happen is going to happen no i see it all right mose i dont know how we got here thats all its so unreal yeah well remember nam it was unreal too until the bullets started flying the world trade center was pretty unreal too if you think about it you think people are reasonable you think there are rules but then guess what suddenly there arent all right but were not going in shooting mose were backing up abe and thats all were doing if you say so unless something goes wrong mcguire threw him another look couldnt tell if he was serious or not hardy would crack wise at his own execution the truck turned onto the freeway going south hardy pulled a box from his jacket pocket and set it on his lap then pulled off the lid reaching under his arm he pulled out the massive blue steel colts police special that hed carried when hed been a cop years before he snapped open the cylinder spun it and began pulling copperjacketed hollowpoints from the box one at a time dropping them into their slots when the six bullets were in place he closed up and reholstered the gun then pulled a second cylinder from his other pocket methodicallyclick click click as they fell into the cylinderhe sat filling the speed loader ten oclock a wednesday morning in the beginning of july john holiday extended one arm over the back of the couch at his lawyers sutter street office today he was comfortably dressed in stonewashed blue jeans hiking boots and a white highcollared shirt so heavily starched that it had creaked when he lowered himself into his slouch his other hand had come to rest on an oversize silverandturquoise belt buckle his long legs stretched out all the way to the floor his ankles crossed nothing about his posture much suggested his possession of a backbone women had liked him since hed outgrown his acne his deepset eyes seemed the window to a poets soul with the stained glass of that window the odd whitish blue of glacier water now close up those eyes revealed subtle traces of dissolution and loss there was complexity here even mystery with an easy style and pale featureshis jaw had the clean definition of a bladehed been making female hearts go pitterpatter for so long now that he took it for granted he didnt much understand it to him the prettiness of his face had finally put him off enough that hed grown a mustache full drooping and yellow as corn silk it was two or three shades lighter than the hair on his head and had only made him more handsome when his face was at rest holiday still didnt look thirty but when he laughed the lines added a decade got him up to where he belonged he still enjoyed a good laugh though he smiled less than he used to he was smiling now though at his lawyer dismas hardy over by the sink throwing water on his face for the third time in ten minutes as though thats gonna help holidays voice carried traces of his fathers tennessee accent and the edges of it caressed like a soft southern breeze it would help if i could dry off didnt the first two times hardy had used up the last of the paper towels and now stood facing his cupboards in his business suit his face dripping over the sink holiday shrugged himself up from the couch dug in the wastebasket by the desk and came up with a handful of used paper which he handed over never let it be said i cant be helpful it would never cross my mind hardy dried his face so where were we youre due in court in fortyfive minutes and youre so hung over you dont remember where we were if youd behaved this way when you were my lawyer id have fired you hardy fell into one of his chairs i couldnt have behaved this way when i was your lawyer because i didnt know you well enough yet to go out drinking with you thank god youre just out of practice its like riding a horse youve got to get right back on when it tosses you i did that last night twice dont look at me if memory serves nobody held a gun to your head why dont you call and tell them youre sick get a whatdoyoucallit continuance hardy shook his head cant this is a big case all the more reason if you cant think but you said it was just dope and some hooker but with elements hardy said in fact he hadnt done a hooker case for nearly a decade in his days as an assistant da the occasional prostitution case would cross his desk hardy mostly found these morally questionable politically suspect and in any case a waste of taxpayer money prostitutes he thought while rarely saintlike were mostly victims themselves so as a prosecutor he would often try to use the girls arrests as some kind of leverage to go after their dope connections or pimps the true predators occasionally it worked since hed been in private practice because there was little money in defending working girls he never saw these cases anymore as a matter of course the court appointed the public defenders office or private counsel if that office had a conflict in this way aretha labontes case had been assigned to gina roake a midforties career defense attorney but ginas caseload had suddenly grown so large it was compromising her ability to handle it effectively if she wanted to do well by the rest she had to dump some clients including aretha by chance she mentioned the case to her boyfriend hardys landlord david freeman whod had a good listen and smelled money with his ear always to the ground freeman had run across some similar cases arethas arrest had been months ago now her case was interesting and from freemans perspective potentially lucrative because her arresting officer wasnt a regular san francisco policeman instead he had been working for a company called wgp inc which provided security services to businesses under a jurisdictional anomaly in san francisco in its vigilante heyday a century ago the city found that its police department couldnt adequately protect the people who did business within its limits those folks asked the pd for more patrols but there was neither budget nor personnel to accommodate them so the city came up with a unique solutionit created and sold patrol beats to individuals who became private security guards for those beats these beat holders or patrol specials then and now were appointed by the police commissioner trained and licensed by the city the beat holders could and did hire assistants to help them patrol and in time most patrol specials came to control their own autonomous armed force in the middle of the city on his beat a patrol special tended to be a law unto himself subject only to the haphazard and indifferent supervision of the san francisco police department they and their assistants wore uniforms and badges almost exactly like those of the city police they carried weapons and like any other citizen could make arrests aretha labontes arrest had occurred within the twelvesquareblock area just south of union square known as beat thirtytwo or simply thirtytwo it was one of six beats in the city owned by wgp the corporate identity of a philanthropic businessman named wade panos he had a total of perhaps ninety assistants on his payroll and this along with the amount of physical territory he patrolled made him a powerful presence in the city arethas case was not the first misconduct that freeman had run across in panoss beats in fact freemans preliminary and cursory legwork his sniff test revealed widespread allegations of assistant patrol specials use of excessive force planting of incriminating evidence general bullying if hardy could get aretha off on this one assistant patrol specials misconduct and several of the other sniff test cases could be developed and drafted into legal causes of action he and freeman could put together a zillion dollar lawsuit against panos they could also include the regular police department as a named defendant for allowing these abuses to continue but at the moment hardy didnt exactly feel primed for the good fight he brought his hand up and squeezed his temples then exhaled slowly and completely its not just a hooker case its going to get bigger and delay doesnt help us theres potentially huge money down the line but first ive got to rip this witness a new one if he goes down we move forward thats the plan which gang aft agley especially if your brains mush itll firm up pain concentrates the mind wonderfully and i really want this guy what guy the prosecutions chief witness the arresting cop nick sephia suddenly holiday sat upright nick the prick sounds right whatd he do wrong this time planted dope on my girl let me guess she wasnt putting out for him or paying for protection so he set her up youve heard the song before its an oldie but goodie diz everybody knows it whos everybody a shrug the neighborhood everybody suddenly hardy was all business he knew that holiday owned a bar the ark smack in the middle of thirtytwo knew it hell hed closed the place the night before but somehow hed never considered holiday as any kind of real source for potential complainants in the panos matter now suddenly he did you got names john people who might talk to me ive talked to a lot of folks in the neighborhood in the last couple of months people might be unhappy but nobodys saying anything too specific a little snort pussies theyre scared scared of wade panos holiday pulled at the side of his mustache and nodded slowly yeah sure who else thats what im asking you hardy hesitated look john this is what freeman and i have been looking for we need witnesses wholl say that things like this sephia bust im doing today are part of a pattern that the citys known about and been tolerating for years if you know some names id love to hear them holiday nodded thoughtfully i could get some maybe a lot he said theyre out there ill tell you that his eyes narrowed you know nicks his nephew dont you wades panoss so his own uncle fired him moved him out of harms way is more like it now hes working for the diamond center and youre keeping tabs on him weve been known to sit at a table together poker which as your lawyer i must remind you is illegal you beat him a shrug i dont play to lose the wednesday night game had been going on for years now in the back room of sam silvermans pawnshop on ofarrell a block from union square there were maybe twenty regulars you reserved your chair by noon tuesday and silverman held it to six players on any one night nobody pretended that it was casual entertainment among friends table stakes makes easy enemies especially when the buyin is a thousand dollars twenty white chips at ten bucks each fifteen reds at twenty and ten blues at fifty made four or five small piles that could go away in a hurry sometimes in one hand with his neat bourbon in a heavy bar glass john holiday sat in the first chair to silvermans left and two chairs beyond him nick sephia now smoldered hed come in late an hour ago and had taken a seat between his regular companions wades little brother roy panos and another diamond center employee named julio rez the other two players at the table tonight were fred waring a midforties black stockbroker and mel fischer who used to own four nosh shop locations around downtown but was now retired at thirty or so sephia was the youngest player there he was also by far the biggestsixthree maybe all of it muscle while silverman took the young greeks money and counted out his chips sephia carefully hung the coat of his exquisitely tailored light green suit over the back of his chair the blood was up in his face the color in his cheeks raw beef the scowl a fixture hed shaved that morning but his jawline was already blue with shadow after he sat he snugged his gold silk tie up under his adams apple rage flowing off him in an aura the usual banter dried up after a few hands during which no one said a word roy panos pushed a cigar over in front of the late arrival holiday sipped his bourbon eventually silverman maybe hoping to ease the tension called a bathroom break for himself and sephia lit up blowing the smoke out through his nose waring and fischer stood to stretch and pour themselves drinks holiday quietly enjoying sephias pain had a good idea of what was bothering him maybe the whiskey was affecting his judgmentit often didbut he couldnt resist bad day nick sephia took a minute deciding whether he was going to talk about it finally he shook his head in disgust fucking lawyers i spent half the day in court why whatd you do whatd do he blew smoke angrily i didnt do dick roy panos helped him with the explanation they suppressed his evidence on some hooker he brought in for dope a couple of months ago said he planted it on her so holiday was all sweet reason if you didnt whats the problem sephias dark eyes went to slits his temper ready to flare at any indication that holiday was having fun at his expense but he saw no sign of it guy made me look like a fucking liar is the problem like im supposed to remember exactly what i did with this one whore shes got junk in her purse another ones got it in her handbag who gives a shit where it was or how it got there its there shes guilty end of story am i right fuckin a julio rez a mediumbuilt latino spoke without any accent all wires and nerves hed probably been a good base stealer in his youth hed lost the lower half of his left ear somewhere but it didnt bother him enough to try to cover it with his hair which was cropped short she goes down but not today today they let her go panos spoke to holiday they suppress the dope theres no case were you down at court too panos shook his head no but wade was my brother he is pissed off not at me i hope sephia said panos patted him on the arm no no the lawyers bastards why would your brother be mad at nick holiday sipped again at his tumbler of bourbon he was working for him at the time thats why it makes wade look bad i mean nicks doing patrol for christ sake he busts a hooker she ought to stay busted at least now maybe they start looking at the rest of the shop judge reamed my ass sephia said this prick lawyerhe had the judge talking perjury being snotty on the record i find the arresting officers testimony not credible as to the circumstances surrounding the arrest yeah well mr hardy you can bite me holiday feigned surprise hardys my lawyers name dismas hardy now sephias glare was full on the fuck i know but whatever it is i see him again hes going to wish i didnt so he must have convinced them you did plant her rez shot a quick glance at sephia but sephia held holidays eyes for a long beat as though he was figuring something out she wasnt paying he finally said his voice filled with a calm menace wade wanted her out of the beat most of the time thats intensive care i figured i was doing the bitch a favor dismas hardys wife frannie cocked her head in surprise theyd just sat down at a small spanish place on clement not far from their house on thirtyfourth avenue youre not having wine she asked not tonight nothing to drink at all just water waters good you feel all right fine sometimes i dont feel like drinking thats all oh thats right i remember there was that time right after vincent was born their son vincent was now thirteen she reached her hand across the table and put it over one of his did you hurt yourself last night half a grin flickered then died out i didnt think so at the time im out of shape pounding myself with alcohol frannie squeezed his hand out of shape could be a good thing you know but she softened her tone how was john entertaining charming drunk the usual though he came by the office this morning fresh as a daisy he must have been pouring his drinks in the flowerpots so what time did you finally get in oneish thats a guess you were asleep though i think arent you glad you decided to take a cab when you went out thrilled i guess i must have taken a cab back home then huh if john didnt drive you hardy pressed two fingers into his temple no i think we can rule that out a look of concern you really dont remember no i remember i didnt even think id hurt myself until this morning when that moose in my mouth wouldnt stop kicking at my brains he shrugged but you know with john maybe you dont have to keep up with him thats what they all say but then you do the waiter came by with a basket of freshly baked bread some olives a hard pungent cheese frannie ordered her usual chardonnay as advertised hardy stayed with water they kept holding hands over the table the waiter vanished and hardy picked up where theyd been hes more fun than a lot of people he said and more interesting than almost everybody except you what a sweet thing to say and so sincere she squeezed his hand i dont have a problem with him really or with you i dont know if i understand the attractionif you were a woman okaybut i dont like to see you hurting im not so wild about it either but you hang out with john holiday theres a chance youll drink too much sometimes and in spite of all this by the way today wasnt a total loss maybe i should have a drink after all celebrate what you know that motion to suppress he told her about his afternoon in the courtroom getting nick sephias evidence kicked out which led to aretha labontes case being dismissed not that its going to change her life in any meaningful way shes probably back on the street even as we speak although if shes smart shes not working one of wade panoss beats but it was nice to serve notice that this stuff isnt flying anymore when it was over david even had a little moment of actual drama right there in the hall of justice the curmudgeonly and unkempt seventysevenyearold legal powerhouse that was david freeman wouldnt give wade panos or his hired thug nick sephia the satisfaction further he did not believe in revealing pain or weakness under any conditions but most especially in a professional settling so even dismas hardy whod been there wasnt aware of how badly hed been hurt how badly he still hurt at first he even tried to fake it with roake on her sixth full day of automatic redial she had finally succeeded in getting dinner reservations for them both at the legendarily swank restaurant gary danko freeman wasnt going to whine and ruin the special night shed so painstakingly orchestrated so after the successful hearing and the little problem hed had with sephia and panos hed forgone any celebration with hardy and instead had beelined home from the hall of justice hailing a cab as soon as he was out of sight around the corner in his apartment he popped a handful of aspirin with a hefty shot of calvados then he ran a hot bath and soaked in it before dragging himself into bed where he slept for three and a half hours until his alarm jarred his aching body into a disoriented awareness it cost him a half hour laboring mightily through the pain to get himself dressed freeman held fast to a lifelong core belief that juries didnt trust nice clothes and so of the seven business suits he owned six were brown and straight off the rack but the last one was a khaki canali that roake had bought him last christmas he was wearing that one tonight with a red silk tie over a rich ivory custommade shirt his scuffed cordovan wingtips were the only sign of the usual freeman by the time roake had come by to pick him up at seven oclock he had steeled himself and thought he was ready but then she surprised him or perhaps his flashy clothes surprised her in any event she hung back in the doorway and whistled appreciatively frankly admiring him for a moment then took a little skip forward and threw her arms around him squeezing hard a cry escaped before he could stop it what is it david are you all right whats the matter he was righting for control his jaw set brow contracted blowing quick short little breaths from his mouth now two hours later he awoke again from his third brief doze he was back in bed in his pajamas and roake was sitting at his side holding his hand you really ought to see a doctor she said but he shook his head if it aint broke dont fix it and nothings broke but youre hurt he started to shrug then grimaced tomorrow ill be dancing you wait he put a hand to his neck and turned his head slowly from side to side a couple of times then stopped and fixed her with a sheepish gaze i feel like such a fool what for you didnt ask for this no but i knew who i was dealing with i should have been prepared in the old days i would have been prepared for nick sephia to knock you over the old man looking every year of his age nodded wearily they set me up how did they do that childs play with a trusting soul like myself he sighed in disgust id already had a few words with the elder mr panos after dismas beat the hell out of sephia on the stand what in the world prompted you to do that hubris plain and simple another sigh i couldnt resist the opportunity to crow a little though i thought id done it subtly enough in the guise of giving him a friendly warning of what was coming roake allowed a small smile hence your nickname mr subtle in any event it didnt fool him much so afterwards a bunch of their guysdick krolls there too you know dick sephias lawyer and panos and one of nicks pals id seen in court with him before some greaser anyway all these guys are having some kind of powwow out in the hall so wade sees me come out with hardy and motions to me over nicks shoulder come on over and you went what was i gonna do i tell diz to wait and give me a minute im thinking no doubt i put the fear of god in wade and hes talked to kroll and decided to cave and try to cut some kind of deal right there that hubris thing again freeman raised his shoulders an inch acknowledging the truth occupational hazard if you happen to be cursed with genius anyway its here to stay another shrug so im like two steps away when nick the prick suddenly whirls aroundwhoops late for a busand next thing i know im flat on my keister stretched out on the goddamn floor and theres nick leaning over me all sorry old man didnt see you finally his eyes got some real fire back into them sorry my ass wade gave him some kind of sign and he turned on cue that was his warning back at mefuck with me and youll get hurt he went to straighten up in the bed but his bones fought him and won he gave it up falling back into his pillow roake put her hand on his chest brought it up to stroke his cheek you guys she said gently then in a minute it could have been an accident after all couldnt it no no chance so now you need to get back at them is that it he nodded in the words of ol blue eyes ill do it my way but bet your ass i will reading her reaction he added thats the only message they hear and how about you which one do you hear what do you mean by that i mean you warn them they attack you now its your turn again and it all escalates until somebody really gets hurt maybe it doesnt always have to be that way with some people maybe it does what else do you do when theyre pulling shit like today you fight back is what roake had her hands back in her lap then youre both still fighting and whats that prove when somebody wins it ends and i intend to win and thats what its all about is it who wins yep defiantly what else he asked what else is there roake sat with it for a beat she blew out in frustration finally she looked down at him and stood up how very male of you theres worse ways to be gina what else do you want she looked down at him i want you to be smart dont get drawn into playing their games this doesnt have to continue being personal especially if they believe in doing things like today in actually hurting people thats all im saying file your papers keep out of it and let the law do its work thats exactly my intention what else would i do freeman patted the bed come sit back down im not selfdestructive you know im not going to fight anybody physically roake lowered herself down next to him again thats what i thought you were saying she took his gnarled hand in both of hers no no no im talking what i do the law thatll beat up on em good enough but i will tell you one other thing whats that whatever else it might look like its going to be personal lieutenant abraham glitsky once the powerful head of san franciscos homicide detail was halfblack and halfjewish and in his job hed groomed himself to exude a threatening mixture of efficient competence and quiet menace his infrequent smiles would even more rarely get all the way to his piercing blue eyes a semitic hatchet of a nose protruded over a generous mouth rendered unforgettable by the thick scar that bisected both lips now this fearsome figure stood framed in the doorway to his duplex he wore neither shoes nor socks and his bare legs showed at the bottom of a dirty kitchen apron hed draped a diaper over his right shoulder it was streaked recentlywith the oranges and greens and offbrowns of strained baby food he held his tenmonthold daughter rachel in the crook of his left arm she had somehow wriggled out of one of her pink baby booties and just as glitsky opened the door shed hooked it over his ear wheres a camera when you really need one hardy asked frannie stepped forward here abe let me hold her in what had become a largely unacknowledged weekly ritual the hardys wednesday date night was ending here again since rachels birth frannie couldnt seem to get enough of holding her she was turning forty soon and their children were both teenagers maybe she and dismas should have another baby there was still time just if dismas wanted one too which he did like he wanted cancer he couldnt decide if the visits to hold rachel were a good thing because it satisfied frannies need to hold a baby or a bad thing because it made her want one of her own even more but either way theyd been coming by now regularly enough that there was usually some kind of dessert waiting for them when they got there glitsky shrugged the baby over to frannie immediately grabbed at the bootie you ought to leave it hardy begged its so you and that pink goes just perfect with the puke on the diaper glitsky glanced down at his shoulder thats not puke puke is eaten regurgitated expelled matter thishe touched the diaperis simply food that didnt quite get to the mouth guys guys frannie whisked the diaper over to her own shoulder she slipped the booty over rachels foot then fixed each of the guys with a look fascinating though these distinctions are maybe we could leave them just for a minute she turned into the living room hardy behind her didnt want to let the topic go he could score some valuable points here you know fran if you really want another baby youve got to be ready to deal with puke i can deal with it fine she said over her shoulder i just dont want to talk about it much less conjugate it hardy took the cue i puke you puke he she or it pukes suddenly treya came around the comer from the kitchen who wants another baby ten minutes later they were arrangedcoffee for the hardys tea for the glitskysaround the large square table that took up nearly all the space in the tiny kitchen rachel was dozing ready to be laid down in her crib although neither frannie nor treya seemed inclined to move in that direction the treat tonight was a plate of homemade macaroon cookies still hot from the oven all coconut and sticktotheteeth sweetness these hardy said to treya after his first bite are incredible i didnt know normal people could make macaroons abe can not that hes a normal person exactly or even approximately hardy said but if he can make these things maybe theres still some use for him youre both too kind glitsky turned to hardy so where did you think they came from macaroons i thought they dropped straight out of heaven like manna in the desert in fact i always imagined that manna had kind of a macaroon flavor didnt any of you guys im serious his face lit up with an idea hey manna macaroons that wouldnt be a bad brand name we could market them like mrs fields abes manna macaroons we could all get rich frannie spoke somebody please stop him glitsky jumped in its a good idea diz but i couldnt do it anyway im going back to work next week monday treya gave him a wary look you hope all right he conceded i hope why wouldnt you be hardy asked how longs it been anyway on monday itll have been thirteen months two weeks and three days roughly treya added pointedly not that hes been counting glitsky was coming off a bad year one that had begun with a pointblank gunshot wound to his abdomen for the first month or so after the initial cleanup hed been recovering according to schedulegetting around in a wheelchair taking things easywhen the first of several medical complications had developed a secondary infection that finally got diagnosed as peritonitis put him back in the hospital where he then developed pneumonia the double whammy had nearly killed him for a second time and left him weakened and depleted through rachels birth last august until late in the fall then suddenly the initial wound itself wouldnt completely heal it wasnt until february of this year that hed even been walking regularly at all and a couple of months after that before he began trying to get back into shape at the end of may his doctors finally declared him fit to return to work but glitskys bosses had told him that homicides interim headthe lieutenant whod taken glitskys placewould need to be reassigned and there wasnt an immediately suitable job befitting his rank and experience so glitsky had waited some more now they were in july and evidently something had finally materialized but obviously with a wrinkle so whats to hope about getting back on monday hardy asked how could it not happen you walk in say hi to your troops go back to your desk and break out the peanuts the lieutenants desk in homicide was famous for its unending stash of goobers in the shell glitsky made a face apparently treya said its not that simple hardy finished a macaroon sipped some coffee what he asked somebody from the office saw you in the apron i bet thats it we can sue them for discrimination you should be allowed to wear an apron if you want dismas shut up frannie said what abe well the pd will of course welcome me back but maybe at a different job what job hardy asked maybe theyre promoting you i didnt get that impression theyre talking payroll head of payrolls a sergeant hardy said isnt he used to be anyway glitsky hesitated seems theres been some concern that i was excessively close to my work in homicide evidently this is a bad thing treya added as opposed to what frannie asked bored with it you havent even gone to work for a year hardy said how does that put you excessively close to it glitsky nodded i raised some of the same points myself and hardy asked and in the past few years as we all know my daughter was killed i had a heart attack and i got shot in the line of duty one of which actually happened because of the job treya was frowning deeply he also got married and had a baby as if theres some connection there too glitsky shrugged its just an excuse its really because my extended disability made them put a new guy in homicide for the duration gerson right hardy said thats him they probably told him it was his permanent gig when they moved him up and now that ive had the bad grace to get better theyre embarrassed so transfer him hardy said what does the union say they say gersons been doing okay so far and it wouldnt be fair to transfer him before hes even really gotten his feet wet it might look bad for him later whereas ive already proved myself and so as a reward theyre moving you out frannie asked and down not down treya said hes going to be lieutenant of payroll i dont even know where payroll is glitsky said much less what they do thats perfect hardy said you wouldnt want too many people working at jobs they know about god forbid glitsky said and the great thing as they so graciously explained to me is that this is not a punishment its an opportunity to improve my resume i spend maybe a year in payroll then they promote me to captain at one of the stations couple of years there next thing you know im a deputy chief his lifelong dream treya added with heavy sarcasm hardy knew what treya meant glitsky had worked fourteen years in the department before he got to inspector sergeant at homicide and then another eight before they promoted him to lieutenant of the detail abe didnt crave varied administrative experience he wanted to catch murderers have you talked to batiste hardy asked this was frank batiste recently promoted to deputy chief for many years as captain of inspectors he had been glitskys mentor within the department maybe he could throw some juice but glitsky shook his head who do you think i talked to hardy frowned i thought he was your guy well glitsky made a face treya knew that her husband wasnt comfortable complaining about a colleague so she helped him with it it seems like franks going through some changes himself like what frannie asked its not frank glitsky said he wasnt going to let people badmouth another cop even if there might be something behind it hes stuck too his wife hasnt sold a house in a year they got kids in college times are not sweet so he makes them bad for you too whats that about again glitsky wouldnt rise i cant really blame him diz he cant afford to lose his own job to make me happy that wouldnt happen treya argued hes too connected people might have said the same thing about me last year glitsky said its a different world down there lately he shrugged frank got the word from above then he got to be the messenger if he didnt want to deliver it theyd find somebody else and then hes not a team player anymore he had no choice but treya shook her head he didnt have to tell you good cops dont go where they choose they go where theyre ordered that doesnt sound like a friend i could hear me telling one of my troops the same thing clearly uncomfortable with the discussion glitsky looked around the table as for being friends franks my superior officer hes doing his job so youre really going to payroll frannie asked i cant really see you crunching numbers all day long the edge of glitskys mouth turned up im sure therell be lots of hidden satisfactions in any event ill find out on monday you got a backup plan hardy asked glitsky looked at treya tried a smile that didnt quite work weve got a new baby he said what else am i going to do it was a thursday evening in early november daylight saving time had ended on the previous weekend and consequently it was full night by six oclock it was darker even than it might have been because the streetlights on ofarrell street between stockton and powell had not come onperhaps they hadnt been set back for the time change a fifteenknot wind was biting and blowing up from off the bay pushing before it the occasional large drop of what was to be the first real rainstorm of the season although sam silvermans pawnshop was located only one block south of the alwayscongested union square neighborhood tonightwith the awful weather and deep blacknessthe street out front was all but deserted silverman had already locked the front door and pulled both sides of the antitheft bars on their tracks now all he had to do when he was ready to leave was to unlock the door again for a moment step outside and pull the bars so that he could padlock them together he stood at the door inside an extra second and frownedthat hour of lost daylight always depressed him for the first week or so sighing he turned and walked back through the center aisle of his shop reaching out and touching the treasures of other peoples lives against which hed loaned them moneyguitars and saxophones and drum kits silverware cutlery fine porcelain china sets doll collections televisions radios microwave ovens much of it bought new in a spirit of hope for the future now most of it abandoned forever secondhand junk without a trace of dream left in it at the back counter he stopped again struck by the display jewelry was by far his biggest stock item and the watches and rings the necklaces and earrings though lovely tonight seemed to hold even more pathos than the other goods these were mostly giftsat one time theyd been the carefully chosen expressions of love of vows taken and lives shared now they were locked under the glass in a pawnshop to be sold for a fraction of their cost with all the human value in them lost to time and need he shook his head to rid himself of these somber thoughts the start of winter always did this to him and hed be damned if hed give in to it maybe he was getting that sickness where you got sad all the time when the weather sucked but no hed lived in san francisco his whole life and god knew there had been enough opportunity that he would have caught it before now it was just the early darkness he glanced back at the front door and saw himself reflected in the glassa small somewhat stooped decently dressed old jewish man it was black out there time passed during which he didnt move a muscle when he heard the wind gust then fade and drops of rain just beginning to sound slowly onto the skylight overhead he started coming suddenly back to where he was he looked up at the source of the noisethe skylight covered with bars was just a dark hole in the ceiling the thought crossed his mind that he wished hed kept up his contract with wade panos it would be nice on a miserable night like tonight to have one of his big and armed assistant patrol specials walk with him the two blocks around the corner to the night deposit box at bank of america but he and sadie had gone over it and decided they couldnt justify the prices anymore especially since wade was raising them again while it was somewhat comforting to have the private patrol watching out for youespecially on your walks to the bankit wasnt as though this part of the city was a magnet for violent crime anymore nothing like it used to be the shop hadnt even had a window broken in over twenty years no the patrol special was a luxury he really didnt need and couldnt afford anymore and it wasnt as though the city police didnt patrol here too maybe just not as often still though he considered calling the station and requesting an officer to walk over to the bank with him but even if they could spare anyone hed have to wait here another hour or so maybe he just shouldnt do the errand tonight but thursday after the poker game was always his deposit night and last night hed made one of his biggest hauls he flicked on the small nightlight in the jewelry cabinet enough with maudlin hed better get finished here or hed get soaked on the way to the bank he considered that maybe this should be the year he and sadie pack up and buy a condo like the ones theyd looked at last summer in palm springs maybe even scottsdale although when theyd gone there in the summer a few years back it had been way too hot and leaving his friends here and his synagoguedid they really want to do that what did he think he was going to do in palm springs without the company of nat glitsky a brother to him all these years and nat with a new baby grandchild wasnt going anywhere sam loved sadie but she was a readera very solitary and passionate readernot a games person nat on the other hand loved all kinds of gamesbackgammon dominoes scrabble anything to do with cards they had tournaments for gods sake with trophies no sam didnt really want to move he just wanted the days to be longer again fartknocker he said aloud to himself shaking his head in the back room he went to a knee worked the combination swung open the door to the safe lifting out the old maroon leather pouch he was struck again by the thickness of it he unzipped the top and ran his thumb over the top edges of the bills nearly twentytwo thousand dollars in all more than two months worth of the shops earnings even if he included what he made on his poker fees it would be the largest deposit hed made in years he zipped it back up and placed it in the inside pocket of his jacket a last check of the shop then he grabbed his fedora off the hat rack pushing it down hard over his crown against the wind hed encounter when he got outside he turned out the lights and retraced his steps down the center aisle stopping a last time he looked both ways up the street and saw nothing suspicious he reached for the door and pulled it open the plan was a simple one speed and efficiency they wore heavy coats latex gloves and ski masks to thwart identification none of them was to say one word before they knocked silverman out the old man was holding his hat down securely on his head with one hand pulling the door to behind him when the three men came out of hiding in the doorways on either side of his shop windows and pulling their masks down over their faces fell upon him the biggest guy got the door while the other two grabbed him by the arms covered his mouth and manhandled him inside and back up the aisle in the back room they turned the light on but the old man had gotten his mouth free and was starting to make noise now yelling at them maybe getting up the nerve to give them some kind of fight as though he had any kind of chance but delay would mean a hassle and since hassle wasnt part of the plan the big man pulled a revolver from his pocket the old geezer was actually making a decent show of resistance struggling manipulating his shoulders from side to side grunting and swearing with the exertion because of all the lateral movement the first swing with the gun glanced off the side of the mans head but it was enough to stop him stunned by the blow the instant was long enough the next swing connected with silvermans skull and dropped him cold he slumped into dead weight and they lowered him to the ground where he lay unmoving the big man knew just what he was looking for and where it would be in two seconds hed unplugged the surveillance video mounted over the office door five seconds later he had the maroon leather pouch in his hands and was back on his feet he pulled his ski mask off and threw it to the floor his accomplices removed theirs and put them in their coat pockets okay the big man said vamonos leading the way he doused the shop lights again he was at the front door halfway out somebody called out guys wait up the gunman stopped and turned waiting up wasnt in the plan the idea was to get the money and then get out closing the dark shop behind them when silverman came to if he ever did theyd be long gone the fuck are you doing their third partner remained in the back of the shop over the jewelry case still glowing under its soft nightlight hes got great stuff here we cant just leave it yeah we can lets go the big man had the door open and was checking the street he turned back and whispered urgently we dont need it we gotta move move move the man in the back moved all right but in the wrong direction now he was behind the counter pulling at the glass trying to lift it up hes gotta have a key somewhere maybe its on him at the door fuck it come on come on his partner pulled again at the countertop a noise in the street shit people the two men up front ducked to the side below the windows as two couples walked past the shop directly in front of the door they stopped their voices filled the shop would they never move on sweat broke on the big mans forehead and he wiped it with the back of his hand he pulled the revolver from his pocket other people joined up with the first group and they all started walking again laughing the big man looked out the street seemed clear but at the back counter his partner was holding something up nowa keyand fitting it to a lock jesus christ theres no time for when suddenly he was proven right whatever it might have been there wasnt going to be time for it silverman must have come to and had a button he could push in the back room the whole world lit up with light and the awful continuous screaming ring of the shops alarm wideeyed in the sudden daylike brightness the big man threw the door all the way open yelling go go go this timethe jewelry forgotten in the mad rush outboth his partners went he was turning himself breaking for the street when he caught a movement off to his left one hand to his head blood running down his face silverman was on his feet holding the side of the doorway for support the big man saw the shock of unmistakable recognition in the pawnbrokers face i i cant believe silverman stammered then ran out of words shaking his head in frustration and disgusttheir good plan was all in tatters nowhe stood up slowly and took three steps toward the old man as though he planned to have a conversation with him he did speak but only to say ah shit sam then he raised the gun and shot him twice in the chest the streetlights on ofarrell came on as assistant patrol special matt creed working thirtytwo came around the corner a long block down on market though creed had been on the beat less than a year when he heard the squeal of the burglar alarm and saw the two men breaking out of a storefront ahead of him on a dead run he knew what he was seeing hey hold on he yelled into a gust over the alarm and the wind to his surprise the men actually stopped long enough to look back at him creed yelled again and moving forward now reached down to clear his jacket and unholster his weapon but he hadnt gone five steps when crack unmistakably a gunshot brickwork shattered by his head rained down over him creed ducked against the front of the nearest building another man broke from the door of silvermans shop less than a half block separated them now and creed stood stepped away from the building into the lamplight and called again hold it stay where you are the figure stopped whirled toward him and without any hesitation extended his arm creed caught a quick glint of shining steel and heard the massive report and another simultaneous ricochet it was the first time hed been fired at and for that moment during which his assailant broke into a run he half ducked again and froze by the time hed recovered raised his own weapon and tried to level it with both shaking hands the third man had disappeared with the other two and there was no real opportunity to shoot creed broke into a full run and reached the corner in time to get a last glimpse of what seemed to be a lone fleeing shadow turning right at the next corner vaguely aware of pedestrians hugging the buildings on both sides of the street he sprinted the length of the block along the cable car tracks past the trees that incongruously sprang from the pavement near the end of the powell street line by the time he got down to the cable car turnaround at market it was over there was no sign of any of them theyd probably split up and gone in separate directions but even if they had stayed together which creed would have no way of knowing they could go in any one of six or seven directions from this intersectionstreets and alleys within a half block in every direction each a potential avenue of escape the turnaround also marked the entrance to the subterranean bart station and since creed hadnt gotten close enough to get a good look at any of them as soon as his three men stopped running they would look like anyone else he had a sense that the man whod fired at him was bigger than the other two but that was about it a fresh gust of wind brought on its front edge a wall of water as the drizzle became a downpour creed heard the insistent keening still of silvermans alarm he took a last look down market but saw nothing worth pursuing he looked down at his gun still clenched tight in his right hand unexpectedly all at once his legs went rubbery under him he got to the nearest building and leaned against it he got his gun back into its holster buttoned the slicker over his jacket against the rain began to jog back to silvermans it didnt take him a minute still the alarm pealed the door yawned open the shops interior lights illuminated the street out front creed drew his gun again and stood to the side of the door raising his voice over the alarm he called into the shop is anybody in there he waited then even louder mr silverman remembering at last he pulled his radio off his belt and told the dispatcher to get the regular police out here with his gun drawn he stepped into the light and noise of the shop but he saw or heard nothing after catching sight of the body the victim might have been napping on the floor except that the arms were splayed unnaturally out on either side of him and a stream of brownishred liquid flowed from under his back and pooled in a depression in the hardwood floor the skin on sergeant inspector dan cuneos face had an unusual puffinessalmost as though hed once been very fatand it gave his features a kind of bloated empty quality not exactly enhanced by an undefined wispy brown mustache that hovered under a blunt thumbprint of a nose but his jaw was strong his chin deeply cleft and he had a marquee smile with perfect teeth tonight he wore a black ribbed turtleneck and black dress slacks he was a professional and experienced investigator with an unfortunate arsenal of nervous habits that were not harmful either to his own or to anyone elses health they werent criminal or even in most cases socially inappropriate yet his partner lincoln russella tall lean africanamerican professional himselfwas finding it increasingly difficult to tolerate them russell worried about it it reminded him of how hed gotten to feel about his first wife monica before he decided he was going to have to divorce her if he wasnt going to be forced to kill her first she wasnt a bad person or an unsatisfactory mate but she had this highly pitched laugh that finally he simply couldnt endure any longer shed end every sentence every phrase almost with a little heehee sometimes heeheehee regardless of the topic as though she was embarrassed at every word every thought every goddamned impulse to say anything that passed through her brain by the last few weeks of their cohabitation russell would often find himself in a high rage before he even got to their front door merely in anticipation of hi honey heehee and the chaste little kiss his fists would clench he knew it wasnt fair of him wasnt right it wasnt monicas fault hed even told her about how much it bothered him asked her politely more than several times if she could maybe try to become aware of when she did it which was all the time and perhaps try to stop ill try lincoln i really will heehee oh im sorry hee one of the things he loved most about dierdre his wife now of eleven years was that she never laughed at anything and now his partner of six years a damn good cop a nice guy and the other most intimate relationship in his life was starting to bother him the way monica had he thought it possible that this time it could truly drive him to violence if he couldnt get dan to stop here on this miserable night for example they had been called to a homicide scene just outside the tenderloin some poor old bastard beaten up and shot dead and for what a few hundred bucks no sign of forced entry to his shop nobody even tampered with the safe botched robbery was russells initial take on it probably dopedup junkers too loaded to take the stuff they came for but a tragic scene its looking like the guys married forever an old ladys picture on the desk kids and grandkids on the wall awful stupid pointless and awful and heres his partner humming volare to beat the band humming while the young beat guy creed all traumatized is giving his statement to them humming as he follows the crime scene photographer around snapping pictures of everything in the store humming while the coroners assistant is going over body damage occasionally breaking into words in both italian and english volare whoaoh cantare oh oh oh oh now its tenthirty theyve been here three hours somebody is knocking at the door and cuneos going over to open it suddenly breaking into song just like birds of a feather a rainbow together well find suddenly russell decides hes had enough dan what completely oblivious russell holds out a flat palm shakes his head background music ixnay cuneo looks a question checks the figure at the door then gets the message nods mercifully shuts up the sudden silence hits russell like a vacuum the rain tattoos the skylight overhead im wade panos patrol special for this beat and no pussycat heavyset an anvil where most people have a forehead eyebrows like the business side of a barbecue brush pure black pupils in his eyes almost like hes wearing contacts for the effect mind if i come in under his trenchcoat panos was in uniform in theory patrol specials were supposed to personally walk their beats in uniform every day then again in theory bumblebees cant fly but obviously panos at least went so far as to don the garb he looked every inch the working cop and cuneo opened the door all the way sure panos grunted some kind of thanks he brushed directly past cuneo and back to where silvermans body lay zipped up in a body bag the coroners van was out front and in a few more moments theyd be taking the body away but panos went and stood by the bag went down to a knee you mind if i the coroners assistant looked the question over to cuneo whod followed panos back to the doorway the inspector nodded okay and the assistant zipped the thing open panos reached over pulled the material for a clearer view of silvermans face a deep sigh escaped and he hung his head shaking it heavily from side to side did you know him cuneo asked panos didnt answer right away he sighed again then pulled himself up when he turned around the patrol special met cuneos gaze with a pained one of his own long time to a great degree cuneos nervous habits were a function of his concentration which was intense his mind preoccupied with the immediate details of a crime scene or interview situation would shift into some other trancelike state and the rest of his behavior would become literally unconscious and the humming or whistling or fingertapping would begin now panos took up space next to russell in the front of the shop neither man saying much of anything although they were standing next to one another the body had been taken away and the crime scene people were all but finished up packing away whatever theyd brought cuneo was back in the office doing snippets of pachelbels canon in d while he took another careful look aroundhed already discovered the unplugged video camera located one of the bullet holes in the wall and extracted the slug lifted some of his own fingerprints matt creed had finished his regular beat shift after the preliminary interview hed had with the inspectors at silvermans and now he appeared again in the doorway this time carrying a cardboard tray of paper coffee cups hed picked up at an allnight place on market he paused at the sight of his boss mr panos he said is everything all right id say not no i know thats not how i meant it thats all right creed that coffee up for grabs creed looked down at his hands yes sir a couple of minutes later the last of the crime scene people were just gone and panos creed and russell had gathered at the door to the office in which cuneo was now rummaging through the drawers in silvermans desk bagging in ziploc as possible evidence whatever struck his fancy he had stopped humming though now at regular intervals he slurped his hot coffee through the hole in the top of the plastic lid loud and annoying as a kids last sip of milkshake through a straw suddenly he looked up the sight of other humans a mild shock but he recovered slurped spoke to panos you said he wasnt your client anymore no but hed been for a long time panos boosted himself onto silvermans desk and blew at his own brew i had to raise my rates last summer and he couldnt hack them anymore but ask mr creed here we still kept a lookout creed nodded every pass cuneo moved and his folding chair creaked every pass what every pass id shine a light in no charge panos put in just watching out but hesilvermanwasnt paying you anymore right so thencuneo came forward his elbows on his kneeswhy are you here again the question perplexed and perhaps annoyed panos he threw his black eyes over and up to lincoln russell who stood with his arms crossed against the doorsill but russell just shrugged the incident occurred on mr creeds shift so he was obviously involved and he was one of my men plus as i say i knew sam the deceased but this place isnt technically in your beat thirtytwo isnt it cuneo sucked again at his coffee panos straightened up his torso and crossed his arms yeah its thirtytwo so what cuneo sat back in his chair so since the deceased is your friend and exclient you might know something more about this shop than your average joe off the street isnt that right and if you do what do you think might have happened here panos grunted let me ask you one did either of you or any of the crime scene people find a red leather pouch here maybe on sam what leather pouch panos held his hands about eight inches apart about this big real old maroon maybe more than red cuneo glanced up and over at russell who shook his head cuneo spoke no pouch what about it no pouch makes it open and shut what this was about i mean russell spoke from the doorsill and what is that were listening cuneo said panos shifted his weight on the desk all right he said first you should know that thursdays was when sam took his deposit to the bank every thursday russell asked panos nodded clockwork everybody who knew him knew that i used to walk with him myself over to the b of a he put the cash in this pouch its not here now so cuneo butted in he was going to the bank tonight and somebody who knew him decided to take the pouch three guys creed corrected one of em pretty big okay three cuneo hummed a long unwavering note must have been a lot of money they were going to split it three ways might have been panos said i wouldnt know cuneo indicated the surroundings this little place did that well panos shrugged wednesday nights they played poker here the two inspectors shared a glance who did russell asked bunch of guys it was a regular game for a lot of years sam took out ten bucks a hand for himself except when he played blackjack when he was the house russell whistled softly every hand panos nodded that was the ante per guy per hand ten bucks a silence settled while they did the math cuneo hummed another long note big game he said pointing thats the table then right were going to need the players russell said did he keep a list i doubt it panos replied knowing sam he kept them in his head but i might be able to find out and you can take it from there wed appreciate that cuneo was making some notes on his pocket pad so they came in masked they werent masked creed said not when they came out they were when they came in cuneo said because silverman knew them they knew him and the setup here he pointed to the hidden video up above they knew about that for example panos stopped him how do you know about the masks cuneo reached into his pocket and pulled out a gallon ziploc bag into which hed placed the one ski mask that had fallen to the floor sons of bitches panos said who cuneo asked panoss jaw was tight his heavy brow drawn in itd be a better guess once we know who was at the game all right cuneo said but this is a homicide investigation what youll do is give us a list of players at the game and well work from that panos nodded all right but id appreciate it if youd keep me in the loop whoever killed sam any way i can help you count me in for several years after the death of his first wife flo glitsky had a livein housekeepera woman born in jalisco mexico with the german name of rita schultz she had slept in the living room of his duplex behind a shoji screen and had come in her own way to be almost one of the family after the marriage when treya and her then sixteenyearold daughter raney had come to live with glitsky and his sixteenyearold son orel rita wasnt needed anymore and glitsky regretfully had had to let her go now and for the past eight months since treya had gone back to work at the das office rita no longer living in was again at the glitskys five days a week taking care of the baby two months ago the big kids had both gone off to collegeorel to his dads alma mater of san jose state and raney all the way across the country to johns hopkins where shed gotten a full academic scholarship and planned to major in premed the baby rachel moved out of abe and treyas bedroom and into raneys old room behind the kitchen over the summer he and treya had actually fixed up the place a bit they tore out the old battleworn gray berber walltowall carpet in the living room and discovered the original blond hardwood underneath over one weekend they stripped the seventies wallpaper and repainted the walls a soft tuscan yellow then with the fresh new look they got motivated to go out and buy a modern brown leather couch and matching love seat some colorful throw rugs missionstyle coffee and end tables they put plantation shutters over the front windows it wasnt a large place by any means and glitsky had lived in it for more than twenty years but with all the recent changes he would sometimes come out into the new living room holding rachel in the dimly lit predawn and wonder where he was he knew it wasnt just the room in reality everything seemed different the whole world since the terrorist attacks the new reality perhaps more psychic than physical but all the more real for that all his boys now moved out his old job gone a new marriage with a young woman and for the past fourteen months their baby girl at such timesnow was one of themhe would stand by the front windows with rachel in his arms and together they would look out at the familiar street hed done the same thing dozens of times with isaac jacob and orel when they were babies but now he did it to try and convince himself that he was the same person with rachel that hed been to his sons and that his home was not foreign soil he opened the shutters and looked down the street toward its intersection with lake the rain had kept up throughout the night but the wind had finally abated with the first sign of light now outside it was all heavy mist under high clouds that would hang on all day if not longer glitsky stared out through it holding his daughter up against him patting her back gently a pedestrian appeared at the intersection and turned into his street though he wore a heavy raincoat that hid the shape of his body and had pulled a brimmed hat down over his face glitsky knew who it was as soon as he saw him whats grandpa doing here he asked his daughter his own brow cloudingthis could only be bad newshe watched his father plod slowly up the street hands in his pockets head down when he was out front glitsky moved to the front door and opened it nat was already coming up the stairs the dripping hat in one hand lifting his feet one heavy step after the other what glitsky asked his father stopped before he got to the landing he raised his eyes but something went out of his shoulders abraham the way he said his sons name made it sound as if just getting to him had been his destination he let out a breath sam silverman he said shaking his head somebody shot him nat walked the last few steps up and abe stood aside to let him pass while nat hung his coat on the rack by the door his son went in to wake trey a and give her the baby when he came back out his father was sitting forward on the edge of the new love seat his hands clasped between his knees he looked feeble a very old man in fact he was eighty years old but on a normal day no one would guess it abe went down on a knee in front of him did you get any sleep dad nat shook his head no sadie called me about midnight i went over there hows she holding up his father lifted his shoulders and let them drop a complete answer treya was holding the baby and came up beside them how are you holding up nat you want some tea he looked up at her managed a small smile tea would be good he said treya moved around her husband and sat down next to nat rachel reached out a tiny hand to touch his face said gapa and got a small smile out of him treya put an arm across his shoulders and rested her head against him for a beat then kissed the side of his head and stood up again well be right back the men watched them leave nat turned to abe why would somebody do this to sam of all people sam who wouldnt hurt a fly glitsky had heard the refrain hundreds of times when hed been in homicide and the answer was always the same there was no answer no why so abe didnt try to supply one instead as though knowledge could undo any of it he asked do you know how it happened i dont know what you want me to do im not in homicide anymore what nobody remembers you over there the two men were at the kitchen table rita had arrived and could be heard reading a childrens book in spanish to rachel in the living room treya was getting dressed for work abe had no intention of snapping at his father but it took some effort even after four months on the new job the topic of his employment with the police department still tended to rile him up he forced an even tone people remember me fine dad but i dont work there itll look like im meddling so meddle in what way exactly just let people know this one is important people care who shot sam abe turned his mug theyre all important dad most people who get shot have somebody who cares about it with his index finger nat tapped the table smartly three times dont give me with everybody cares abraham ive heard your stories most are what do you call no humans involved i know how it is down there im saying go make a difference what could it hurt what could it hurt thats what i said i heard you abe sighed you want me to what exactly just keep up on it keep them on it nat put a hand on his sons arm abraham listen to me if they see its family abe knew that wouldnt help not in any meaningful way the inspectors on the caseand he didnt know who they were yetwere either good at their jobs or they werent and that more than anything else would determine whether they succeeded in identifying and arresting sam silvermans killer then what he asked they look harder he shook his head theyll look as hard as they look dad theyll either find him or not thats what will happen period me butting in wont make any difference it might in fact actually hurt nats eyes flared suddenly with impatience and anger so what then you cant even try you let the animals who shot sam walk away abe couldnt completely check his own rush of frustration he bit off the words sharply its not up to me its not my job anymore im not talking job i dont care from job im talking whats right he drew a deep breath again rested his hand on abes arm just so they know thats all this one matters abe glanced down at his fathers hand since hed started with payroll he hadnt even shown his face once in homicide even for a social visit he realized now that his reluctance with his dad was probably more about his own demons than whether he could actually have any effect in turning the heat up on any given investigation it might not hurt after all he put his own hand down over his dads all right he said but no promises no of course not heaven forfend the payroll detail had four entire rooms each twelve feet square glitsky was the sole occupant of his he had a standard cityissue green desk four wooden chairs a computer and his own printer which also served the rest of the detail and natural light through the windows that made up the back wall these overlooked the everscenic bryant street and the rest of the industrial neighborhood to the south all the free space around the other three walls was taken up with mismatched black gray or green filing cabinets except for one metal floortoceiling bookshelf filled to overflowing with bound computer payroll reports going back four years an hour after he got to work he was talking to jerry stiles in his office stiles was the lieutenant in charge of narcotics before that he had been in many peoples opinion the absolute best narc in the city certainly his arrest record backed that up his seizures of illegal substances three years ago before his promotion hed been named police officer of the year stiles was thirtyeight years old in spite of his administrative role he often found an excuse to get back on the street and today he wore a ratty beard and looked as though he hadnt combed his greasy brown locks since the world series in fact currently he could have been mistaken pretty much exactly for a typical street drunk but that came with the territory making glitskys small airless office a less than optimal spot to talk to him that office was one floor up from homicide on the fifth floor of the hall of justice glitskys normal staff in his new role in payroll included five civil service secretaries two halftime sergeants of police and one rotating patrolmangrade gopher this morning hed been planning to check in at his desk then zip on down to homicide while the motivation held but instead he found a note from frank batiste on his chair telling him to expect stiles within the hour glitsky and batiste had already discussed stiless situation with some heat luckily for glitskys peace of mind since he had no other duties at the present moment within the hour turned out to be about ten minutes he and stiles made small talk catching up for a while theyd worked together on cases before and gotten along beyond that theyd both caught lead in the line of duty and that put them in the same club stiles made a few profane remarks that made it clear he thought glitskys latest career move was unjust abe didnt comment though the sentiment did his heart good finally though the air got a little ripe and glitsky decided to get to the point he went around his desk tried the windowsboth hermetically sealed no chanceand sat down so he began sorry to pull you in after your shift hey a shrug its overtime im here anyway im not complaining whats it about well funny you should mention ot is somebody bitchin about ot again stiles straightened up in his chair his eyes getting some life in them they can kiss my ass yeah well he let it hang of everything glitsky hated about this new job this kind of bureaucratic nonsense was first im just delivering the message jerry and only because ive been requested to informally im not keeping any record of this meeting fuck that as if i care who requested if you dont mind my asking just curious it doesnt matter right what do you thinks got into frank lately i dont know he must be getting mature but glitsky didnt want to discuss batiste he pulled a printout from a file in front of him glanced at it then turned it around and slid it across the desk stiles all belligerence now came forward and snatched it he raised his voice in the small room so whats the message tell my guys to go out and risk their lives every night live with these scum smell like a sewer and do it all for free glitsky had his elbows on the desk he templed his fingers at his mouth for a moment then pointed at the paper your units ot is about twenty percent over department guidelines he raised his eyes met those of his colleague ive been asked to bring the matter to your attention glitsky tried to avoid profanity but this was so much bullshit and nothing else that the temptation was almost too great instead he said now ive done that all right so what stiles stared at the paper for another couple of seconds narcotics works nights abe we catch bad guys and the da takes them to court during the day quite often on a day after a night shift you know why we get subpoenaed to show up thats why were the fucking key witnesses without us theres no case get it so what do they want us to do but stiles didnt want an answer he wanted to vent the reason we work nights is because thats when these lowlifes crawl out from under their rocks its when they buy their shit and make their deals and have their fights its when it works stiles turned on his chair stood up sat back down glared across the desk glitsky did his buddha imitation stiles started again even louder they dont want to pay the guys extra maybe they can have night court course then nobodys out on the street doing the job or maybe we could just ask these scumbags if maybe they could do all their business between eight and five business hours he half turned again on his chair ran a hand over his forehead finally settled a little shook his head back and forth i dont believe this shit glitsky came forward an inch you might want to take it up with the chief jerry either that or tell your guys they can only work days wed never bag a soul but your detail would be under budget and thats the important thing right who cares about crime glitsky gave no sign he was joking stiles sat still a moment abe were the police department what are these clowns thinking when stiles left glitsky didnt give himself any more time to think about it he stood up came around his desk and looked in at the room next door there two of his secretariesmercedes and jacquelinewere engrossed at their respective desks in front of their computers jacqueline didnt look up when he cleared his throat at the door she must have been at a really juicy part of her romance novelbut mercedes in the middle of her daily crossword puzzle brightened at the sight of glitskys face lieutenant nine letters jackson aka ends in l it took him less than ten seconds stonewall thats it stonewall i was thinking something about michael if there was another way to spell it but normally thats only seven letters but stonewall andrew right youre great lieutenant she looked over to jacqueline stonewall she said the other woman nodded umm glitsky pointed down the hallway ive got an errand you women okay holding the fort but mercedes was leaning over her newspaper carefully filling in her boxes and didnt respond or notice as he left down a flight on the internal stairs and in a few more steps he was back where hed lived for all those years it brought him up short how physically close the homicide detail was to his current office where nothing important had or ever would happen it was probably no more than sixty feet although the spiritual distance was incalculable standing in the middle of the familiar room he was surprised by how little it had changed in the near yearandahalf since hed been here as usual on a weekday morning the place was desertedsome inspectors were out working cases others might be in court or increasingly had not come in at all because of vacation alleged sickness special training or any of a dozen other reasons somebody had moved the fullsize working stoplight off of braccos desk and it now hung from the ceiling a floortoceiling picture of the world trade center at the moment of the second impact was attached to the pillar behind marcel laniers desk and the old bulletin board on itformerly reserved only for the grossest most explicit crime scene photographshad been done over with an osama bin laden motif mostly email printouts of the terrorist being sexually abused by a variety of weapons and animals otherwise the decor was the same so was the smell but at least glitsky knew what that was as usual the last one out had left the coffee cooking and it had turned to carbon at the bottom of the pot he automatically walked over leaned down to make sure and turned it off can i help you he straightened up and turned at the voice the lieutenant had silently come out of his office or maybe glitskys senses were taken up with his impressions in any event for a heartbeat he felt somewhat bushwhacked although there was no indication that that had been the mans intention it was barry gerson glitsky recognized the face immediately from the newspaper pics which hed had occasion to notice when theyd announced the appointment ten years glitskys junior but no kid himself gerson had gone a bit to paunch and jowl though he didnt come across as soft or flabby in any way here on his turf he appeared relaxed and in complete control the smile was perfunctory but there wasnt any threat in it youre abe glitsky guilty i didnt realize you were back at work four months now glitsky kept it lowkey he pointed at the ceiling put some humor in his tone payroll the throbbing pulse of the department gerson to his credit in glitskys view clucked sympathetically they give you that varied administrative experience crap a nod its making me a better cop i can feel it every day me too he said then more seriously sorry i turned out to be the guy glitsky shrugged somebody had to be not your fault he added im not hearing any complaints though i cant say ive been in touch gerson cocked his head as though the comment surprised him his next smile might have been a bit more genuine not even lanier this question wasnt a great surprise marcel lanier was a longtime homicide veteran inspector whod passed the lieutenants exam well over two years before it was no secret that hed craved the appointment to head the detail after glitsky hed even turned down a couple other of the varied administrative experiences hed been offered waiting for the homicide plum only to be disappointed at gersons appointment like glitsky lanier was homicide through and through his refusal to take what they offered before hed even made his bones as a lieutenant had at least for the time being doomed him with the brass but glitsky hadnt talked to him in six months or more not a word he told gerson he making trouble here the lieutenant seemed to consider what he would say for a minute then he shook his head naw hes all right and suddenly the preliminaries were over so how can i help you three hours after concluding his meeting with gerson glitsky was in another of the payroll rooms this one internal and hence windowless and more crowded since it held not only as much paper and other junk but also two desks to accommodate its two workers in practice because the two office residents rarely worked the same days one desk probably would have sufficed but nobody ever brought this up or suggested that the second desk be removed to make more room that of course would mean that neither person working there would have his own desk and wouldnt that be just an unbearable slight in any event pride of desk was typical of a number of similar crucial issues facing the detail at this moment glitsky was behind the closed door of this office with deacon fallon who it appeared was having continuing problems with jacqueline the romance novel fanatic from the office across the hallway as a sergeant with the police department fallon made more money per hour than jacqueline did in spite of his parttime status he had conceived the notion that he somehow outranked her a mere clerk originally hired from the civil service pool though by now shed been working fulltime for five years three more than fallon fallon was in his early forties his wife had some honcho job in what he called the private sector between the two of them and the police union theyd brokered a deal with the city whereby deacon could stay home a lot with the kids hed been in the department for twenty years and could have already retired on pension but the department had a few of these parttime positions and deacon could increase his retirement base one year for every two he worked which he considered a good deal glitsky propped on the corner of one of the desks sat back with his arms crossed his concentration had been wavering in the tedium and now he realized that fallon pacing in front of him while hed been talkingexpected some sort of response im sorry what fallon sighed jacqueline she says shes always taken her lunch between noon and one though we know that isnt true and she doesnt have to change now if she doesnt want to but cathy and i cathy my wife okay right cathy and i signed up for this incredible sixweek course on website design i know i know but its the new wave of this net stuff believe me its going to explode it really is a great business abe you might even want to look into it yourself the opportunities are just perhaps sensing glitskys lack of enthusiasm for the project he wound down anyway its twice a week tuesdays and thursdays at noon which happens to be when youre supposed to be here right i mean i get the hour lunch which is enough time each lesson is fortyfive minutes glitsky knew that what fallon meant was that by leaving twenty minutes early and getting back half an hour late then eating lunch at his desk he could squeeze the class into his hour lunch nobody would ever say a word about an abuse of free time like this these were the little perks enjoyed by those ready to lay down their lives for their fellow citizens but its got to be the noon hour and jacqueline wont trade he looked expectantly at glitsky who hadnt moved his posture was relaxed his arms still crossed over his chest he might have appeared to be thinking hard abe no response i mean i dont want to have to go to the union about this he tried another tack maybe we could both get off at the same time me and jacqueline its only for six weeks finally glitsky took a deep breath his eyes came into focus when i came on here didnt i read in your file that you decided that youd like to have lunch from one to two and didnt jacqueline agree back then to change to noon so the office would be covered yeah her earlier scheduling flexibility didnt seem to have made much of an impact on fallon but that was before this class and im the sergeant here after all besides shes not doing anything special just meeting her regular friends and hell its only six weeks glitsky later told treya that the knock at the door probably saved him from at least a charge of aggravated mayhem if not homicide it was mercedes telling him frank batiste was on the line and wanted to talk to him immediately he thanked her slid off the edge of the desk and without so much as a glance at fallon hurried from the room the rain continued unabated a fine slow drizzle that only seemed heavy to glitsky because he hadnt supposed hed be leaving the building and so was in his shirtsleeves batiste had been standing waiting at the head of the hallway that led to his office when glitsky got off the elevator hed fallen in beside him and without much preamble led the way out the halls front entrance to the street where are we going glitsky asked on the outer steps i thought lous sound good batiste broke into a jog and abe had no choice but to follow across bryant and down to the floor below the bailbondsmans place where lou the greeks had operated continuously as the legal communitys primary watering hole for nearly thirty years the last of the lunch crowd was finishing up and they had no trouble finding a booth under one of the small elevated windows that because lous was below ground level opened at about gutter height to the alley outside lou was a handson and voluble proprietor who knew everybody who worked at the hall of justice by first name he came by before theyd gotten settled and offered them a onceinalifetime deal on the last couple of servings of one of his wifes inspired culinary inventions athenian special rice minced pork scrambled eggs i think some soy sauce cucumber and taramosalata everybodys raving about it taramosalata glitsky said that would be fish roe dip lou grinned i know i told chui the same thing but thats why shes the genius the taramosalata is like anchovies just included for flavor you dont even taste it i bet i would glitsky said it sounds terrific lou batiste said but i dont think were eating thanks lou wasnt five steps away putting in their orders for tea and coffee when glitsky spoke so this isnt about jerry stiles and his departments overtime batiste checked the surrounding area no one was in earshot and still he leaned in across the table between them i thought itd be helpful if we had a talk abe just you and me man to man friends like i think weve always been glitsky thought that the friendship theyd always shared would not have allowed one to peremptorily summon the other for a serious discussion of issues during work hours but he only nodded no think about it frank good batiste folded his hands on the table between them i know you havent been exactly thrilled with the new job i sympathize i spent a year before i got homicide in personnel records so i know its been what now a couple of months four but the times just flying by a pained look that long batiste sighed well im aware of you up there the rest of the administration is too its not going to last forever i thought it already had but the comers of glitskys mouth turned up for him a broad smile he was keeping it light and friendly well im sure it does seem that way but ive got my eye out for a chance to get you out of there lateral or up either way getting back to homicide isnt even out of the question thats good news frank thank you lou returned at that moment with their drinks and it broke their rhythm when lou walked away again a silence fell at the window by their ear the rain picked up batiste put some sugar into his mug and stirred thoughtfully glitsky blew over the surface of his tea finally batiste found the thread again i guess what im trying to say is that it would be well worth your while if you could just hang in there a little while longer youve got great support across the board abe youve been a hero and now youre putting up with this this waste of your talents for the good of the team dont think people dont recognize this dont think it doesnt matter well thats gratifying glitsky said i mean it it should be it is glitsky put his mug down leveled his eyes across the table so why am i hearing a but now batiste broke a small and formal smile could it be that finely honed and welldeserved reputation for cynicism glitsky allowed his own expression to match batistes it could be that but im thinking maybe its also that gerson talked to you a slight pause then a nod maybe some of that glitsky let out a heavy breath turned his mug around on the table he hated to explain to be on the defensive and his jaw went tight still he kept his voice tightly controlled silverman the victim was my fathers closest friend frank i asked barry if he could just keep me informed no press at all thats what i heard too batiste spread his hands all innocence he didnt come to me with it as any kind of complaint we were just having lunch and it came up glitsky nodded perhaps somewhat mollified all right but what im talking as your friend what i said when we got here this is the kind of thing thats nothing in itself hey one time your dads friend you want to be inside who wouldnt understand thats all it was one time four months back and i finally stop by homicide once batiste reached out his hand over the table and touched glitskys youre listening to me abe but youre not hearing it wasnt a problem really not with barry not with me he drew his hand back im talking about the future just that you be a little careful you dont want to have peopleand not only barrymisinterpreting thats all people are touchy you know what im talking about i told my dad the same thing this morning there see okay but then i figured what could it hurt to go to the horses mouth i was completely upfront with barry im not horning in on him or anybody else nobodys saying you were lanier thieu evansall homicide inspectorsany of them would have found out anything i wanted but i didnt want to go behind barrys back the explaining was wearing him out i thought if i could id give my dad a little more peace of mind thats all i hear you abe i do i also know how badly you want homicide back and i wouldnt be a friend if i didnt make it crystal clear that this wouldnt be the way to go about getting it that never occurred to me i didnt think it would but i wanted the air clear between us im trying to fasttrack you and it wouldnt help if it looked like you were trying some end run glitsky shook his head not even a double inside reverse frank but just for the record i truly am ready for another assignment im trying abe i really am he finished his coffee think you can make it another couple of months glitsky put his own cup down if a couple doesnt mean a whole lot more than four he said inspectors dan cuneo and lincoln russell had pulled a long night that ended near dawn so they didnt come back to work the next morning until after am when they finally checked in they found theyd miraculously after only six weeks received a positive dna match on one of their outstanding casesa rape and murderso their first stop was the video store where shawon worked and where they put a pair of handcuffs on him by the time they finished the arresting folderol and were ready to get back to wade panos less than an hour of daylight remained though with the continuing and steady rain what daylight there was didnt amount to much the administrative offices for all of panoss operations werent downtown in thirtytwo but a couple of miles south in a nomansland of underutilized piers and semiabandoned warehouses lining the bay below china basin this neighborhood comprised another beatsixtythree it was light years from the highend marinas such as mccovey cove that had sprung up by the bay bridge with the embarcadero upgrades and the draw of pacbell park cuneo parked at the curb directly in front of the onestory flatroofed stucco box and doublechecked the address i admire a man who doesnt waste his money on overhead he said neither the single glass door nor the large picture window afforded a hint about what was insideboth were tinted black with fitted blinds on the wall next to the door gonetogreen brass lettering identified the building as the home of wgp enterprises inc cuneo looked across at his partner maybe rotorooter needed the rs and stole em russell had no idea what he was talking about and wasnt going to ask he got out of the car and was a step behind cuneo when they walked in inside the place was much deeper than it looked from without several offices opened off the hallway back behind the wellappointed reception area a pretty darkeyed young woman in a heavy cowlneck white sweater stopped working on her computer and smiled a greeting at them can i help you absolutely cuneo flashed all his teeth all business russell stepped around his partner he had his identification out and showed it to her were with homicide we talked to mr panos last night at mr silvermans pawnshop hes expecting us oh yes youre the gentlemen who called earlier well one of us is cuneo said then clarified a gentleman thats nice to hear theyre getting to be in terribly short supply he extended his hand inspector dan cuneo and this is inspector russell first name unnecessary she took his hand liz ballmer nice to meet you her eyes went to russellboth the smile disappeared and she swallowed nervously ill tell him youre here it was an impressive albeit industrial office glass block served as opaque windows just under the ceiling and found an echo in the large coffee table in front of the long leather couch against one wall the rest of the furnitureseveral chairs and another smaller couchwas all chrome and leather framed and mounted photos of panos with various luminariessan franciscos mayor the police commissioner both us senators rock stars and other celebritiescovered most of one entire wall thats who was there panos was saying all of them cuneo studied the list of the poker players from silvermans game he was sitting sideways from panoss expansive desk drumming the theme from bonanza with two fingers on the coffee table in front of him with addresses yet he said very nice panos nodded i thought id save you guys some legwork as he had last night he wore his uniform steam curled from a large mug of coffee at his right hand one of the guys in the gamenick sephia he pointed youll see him therehes my nephew used to work for me in fact since when has poker gotten legal russell asked you know anybody in vice wants to hassle with it panos asked when so many of them play themselves anyway it turns out nick knows all the guys from wednesday those five six including him which makes this your lucky day cuneo stopped his drumming in what way panos sipped coffee in the way that you wont even need to talk to all of them russell came forward to the edge of the couch how would we avoid that you start with john holiday you ever heard of him cuneo raised his head not much since tombstone i heard he died then why would we have heard of him he had some legal troubles not too long ago they made it into the newspapers whatd he do russell asked what he used to do panos said was run a pharmacy holiday drugs ring any bells cuneo looked the question to russell shrugged nada he said so what so he got into the habit of filling prescriptions without worrying too much about whether or not they had a doctors signature on them when they stung him they had guys on videotape writing their own scrips at the counter right in front of him when was this exactly russell asked i think i did see something about it panos considered briefly year year and a half ago and hes not still in jail cuneo asked he never went to jail he got himself a hotshot lawyer who cut some deal with the da got the thing reduced to a business and professions code beef he got some community hours and they took his license but thats it basically he walked cuneos fingers started moving again the william tell overtureta da dum ta da dum ta da dum dum dum so you think holidays the shooter im saying you might save yourselves some trouble if you talk to him first if you can find him sober he sipped some coffee my brother roy is working up in thirtytwo now maybe he could help you you keep wanting to help us cuneo said if cuneo was trying to get some kind of rise out of panos he wasnt successful the patrol special took no offense turned his palms up i liked sam silverman inspector i liked him a lot if ive got resources that might help you find his killer im just telling you youre welcome to them if youre not so inclined of course thats your decision whats your brother do russell asked that he might help us roy hes an assistant patroller same as mr creed last night he works the beat hell know the players in the game you mean russell asked that too panos said but i was talking more generally the connections always thirtytwo panos nodded at cuneo mostly he likes the action downtown a shrug he might be able to save you some trouble thats all hell know where you can find holiday anyway without a bunch of running around cuneo flicked at the player list why him holiday other than the old pharmacy beef he lost six thousand dollars at sams the night before the number jerked russells head up six thousand thats the number nick gave me cuneo whistled he came to this game with six grand in his pocket russell was on the same page whered he get that kind of money he owns a bar the ark he pointed northward again up in thirtytwo a real dump but they must move some booze whatever it was he had the money on wednesday and lost it all i know the ark cuneo said maybe your brother could meet us outside give us what he can say a half hour ill call him right away panos said set it up six grand russell asked again yeah well panos said the point is hed be motivated to get it back wouldnt you think they were driving back downtown through the dark drizzle cuneo was forcing air rapidly back and forth through the gap in his front teeth keeping a rhythm tapping the steering wheel to the same beat after ten blocks of this russell finally had to say something you ever get tested for like hyperactivity or anything dan his partner looked over no why because maybe you dont know it but you never stop stop what making noise humming songs keeping a beat whatever i do a pause are you kidding me no you do like right now you were doing this russell showed him and hitting the steering wheel to the same beat i was i was just thinking about these poker guys and last night it was volare and back in the office just now with panos you were doing the lone ranger or bonanza or something with your fingers russell played the beat on the dashboard i mean i dont want to complain but youve always got something going and i just wondered if it was something you could control cuneo accelerated through an intersection he looked across at his partner all the time russell considered pretty much cuneo made a face i think as you say its mostly when your minds on something else russell said when its just you and me its one thing but around witnesses yeah i hear you they drove on another few blocks in silence finally cuneo turned in his seat again maybe we could get some signal where you tell me when im doing it you pull at your ear or something i could do that and when its you and me alone just tell me i dont want to be on your case all the time hey be on my case youre doing me a favor well well see they had gone a few more blocks and were stuck in rainsoaked friday rush hour gridlock a couple of blocks south of market when russell spoke again dan youre doing it again california girls clint terry knew trouble when he saw it and this time he recognized it right away roy panos all by himself was usually good for some kind of problem and tonight he had reinforcements cops without a doubt the smell all over them cops were always trouble in the bars mirror he saw them enter stop in the doorway look the room over they stayed by the front for a moment talking checking out the place the one good window with its view of the parisian touch massage parlor across the street plywood over the other one the stools were bolted to the floor the bar was pitted and overlacquered clint terry went about six feet four he had been almost famous once as a young man when his life had breathed with great promise an allamerican linebacker at michigan state he then had gone on to play half a season with the packers before a couple of guys had clipped him one from each side and had broken all three major bones in his right leg which bob costas on national tv had conceded was a damn good trick they still replayed the tape of his last moment in pro ball a couple of times a year on shows with titles like footballs ugliest moments by the time he was twentyfour his football career over he came out to the left coast where nobody knew him to explore his sexuality hed heard there was more tolerance for alternative lifestyles in san francisco than anywhere else and that turned out to be true to support himself he got a job as a bouncer at the condor a strip club in north beach for almost three years he did okay until in a misplaced burst of enthusiasm he bounced one tourist too hard and got charged with manslaughter now thirty years old and a convicted felon hed served his four years at folsom hed had sixteen months to get reaccustomed to living outside of prison walls and he liked it way better than in he had a partner he loved and didnt need much more this bartending gig was about as good as he thought it was ever going to get and he didnt want to lose it the cops finally made it to an open spot at the rail terry swiped at the bar with his towel threw down some coasters as always when he spoke to law officers his stomach fluttered high up under his ribs but he ignored that as best he could and offered up a smile hey roy help you gentlemen the badges the flat nononsense faces one black and one white homicide inspectors then the black guy saying were looking for john holiday you know where he is no sir i havent seen him he hasnt been in today whens the last time you saw him the white guy asked hed picked up his coaster holding it in one hand and flicking it with the fingers of the other yesterday i think he opened up whats this about roy panos moved forward put his elbows on the bar lets see if you can guess clint well make it a quiz what do you think homicide inspectors would be interested in terry wiped his hands on his towel shifted his eyes up and down the bar he had maybe a dozen drinkers for the twenty stools and none of them looked ready for a refill you nervous clint the white guy again still flicking the damn coaster he seemed pretty highstrung maybe nervous himself no he wiped his bar rag across the gutter its just im working that was the other thing the black guy said we were hoping you could give us a minute maybe go to the office you got a room in the back here i assume yeah but as i said he motioned ambiguously around him i mean look the white guy sighed heavily and finally put the coaster back down so you wont talk to us terry wasnt too successful keeping the fear and worry out of his voice im not saying that im talking to you right now tell me what it is you want to know he wants to help dan the black cop said we can tell his parole officer he wants to cooperate thats an intelligent response the cop named dan replied in a cheery and suddenly frightening tone and especially coming from an exconvict it gives me confidence that the prisons are doing a good job after all his eyes never left his partner ask him where he was last night last night i was here the whole night six to two and i didnt even ask him yet the black guy said see hes just volunteering everything mr cooperation yeah dan said but you notice he happened to know what hours wed be asking about he came back to terry what about that clint i dont know what youre saying you asked where i was last night and i told you i was here so then you couldnt have been up at silvermans pawnshop dan flashed some teeth at him did you hear about that terry felt sweat breaking on his forehead yeah sure but i heard that was like a gang no just three guys dan smiled across at him but let me get this straight you didnt know what we wanted to talk about when we came in here tonight even hearing we were from homicide but you knew about silverman i just didnt put that together terry said and that couldnt have been john he shook his head wiped down the gutter again john wouldnt have done anything like that that would be the same john holiday who got arrested last year dan asked that was different terry said and he got off on that besides that wasnt violent john wouldnt do anything violent actually the black cop said its interesting you brought up holiday again and mentioned violence because as it turns out we dont think he was the shooter he just thought up the idea is what we hear kind of like a whitecollar idea that went south yeah dan agreed jumping right in giving terry no time to process this stuff as it came out in fact our best witness was one of roys partners here walking his beat last night whats his name again roy panos appeared to be enjoying every minute matt creed you remember matt dont you clint he nodded this place used to be one of the beats clients roy explained dan nodded apparently fascinated with the history lesson well he said matt says no question it was the big guy of the three who shot silverman he was the last one out the big guy big like a football player terry put his hands on the gutter for support his legs were going to give out under him i was here he said i love a consistent story dan announced happily to his two companions hes said the same thing three times now you guys notice that no deviation at all always a sign a guys telling the truth suddenly he started whistling the theme song from bridge on the river kwai he stopped in midphrase who worked till six one of the customers slammed his glass down on the bar bartend you sleepin down there i need another drink terry worked the orders for the next few minutes finally made it back to where the cops sat they hadnt budged you know on second thought i could use a glass of water dan said then as terry was filling it so who worked till six last night didnt i say that i told you john opened up so he was here with you when you changed shifts for a few minutes yeah but he had a date a date with who i dont know youve got to ask him that i will when i meet him dan drank some water did another bar or two of river kwai hed taken over the interview now moved it into high gear so was randy here too terry gave roy a bad look what did he tell you nothing just that you and randy were an item youre together a lot thats right you seem a little defensive im not defensive randys got nothing to do with this with what what were talking about here silverman i didnt say anything about silverman i asked if randy was here last night hes got nothing to do with it as opposed to you and holiday no i didnt mean that terry ran his whole hand through his hair but listen whatever its not randy but he was here again the young white guy came quickly forward pouncing dont be dumb clint if he was here hes your alibi think about it i already told you he was here as a matter of fact no you didnt but now you do say he was terry nodded we were alone here after john left for i dont know an hour or two it was a slow night as quickly as hed come forward dan leaned back smiled triumphantly spread his arms out there beautiful thats all we wanted you randy and holiday here together at six oclock last night that wasnt so hard now was it he lives with you doesnt he randy the black cop got back in the game is he there now do you know maybe you could give us the address when they came out of the ark the two inspectors stopped and stood on the sidewalk in front of the place roy panos had gone to the bathroom and they were waiting for him to finish up and come outside i like this guy roy cuneo said his brother was right he knows the players russell cocked his head back toward the bar you think terry was part of it ill tell you one thingroy thinks he was that would be pretty easy wouldnt it the first guy we talk to cuneo shrugged ive heard it happens not to us generally a grin maybe not yet first time for everything right the bar door swung open hey roy that went pretty well thanks my pleasure ive got to tell you it was awesome watching you guys work another minute he would have been crying he did seem a little nervous cuneo said i would have been too whys that roy you think he did it russell asked terry roy gave it a second was it true what you guys said about the shooter being a big guy you didnt just make that up to spook him russell nodded thats what mr creed said three of them one of them big roy looked back and forth at the two inspectors clints not little he said no hes not cuneo shot his partner a glance came back to roy what about this randy clints boyfriend he with holiday too theyre all buds roy said lowlife would mr creed know terry cuneo asked on sight sure im wondering if he could id him as the shooter get him in front of a lineup itd be worth checking out russell said we could find out pretty quick roy said he looked at his watch hes on the beat in ten minutes hell be at the station checking in now you want to walk down im on my way there anyhow to check out its like four blocks matt creed was in fact at the station signing in to come on for his nights work with the patrol special liaison he greeted roy perfunctorily then glanced at the men with him and recognition hit he spoke first to roy this is silverman then isnt it then to cuneo are you inspectors having any luck yet getting a few ideas cuneo said roy here says you might know clint terry creeds brow contracted in a question and roy answered it bartender over at the ark oh yeah i got him creed said why you said last night that the shooter was a big man mr terrys a big man the idea played itself across creeds face you think he shot silverman we dont know russell said were open to the idea do you remember seeing mr terry at the ark last night when you walked your beat creed shook his head i didnt even look in he said theyre not on the beat anymore but you passed by the place right cuneo asked couldnt have been five minutes before you got to silvermans do you remember if it was open the young security guard tried but finally shrugged frustration all over his face the doors closed the windows boarded up if they were open they werent having a party but beyond that i couldnt tell you i didnt see anybody go in or come out but i couldnt tell you i really looked he met cuneos eyes you really think it might have been terry youre the one who chased him we were hoping maybe you could tell us you said the shooter was big russell added as big as terry creed closed his eyes for a moment maybe but it happened fast and it was dark plus i was shitting in my pants at the time i dont think i could pick him out of a lineup if thats what you mean this was disappointing news and both inspectors showed it cuneo however bounced right back all right but you wouldnt eliminate him is the point no i suppose it could have been him there you go cuneo said but who were the other guys creed asked you must be thinking randy wills and john holiday cuneo started making a little clicking sound im thinking it a little more right now he said what made you think of them they hang out a lot you see them around together holiday was at silvermans poker game russell said roy panos was nodding through a deep scowl he lost six grand cuneo was still making the clicking noise anything about the other two guys you saw make it impossible it was them holiday and wills no but they didnt stay around to talk the other two could have been anybody else but it also could have been them am i right cuneo didnt want to lose his focus yeah sure or them the clicking stopped okay then dismas hardy was listening to his wifes voice on the speakerphone in his office and taking notes about what he might want to pick up at the grocery store on his way home if he wanted to be the perfect husband and save her a trip ordinarily she would have just walked over herself the safeway was only a couple of blocks down around the corner but now with the rain shed have to drive which meant finding another parking place possibly even farther from their house than the store was not possibly definitely hardy said i do a little victory dance whenever i get closer than safeway so whats on the list he wrote as she finished reciting coffee cottage cheese cherries claussens celery goods beginning with c i got it anything else a short silence then frannie said oh and some copper clappers got it clara see you in an hour hardy hung up he moved the newly framed picture of his wife to front and center on his desk and gave it a moment the planes of his face softened the edges of his mouth tickling at a smile it was a head and shoulders shot hed taken recently in their home on an indian summer saturday morning for the first time ever rebecca and vincent had both spent the night with separate friends frannie was turning away from rearranging the caravan of glass elephants on the mantel over the fireplace in their front room in the picture frannies eyes were full of mischief her own smile about to break the unseen story was that theyd just finished making love on the living room floor by no means a daily event the camera had been sitting next to hardys reading chair and hed grabbed it called her name and got her mooning over your wife again caught in the act we are having a bit of a renaissance good for you david freeman stood in the doorway a large wineglass in each hand he schlumped his way across the office put one of the glasses on hardys desk and pushed it across chateauneuf du pape cuvee des generations nineteen ninety its just too good not to share and the pups downstairs are all working maybe im working too the old man shook his head not likely this time friday night i know you youre done he had come around behind hardy new picture that is a good one though im surprised shes letting you display it in public hardy feigned ignorance what are you talking about why wouldnt she freeman gave him a knowing look maybe because under that innocent and pretty face shes not wearing anything hardy had long since given up being surprised at freemans perspicacity but even so how in the world completely obvious to any serious connoisseur of naked women one of whom i pride myself on being freeman pointed taste the wine tell me what you think hardy did as commanded its pretty good and i think you may actually be mythically ugly and ive only got about five minutes if youre really here on business and the wine is a ploy over at the couch freeman lowered himself into a sit the wine is genuine largess on my part but as a matter of fact i did hear from dick kroll on the panos thing im starting to love the panos thing im still a little more in the infatuation stage myself especially with your recent input that wasnt through much effort on my part david hardy said that was abe and john holiday freeman made a face okay you dont like him but youve got to admit hes doing us some good this was and both men knew it quite an understatement holiday had come to believe that some of the wgp guards had played undercover roles in his own sting and arrest and he was out for vengeance in the past four months or so hed brought in no less than seven disgruntled wgp clients andor victims to freemans offices out of which four were on board with causes of action ranging from fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress to assault and battery named defendants in the lawsuit included wade on all the causes of action of course but also his brother roy his nephew nick sephia and nine other wgp current and past employees by the same token common scuttlebutt at the hall had made glitsky realize back when he was still in homicide that panos was a bad egg his organization fairly corrupt his rate increase of the year before had been nothing more than a thinly disguised protection racket glitsky knew that several businesses had at first elected to drop out of thirtytwo only to sign back up after windows had been broken or goods stolen two men had been mugged one storefront cat killed all of them had filed complaints with the pd only to drop them glitsky up in payroll found it entertaining to chase these paper trails and identify potential plaintiffs for his friend diz was he doing anything else worthwhile eventually he had turned all of these names over to hardy and most had joined the other plaintiffs in the lawsuit hardy thought it was starting to look pretty solid for the good guys so what did mr kroll want he asked he wants to talk some more before the next round of depositions hardy shrugged did you tell him that thats what depositions are all about everybody getting to talk i believe i did told him we could talk all we wanted starting tuesday but he wants to put it off maybe till early next year if i were him id want that too whatd you tell him no of course freeman cleaned out his ear for a minute his eyes somewhere in the middle distance he picked up his glass and swirled it then took a sip my gut is hes feeling us out for a separate settlement hardy was about to take a sip himself but he stopped midway to his mouth put the glass back down were asking for thirty million dollars david rodney king got six and he was one guy weve got fourteen plaintiffs two million and change each what could kroll possibly offer that would get our attention i think he was having a small problem with that question as well i got the feeling hed been chatting with his insurance company which wont pay for intentional misconduct to say nothing of punitives which well get to the tune of say six or eight mil and again theres no coverage so if we win panos is bankrupt which was the idea and still a good one did he actually mention a number not in so many words but but hes going to propose we amend the filing so panos gets named only for negligence no intentional tort this leaves his insurance company on the hook for any damages we get awarded and why do we want to do this to help them out thats what he wanted to talk about before the depositions i predict hes going to suggest that he rat out the city give us chapter and verse on the pd and their criminally negligent supervision of his people which strengthens our case and in return he gets insurance coverage on any judgment we get what a sleazeball true but not stupid freeman said if we were equally sleazy its actually a pretty good trick lets not be though sleazy what do you say im with you but still its not bad strategy and it could be even better if he thinks to suggest settling directly with us for say a quarter mil per plaintiff which puts three and a half mil in the pot a third of which comes to you and me and his insurance pays for all of it panos comes out smelling like a rose we make a bundle the citys selfinsured so theyre covered everybody wins hardy liked it but shook his head i dont think so though his insurance would have to agree and why would they maybe panos has got it himself in cash thats not coming out smelling like a rose thats down three plus mil but at least then hes still in business we settle sign a confidentiality statement he raises his rates he still wins hardy nodded grimly its so beautiful it almost makes me want to cry and all we have to do is change a word or two correct just like guilty to not guilty one word for a brief instant hardy wondered if freeman were actually considering the proposal which kroll had never actually voiced and may not even have thought of are you tempted he asked freeman sloshed his wine around put his nose in the bowl took it out and nodded sure it wouldnt be a worthwhile moral dilemma if i wasnt tempted but its half your case and im duty bound to admit that i believe its a solid pragmatic strategy and not overtly illegal if we dont do it itll be way harder to win hardy took the cue from freeman and swirled his own glass for a minute so its my decision too got to be freeman admitted give me a minute hardy said how much do i clear well kroll never gave me a specific number but if im even close to what hes thinking at three and half million say and i bet i am you personally bring in close to a half million before taxes silence gathered in the room couple of years work hardy said at least hardys mouth twitched he blew out heavily for the record im officially tempted he put his glass down walked to the window pulled the blinds apart and stared a minute outside at the street when he turned again his face was set okay he said now that thats out of the way fuck these guys for a wealthy man wade panos kept a relatively low profile he didnt need flashy clothes since he wore a patrol special uniform every day at work the toyota runner got him wherever he needed to go the threebedroom house on rivera that he shared with claire blended with the others in the lower richmond district he mowed his own lawn every saturday took out the garbage talked over the fence with his neighbors to all outward appearances wade was a regular guy hed started working as an assistant patrol special in thirtytwo when he was just out of high school it was his fathers beat george ran a tight ship in those days providing basic security for his two hundred clients patrolling the beat on foot it didnt take wade long to realize that his father was missing a substantial opportunitybig money could be made in this field people wanted protection especially once they came to understand that without it bad things could happen more importantly wade was adept at identifying enterprisesprostitution the drug trade gambling densthat operated outside the protection of the law these businesses couldnt survive in his beats without his protection and rather than roust them out or turn them over to the regular police he found most of them willing to enter into partnership with him by the time wade was twentyfive hed made enough on his own to buy his first beat from the city ten years later when he inherited thirtytwo after his fathers death he had six of them and a payroll of nearly ninety assistants he was fortunate that his timing was so good about five years ago the city had limited the number of beats to three for any one individual but his holdings were grandfathered and allowed to stand his books showed that he was pulling down close to a million dollars a year until relatively recently the actual figure was about twice that and in the last three years the profits had become nearly obscene not that he was complaining since so much of his income was in cash wade had had to become skilled at laundering it and to this end he formed a holding company that owned four bars in various parts of the city each of which pulled down a tidy legitimate profit and substantially more in dirty money being a good businessman wade always kept his eyes open for rundown watering holes that he could scoop up at bargain prices then renovate to a veneer of respectability hed also found that once a property appealed to him his connections associates and business practices could often help a struggling bar along on its journey to bankruptcy hed wanted the ark now for a couple of years and since hed learned of john holidays interference with his business in the past four months he was more motivated than ever to take control of the place put the son of a bitch back on the street where he belonged because of its central downtown location with any kind of attractive atmosphere it would draw heavily from the police legal and financial communities so it was a natural fit for his operation but this lawsuit didnt look like it was going away anytime soondick kroll wasnt having any luck with freeman and hardyand anything wade could do to cut into their enthusiasm was to the good not incidentally if he could get his hands on the ark it might also finally provide a safe and comfortable living for the son of his little sister rosie nick sephia had become a trial for all of them hed proven his loyalty to wade on several occasions true but his judgment often got him into trouble as it had with the labonte girl wade was hoping that with seasoning age and experience nick could become an asset as a bar manager instead of a liability as muscle he didnt have the selfdiscipline that muscle called for also truth be told wade felt guilty about nick whod grown up without a father because of him twentysomeodd years ago when wade had realized that sol was hitting rosie he had beaten his brotherinlaw to within an inch of his life then given him the option of leaving town or dying nicks father had made the smart choice now near eight oclock on this friday night wade was in a tuxedo waiting for claire to finish dressing and come downstairs he sat in a folding chair hunched over a large jigsaw puzzle that he was working on at a card table in the enclosed porch at the back of his house a light rain still fell just outside the windows he usually worked on his puzzles for the half hour before dinner after he got home it took about two weeks to finish one of these big ones after which claire would transfer the completed puzzle to a plywood backing and glue it down she told him she donated the things to shelters or schools or something but wade couldnt really imagine anyone really wanting one of them he thought it possible that claire simply threw most of them away and told him the story about giving them to charity to spare his feelings wade didnt really care the joy was in the doing of them and this one was particularly challenging twelve hundred pieces the picture on the front showed nothing but the water in a swimming poolblues and shadows he had most of the border now and was about a third done suddenly a fivepiece segment fell into place and he sat back pleased claire two minutes she chimed from upstairs he frowned two meant ten standing up he pulled at his bow tie and walked back to the kitchen where on one of the stools by the counter the paper lay open to the metro section and as so much didexcept for his jigsaw puzzlesthe story brought him back to business and again to nick the article was about the new russian kamov ka helicopter that one of wades relatively recently acquired clients georgia aaa diamond had purchased as a gift for the san francisco police department the deal was that in return the jewelers could use the chopper to transport their gem imports with police guard directly to and from the corporate jet at the airport in south san francisco to the city here was a nice picture of dmitri solon the companys thirtyfouryearold ceo he was posing by the helicopter with mayor washington police chief dan rigby some city supervisors and members of the california legislature it was amazing wade thought with some pride that he and solon had been able to create such a substantial krysha russian for roofas protection for georgia aaa in such a short time wade knew solon well by now he was a smooth operator who spoke nearly perfect english the protege of severain grotny head of the ministry of precious metals and gems in russia solon had ostensibly come to san francisco with a twofold missionto open a stateoftheart diamond cutting and distribution center and not incidentally to make inroads into the international monopoly of the de beers diamond cartel wade couldnt help smiling as he scanned the platitudes in the article for he knew the truth about georgia aaa and this was that solon and grotny were using the business as a front to systematically loot nothing less than the national treasury of russia he knew this because about eighteen months ago before solon had even opened his doors wade had signed him up as a client in another of his beats it hadnt taken him three months to become suspicious of some of the activity he witnessed some of the questionable personnel on the periphery of things so he set up special surveillance teams and about two months later he and his nephew nick found a pretext to stop one of solons imported russian employees as he left the building one evening he was carrying a bag of uncut diamonds worth wade later discovered approximately fourteen million dollars rather than report the incident to san francisco police wade brought him first back to solon the ensuing discussion was more than enlightening it was breathtaking once it became clear that wades agenda was cooperation rather than interference solon seemed almost relieved to be able to explain the financing for georgia aaa about million had come directly from the russian treasury in the form of diamonds jewelry and silver but mostly from gold five tons of goldand most of that investment grade commemorative coins from the olympics this had all come under diplomatic pouch grotnys pouch on lufthansa airlines after it had arrived in this country solon arranged for its delivery to premier metals the top gold distributor on the west coast premier then melted down the coins and established the georgia aaa account based on ounces of gold on deposit with them with his million line of credit solon had gone a little wild although it was on the market for a mere five million dollars he paid eleven million for the fourstory building that would house his new diamond center at about the same time he spent three million dollars for his rambling mansion in the hills of kensington for two cigarette boats more than a million for a rollsroyce and two aston martins and around eighteen million for a gulfstream twinengine corporate jet there were other acquisitions as wellcondos at lake tahoe a small napa winery a chain of bay area gas stations all were intended to bolster the image solon wanted to conveyhe had unlimited money and extraordinary connections wade looked down at the newspaper photograph again the young russian entrepreneur had certainly done himself proud but he couldnt have done it without wade panos whod helped him build his krysha extended solons connections through wades own to the political elite of the city and even the state and it had all begun the night that he and nick had busted the messenger with the bag of diamonds wade had asked solon this simple question if georgia aaa was in the business of cutting and selling diamonds why was he sending fourteen million dollars worth of them away the answer was that only a fraction of the diamonds imported from russia ever made it to the floor of georgia aaas hightech cutting room showcase most were sent to a sister georgia aaa office in antwerp where disguised with false invoices from angola and zaire they were then ironically sold to de beers for cash which was then wired either back to san francisco or to grotny in moscow essentially it was a moneylaundering scheme through which diamonds from the russian national treasury could be dumped into the world market and converted to cash the san francisco georgia aaa diamond center for all of its grandeur and visibility was in fact merely a front to legitimize an immense traffic in unregulated diamonds and established in the center of one of his beats it had fallen into the lap of wade panos his commission during the past yearessentially to have nick instead of one of solons people carry the diamonds and guard them to and from the airport to the diamond center plus a little muscle and political favorwas a little more than six million dollars most of which solon wired directly from the antwerp office to wades account in the caymans the rest came back to san francisco where wade used it to keep his own krysha in good repair he loved the termthe roof that protected you the people you paid off but nick even with his new job nick remained a problem because he was young headstrong and prone to violence he hadnt worked out at all as an assistant patrol special wade had thought the simple job at georgia aaa would serve two purposes first it would keep his nephew out of trouble and second wade would have his own man and a relative at that on the inside to protect his position with solon but after a little more than a full year at it neither part was working out too well nick had too much free time no real job to do and too much money he was upping his profile all over towngetting into fights gambling throwing his weight aroundand this was not good when it was time for his deliveries he would show up around the georgia offices selfimportant welldressed and surly and alienate everyone from the cutters to solon himself even more disturbingly he had somehow ended up with julio rez as his partner on these trips wade didnt know rez well but thought him capable of shooting nick and stealing the diamonds they were transporting he needed to get nick out of there get him a real grownup job maybe at the ark then put his brother ray in with solon to protect the relationship ray was good with people but suddenly he straightened up tugging hard now at his collar getting it loosened up he looked at himself in the mirror on the kitchen wallhis skin color was awful a flushed ochre that made him look both pale and flushed he thought he could feel his blood pressure pushing on his eardrums he brought a hand up to his nostrils checked it for blood look at him what the hell was he doing here he was wade panos nobodys idea of a lightweight brooding over individual strategic moves again and again and againwhen the real issue the big issue was that these two goddamned lawyers looked like they were going to try to shut him down they were threatening the entire foundation of his lifes work okay he understood they saw their chance to clear a nice chunk of change here he assumed that they were just businessmen like he was looking out for opportunities he didnt blame them for that and maybe it was true that wade had been pushing his luck the last couple of years throwing his weight around too much in the beats giving them the opening so okay the lawsuit was a wakeup call maybe hed rein things in a little with his troops in the future his dealings with solon were bringing in the bulk of his income now anyway but without the beats and wades presence in the field as his legitimate power base even that relationship could erode and that would be disaster so freeman and hardy had delivered the message that they were on to him so hed tone things down and theyd make a decent pile for their efforts what more did the greedy bastards want hed floated the idea that he was ready to make an offer settle this thing hed even provide evidence to help them fleece the city a bit fuckers whats the matter claire stood in the door to the kitchen he hadnt heard her come downstairs youre frowning she said you look sick do you feel all right fine he shook his head its nothing just business i thought business was good business is all right and yet youre frowning he shrugged debating with himself whether he should burden her with his own worries about the lawsuit but no the solution came to him fullblown all at once he didnt have to do this krolls way according to hoyle he wouldnt even tell kroll he could end his troubles with the lawsuit or at least slow things way down anytime he wanted he was being reasonable and if freeman and hardy and their spies and stooges didnt choose to be then what happened after that wouldnt be wades fault they would have asked for it all of them you know wade he came back to his wife im afraid im going to have to move nicky again thats all it was her turn to frown maybe you want to move him all the way out i cant he said rosie she held up a hand stopping him your poor sister rosie shes had it rough claire who hasnt and nickys nothing but trouble hes already cost us and its going to get worse you watch hes growing up hes going to be okay she shook her head when you were his age you had three beats already your own business trying to help him is just throwing good money after bad anyway where are you going to move him to i was thinking the ark which we dont own last time i checked not yet the seed of an idea had sprung but it turns out the owner of the place was with the guys that shot sam silverman after they bring him in hes going to need all the cash he can get his hands on ill pick the place up for a song and then give it to nicky theres better people you know wade even if hes family she was a short buxom woman and stared up at him defiantly her arms crossed over her chest after a minute he leaned down and kissed her conciliatory on the cheek nothings written in stone claire he smiled took her arm started to steer her toward the front door now who are we giving our money to tonight hardys daughter rebecca had at last reached sweet sixteen years old and tonight she was going on her first solo date shed been out to the movies and the malls with mixedgender groups of friends many times before of course but this was the homecoming dance and this boy young man whatever he wasa seventeenyearold senior named darren scotthad asked her frannie had done herself up somewhat too for the occasion she wasnt exactly mrs cleaver but she wore a skirt and a light salmoncolored sweater shed pulled her red hair back into a tight bun applied some makeupmascara and lipstick vincent their fourteenyearold son had gone to a football game with some of his friends now hardy was standing in the kitchen alone with frannie while they awaited the becks grand entrance from her bedroom into which shed vanished after her shower about a half hour before he was talking in that halfwhisper parents sometimes adopt when their children might be within earshot its just that im not exactly thrilled that the sum total of what i know about this guy whos taking out my daughter is his name darren scott if thats really his name frannie threw a glance back over her shoulder dismas of course its his name its all ive been hearing for weeks darren darren darren hardy was undeterred doesnt mean he didnt make it up maybe he and the beck are in on it together and are planning to run away if i was making up a name it would be darren scott i mean it if he honks from out on the street shes not going ill let you tell her that i will too dont think i wont what rebecca looked unimaginably grownup in basic black spaghetti shoulder straps hemline three inches above the knee heels and hose sometime in the past year or so shed pierced her ears and now gold teardrop earrings hung from them matched by a thin gold necklace hardy had bought her her red hair like her mothers was up off her neck and some kind of glitter graced her cheeks and the bare skin beneath the necklace what she asked again worry flitting over her brow nothing frannie said moving toward her just your father being silly you look beautiful she spun in a pirouette beaming now with her mothers approval what do you think daddy he found that he couldnt reply for a second then cleared his throat i think this darren scott is one lucky guy i hope were going to get to meet him mother and daughter shared an amused look and then rebecca skipped across and put her arms around her father of course you will id never go out with anybody my favorite daddy didnt know he should be here any minute and as though on cue the doorbell rang thats him the beck turned back to her mother i look all right its not your looks frannie began i know mom its who i am inside but do i look okay really frannie gave up on the mother lecture and hugged her you look perfect meanwhile hardy walked down the hallway geared up to be polite and yet somehow firm and even aweinspiring he swiped at his eyes opened the door and it was abe glitsky not with my daughter you dont his voice was harsh darren and he slammed the door in his friends face a couple of seconds later he opened it again grinning at his cleverness he noticed that a lanky young man in a suit was standing behind glitsky on the stoop looking tentatively over glitskys shoulder excuse me he began he appeared to be sufficiently terrorized to last through the evening is this where rebecca hardy lives he seemed like a nice kid glitsky said i doubt if hes even got a sheet theres a consoling thought if ive ever heard one my daughters dating a guy whos never even been arrested they were at the dining room table abe with his tea and hardy and frannie finishing their wine dismas has been preparing himself for this so he wouldnt be too harsh frannie said imagine if it had just been sprung on him i thought i was downright civil hardy said considering that thing with abe at the door was meant to be a joke i had no idea darrel was there darren frannie corrected him didnt i say that that was just bad timing abe put in deadpan couldve happened to anyone anyway itll give him something to think about later hardy said when hes wondering whether he should keep the beck out past eleventhirty or not i dont think thatll be much of a question frannie said in fact i dont think it will even cross his mind especially not after the six reminders not six hardy said not more than two abe was here he heard no way was it six was it abe glitsky sipped at his tea looked up in all innocence im sorry he said i wasnt paying close attention glitsky and hardy had a chessboard set up between them on the dining room table it wasnt much of a contest although glitsky had won the vast majority of the many games theyd played over the years they both pretended that they were fairly evenly matched hardy explained his poor record by the fact that since he was more excitable than his friend he tended to see a move and act precipitously and it was true that glitsky was more patient even methodical in his play it was also true that glitsky never drank alcohol and hardy would have a beer or two and sometimes as tonight an afterdinner cognac or two after hed already had his wine for dinner hardy felt that the mere suggestion that this had any effect on his strategy or play was of course ridiculous but glitsky was happy to take advantage of whatever mistakes hardy made and hed already made one that would be conclusive so glitsky made his next move then sat back and relaxed a degree or two he was already tired as hed done the wakeup call for their baby rachel before dawn she had a low fever and maybe a tooth was coming in as well and treya had basically done him the kindness of kicking him out for the night freeing him to go talk about his fathers demands and his job frustrations with his friend dismas it was her turn for baby duty no need for both of them to suffer hardy studied the board raised his eyes you dont look good neither do you so what glitsky let out some air but i admit i am a little tired ha the excuses begin for what for when i beat you here glitsky kept all expression out of his face he picked up his mug of tea well see i believe its your move see he worries hardy lifted his snifter and studied the board he understood that glitsky thought he had an advantage but danged if he could see what it was after a minute he looked up id take a teething daughter over a dating one anytime you want glitsky said ill bring rachel over we can trade no thanks frannie from the front room where she was reading okay well leave daughters hardy said so moving in the other direction whats the problem with your father is he all right glitsky pushed his chair back far enough from the table so that he could cross a leg he let out a long breath you hear about sam silverman hardy shook his head dont know him what about him he was nats best friend he ran a pawnshop by union square and somebody shot him last night in his store its still your move by the way if you dont want to concede which you should anyway nat doesnt seem to get it that im not in homicide anymore he asked me if id look in on the investigation and make sure theyre on track like that so much against my better judgment i went downstairs and talked to gerson today in homicide howd that go over about like youd expect after the parade the welcome kind of wore off pretty quick gerson even found a way to mention it to batiste evidently in one of those strange coincidences you read so much about the topic just happened to come up while they were having lunch imagine that hardy said right but in any event frank called me off period not that i was on are you going to move someday im savoring the anticipation hardy said so what about nat nothing really but ive got to tell him and hes not going to like it he might even decide hes got to go talk to somebody himself whichno matter whatwould be a disaster in the kitchen the telephone rang and frannie although she was farther away in the living room jumped up to answer it it might be one of the kids she said by way of explanation as she passed by them she got to it and after a short amiablesounding talk she was back in the doorway its john holiday he says its important i bet hardy pushed his chair back two minutes he said to glitsky you want to move first he paused and pushed a pawn up one square youre dead very soon then turned toward the kitchen ten minutes later hardy came back into the dining room where frannie and abe were sitting side by side at the table as hed talked to holiday hed heard the two of them erupt in laughter several times this especially from glitsky was a rare enough event in itself to warrant comment but then as soon as hardy looked he saw the cause of it and didnt have to ask they were going through a stack of birthday cards that holiday had been randomly sending hardy now for over a year whenever he ran across one that was particularly funny or insulting or both the latest was a lovely romantically outoffocus picture of a forest of redwood trees with streams of sunlight shining through them and a gorpy poem extolling their majesty and incredible longevity adding to the magnificent beauty of the earth for thousands and thousands of years when you opened the card it read thanks for planting them these are pretty good abe admitted hardy nodded i laughed at the first seventeen of them myself i wish id thought of this hey he snapped his fingers maybe its not too late its way too late hardy said was it important frannie asked another shrug everythings relative he moved back up to his chair and hovered a moment over the chessboard raised his eyes quickly to glitsky you moved something just one little knight it was my turn thats all you moved he stared back down saw it swore under his breath tuttut the lieutenant wagged a ringer then checked his watch and stood up but enough of this wild partying i think id better go spell treya so what did you decide about nat hardy asked somewhat unexpectedly out of context the question stopped glitsky and he considered for a minute hell get used to it i suppose i just hate to disappoint him theyd gotten to the door frannie had opened it and abe was putting on his jacket you want hardy said you and i could do a field trip to the crime scene tomorrow maybe get a tidbit for your dad make him feel better like youre working on it maybe we even do some early christmas shopping ill check my social schedule glitsky said but sounds like a good idea youd really do that sure what are friends for say ten eleven ill let you know when he was gone frannie closed the door and turned to him maybe do some early christmas shopping since when it could happen hardy said okay but what else but that call from john it turns out it was pretty important the police want to talk to him about this guy silvermans death abes fathers friend what about him whether he was involved somehow involved how could john be involved in what way in the way of whether he had something to do with killing him the sun broke through while hardy read the morning paper at his kitchen table waiting for glitskys call which never came he finally called abes and left a message at around eleven next he tried holiday at homeuselessthen at the ark nothing his own house had been empty now for an hour and a half though for years hed fantasized about the magic day when he and frannies lives werent ruled by the schedules of his childrenthe lessons and ballgames the colds and homework and simple stuff that had cluttered his every waking moment for the past sixteen yearsnow that the time was upon him he wasnt sure how much he liked it frannie was dropping the kids off somewhere and in an ironic turnabout he wasnt sure he fully appreciated she was seeing one of her clients on a weekend morning technically still a student frannie had gotten hooked up with a psychologist friend of hers jillian neumann and was working about twenty accredited apprentice hours a week in family counseling so with the day looming empty as his house before him hardy went into the kitchen and took his black castiron pan down from where it hung off a marlin hook behind the stove he ran his knuckles across its surfacesilk automatically he threw in a big pinch of saltfrannie had switched to kosher salt and kept a bowl of it open next to the burnersand turned on the gas he went to check the refrigerator grabbed a sierra nevada pale ale from the top shelf opened it and drank in two minutes hed cut up garlic and scallions poured in some olive oil added leftover rice a can of sardines a good shake of red pepper flakes it occurred to him that he was eating too often at lou the greeks if he found himself hankering for this kind of treat but the smell pushed him onward soy sauce some plain yogurt and then finally an egg to bind it all when it was done it looked awful but he almost couldnt wait to get back to the table to dig in he thought it was even possible that hed stumbled upon one of lous wife chuis secret recipes such as athenian special rice or even wonder of wonders yeanling clay bowl first though before he sat down to eat he kept the heat up and threw in more salt swiping at the bottom of the pan two or three times with a dish towel he then dumped the contents into the garbage can the magic pan was as it had been before he beganblack gleaming oiled as he ate his masterpiece his thoughts returnedif in fact theyd ever leftto holiday to most outside observers the failed pharmacist was not typical of hardys friends the serious overdrinking the gambling the women certainly bartending and trying to keep the bar hed inherited afloat he wasnt working on any kind of career that alone set him apart beyond that holiday had ignored his earlier friends until he lost them hed burned out his parents and the rest of his solidly suburban family rejected their values and hopes for him this was because john holiday had no real hopes anymore himself theyd been dashed six years ago when his wife and eightmonthold baby daughteremma and joliehad been killed by a hitandrun driver whod run the red and never even slowed down hardy too had lost a child in another lifetime hed had a son michael whod lived seven months a couple of years into his first marriage to jane fowler the child had somehow pulled himself up over the bars of his crib one day fallen to the hardwood floor for about ten years after that his own marriage and fledgling legal career having collapsed under the weight of the grief hardy drank guiness stout bartended at the little shamrock like holiday he was glib all the time so hardy knew what made holiday the way he was he didnt blame him wouldnt judge him didnt expect anybody else to understand the connection it was what it was he was no longer eating he was considering his friends life and wondering if it could now have led him to a murder holiday grew up in a middleclass home in san mateo his father joseph ran three independent and successful sporting goods stores until they were bought out by a nationwide chain in the eighties his mother diane stayed at home with the kidsjohn his younger brother jimmy and their two sisters margie and maryuntil mary was in kindergarten then she went back to teaching he went to an allboys catholic high school lettered in baseball and track became the schools blanket player the best allaround athlete whose name went on the blanket that hung in the schools gymnasium for a time he held the wcal record in the half mile popular with students and faculty alike he was secretary of the student body his senior year academically he was sixth in his class with a gpa a national merit and california state scholarship finalist and a lifetime member of the california scholarship federation these accomplishments were impressive but said little about holidays essence evidently between the ages of fifteen when he lost his virginity and thirtyone when he got married his chief persona was sexual predator the first time was with anne lerner a neighbor and friend of his mother who it was a warm windy saturday afternoon in late spring and he was with his three best buds from school buying sodas at the safeway where theyd been let off by one of the moms after the ballgame in the checkout line anne lernerthe youngest and always the foxiest of moms married friends with a really cute bobbednose face and a great smilewas her usual friendly self to all of them every one of johns pals admitted having the private hots for her mrs lerner was the only adult who got mentioned when the guys were making one of their frequent lists of the cutest girls the best breasts and so on today she looked almost like a teenager herself with her long tan legs the short white tennis shorts the ashblond hair hanging around her shoulders she had a cart full of grocery bags and all four of the guys were happy to help her load them into the back of her wagon since none of them drove yet and all lived up the hill on her way home she asked if they wanted a ride and all of them piled in john in the front where when she leaned forward to put in the key he couldnt help but see that the top button on her blouse had come undone she glanced and caught him looking gave him a playful open smile then buttoned up when the last of them but john got out mrs lerner asked him if hed mind stopping by her place firstjust a few blocks farther up the streetand helping her unload the groceries her daughters were both gone on a weekend camping trip with the girl scouts and her husband was traveling again and wouldnt be back until midweek so she was all alone he carried the bags inside it took him four or five trips and the button came undone again and then the one under it finally by the time he put the last bag on the counter and turned to face her only one button remained thanks john can i offer you something a glass of water he was mesmerized by the fall of her blouse but stammered out a no he had to be getting home she took a step toward him are you sure you can stay a few minutes anything he swallowedhis mouth had gone drythen he looked at her face which wore a mysterious smile now an expression unlike any hed seen before she closed the gap between them even more they were so close he smelled the wonderful scent of heralmonds and and something else she cocked her head up at him what she asked playfully tell me following his gaze she looked down oh these darn buttons but slowly slowly her eyes never leaving his her hand went not to any of the open buttons but to the closed one under them all which was suddenly open too oops she said laughter in her throat she took his hands and brought them up to the little snap in the front of her bra which she helped him open with a practiced ease what a charming story of young love hardy said she was how old thirtyfive forty somewhere in there so if you were fifteen she raped you diz please rape has such ugly connotations i infinitely prefer the word seduced and i promise it did not scar me for life in facta slow grin lifted holidays cornsilk mustacheive been known to drop by in the recent past from time to time and you know what she is still hot im happy for you both maybe not so much for the husband long gone im afraid i believe his prostate gave out holiday kept his grin on knowing he was pushing hardys buttons they were both sitting on folding chairs in sunshine just outside the proppedopen front door of the ark holiday was drinking a bud lite from the bottle and had his brown denim workshirt unbuttoned halfway he was supposed to be bartending but he owned the place and there werent any customers well fascinated though i am with all this history its not why i came down you talk to any cops yet i havent had that pleasure they didnt come by your house they might have holiday tipped up some beer the sloegin eyes twinkling i dont believe i slept there last night so i cant be sure but i did stop by here and clint told me what was up which was when i called you and im so happy you did hardy squinted up at the bright sky he moved his chair back into the shade of the doorway so what do you think i think i didnt shoot sam silverman or anybody else you pretty sure a nod reasonably its the kind of thing id remember you got an alibi for when it happened suddenly all trace of the grin was gone this is starting to remind me of when you were my lawyer last time that didnt turn out so bad look at you now they dont let you drink in prison bud lite or anything else you chumming for business hey you called me the last thing i want in the world is a murder case and heres a hintyou dont want one either if frannie wasnt working id be having lunch with her right now instead of checking up on your sorry ass but as you appeared to be seeking advice and counsello i appear all right holiday leaned forward in the folding chair his elbows on his knees he had his index ringer in the neck of his beer bottle and spun it in little circles near his feet so where were we on your alibi holiday gave an impression of thought what night again hardy came forward and spoke with some sharpness dont give me that john it was the night after your poker game which makes it thursday this is saturday im thinking even you two days and who knows how many drinks ago you might remember okay between you and me i had a date holiday said dinner and a movie hardy sat back spread his hands in victory there you go was that so hard but holidays expression was far from relaxed what hardy asked well couple of things hardy waited a minute finally spoke do i guess or are you going to tell me no im going to tell you he pulled the bottle off his finger and took another pull at it first the lady in question is married so shes not going to want to be involved why am i not surprised maybe shes not going to have a choice so who is she i cant say not even to you her husband would he let it drop well theres a ray of good news her husband then is still alive i take it oh yeah youd know him id know him hows that i mean hes well known a public figure she cant come out great swell youre seeing the wife of a famous guy do i dare ask if this is a longterm relationship between you and her i mean not her and her husband we went out a couple of months but it looks like its over now anyway holiday shrugged it ended thursday in fact before the movie before dinner if you want to get technical technicals good lets go that way hardy barked half a laugh so you didnt go out with this unnamed married woman for dinner and a movie after all and hence you dont have an alibi for the time of the murder is that what youre saying and might i add parenthetically do you have any idea how much fun id be having with you already if you were on the stand in court but i was with her till at least sixthirty is what im telling you diz by which time silverman was dead hardy was shaking his head not sure if he was near despair or enjoying himself there was no question but that he believed holidaywho else would go to these lengths to make up something so byzantine and absurdbut his predicament visavis the authorities might become very real if these vital facts couldnt be managed i think i could use something to drink john you carry any nonalcoholic mixers club soda cranberry juice while holiday went searching behind the bar hardy brought in the folding chairs then sat at one of the bolteddown stools just out of curiosity where do you take the wife of a wellknown public person out to dinner for a couple of months and never get recognized holiday shot club soda from the gun over some ice squeezed in a lime wedge chinatown he said we all look the same to them hey its true its the next best thing to invisible he handed the drink across anyway the point is silverman was dead by the time we got to dinner am i right i dont know i havent got the timetable on it i gathered from glitsky it was the end of the day but fivethirty sixthirty i dont know you want to just tell me privately who the woman was i could tell you but so what shed just deny it especially now she always had a cover story for her husband anyway where she was look maybe we wont even need it okay werent there three guys again hardy had no previous connection to the case and he didnt know well holiday said im telling you there were clint my night guy said the cops were trying to scare him putting the three of us togetherme clint and clints boyfriend randy clints gay i guessed hardy said and theyve got alibis clint and randy they were here together the whole time from six clint was behind the bar and customers saw them and would swear to it holiday shrugged somebody must have very strong john very strong does clint remember any of them these customers im sure he could come up with somebody this answer didnt warm hardys heart he sipped at his club soda wiped his ringer along the overlacquered bar john remember our first few interviews when they busted you for the bad scrip when you just couldnt believe anybody really cared about prescription drugs enough to hassle anybody about them i still cant believe it adults ought to be able to get anything they want if they kill themselves with whatever it is hey theyre adults its really special you believe that and we can have a debate about it later but maybe right now we can agree that murder is more serious holiday on the other side of the bar was filling the garnish trays he stopped cutting lemon peel and looked up i really didnt kill sam diz the other thing was different since i actually did it then whyd you call me last night about this he went back to cutting clint was freaked out about the cops coming by it got a little contagious but youre over that now a shrug i really didnt do it clint and randy certainly didnt do it theyre not going to nail three of us when none of us were there hardy sipped his club soda said nothing holiday stopped again what whats that look no look hardy said i guess i forgot for a minute that nobodys ever been arrested for a crime they didnt commit theyre not going to arrest me they didnt arrest clint last night and they were right here with him okay im convinced youre in no danger but do me a favor the cops come by to talk to you call me first dont say one word holiday made a face surely i should say hello if i dont return their greeting they become surly ive done experiments sure say hello bake em a cake if you want hardy drained his glass stood up and walked out the open door without another word after he calmed down a little he called his home from the cell phone in his car but nobody answered at glitskys too he got the answering machine again this was turning into a rare day with no work and no family he considered going home and doing something physicalthey had half a cord of wood that needed to be stacked or he could take a runbut then he decided screw it hed go to his own wellrun and pleasant bar and talk to someone with a functioning brain the guys an idiot he told mcguire whod once when he cared about different things earned a ph d in philosophy from cal berkeley they were both waiting for the churning foam in hardys guinness to fall out i dont know why i waste my time you like him thats all i like him too hes a firstborn male right and this means something mcguire had his standard macallan poured into a rocks glass that sat in the shamrocks gutter he took a bite of a piroshki he was eating from a place around the corner and washed it down with scotch you got any close friends that arent hardy quickly filed through the litanymcguire freeman glitsky pico morales even graham russo another exclient and now holiday thats interesting to mcguire it was an old selfevident truth and he shrugged it might be that but dont mistake it for a character reference he reminds me of everybody we knew when we went to school sex drugs rock and roll party all night you remember not as much as youd think i didnt go to berkeley you were alive in the sixties though if im not mistaken heres an ugly surprise mose i hated the sixties the only good thing in that decade was the beatles come on the turtles hermans hermits hardy had to smile my point exactly but i give sixtyeight my vote for the worst year of our lifetime so saying holiday brings back those good ol days isnt what id call high praise ill tell you something though and no reference to the sixties moses leaned over the bar his brokennosed face six inches from his brotherinlaws he spoke quietly nearly in a whisper but with some intensity possibly even rebuke hes just like you were when you worked here you werent so hot on all the rules before you got with frannie and decided it was time to grow up this brought hardy up short threw him back on himself as mcguire straightened back up and turned to check on the other five customers in the bar hardy took a slug of his daytime stout and looked at his face in the back bar mirror mcguire was right he realized crippled by grief loss and guilt over his babys death and the breakup of his marriage in the wake of that hardy had walked the boards behind this very bar for most of another decade a lawyer without a practice a thinker without a thought he hadnt been able to commit to much more than waking up every day and sometimes that was too much now with a good marriage a thriving practice and teenaged children hardy had a life filledsometimes overfilledwith meaning import details routine relationships and responsibility holidays life his situation couldnt be more different and more importantly it hadnt been of his choosing hardy of all people should remember that holiday was living daytoday waiting for that first flicker of meaning or hope to assert itself until then hed take his solace from whatever source a woman or a bottle or easy money at the poker table mcguire was back in front of him he poured another half inch of scotch dropped in one ice cube and stirred with his finger so where were we at the part where i was being a judgmental old dick theres a sixties concept the famed value judgment his brotherinlaw reached over and goodnaturedly patted his arm but you cant qualify for true old dickdom for at least a couple of years the sad thing is though mose i kind of believe in value judgments nowadays mcguire clucked yeah well as you say most of those sixties ideasvalue judgments are bad dope wont hurt you fidelitys not importantthey havent exactly stood the test of time but theres still that old nagging tolerance for different lifestyles and the beatles hardy said dont forget the beatles only two of em left though you notice moses said hardy didnt talk to glitsky again until he showed up unannounced late monday afternoon at his office his babys fever hadnt been from teething and by early saturday morning it had gotten to degrees and he and treya were with her at the emergency room roseola you should have called me hardy said the beck had it too i could have diagnosed it over the phone next time she wakes us up screaming at three am ill call you first ill look forward to it for the past couple of hours hardy had been reviewing the technical specifications of a supposedly fully automated truckwashing unit one of his clients had bought it for a million and a half dollars it hadnt worked even within the ballpark of the manner promised by the companys brochure from day one the gap between the gallons of recycled clean water the system could actually process and the gallons guaranteed by the brochure was big enough hardy thought to drive an eighteenwheeler through hed studied the numbers enough to master that fact he was taking the case to trial in a little over a month he could spare his friend some time so whats up did you take today off glitsky sometimes wasnt much of a sitter first hed crossed over to one of the windows and peered out now was pulling darts from hardys board amazingly enough i finished all my critical work by he looked at his watch about six hours ago you must be underutilized i hope at least you looked busy glitsky threw a dart i sat behind my door and gnashed my teeth for six hours that must be hell on your molars i dont care about my molars you would if you cracked one with all that gnashing but then youre the guy who chews ice all the time i bet you grind your teeth at night too glitsky turned to face him howd you like a dart in the eyeball youd probably miss he stood and came around his desk strode over to the dartboard and waited for glitsky to throw the third dart so did you ever get to find out anything else about silverman else implies i found out anything at all he threw and yet just today you whiled away six perfectly good hours when you could have been detecting except im not a detective anymore nor much of a dart player hardy pulled the darts walked back to the tape line on the floor he whirled paused for an instant setting up and threw a triple twentyone of the very difficult shots right now youre probably asking yourself how i can be so good the question fills my every waking moment nat tried to find out something though about silverman without you howd he do that glitsky appeared to be gnashing his teeth again when i got busy with rachel he told sadiesilvermans wife she might as well go through the normal channels so she called homicide and hardys focus was suddenly lost and his next two darts didnt score at all glitsky pulled the darts for his round and nobody called her back all day yesterday or today nobody they were probably busy right so finally maybe an hour ago nat called me again with would i check so i called lanier and a fine inspector he is are you going to throw or not are we playing a game im shooting bullseyes thats all not too many glitsky pegged a dart missed his target by three inches threw missed again threw the last dart missed good round hardy said so what did lanier say he hasnt seen gerson all day all right progress glitsky ignored him stepped to the side as he came to the line butand youll love thisthe guys working the case russell and cuneo do i know them id be surprised anyway lanier checked the signin and they hadnt been in over the weekend or today hardy threw a bullseye theyre not out in the field lanier didnt think so they would have checked in were big on paperwork nowadays they dont sign in they get a nasty letter from payroll ask me how i know hardy threw the last two darts in quick succession leaving all three clustered in the middle of the board he eased himself back up onto his desk theyll probably get to it someday he paused i probably shouldnt tell you this at the dartboard pulling the darts again glitsky turned around a question theyre snooping around one of my exclients who i need hardly add had nothing to do with it you remember john holiday it didnt take glitsky two seconds the drug guy right and two of his friends all of whom have alibis the tumblers fell into place the call you got friday night hardy nodded it pains me to admit it but that was why i was willing to go and peruse the crime scene with you on saturday and would do the same today if you were so inclined for a long moment glitsky considered it then shook his head thats what i came by here thinking we might do to tell you the truth but what are we going to do there except get me in trouble how do we even get in youre probably right hardy said ill let gerson call sadie first find out for sure what theyve got if anything at least get some questions of my own i might want to ask why do they like your guy he doesnt know and in any case hes not worried about it except that he called you hardy shrugged it was early in the process hes over it but his bartenders got a sheet and maybe a squishy alibi john thinks they were just shaking his tree see if he knew anything at all and did he he was bartending a couple of blocks away glitsky frowned whats squishy about that it was evidently a slow night few if any customers he and his partnerthe other alleged suspectthey alibi each other but thats about it and what about your guy holiday he was having dinner with a girlfriend chinatown he added so hes out of it a tight smile yep well glitsky pursed his lips thinking if theyre even shaking this guys tree at least theyre doing something he let out a heavy breath its not my job i keep telling myself i guess im just not so good with being patient youre kidding me hardy said when did that start matt creed had been off the past two nights but now he was back in the beat walking with both hands in his pockets vapor appeared in front of him with every breath he took the night outside the glow of the streetlights was full dark as it had been about the same time that things had gotten hairy outside of silvermans last week that sequence of events had been an unending tape loop in his mind over the weekendthe first shot and simultaneous ricochet by his ear so much louder than anything hed ever heard with his earphones on at the range even now it reechoed in his memory he turned the corner up from market and on the other side of the street came abreast of the ark noticed this time that a dim light emanated from the doorway stopping he tried to force himself to picture to remember anything about the previous thursday but it was such a nondescript length of street such an anonymous location that it had no discrete existence for him at all there was the plywood in the hole for one window the tinted blank of the other the darkened mouth of the doorway the door itself stood open tonight but he couldnt for the life of him recall even glancing in the bars direction when it mattered the most here he was all dressed up like a cop and really nothing like one his apparent duty was so far from the reality that it almost made him sick to his stomach creed was twentytwo years old and taking courses in criminology at city college during the day he had taken the assistant patrol special job with wgp enterprises because it offered decent pay along with the opportunity to attend the police academy on essentially a panos scholarship creeds plan was to get his aa from city get training at the pa and experience with panos then apply for the regular pd where he thought hed have the inside track his life goal was to become a homicide inspector and hed been thinking he was well on his way until last thursday when he hadnt seen a damn thing and of what hed seen he noticed even less although he was the only real witness to any part of the crime hed been little enough help no more than coffee gofer when wade panosthe big boss himselfhad been at silvermans thursday night even worse he had a sickening feeling that hed let himself be manipulated when roy had come by with the two reallife homicide inspectors because hed so wanted to please them to be important hed picked up the thread of their suspicions and let himself more or less volunteer randy wills and clint terry as suspects creed had run into randy wills a few times in the ark but he didnt know him except to nod at terry on the other hand was a pretty good guy who back when theyd still been clients in the beat had often given creed a free coffee or a coke when hed stopped in in reality he hadnt seen enough of the two forward runners in his chase last week to say for sure whether or not they were twoheaded martians and as to the shooter sure hed seemed like a pretty goodsize guy but again running away at seventyfive feet in the dark and wearing a heavy coat against the weather he could have been anybody hell he could have been a she but now creed worried that he might have helped direct the homicide cops to some innocent people more because it had been so nonspecific he didnt know how to undo what he might have done suddenly he found himself standing inside the ark it was monday night slow as death two patrons at the bar and the huge really hulking form of clint terry stood behind it right up by him by the front door suddenly forcefully it struck him that the shooter surely couldnt have been that big creed would have retained that as a positive memory rather than a vague sense hey matt checking up on us you cold its not warm clint ive got some gocups you want one two sugars and cream right thatd be good thanks everything okay in here good a pause roy was in here the other night with a couple of inspectors from homicide yeah they told me the silverman thing huh thats what he said i was working here though just at that time you might remember i never crossed over clint never looked in sorry yeah well it probably dont matter the cops havent been back but listen from now on you want to poke your head in here when you pass the coffees on me the cup did warm him up but neither clints hospitality nor the steaming brew made him feel much better by the time he got to ellis hed pretty much decided he would have to talk to russell and cuneo back off from his earlier stance and this might be his opportunity now the lights were on at silvermans when abreast of the door creed saw an old man sitting on a chair by the counter an old woman standing in the center aisle facing the shelves writing on a clipboard for a few seconds he watched them they appeared relaxed if somewhat subdued and were having some kind of conversation between the womans notes when creed knocked on the glass it startled both of them but then they noticed the uniform and the woman came to the door and unlocked it can i help you she asked to creed she looked to be in her late sixties early seventies her face was sharpfeatured birdlike under her wispy white hair he would be surprised if she weighed more than a hundred pounds but there wasnt anything frail or timid about her her eyes no glassesnarrowed down critically at him i was going to ask you the same thing creed said how would you be able to help me youre with wgp arent you she peered closely at the name tag over his pocket well mr creed im sadie silverman sams wife were not with the beat anymore yes maam i realize that i just saw the light and he came to an end shrugged suddenly the man was up with both of them he put a hand on sadies shoulder pulled the door open and motioned creed inside im nat glitsky he said extending his hand a friend of the family we thought it would be smart to take an inventory were you here the night it happened he closed the door threw the deadbolt yes sir i was the again he stopped i discovered the body he said do you know if the police took anything no i dont think so from the shelves you mean they havent told me anything sadie snapped i cant get anybody to call me back i just came down here with nat and opened up myself nat laid a hand on the womans arm all they told sadie was that sam had been killed in a robbery attempt three men apparently did you see them creed temporized from a distance one of them shot at me twice i chased them but couldnt catch up so if youd come by just a couple of minutes earlier sadie let out a heavy breath what about these robbers these killers why did they pick here why was it sam who a small tremor began in her jaw and nat put an arm over her shoulders its all right sadie its all right he walked her back to the chair hed been sitting in by the jewelry case sat her down then turned and came halfway back down the center aisle to where creed was now standing it would be nice to know if anybodys interested in what happened here he said thats all is anybody looking for who did this theyre looking the inspectors came by and interviewed me on friday night and what did you tell them what did you know pretty much what i told you three guys at least one of them with a gun mr panos thought they probably got away with mr silvermans bank deposit this old leather pouch he was supposed to be carrying thats what it was sadie said thursday was his deposit night whos mr panos nat asked my boss creed said sadie had recovered enough to stand up again he owns the security patrol we used to pay but he raised his rates last summer and we had to drop it but nat wore a confused expression wait a minute if this guy panos didnt do security here anymore why was he here on thursday because i was creed said the cops asked him the same question also he and sam knew each other he turned to sadie he was really upset about this maam he told the inspectors hed give them any help he could and i know he was working with them as of fridayhe included natwhen they interviewed me how do you know that nat asked his brother roythats mr panoss brotherwas with them interviewing suspects so they have suspects after all sadie asked creed made a pained face they were looking at a few guys whod been at a poker game apparently one of them lost a lot of money the night before and the thought was he might have come back to get it mr panos had given the inspectors a list of whod been there and thats where they started a sharp rapping on the front door made them all turn a dark menacing hatchet face scowled through the glass and creed reached for his gun nat though put a hand on his arm stopping him its my son he said what are you doing here dad the intimidating black man took up a lot of room in the cramped aisle he turned impatiently to creed and held up a badge im glitsky sfpd who are you im assistant patrol special matt creed sir but glitsky had already whirled nat you shouldnt be in the room the old man was unbowed sadie wanted he stopped we thought it would be a good idea to do an inventory nobodys gotten back to her and she has the key so we thought wed let ourselves in find out what they took find out something at least abraham since nobody seems to want to tell us anything i got that much from your message shaking his head disgustedly glitsky looked around he walked to the entrance to the back room glanced down at the brownish stain on the floor then threw a cursory glance over the jewelry case then he was back at his father i told you id talk to gerson as soon as i could dad find out what i could he wasnt in today he took a deep breath focused on sadie mrs silverman he said i know its very hard to wait to learn anything when at the same time youre trying to deal with your grief my heart goes out to you but it would be better if my father wasnt here right now nat will tell you i did this homicide stuff for sixteen yearsnot just did it i ran the detailso believe me i know when the police know something they will tell you and i really cant have my father involved in this case in any way when creed realized that he had been in the room with lieutenant glitsky formerly head of homicide he decided that even if it delayed him for a few stops in his rounds he was going to talk to him after his father and mrs silverman had been sent on their way even a lowlevel connection with someone of glitskys rank and experience might translate to a letter of recommendation or something later on he might also get some advice on how to approach cuneo and russell about his perhapssquirrelly identification of clint terry so as glitsky left with his father and silvermans wife creed trailed along behind invisible while the trio walked down the street and across it into the underground level of the macys parking lot hanging back by an overhang until mrs silvermans car had driven away creed tried to time his moment in his best mood glitsky didnt exactly invite an easy familiarity and nowstanding with his hands on his hips looking after the taillights of the lexushe positively simmered over a low flame of anger frustration maybe fatigue after a minute he brought a hand to his forehead and squeezed at his temples are you all right sir the return to professional mode was immediate and impressive im fine mr creed i didnt realize you were still with us yes sir glitsky was walking and creed fell into step next to him im sorry i snapped at you back there at the shop i was upset with my father it wasnt your fault thanks it seemed to be a chance at an opening theyd come to the mouth of the garage up on the street level again crime scene stayed till about four in the morning glitsky stopped and faced him between the garage and streetlights they stood in a pool of visibility how do you know that you stay around too i came back after my shift creed shrugged im taking crim courses in school id been the first person on the scene and nobody seemed to mind if i stayed i wanted to see how it worked in real life and how was that i thought they were pretty thorough from what i know which isnt much glitsky put his hands into his jacket pockets several seconds passed so what happened that you got there first did you get a call no really it was just mostly a coincidence i was on the block right over therehe pointed to a spot across the streetwhen the alarm went off at silvermans i saw some guys running out the door so i yelled after them to stop and one of them shot at me twice glitskys mouth moved an impulse to smile and missed i see yes sir youre lucky his eyes went to the shop though maybe not so much from that distance but either way you dont want to get shot its never been in my plan yeah well it was never in mine either it just goes to show you creed couldnt stop himself you got shot it was the wrong question the lieutenants face closed up nothing to brag about he said clipping the words glitsky was wrestling with himself hed only come downtownfifteen minutes after hed arrived hometo keep his father from getting him into more trouble he hadnt even had dinner yet and knew that treya would be waiting for him rachel was still feverish and in some lowlevel but constant way he was worried about that too certainly he didnt want to stay in any kind of private conversation with this young rentacop even if he did seem bright interested and idealistic these were not traits glitsky normally associated with panoss crew especially since hed been reviewing the police reports on behalf of hardy and his pending lawsuit hed had innumerable dealings with wgp on his own as well and few of them had been pleasant on the other hand this boy had been the first person on the scene had actually been a witness to the crime in progress undoubtedly he had been interviewed by the case inspectors and glitsky had no reason to believe that they were less than adequate he didnt know cuneo and russell at all theyd been brought up in gersons watch and might for all he knew be the most competent and committed policemen in san francisco although most of his recent experience in the department argued against that nothing to brag about he said and realized that he sounded too harsh but so you actually saw these guys well to tell you the truth lieutenant i saw three figures running away from me in the dark i couldnt identify any of them to save my life that happens i wouldnt worry too much about it the open face of the young man took on a troubled look and glitsky said what creed blew out heavily a deep sigh he seemed suddenly ashamed of himself except maybe i was trying too hard to be helpful helpfuls generally good son whats the problem a shrug i might have given your guys some bad information glitsky had seen enough confessions to know when somebody wanted to talk he leaned against a parking meter crossed his arms met creeds eyes waited i had told themyour inspectorsthat the person whod shot at me seemed like he was kind of big so then they came back the next day and said they were looking at this other guy who works in the neighborhood a bartender over at the ark do i know him do i think it could have been him and im thinking i dont know what im thinking to tell you the truth probably just wanting to be important you know so i give them the impression that yeah maybe it was this guy i mean i say it could have been and then i told the inspectors hes got these two friends he hangs with the recitation ground down to a stop and now you dont think it was creed shook his head miserably i really dont know i went by there tonightthe arkand he was behind the bar i mean it could have been him i suppose maybe but i was a lot stronger than that when i talked with the inspectors it was like i gave them the impression that i could positively id him so call them up and tell them glitsky said just like that yep theyre probably working half a dozen leads right now theyll be glad to know sooner rather than later believe me theyll thank you for it and think im an idiot glitsky actually broke a smile possibly but if youre not an idiot next time nobody will remember but im curious howd they get on to this guy the big guy in the first place there must have been something yeah there was it was the ark the connection there which is what this guy john holiday owns the place evidently he was at silvermans poker gameyou know about the poker game wednesday nights anyway holiday was there the night before and lost a lot of money mr panos knew about it and told the inspectors and they went by the ark to talk to himholiday but since he wasnt there they got clint the big guy the bartender and after that of course they came to me talk to the inspectors glitsky said maybe theyve got something else on these guys too i just wouldnt want them to waste their time because of what i told them and also ive got to tell you whats that these guys holiday clint and randy wills i think theyre pretty harmless id hate to get them in trouble if they had nothing to do with this glitsky chewed on the inside of his cheek his brain fully engaged i wouldnt worry about that he said if they did it some evidence of it will likely turn up and thats what theyll get them on theyre not going down on your id i promise you that meanwhile im keeping you and my wife thinks im on my way home he pointed a ringer at creed call the inspectors though all right yes sir fortyfive minutes later creed was working the beat south of market and saw roy panos taking a break in a booth at carrs coffee shop like creed he was on duty tonight and in uniform roy was engaged in an animated conversation and after creed was inside he realized that one of the two men facing away from him was nick sephia not a big fan of nicks whom hed worked with a few times before he went to the diamond center he considered turning around and walking out but by then roy had seen him and motioned him over sliding over to the wall to make room hey mattie creed hated the diminutive and had committed the cardinal error of mentioning it once to roy thereby assuring that hed forever be mattie or little matt or mataroni in any event it was hard to stay mad at roy who was always hale fellow well met and tonight so much so that creed wondered if hed been drinking or maybe he was nervous i was just telling the guys hereyou know nick and julio no julio rez matt creed creed reached across the table and shook hands with a very welldressed overshaved alert and unsmiling hispanic with a little less than half of his left ear nice he said as though adding to meet you would have been excessive creed had a quick impression of danger of suppressed energy maybe of cocaine he wondered if nick whod moved into the stratosphere of security positions transporting diamonds now had his own bodyguard when rez had leaned across to take creeds hand his coat had fallen open revealing a shoulder holster and the butt of an automatic but this was the observation of a split second roy was back carrying the conversation i was just telling these guys about you i mean here ive been doing this work what fifteen years and its shine the flashlight see nothing go to the next window and do it again mattie here hes on less than a year he comes round the cornerblam blamcouple of rounds right at him guys running him chasing the fucking wild west awesome action anytime you want ill trade you creed said i took the job for the flashlight work you dont like gettin shot at sephia asked i love it you know that swear to god makes me horny as hell anything doesnt make you horny nick roy asked sephia considered briefly nothing comes to mind he said but rez turned to creed roy said you fingered those assholes at the ark he said it wasnt quite a question it sounded more like a challenge but then rez had made the single word nice sound the same way fingered might be a little strong he said hes being modest roy said he set em all up to go down holiday terry his little girlfriend whats his name randy wills rez didnt have to think he had it all in his head he might have been an accountant wills terry holiday all of em roy repeated not only does the kid get himself shot at a few times he solves a murder before his first anniversary not exactly that but roy pushed it hey its true matoosh after your id the other night those guys are going down for a long time yeah well you dont seem so happy about it rez said he leaned in across the table a tight smile fixed under a glassy catseye stare creed felt a line of sweat forming at the back of his neck the thing is it might not have been them roy snorted half laughing what are you talking about of course it was them youre the one who saw them didnt you how could it not be them but now having gotten it out creed continued in a rush thats what i wanted to talk to you about do you know a lieutenant glitsky roy nodded sure he used to run homicide what about him well his father was a friend of silvermans and they were by there tonight who was by where rez asked glitsky and his father and silvermans wife at the shop doing what sephias color was suddenly up creed shook his head nothing really they never got to it they were going to do an inventory but barely got started before glitsky got there and cleared them out there you go roy said as though he were satisfied with the answer so glitskys working the case now whats that about no i think he was just there because of his father but outside after i asked him what if i wasnt as sure as i sounded about the three guys with the other inspectors and whatd he say a shrug he said just to tell them not a big issue theyd be glad about it wait wait wait not if sephia said but roy raised a handfirmly made eye contact across the table exactly right he said then in a milder tone exactly right he smiled a shutup warning at sephia and rez no way they want to spend all that time chasing the wrong guys back to creed but youre sure this time you seemed pretty certain the other way the other night creed shook his head miserably i dont even know that it still could have been them i suppose i just didnt want themthe inspectorsthinking i was positive basing their case on what i said he scratched at the tabletop roy nodded in full agreement hey bottom line is glitskys right you got to tell them in fact im meeting up with them later tonight down at the hall roy tapped his own pocket wades little pr moment for our good friends among the police fortyniner tickets fifty yard line you want ill pass the message on for you when i see them creed felt a wash of grateful relief and it showed roy panos was far better with people especially with city policemen than he was roy could phrase creeds ambivalence about the id in such a way as to minimize the idiocy factor maybe even give it a rosy gloss certainly creed himself could avoid the embarrassment of having to face the inspectors and admit that in his zeal to be a help hed screwed up you sure he asked roy youd do that roy smiled and took a pinch of creeds cheek hey anything for my little matooshka huh creed took this as his cue to leave he slid out of the booth and said goodbye all around but he wasnt completely out the door to the coffee shop when nick leaned across the table he cant take back that id roy he was whispering but with great intensity thats the thing thats keeping the inspectors busy roy picked up his coffee cup sipped at it hes not taking back the id he said sephia hit the table for emphasis hello roy he just told us he was roy finished his sip slowly put the cup down i dont know if you heard me but i said id tell the two inspectors and im going to forget not enough rez said it would still screw it all up sephia said he still knows rez methodically turned his own mug around and around on the table roy shook his head look guys creed doesnt know anything dont go all paranoid around this even if he somehow gets back himself with cuneo and russell and says the id on terry isnt positive so what maybe he gets them thinking rez said still spinning the mug never looking up its not going to happen especially since im not passing it on i still dont like it sephia said rez nodded in agreement finally looked over at sephia creeds a problem he said creeds not a problem he thinks it might not have been terry thats all but if he cant talk at all it doesnt even get to that sephia said dont you guys be stupid roy said this is under control im telling you rez slowly brought his empty gaze around across the table to roy he nodded his head once a dismissal oh okay he said is this the same man who prides himself on living according to john kennedys old motto of never explain never complain ive only heard you say those words about a hundred and fourteen times now im sure i meant them every single time too well well this particular fine dayand it was the good weather continuing as they drove together into workim going to have to do some explaining before i can succeed in doing some real good the explaining part will neither be appreciated nor understood and neither will the real good if in fact thats what it is glitsky stared at the road ahead of him his wife kept it up when are you going to learn abe theres no point in trying to live by a motto even an excellent one if you cant dredge it up and act on it when you really need it which you do today believe me you dont want to even start to do this he kept his voice civil so what do you suggest i do she turned to him you know that one no im asking she sighed all right then i suggest you do absolutely nothing you go up to your office and close the door and read a good book and just ignore all this other stuff she glanced over at him how can i put this so you understand it is not your job you are not responsible for what happens down there you should not even care how can i not care tell me that easy you say to yourself self im at my job because i have a wife and a child and two kids in college and i need the paycheck and benefits that is why i go to work period and thats how you feel about your job actually no i love my job but its not the same situation how is it different then she rolled her eyes i dont believe were having this discussion its different because i care about the job theyre paying me to do you on the other hand care about a job nobodys paying you for its like if you decided you cared about i dont know being an astronaut im sure astronauts have problems all the time but guess what abe theyre not your problems she slapped at the console between them and neither are homicides they rode in silence for a block finally abe said so i shouldnt go to gerson again trey a sighed you think you know something call one of your people there youve still got friends there right marcel paul they make the same argument to gerson tell him what you told themthe id might be funky then you buy them a hamburger everybodys happy whats the problem with that i dont know glitsky said i really dont know it just doesnt seem right somehow and it still leaves me having to explain why i was by silvermans if he finds out which he will how would he find out whos going to tell him the young rentacop i dont know but hes going to find outthats the way these things goso given that itd be better if he heard it first from me theyd gotten to a parking place in one of the lots under the freeway a couple of blocks from the hall of justice glitsky switched off the motor but made no move to get out treya pulled down the visor and carefully with an exaggerated calm applied some lipstick she was breathing heavily through her nose when she was done sheagain carefullyclosed the lipstick and dropped it back in her purse at last she turned to her husband well im thinking about it he said glitsky was in a booth at lous with marcel lanier a longtime colleague in homicide he was bragging modestly about his wife whod convinced him that there was no point in having a motto if you were going to jettison it at a real opportunity to have it work for you it would be like being a boy scout and just before a rafting trip in class v rapids forgetting to put on your life vest so what good would all that earlier be prepared stuff have done you lanier squinted in the dim light i know you dont drink abe especially this early otherwise id be worried what the hell are you talking about glitsky blew on his tea not explaining to gerson about why im interested in this silverman thing and this has to do with the boy scouts somehow the tea was too hot and glitsky put it down never mind marcel lets leave it what i really want to talk about is wade panos lanier made the face of a chronic heartburn sufferer do we have to at a few minutes after eleven oclock about two hours after glitsky had told lanier about creeds perhaps bogus identification there was one sharp rap at his door glitsky took his feet off his desk snapped shut his latest patrick obrian noveldesolation island he opened his drawer deposited the book pulled some paperwork over in front of him its open he said glitsky wasnt altogether stunned to see barry gerson he came to his feet with what he hoped was a warm greeting invited the lieutenant in shook his hand told him to take a chair returning the courtesy visit he finally asked gerson polite as an undertaker inclined his head an inch something like that but not exactly no frankly abe not all right he squared himself linked his fingers on the desktop in front of him how can i help you actually i came here to ask you the same thing i thought id made it clear yesterday when you came down to the detail that my door was open to you you needed anything all you had to do was ask thats true i appreciated that too barry i really did i still do but but then i had a talk withhe almost named batiste stopped himselfwith some colleagues who didnt think it would be smart of me to abuse the privilege it might look like i was trying to insinuate myself back into the detail which youre not no of course not glitsky pushed his chair back crossed his arms behind his head im minding my own business up here keeping an eye out for payroll irregularities but gerson didnt smile at the witticism so youre denying that you went down to silvermans last night glitsky repressed his own rare urge to smile of course as hed told treya gerson would have to find out he was almost pleased that hed predicted it nobodys asked me if they did if youre asking me now i admit it gerson nodded you mind if i ask you why not at all my father went down there with mrs silverman and i didnt think it was a good idea i wasnt there ten minutes you expect me to believe that glitsky let out a weary breath as i told you yesterday my father was silvermans best friend you mentioned that i remember gerson straightened to his full length in the chair and as i believe i told you yesterday i would inform you as soon as we unearthed anything that moved the case forward of course i appreciate that its just that my dad and the wife hadnt heard from your department and thought theyd take an inventory i told my father it wasnt a good idea for him to be involved because of the discussion i had with you thats what happened i was out yesterday cuneo and russell both had personal time off thats why nobody called the wife at glitskys look he added hey it happens yes it does good glitsky thought ive got him explaining too so you just went down to silvermans and found them there he called me and left a message and i dont need to answer these questions ive got no interest gerson displayed a small air of triumph and because youve got no interest you didnt talk to lanier this morning so what glitsky pushed his chair back far enough to allow him to cross a leg you want to know the truth lieutenant i was trying to do you a favor goodness of your heart huh believe it or not i actually have some understanding of the job youve got i thought i could save you some misery and how would you do that do you know wade panos by reputation sure and whats his reputation he does a good job maybe a little rough but he keeps the scum factor down in his neighborhoods and thats it a shrug what else is there glitsky came forward again do you know hes being sued who isnt people sue people all the time whats that mean maybe nothing except when theres something like fourteen plaintiffs asking around thirty million dollars again i ask you what does that prove hell you know somebodys always suing us brutality invasion of privacy stealing candy from schoolkids you name it true enough glitsky said youre probably right panos is a saint i never said that but glitsky still had a look and gerson said but what only that id think hard before i gave him point in any homicide investigation hes not point he had leads thats all the poker players glitsky locked his ringers on the desk said nothing gerson raised his voice and in fact the names he gave us took my boys someplace you got a problem with that not at all so what then so the usual suspects huh two guys with sheets three as it turns out randy wills isnt any choirboy either so yeah the usual suspects happens every day no question about it glitsky turned a neutral face up at him your boys find any evidence to go with their suspects theyll be getting warrants glitsky clucked then nodded all understanding they looking at anybody else in the meanwhile why do they want to do that when the guys panos gave us look good for it youre right glitsky said mildly waste of time thatd be stupid perhaps correctly gerson must have gotten the impression that glitsky was including him among the less intellectually gifted hed burst in here ten minutes ago holding the high moral ground and for the past several minutes had been drifting into the lower regions and losing territory even there it didnt appreciably improve his attitude he stood up well you know he said stupid or not im running the detail now im calling the shots with my troops and what i came up here to tell you still goes silverman is my case im controlling the investigation yesterday im a good guy and bend a little and you take advantage of it hiding behind your old man well im telling you now you keep you and your father out of it all the way out or ill haul your ass in before the deputy chief dont think i wont his voice was rasping now lowpitched with anger and the need for control in the cramped room in fact you might want to remember that every homicide in the city is my case now and my guys work for me glitsky knew he could a draw a punch with one sarcastic word and it hovered temptingly on the tip of his tongue thered be a great deal of pleasure in it but he only leaned back crossed his arms and nodded i got it he said david freeman had to be at his office at pm to hold the hand of another of his coplaintiffs being deposed in the panos lawsuit yesterday theyd started at am with a gentle turbaned professor of comparative religion at city college in his midfifties now soon after the terrorist attacks casif yasouf had been walking back to his car parked at the downtown center garage from a meeting at the st francis hotel when he had the bad luck to run into roy panos in uniform the assistant patrol special was abusing a homeless man in an alley kicking him and his shopping cart down toward the western border of thirtytwo mr yasoufs version of events was that hed simply tried to intervene as a citizen telling the policeman that he didnt have to use such tactics panos he said had then abandoned his pursuit of the bum and turned on him lifted him easily by his shirt slapped his face hard twice and told him to take his raghead ass back to arabia frightened and bleeding mr yasouf finally fled he reported the incident to the regular police the next morning complete with panoss name from his tag two days later he abandoned the complaint againhis versionbecause someone had set fire to his car that deposition hadnt finished up until twelvethirty the next morning and by the time freeman had gotten back walking as always to his apartment at the foot of nob hill it was after am and gina roake was asleep in his bed it had been their bed now since a few weeks after his physical confrontation with nick sephia about a year ago things had started to change with freeman and roake before that freeman had maintained a discreet and rotating harem of up to a dozen women he was after all a wealthy and successful old man with an established urban sophisticated lifestyle that did not include the sort of entanglements that he believed were the unvarying attendants of exclusive physical relationships he had always kept an armoire of womens robes for his visitors the medicine chest was wellstockedtoothbrushes creams and so on roake was at fortyeight not exactly a babe in the woods herself she like freeman had had several longstanding but essentially casual relationships and had never been married they had seen each other in professional and social settingscourtrooms fundraisers restaurants even the occasional judges chambersfor years but had never shared more than pleasantries freeman had a longstanding tradition that whenever he won a large case he would celebrate alonea fine meal at one of the citys restaurant treasures with an old and noble wine then a final cognac or two at the top of the mark or one of the other towersthe st francis the fairmont that night at the crown room in the fairmont he sat savoring his paradis at a small table by the window overlooking the bay side he appreciated the walk of the shapely grownup woman as she got off the elevator unavoidably registering that she appeared to be alone it didnt matter he told himself this was not how he met women ever hed been playing the case over and over again in his mind throughout the night all the high points up to and including the glorious moment of the not guilty verdict people had no idea what a rare and lovely thing it was even in san francisco to get a defense verdict the best defense lawyers in the world won maybe five percent of their casesfreeman himself hovered around fourteen percent but he believed himself to be an almost unparalleled genius and he was right except now the case was over there would be no need even of an appeal his mind consumed by its strategies for most of a year was suddenly empty he felt a mild euphoria and with the meal and wine a deep physical contentment the cognac was the essence of perfection he stared out the window over the sparkling lights he turned back to the room the woman had materialized in front of him david i thought that was you still half in reverie he smiled gina hello what a pleasant surprise i dont want to bother you if youre busy she said not at all at all please join me if youd like shed sat and they had talked until last call after which she took a cab home in the next month he asked her to lunch nine timeshe preferred lunch dates because there was less expectation of automatic intimacy than with dinner either party in the gettoknow stage could back out without embarrassment or loss of face in that way friendship which in freemans opinion was always preferable to physical attraction could be preserved in roakes case though a strange thing happened by the time it became obvious that theyd be sleeping together hed stopped seeing anyone else before he asked her to his apartment for the first time and without any kind of agonizing analysis he got rid of the contents of his armoire the other feminine accoutrements then slowly over time shed started leaving articles of clothing of her own at his place until she had her own drawer in his bureau and the entire armoire all to herself she hadnt spent the night at her own apartment now for three months this morning freeman barely woke up in time to catch roake as she was out the door on her way to work he reminded her of the depositions that had now begun on panos and wondered if she might make it back here for lunch even a little early if possible since they wouldnt get dinner together for who knew how long now he checked his watch she should be home any minute billy joels cd of piano concertosa gina findplayed almost inaudibly in the background rubbing his palms together he was shocked to find them damp with nerves he caught a glimpse of himself in a wall mirror and shook his head in amusement david freeman hadnt been nervous arguing before the supreme court he couldnt remember his last attack of even minor jitters but he had to admit he had them now his eyes left his own image and went to the little eating nook in the cramped and narrow kitchen normally the table was a mess piled high with yellow legal pads lawbooks halfempty coffee mugs wineglasses and sometimes bottles newspapers binders and file folders today it looked perfect and elegant hed spent most of an hour removing the usual detritus and what remained were two simple place settings in silver crystal champagne glasses one yellow cymbidium in the center of the starched white cloth echoing the sunlight that just kissed the edge of the table there was a beaded silver champagne bucket to one side a bottle of veuve cliquots la grande dame purposely chosen for the name of course nestled in it in chilled splendor hed arranged for rick the chef downstairs at the rue charmaine to deliver the light lunch pike quenelles in a saffron broth and an artichokehe artandpancetta saladprecisely at noon one last glance at himself and he had to smile certainly no one would mistake him for handsome but hed done all right and today he looked as good as he could which is to say he probably wouldnt scare most small children he wore the one nice suit a maroonandgold silk tie hed managed to shave without cutting his neck and his collar was free of his trademark brown specks of dried blood it would have to do and here she was on time cheerful kissing his cheek god he loved her youre looking good today mister if i didnt have a meeting in two hours she kissed him again then backed up a step i thought clients didnt trust nice clothes this isnt for a client he realized he had taken her hand when shed come up to him and hadnt released it come look at something she stopped in the doorway to the kitchen and turned to him who are you and what have you done with my boyfriend then more seriously this is beautiful david is it an occasion dont tell me we started seeing each other a year ago today and i didnt remember it might be an occasion someday he said in the future he drew in a deep breath and came out with it i wanted to know if youd be interested in marrying someone like me she looked quickly down to the ground then back up staring at him with a startled intensity somebody like you do you mean hypothetically no i said that wrong i meant me will you marry me for an eternal two secondsthey were still holding handsshe did not move looking him full in the face she brought her other hand up and held it over her mouth obviously stunned oh david her eyes filled i never thought she looked at him hopelessly vulnerable terrified a tear spilled out onto her cheek but still the word didnt come i love you he said please say yes oh god yes of course yes her arms were around his neck and she was crying openly now kissing his face eyes lips again and again yes yes yes yes yes this saturday it was mid afternoon and they were taking a break in the deposition of their old friend aretha labonte while she used the ladies room panoss lawyer dick kroll was waiting taking notes back in the conference room a large sunlit enclosure resembling a greenhouse that they called the solarium freeman and hardy were ostensibly filling their coffee cups in the old mans office freeman nodded if youre free ill get free its not that im flattered that youd ask me im just a little surprised no im flabbergasted i didnt know you were even thinking of it well there you go you dont see everything and isnt saturday a little soon if you just got engaged today why would we want to wait once we decided i dont know most people do thats all send out invitations plan the party freeman was shaking his head none of that diz we dont want a party just a best manthats youand a maid of honor and a judge oh and ginas mother its nice you remembered her can frannie come and frannie naturally goes without saying hardy drank some coffee you know ive been a best man twice now in two years i stood up for glitsky good for you freemans enthusiasm was restrained youll be in practice i didnt need it it was pretty easy like aretha here again freeman shook his head dont get complacent krolls good even if hes got no principles in fact it might be why hes good i dont know hardy said im not seeing much yet freeman opened the door out to the lobby aretha was back at her place in the solarium and smiling freeman waved at kroll who was staring angrily in their direction he pointed at his watch in an impatient gesture freeman waved again turned back to hardy hell come up with something im just saying weve got him on the ropes i dont see him coming up with a legal something you wait freeman said youll see then an afterthought what do you mean legal something what else is there the law offices of richard c kroll were located in one of the recently built and controversial loft spaces south of market street at third and folsom for the past twenty minutes kroll had been turned around in his swivel chair looking out of his second story floortoceiling window for the familiar sight of wade panos to appear on the street below it was the day after his latest deposition with aretha labonte at david freemans office and now here wade was half a block down on foot and in uniform as always stopping to look into the shops as he passed them even occasionally raising a hand to acquaintances on the street an extraordinarily successful man in his element panos bestrode the pavement like a parade marshal confident and unassailable krolls stomach rumbled and he clutched at it taking a few antacids from a roll in his desk drawer he stood up in the mirror over the bar area he got his face composed so that it wouldnt immediately telegraph the bad news he was about to deliver by the time his secretary buzzed him with the word that wade had arrived he was back at his desk apparently lost in other work when panos opened the door to the office he looked up and motioned to the wing chair in front of his desk hed be done in just a moment closing the folder he finally found the nerve to look at his client wade for his part sat back comfortably an ankle resting on a knee his eyes half closed he was always a patient man and the small wait until his lawyer gave him his attention didnt seem to rankle in the least still when kroll closed the folder he came out of his trance suddenly all business so how bad is it he asked kroll tried to smile how do you know its bad you want to see me in person dick its bad its one reason i like you other guys they get bad news they give it to you over the phone or leave a message you you got the balls to be here and try to break the fall i appreciate that so how bad is it kroll templed his hands on his desk pretty bad panos nodded tell me we got denied on the summary judgment which means what it means the judge decided that this things going forward panos showed little reaction if anything he settled back a little more into his chair okay he said you said from the beginning that filing the thing was a slim chance so it didnt work no real surprise right but there is a surprise panos cocked his head an inquisitive dog im listening kroll noticed that his knuckles had gone white and he willed himself to loosen his grip you remember we decided that since you personally were not alleged to have harmed any of the plaintiffs that you shouldnt be personally named as one of the defendants right its just wgp and some of the assistants noticing krolls look he stopped midsentence what thats what freeman and hardy decided to hit they were shooting to pierce the corporate veil and it looks like they did it still well back in his seat still in a relaxed posture panos frowned you lost me dick whats that mean it means kroll stopped shook his head reached for another folder and opened it ill read the relevant part to you hows that plaintiffs have introduced enough evidence to show that there exists a triable issue of fact as to whether wgp enterprises incorporated a california corporation and wade panos an individual are in fact alter egos of one another he dared a glance up at panos theyre saying that the corporation is a sham and that therefore you should be personally bound in apparently the judge bought it dick ive been incorporated for thirty years and my dad before that i know i know kroll sighed but apparently they argued that the corporation is undercapitalized among some other technical points also since youre the only shareholder and you control the companys daytoday workings on your own they said the corporation is being maintained not as a legitimate entity but as an artificial dodge to avoid personal liability artificial my ass i donate to all these charities through the corporation i pay my guys and my bills with corporate checks the corporations as real as a heart attack dick i agree with you wade and certainly thats what id argue in front of a jury and i might even prevail but the judge ruled that it would have to be decided by a jury so thats what were dealing with and if we lose then what then youre exposed personally panos seemed to go into another kind of trance it gets worse im afraid kroll said it also means youll be deposed before the jury gets to hear anything you and me go up to freemans office theres a court reporter taking everything down and youre under oath panos opened his eyes again but didnt respond folding his hands in his lap he took a breath the lawyer continued it also means that freeman and hardy get to ask you where you get your money all of it and how you get it this brought a small rise so then you object right kroll nodded yes i do except in a depo the objection is noted for the record but youve got to answer the question anyway and later the judge rules whether the answer is admissible later way later panoss chest rose and fell long and slow the point is kroll continued once theyve got you in a depo they can ask anything thats how they finally got clinton you know not because of anything he did with paula jones but because he said under oath that he hadnt had sex with anybody else then when monica came along panos held up a hand spare me the history lesson dick whats this mean to me in the here and now kroll picked his words carefully it means theyre going to be able to look at any bank account you have anywhere it could beim not saying it will be but knowing freeman id say its likelythat its going to be open season on your books and not just your corporate books they want your net worth why whats the big deal with my net worth thats largely what they base punitive damages on wade the idea is that punitives are supposed to punish to hurt the more youre worth the more they ask the more panos raised his head stopping kroll his face betrayed no deep concern in fact it had a controlled calm that given the circumstances kroll found to be a little scary a small laugh came from deep in panoss throat you remember when this started you called it awhat was it a nuisance lawsuit i remember again the frightening smile id say these two sons of bitches have taken it a little further than that wouldnt you he came forward in the chair okay youre my lawyer whats your advice now kroll appeared to be thinking although hed known all along that it would come to this we might want to offer to settle now panos lived with that notion for a beat then how much a few million at least say three four panos shook his head uttered an obscenity you think theyll take it kroll shrugged i dont think i would especially after this ruling but it cant hurt to ask theres no other option really panos grunted theres always another option he said he cast his eyes about the room then settled them on his lawyer but you go ahead make the offer dan cuneo lived in alameda across the bay from san francisco he had a dentist appointment at eleven oclock on monday morning though it killed him to miss a day when they might be able to close in on a murder suspect he also had a strong aversion to spending the day drooling with a numb lip next to his partner hed read many many magazine articles and listened to hundreds of hours of psychobabble nonsense about burnout and the consensus was that if you wanted to avoid it you had to keep some perspective on real life dont be a cop all the time if youve got an appointment with a doctor keep it if youre really sick stay home the job isnt everything so he had finally talked himself into believing that he wasnt abandoning the silverman case by taking one day off he had accrued eleven extra sick days from the past couple of yearstimes when the exigencies of the job had won out when hed been sick but today he had the damned appointment and as a conscious exercise he had decided albeit before silverman had been shot that no matter what came upand there would always be something that came uphe was going to keep the appointment mental health to quell the voice of his conscience before it could change his mind he called his partner on saturday morning and gave him the news that he was calling in sick monday russell who lived in sunnyvale fortyfive miles south of san francisco took this as an opportunity to make plans to go fishing on the bay he had three unused sick days in his bank and like every other city employee he knew except cuneo he believed that it was bad luck to let too many of them pile up so on monday he went fishing this morning tuesday after three days out of the office both inspectors had enormous amounts of busywork waiting for them when they checked in at a little after a couple of dozen phone calls for each to return transcripts of the tapes of witness interviews to proofread for accuracyand they stayed at their desks for three and a half hours before breaking for lunch which took up most of an hour at the mcdonalds next to the hall at one they had to be out at the academy for a mandatory previously scheduled fourhour sensitivity training class every cop in san francisco made fun of these attempts to create social workers out of law enforcers but if you didnt go your pay got docked todays topic had been transgender issues timely and relevant because the city had recently decided to extend the insurance of city workers to cover sexchange operations this change in policy also brought to light some sensitivity shortcomings among city service personnel especially the police who needed guidelines on how to refer to those of questionable gender during the arrest and booking process the critical element was the persons selfdefinitionif someone defined herself as a transsexual officers should refer to her as a female if she possessed a penis however she should be booked as a male but even with all the education the concepts remained mostly elusive to some people drumming wipeout on the steering wheel as he drove back downtown after the class dusk descending cuneo turned to his partner so if i dont want em to cut off my dick i cant be a girl russell threw him a frown youve just failed the course you realize that then seeing that cuneo was apparently sincere he continued its not a matter of wanting dan you can be all the way to a woman in your brain and still have a dick you might not want to get rid of it anymore or it might be too expensive not here its covered by insurance okay not here but most places if it were me cuneo said id just move here get a job with the city lop that sucker right off so it went variations on the theme until they got back to the homicide detail where cuneo hoped they could put in some time finally on silverman at least get caught up if thered been any developments but by now the inspectors had each put in ten hours and he knew russell was going to want to go home to his family so more or less casually cuneo walked over and stood outside the open door to gersons office until the lieutenant happened to look up dan there you are you and lincoln got a minute the room had changed since glitskys tenure it wasnt a large space by any definition but in the old days the big desk in the center of it had kept any meetings by necessity small there had been one uncomfortable wooden chair across from the desk affording any visitor maybe three feet of room anybody else would have to stand gerson by contrast had installed a modular unit that hugged the back wall and turned the corner where he had his computer printer fax machine and telephone this arrangement left an open area in the middle of the room made the office seem larger the lieutenant was a bass fisherman and had brought in and hung on the walls a few of his mounted trophy fish and several framed promotional photos of boats and fishing equipment on his last birthday the unit had pitched in and bought him a mounted plastic bass that when activated sang dont worry be happy and hed hung it over his computer now cuneo russell and gerson sat facing one another on their identical ergonomic rolling chairs no one looked happy all seemed angry or at least worried gerson was telling them about glitskys input he thinks wade panos is screwing with your investigation cuneo paying attention was whistling a tuneless melody russell leaning forward elbows on his knees asked did he say why no not really nothing substantive just that panos doesnt have a great rep cuneo stopped whistling the guys a major philanthropist whats he talking about i think hes talking about some of his guys the beat patrolmen what about them russell asked a shrug some of them sometimes get a little enthusiastic it seems play a little rough with the residentially challenged roust em out of their neighborhoods good for them russell said somebody needs to its probably because they dont get the sensitivity training we real cops get youre joking dan gerson said but youre not all wrong evidently its a legitimate problem at least enough so panos is getting sued he could probably run a tighter ship but you ask me the real problem is that glitskys old school and panos isnt a righteous cop simple as that he doesnt like the patrols so glitskys take is that wade panos himself is personally screwing with our investigation cuneo asked why would he do that no idea gerson said but glitskys all over it he went to silvermans you know and yesterday morning he talked to lanier lanier cuneo straightened up what about whats lanier got to do with anything you mean with silverman i dont know gerson shrugged this panos thing what panos thing russell shot a look at his partner came back to gerson are we missing something here barry i guess glitskys wondering why panos got into it at all why russell raised his voice ill tell you why he came down to silvermans because one of his employees discovered the body thats why then it turned out he happened to know about this poker game which was the source of silvermans stolen money next day he gives us names of the players in the game and one of them looks like hes with the guys who did it whats the problem with that tell me that isnt good police work i cant it is i dont have a problem not with you not with the investigation either i got another one for you barry cuneo said whats any of this to glitsky anyway why would he give any kind of a shit gerson pressed his lips together reluctant to diss a fellow lieutenant finally though he decided his inspectors needed to know my gut feeling is i believe he wants to get back into homicide though god knows why his dad knew silverman i guess he thought it gave him a wedge and this helps him how cuneo asked i dont know to tell you the truth the kindest thing i can think is hes really trying to make himself useful somehow i mean to us to you ive been trying to figure it out but it baffles me he shook his head or maybe no what cuneo asked nothing you were going to say something russell said gerson looked at each of them in turn considered another moment well i dont really think this is too likely but if glitsky starts to make you guys doubt your sources maybe you get tentative dont make the arrests you need to you look bad which makes me look bad and pretty soon they want a new lieutenant up here and they pick glitsky out of a hat cuneo asked i dont think so are you really worried sir russell asked gerson was matter of fact i cant say im losing sleep but if you guys could bring in a quick collar here it wouldnt break my heart i he went silent again the inspectors waited finally cuneo said what he sighed with resignation when i mentioned this to batiste he said there might be something else in play with glitsky whats that russell asked gerson paused again lowered his voice id really like to keep this in this room between us all right both inspectors nodded well it seems lieutenant glitsky has a couple of lawyer friends were talking good friends defense lawyers and theyre the guys who are suing wgp they cant very well have panos get a lot of press for helping us solve a murder case right nowitd make him look too good in front of the jury russell came forward and youre saying glitskys working for these guys gerson backpedaled slightly im not saying anything im telling you what batiste mentioned to me as a rumor nothing more to the extent it intersects with your investigation here its probably worth your knowing although i dont know how much credence id give it theres also talk that your suspectholiday righthes been out working the streets rounding up witnesses against panos too why what would be in it for them cuneo asked theyre asking thirty mil or so which is ten to the lawyers if they win any small percentage of that is a nice payday for whoever was on the team helping them hows that sound plus if we somehow screw up in homicide maybe glitsky gets the gig back here were not going to screw up barry russell said this ones falling in by the numbers we brace holiday in the morning get him and his partners nervous about each other talking then somebody gives somebody up and we bring them all in youre sure theyre it the kid creed he basically idd them russell spread his arms show me anything else barry no this all fits it was full dark by the time russell and cuneo checked out they planned to arrive at the ark tomorrow at holiday worked the early shift and theyd catch him there and have a long conversation cuneo considered trying to talk russell into going by and leaning on clint terry or randy wills more that night but he knew that lincoln would want to be home a priority with him besides cuneo had his own date with liz from panoss office and it made the second date difficult if you blew off the first one at the last minute finally theyd already worked eleven hours today and thered been nothing but stink about overtime lately cuneo knew that everything probably could wait until tomorrow and it wouldnt really make any difference certainly nothing had happened since friday cuneo was always frustrated by the pace of investigations this case was proceeding as it should the two inspectors had not done any substantive investigative work on the silverman murder since the previous friday night when theyd gotten creeds tentative identification of terry wills and holiday it was now on tuesday ninetyfour hours later it was a small but welcome surprise the attorneys had all finished with aretha labontes deposition by early evening hardy would be home by dinnertime up in his office he called frannie with the news then checked his messagesnothing crucialand packed some file folders into his briefcase downstairs he stopped in the doorway to the old mans office dick kroll whod stayed for a little chat had gone and freeman was alone at his desk lighting the stub of a cigar hed started early in the afternoon do you have any idea how great it is to be able to walk in here without phyllis stopping me to ask what i want hardy asked freeman had the cigar in his mouth and spun it over a wooden match when he had it going he drew on it contentedly then placed it in an ashtray the firms longtime receptionist phyllis was a tyrant in the lobby whose chief role was to block access to freeman hardys suggestions regarding her termination were a recurring theme that freeman mostly ignored i believe mr kroll is getting concerned he said with satisfaction and not a minute too soon he gestured ambiguously he just offered to settle how much four million i must be losing my touch i had him pegged at three and a half i remember hardy stepped inside the office sat on one of the chairs still it seems a long way from thirty freeman blew smoke yes it does although as mr kroll points out its a mil and change for us right now he seems to believe that our compensationyours and mine the firmsis the critical factor he doesnt even consider that it might be about our clients or his really hardy crossed a leg so the four mil whats that break down to call it almost three hundred grand per plaintiff which after taxes is a hundred and fifty still hardy said thats real money freeman waved that off pah its gone in a year maybe two besides its his first offer i told him flat no not even close but i did learn something whats that panos has four mil of his own that hes willing to give us forget the insurance whered he get that kind of money he chewed his cigar for a moment anyway i told him flat out that my intention was to put his client out of business the mans a common gangster and he knows it hardy grinned you should have just been honest and told him what you really thought so whatd he say to that he got a little put out said making this a personal vendetta wasnt doing either of us any good i was being irresponsible to my clients freeman clucked he also said he was going to approach you directly me what for evidently he thinks you might be more amenable to reason i told him to help himself i hope you dont mind not at all ill just refer him back to you freeman nodded amused i told him thats probably what youd do and he said he said if it kept coming back to me i was looking for trouble hardy came forward he threatened you directly but freeman waved that off it wasnt even that cheap theatrics thats all thats what they do theyre cowards basically wouldnt you agree basically but that doesnt mean they wouldnt try something no chance theyre scared so they want to scare me its all just posturing besides which as you well know im bullet proof hardy grimaced i hate when you say that the old man grinned i know you do thats half the fun but you watch this time next week they come back with six maybe eight mil we get there i might even start listening but i might not he smiled contentedly have i mentioned that i love my job couple of times hardy said and i my family to whose bosom i now fly can i drop you home naw he indicated the clutter on his desk ive got some work here gina wont be home for an hour or two anyway is she picking you up here are you kidding me its what six blocks i need the exercise see you tomorrow drive carefully at the dinner table rebecca was making a face of disgust that is just so gross she said i think its cool vincent retorted its not gross beck they love each other but hes so i mean you know what i mean old frannie offered ancient not just that i mean yeah hes old but also i mean like hardy held up a warning ringer uhuh nice or nothing at all this is david freeman were discussing he is a great man and has every right to happiness and wedded bliss just like i have with your mother he gave frannie a wink and i with your father she said but god the beck ignored them both couldnt let the topic go i mean think about gina she kisses him she shivered at the thought more than that i bet thank you vincent frannie said thats enough and since it is hardy said ive got a fun new game the beck can go first he turned to his daughter here it is you try to say a whole sentence without using the words like or mean the beck was a very intelligent child she hesitated not at all before smiling cruelly at him then i wouldnt be able to say that i like my daddy even though hes really mean this tickled vincent who held up both hands as though she just scored a touchdown good one beck six points for the beck hardy grinned all around six points true but unfortunately grounded for life it hardly seems worth it to me after dinner the adults adjourned to the living room with the last of their wine while the kids cleared the table and started washing the dishes a relatively new development in the hardys ongoing campaign to increase the quality of their life at home frannie sat on the couch with a leg curled under her hardy in his wing chair with his feet on the ottoman without benefit of the kids comments they had returned to the subject of freemans upcoming nuptials do you think hes all right frannie asked i mean physically david hes a horse why do you ask just that it seems so sudden i wonder if he found out hes dying or something and maybe wanted to have his estate automatically go to gina he could just as easily put her in his will he shook his head smiling i think they love each other strange as it may be why do you say that hardy sipped some wine lowered his voice well the beck wasnt all wrong at dinner davids not exactly brad pitt you know hes not even wallace shawn and this matters because it doesnt i know we should be above all that superficial stuff still frannie put on her schoolteacher look and we wonder why the beck worries so much about how she looks hardy was grinning broadly at her very worst lightyears better than david id hope so but just for your information i would take a david freeman any day over say a john holiday thats very noble of you but i believe youd be in the minority and fortunately she said i dont have to choose ive already got a perfectly acceptable husband perfectly acceptable hardy said and people say the passion goes he finished his wine looked at the glass as though wondering where it had all gone but you just reminded me he was getting up what ive been so swamped at work with these depos i wanted to check in with john the thing he called about friday is he in more trouble probably not i hope i would have heard i the telephone rang and got picked up in the kitchen on the first ring he turned back to frannie and made a face well if thats darren there goes an hour but his daughter yelled back dad for you matt creed tried the front door then shone a light around the spacious lobby of the luxury box travel agency everything was as it should be and this was not a surprise this was the upscale portion of his route close up to union square in spite of the citys recent campaigns to discourage vagrancy in the hightourist area the vast majority of security problems this far north in thirtytwo still had to do with the homeless or mentally disabled population unlike many of his colleagues creed didnt try to roust these unfortunates completely out of the beat he didnt want them sleeping parking their shopping carts urinating or taking care of other personal needs in the doorways or elsewhere on the property of the client buildings but beyond that he was happy to leave them alone but tonight late now in the last hour of his shift he had turned right onto stockton and taken maybe ten steps when he saw an exaggerated movement a shadow in the mouth of the alley across the street creed knew the spot pretty well since it ended at the delivery bay for a building on the next block over it was more a driveway than a true alley after the workday in the lee of the prevailing winds and equipped with a dumpster that often doubled as a drop for leftover cooked food from some nearby restaurants it had become a popular sleeping site for the areas homeless normally creed walked right by it on the last leg of his route but when some kind of bottle came skittering up the street toward him slamming the curb and shattering at his feet he stopped he would never have done so normally but perhaps because of leftover jitters from his recent shootout tonight he pulled his weapon and crossed over at the mouth of the alley creed could still hear the footfalls of the man running away he stopped there then stepped to the side against the adjacent building to catch his breath after the excitement at silvermans last week he considered just guarding the opening and calling for some backup roy panos was undoubtedly somewhere in the beat and could be here in ten max but then he thought about the grief roy would give him a homeless guy throws a bottle in creeds direction and he cant handle the situation himself he needs backup it might even cost him points with wade who made no secret of his disdain for cowardice or timidity of any type for that matter if you worked for panos you were macho or you were soon unemployed but creeds jaw was tight his teeth clamped down all of his senses on alert one part of him knew that it was all because of last week of getting shot at he thought of nick sephias boast last night that getting shot at made him horny and couldnt even find a shred of humor in it or truth even thinking about it now but what was he thinking of this wasnt anything like a burglary in process it was a homeless guycreed had seen him or his shadow anyway a homeless man whod somehow scored a bottle of wine and got mad when it was empty he probably hadnt even seen creed much less aimed at him shaking his head at his own demons he realized with surprise that he still held his weapon and he holstered itwhatever this was he was sure it wouldnt call for a drawn gunand turned on his flashlight taking a last deep breath he walked into the alley it wasnt much over ten feet wide seventy or eighty feet deep the beam on his light was strong but at this distance still only dimly illuminated the dumpster at the end on the left side normally at this time of night there would be a couple of guys sitting on the delivery dock maybe three or four piles of debris that turned out to be men wrapped in their newspapers and layers of clothes at the small indentations of doorways along the alley tonight he saw nothing but the alley had no egress except the way hed come in the guy whod thrown the bottle had to be hiding in or behind the dumpster creed walked another ten or twelve steps hey he yelled his voice echoing eerily off the walls on three sides come on out here weve got to talk nothing creed swore to himself stood a long moment shining his light on the dumpster come on he said again whatever it is well get it worked out all right he had half a mind to forget about it to simply turn and walk out of the alley to stockton and back to the precinct where he could tell the lieutenant that there was this possible problem he might want to send some guys to look at that wouldnt even involve either of the panoses and what was he going to do with this guy when he came out anyway march him down to the precinct knock him upside the head clean him up and buy him some coffee not screw it he thought this is dumb he turned around and started back toward the street hed gone six or eight steps when another bottle exploded a few feet behind him the broken glass spraying the ground around him with little diamonds creed nearly jumped out of his shoes but now truly pissed off he turned around okay asshole you want to have some fun the beam from his flashlight preceding him he raked the dumpster side to side and front to back come on out dont be stupid ten feet back he stopped again gave the flashlight another pass finally movement at the back of the dumpster he brought the beam over took a step in that direction then heard a noisea second movement to his left at the front of the dumpster maybe six feet from him he was turning in that direction and then he was dead john lescroart hardy first law the part two sometime earlier todaytime was routinely meaningless nowgina roake had been with them in dismas hardys office in davids building these men these unlikely avengers she knew where they would be going when the meeting broke up and why now she was back where david had asked her to marry him the most stunning shocking and unexpected moment of all her life she sat straight unmoving at the little rickety table now reduced to its usual state without the linen or china or crystal could that lovely service have been here when was it now that eternity ago she looked at her hands the ring caught her short again and she held her left hand within her right and stared at it while more immeasurable time went by the kitchen was in a round turret that jutted from the corner of the apartment the glass in the curved original windows was probably sixtyfive years old looking through them was a wavy vision through perfect water and now she stared downhill at the impossible world going by as though nothing had changed cars passed at the intersection a block down a couple embraced and kissed against a building a woman pushed a baby stroller up toward her she hadnt dressed for work in several days so she wore blue jeans and tennis shoes a uop sweatshirt a blue band to hold her hair back no makeup of any kind she was rubbing her hands and looked at them again surprised that now suddenly they struck her as the hands of an old woman shed been biting her nails and the weekold red polish was chipped and pathetic she made a fist of her right hand let it go made it again and held it until it hurt old or not she recognized that there was still strength in these hands perhaps the biggest shock was what it had taken her this long to processthat her old friends in hardys office had truly scared her shed been playing with the big boys in her real life for a long time now consoling or lecturing her clients being a goddamned equal to her male friends and lovers kicking ass in the courtroom taking no shit and giving no quarter thats why she was successful thats why david loved her she thought it was who she was but now even that wasnt clear nothing was clear she didnt know who she was who she wanted to be what she wanted to do but beyond everything else was raw rage shed never known anger like this before nor even understood that such a thing could exist the desire to hurt someone was almost a physical pain in her stomach that scared her more than anything her mind returned to the men in hardys office shed known them forever it seemed theyd been colleagues in her life with the law shed clerked for dismas at the das when shed been in law school and hed just been starting out glitsky always a presence even long before the homicide years with his passion for justice for fairness a stickler for procedure but then this morning these people of the law suddenly making common cause with a man like john holiday but holiday dismas and abe were in this all the way together now there could be no doubt of that and good lawyer that she was where did that leave her with them if she didnt believe in the rule of law under all circumstances then what kind of fraud had she been for all these years if it seemed to these men that the law wasnt working as it should to protect them did that give them the right to take it into their own hands when the police didnt exactly move mountains to identify shooters in the various ghettos and barrios did that condone or mitigate even slightly the violent retribution of a victims relatives or friends she didnt think it did no she knew it didnt she knew glitsky and hardy and they felt the same way or always had until today today everything was different and gina now found herself with them these men had become her true allies in this the import of the collective decision as abe had left dizs office had been clear he was going down to make the arrests himself if he couldnt move his own police department to do it for him that was the pretext the subtext was that panos and his gang would not go gently into the night theyd proven themselves not only capable of violence but committed to it as the way they dealt with obstruction and the clock was running so glitsky left without an option had come to his decision he gave lip service to the arrest but she knew without doubt that hed get down to pier early maybe a couple of hours early to avoid an ambushin any event long before the four oclock appointment hed made with gerson and when they showed up hed be prepared to fight quite possibly to kill he had never asked hardy or holiday and certainly not gina to back him up in any way in actual fact hed been adamant on the point expressly reminding them that he was a police officer acting in the line of duty diz holiday anyone else who showed up to help him would in the eyes of the law be vigilantes they must not be part of it to be part of it at all if they lived would ruin them but of course he told them exactly where he was going and when what he planned to do what he believed was going to happen a gust shook the ancient windows then howled away down the street like the passage of the angel of death the howl modulating down to a moan and finally fading to a dirge then silence gina had kept a beretta caliber automatic locked in her desk drawer ever since one of her early cop boyfriends had convinced her that one day shed need it she had often thought to get rid of itlawyers needed to believe that they didnt have to carry gunsbut could never quite make the decision and because it really would have been the height of absurdity to keep a gun she couldnt load or shoot properly she went to the range every few months and fired off a couple of hundred rounds of ammunition to keep herself sharp over the years shed not only become comfortable with her gun and in the process turned into a capable marksman shed come to enjoy the experiencethe smell of powder the deafening noise the awesome kick and power so far removed from the copsandrobbers fantasy shed entertained when shed started she knew now to shoot a highcaliber handgun was to taste death in some ways to embrace the idea of it the thing ruined flesh obliterated bone it snuffed out life instantly as fast she thought nofaster than god could take it the feeling was intoxicating still at davids kitchen table she looked at her hands a last time her ring again caught her eye and suddenly the reality of all shed borne coursed through her body like a current she nearly ran to the front door and outside to the street she had to get to her desk then to her car enough reflection she was who she wasequal in her heart and soul and body to any man and to her allies in particular shed suffered along with them and now belonged with them they were all in this and they would need her she checked her watch and broke into a jog the smartest inspector in the san francisco homicide detail if not on the planet worked solo paul thieu a sixyear veteran was on when the call came in at a little after one in the morning a security guard named matthew creed had not reported back to his liaison at the tenderloin station at the end of his shift and the ensuing search of his route by both city and private patrolmen had turned up his body hed been gunned downtwo shots at very close rangeand lay sprawled by a dumpster not two blocks from union square although the pickins were very slim thieu spent most of the rest of the night at the scene with the crime scene investigation unit he did notice a few potential anomalies that might possibly shed light on elements of the crime there were two concentrations of broken glass where bottles had obviously been brokenone out on stockton across the street and up a few yards from the mouth of the driveway and another at its mouth it wasnt that broken glass rose anywhere to the significance of evidenceit was as common as the dew on many city streetsbut thieu believed in collecting all the data that came his way in the hopes that some of it would acquire relevance he asked the csi team to gather any shards that might be large enough to hold a fingerprint he also had a reasonably defined size twelveandahalf shoe print from a leather or smoothsoled shoe the dumpster had been dripping a stinky gooey miasma and somebody had stepped in it and then onto relatively drier pavement thieu knew that the footprint might not belong to the shooter the scene by the loading dock at the end of the long driveway was a known rendezvous for some of the citys homeless so there was a strong likelihood that the footprint belonged to one of the bums on the other hand thieu was a stickler for precision and theyd done some preliminary blood spatter analysis complete with photosa difficult task in the middle of the night the footprint location was at least consistent with where the shooter must have been standing which was at the front or stockton street corner of the dumpster this was hardly conclusive evidence but it was something he was going to take it he asked the csi team to gather some of the liquid and bag it as evidence he was aided in his work by the fact that the victim was in uniform even if he was only an assistant patrol special creed was in some ways one of them every man and woman on the csi would take all the time thieu wanted if it would help him apprehend a cop killer although they found no casing they also got lucky with one of the two caliber bullets that had passed through the victims body leaving fairly clean small holes in the front and even with two wounds something less than a gaping maw of open flesh in the back this had led thieu to conclude first that the slugs were probably not hollow points and second that therefore theyd be able to find one or even both of the bullets not only was he proved right but they discovered one of the bullet holes in a makeshift bumper someone had mounted against one of the buildings where the loading trucks would otherwise scrape so the nearly perfect slug had passed through some rubber tire material that coated the bumper and lodged in the thick wooden beam beneath it again a slug by itself meant nothing the odds of them finding the gun and matching it both to a person and to that particular bullet and thus having it be any use in actually solving the crime were all but infinitesimal but thieu was glad he had the piece of lead bagged and heading for the evidence locker you just never knew impressions too played a role although in even a more nebulous manner than the other potential evidence but impressions unlike the other stuff were ephemeral thieu was conscientiously typing his up so he wouldnt forget them when gerson came in at sharp thieu had been technically off for two and a half hours but he didnt care he wasnt going to put in for overtime he didnt need the money and he knew that eventually the bean counters who controlled promotion would discover that he solved cases and cost less besides there was nothing hed rather be doing nothing his colleagues had been drifting in for fifteen minutes and the homicide detail was filling with sound and the smell of coffee sarah evans had discovered a female country singer with the same name as her and she had her radio going low thieu tried to work through it all concentrating mightily but it was not to be at least not right then gerson made his way through the room and surprisinglythe two men tolerated each other at beststopped in front of thieus desk waiting until he looked up got a minute paul id appreciate it in my office thanks he turned and headed back this was a first but thieu took it for what it was a simple summons undoubtedly some bureaucratic folderol sighing he pushed back in his chair and stood up he couldnt help but compare the current lieutenant with his old boss glitsky who might have come over to his desk in the same way gerson just had but would have seen he was working intentlyjust possibly on a homicide he was expected to solve abe would have either had the sensitivity to let him alone until he was finished or he would have wanted to know all about what he was working on what if anything hed discovered theyd trade ideas and theories of the case but that wasnt barry gerson who when thieu got to his office was turned away from the door studying columns of numbers on his computer screen he knocked on the wall sir gerson blackened the screen and spun round in his seat motioned to the other chairs i dont want to keep you if you were going home he began no i was finishing up but ive got another half hour what can i do for you gerson wasted no time he pointed in the general direction of his desk i was reading the irincident report on your call last night what youre probably working on out there right now the patrol special matt creed thieu said thats him i think theres a good chance hes part of another case another homicide at thieus unasked question he went on i dont know if youve followed this silverman case at all sure gerson didnt know it but thieu followed every case pawnshop on ofarrell last what thursday night cuneo and russell right you know everything else and you dont know about creed thieu ignored the facetious tone not everything sir in fact nothing but the bare facts but he didnt want to get into oneupmanship with gerson he put on a receptive expression what was creeds involvement he was the only witness to the robbery in progress at silvermans he chased the three suspects for a couple of blocks but lost them then he came back to the pawnshop and found the body all right for the life of him thieu couldnt figure out where this might be going hed let gerson get to it without prompting him though relaxed in his chair an ankle resting on its opposite knee he waited gerson cleared his throat finally went on the thing is cuneo and russell interviewed creed and he pretty much identified the suspects this surprised thieu but he kept his expression neutral pretty much he asked he didnt know what that meant positively by name sir or from a photo spread by name the inspectors havent had time to get photos together but creed narrowed it to a trio of losers in the loin clint terry randy wills john holiday thieu automatically filed the names away in the supercomputer he carried between his ears he was stunned that ninetysix hours after a homicide no one had shown the main witness a photo spread still he waited offering nothing but a civil expectancy my point is that if these two homicides are related maybe committed by the same hand it might be more efficient to assign creed to the same inspectors who are working silverman since theyve got the early jump but i wanted to run it by you first thieu was even more stunned when two homicides seemed to be related inspectors on both cases worked together but he was being pulled off ive got no problem with that sir he said without inflection id be happy to brief them if youd like though there isnt much to talk about but who works the casethats your decision no hard feelings not at all then thieu added a brush at levity its not like my caseload is about to dry up no i dont suppose it is but though thieu in fact didnt really mind passing off the new case he did have a question he would always have a question so your assumption is that these suspects must have somehow found out that creed had identified them and killed him to keep him from testifying gerson grimaced all i know is he was a witness in one case and the victim in another and the other guys have got a head start we might get two birds with one stone is all im thinking he spread his palms wide and stood up efficiency the brass loves it thieu standing himself knew hed been dismissed but wanted to be sure that he and gerson understood one another if youd like he repeated i could stay on awhile this morning to brief them but gerson waved that off thanks but youre into ot now as it is if you finish your writeup that and the ir here ought to be enough to get them started they have specific questions they can always ask you later cuneo wasnt sure that he liked the operating theory of the case the very one thieu had asked about cuneo had correctly identified the exact problem that had concerned thieu while there was an admittedly strong coincidence factor in creed being involved in two homicides within thirtytwo in the past week that very fact didnt compel cuneo to believe that the cases were in fact related it seemed to him that the only way the two had to be related was if the suspects had known that creed had identified them and how could they have known that he and russell and gerson were in the lieutenants office an hour after thieu had gone home and he was twitching his legs to some inner beat as he talked if the two are related thats what had to happen didnt it i mean they had to know creed was a threat right right russell said so they knew thats my point how i cant see him being so dumb what did he do stop by the ark and tell the three guys hed picked em out maybe not but close gerson had no problem with it come on dan look the kids involved in his first real homicide hes the star witness for christs sake hes going to tell somebody hes proud as hell of it right he looked to russell and russell agreed and that somebody told somebody else till it got back to terry hell it took four days as it was thats plenty of time more than enough cuneos legs stopped their jumping all right he said if it sings so good for you both i can run with it but if thats the theory we can settle it once and for all pretty quick russell was right up to speed ballistics he said cuneo gave him a nod weve got the bullet that did silverman too two bullets same gun and weve got connections connections we get a warrant in a heartbeat and go on a treasure hunt after theyd left gersons office russell went over to the homicide computer and emailed the crime lab with the request noted homicideurgent the bullets from both scenes would by now have been filed away in the evidence lockup in the halls basement once the crime lab had physical possession of themand a regular shuttle service ran between the hall and the labthey could do the actual comparison with an electron microscope it shouldnt take more than fifteen minutes with any kind of luck they could get it done today while russell did the computer work cuneo checked their messages and found that roy panos had called early last nighthe had some terrific ers tickets for this weekend that he couldnt use if the guys were interested why didnt they all meet at johns grill down in the heart of thirtytwo have an early lunch pick up their tickets of course the call had been before creeds death so cuneo called roy back to make sure he felt he could handle a social lunch exhaustedhed barely sleptroy still wanted to meet with the inspectors maybe he could give them some thoughts on creed while it was still early enough to do some good if even by inadvertence he knew or had heard anything that might help them in finding out whod killed matt he wanted them to pump him for it finally finally finally cuneo and russell got clear of the hall at five minutes to ten they were parked across the street from the ark waiting for their chance to brace john holiday at last find out where hed been last night as well at a quarter after cuneo got out of the car and banged on the bars door for fifteen or twenty seconds quarter to eleven and russell couldnt endure another moment in the car with his hyperkinetic partner he checked the door to the ark again then walked to the corner and around it to the alley that ran to the back entrance it too was closed there was no light within no sign of any life theyd told roy panos theyd meet him at johns at and ten minutes before that cuneo turned on the ignition and put the car in gear hows the guy make a living he never opens his shop maybe hes not coming in at all russell said maybe hes on the run cuneo looked across pointed a finger at him pulled the imaginary trigger john holidays conquest stories to friends such as dismas hardy had lately been fabrications the truth was that he had fallen in love and didnt want to appear to have been a fool if it didnt work out while cuneo and russell waited for him to show up at the ark he was in michelles wonderful apartmenta modest but extremely wellkept onebedroom unit on the back nontourist straight side of the crookedest street in the world lombard the place was only on the second floor of her building but the street fell off in a cliff so out the picture window she had a million dollar unimpeded view of the bay and the golden gate bridge shed started living in these three rooms while she was in college eighteen years ago and rent control had kept her therein todays san francisco she couldnt have found an unfurnished leanto for what she was paying a freelance writer michelle occasionally published in national magazines and regularly in some of the local neighborhood papers and advertising supplements she also had a couple of very nice steady jobs doing restaurant reviews and these helped bridge the income gap by providing dinners out for her and often a guest the first communication between michelle and holiday had been faceless via email in fact because michelle signed her pieces m maier holiday hadnt even known he was writing to a woman in early summer in an ad rag called the russian hill caller she reviewed a small new place called tapa the bottoma spanish tapas restaurant located at the foot of russian hill michelles food pieces often had a kind of mfk fisher quality where snatches of philosophy cultural history or personal experience would thicken the usual thin broth of menu and decor description and this article had stirred up feelings in holiday that hed suppressed for a long time hed spent his honeymoon with emma on the costa brava in spain at a small fishing village called tossa de mar about forty miles north of barcelona for holiday the very air there at that time had seemed imbued with promise with a sense that everything in his life now was going to work out that the emptiness of his early life was over forever and that short season of hope had been steeped in saffron garlic oregano onions as soon as holiday finished the article hed beelined to tapa the bottom where he felt himself transported by nearly every bite escargots in pepper sauce baby octopus the spanish tortillareally an omelette of onion egg and potatothe crusty bread smeared with tomato and garlic when he got back home flushed with a full bottle of chilled rose he emailed m maier through the caller to express his gratitude for the recommendation he ended by adding without much thought happiness has been a bit elusive for a while but while i was eating there i was happy shed written him back the next day and theyd started corresponding regularly breaking ground eventually since they knew they must be neighbors they agreed to meet michelle showed up in what turned out to be her usual outdoor attire an armynavy coat over loosefitting paramilitary camo garb combat boots and a weird hat one of her misshapen collection of thrift store headwear in her heavy blackrimmed eyeglasses with the hat pulled low and her tousled dark hair falling over her face and wearing no makeup of any kind she had attracted no undue attention holiday had enjoyed the lunch and though michelle was nice enough she wasnt the kind of woman he chose to pursue anymore clearly not a casual person she brimmed with passionthoughts and feelings ideas wit not his type not since emma and certainly not the type hed been taking lately to bed but he kept writing to her she wrote back they had another platonic lunch gradually as their relationship had slowly progressed he began to appreciate her really magnificent beauty longlegged and deepbosomed with a sensuous wide mouth an exotic cast to her eyes and strikingly perfect skin she used the baggy clothes and funky headwear and army camouflage as a form of deception that allowed her mostly to pass through the world unmolested in their early lunches shed always looked barely thrown together it came out that shed been hurt a lot by men liking her only for her looks she told him shed always fantasized about marrying a blind man so that she could be sure he loved the person she was and not just because of as she called it the package the package fostered an odd mix of physical confidence and low selfesteem as holiday moved closer and closer to something resembling a commitment to michelle she had started to trust him less if he let her know that he desired her body too it scared her thats what the other men had wanted so holiday must in some way be like them the irony of thisthat the first person with whom hed tried to be faithful since emma doubted himdid not escape him theyd had their worstever fight about it on thursday night holiday in his cups stormed out of the imperial palace before theyd gotten their pot stickers they hadnt made up until sunday after a friday night about which holiday felt guilty as well he should have it hadnt all been lies to hardy this morning in bed with michelle holiday reclined propped on his elbow looking up from the newspaper he was drawn back to that first meeting with her and had to smile that his initial reaction to this woman had been so neutral at this moment he was entirely smitten with the view of her in stylish reading glasses she wore orchidprint white silk pajamas barely buttoned on top they gapped open as she leaned over to read he reached over and cupped her breast and she moved her hand over his holding him there never stopping her reading he went back to the paper and turned the page some tension must have translated over to her what is it john are you all right his hand had left her breast he read on for another few seconds making sure it confirmed what the headline seemed to promise it did he looked up at her concern etching his features into something very much older he hesitated knowing that his ownership and management of the ark was not her favorite thing about him when hed gotten home from work last night he had started to tell her about clint and panoss people to say nothing of the actual police as usual it hadnt sparked her interest and hed let it drop in favor of her query letters to gourmet sunset and bon appetit to see if any of them would be interested in a story on the glories of grilled fruit hed already told her the story about how hed come to own the ark hed known the owner joey lament pretty well joey was pushing seventy and holiday had had a pocketful of cash from the sale of the pharmacy so they made a deal and the thing never even went on the open market but now like it or not his bar was about to become the topic again somebody killed matt creed he said do you know him yeah i did hes the patrol guy kind of a cop private security and somebody killed him shot him he was picking up details scanning the small article point blank or close enough she pulled some covers up around her shoulders tell me this has nothing to do with you or your bar he said nothing eyes down on the printed page john finally a sigh hes the kid who found silverman it was in the paper saturday the thing they came and talked to clint about what do you mean kid it says here he was twentytwo michelle pulled her blanket more closely around her and got out of the bed she walked over to the picture window and stood before it looking out i dont want to have this in our life if were going to have a life she said people you know getting killed theyre related arent they he sat up his voice defensive it doesnt say that here theres no sign of it but he might as well not have spoken i guess i dont understand why you dont just sell the damn bar or if its really important to you at least fix it up its not that important really it keeps my money working so i dont have to thats all i could sell it today for twice what i paid for it and then retire trying to inject some lightness he added but then what would i do ive got a wild idea what how about something worthwhile a jolt of anger shot through him and he fought to control it i guess i dont remember he said were we having a fight she lowered herself onto the ottoman by her reading chair her head went down so that he couldnt see her face would you be happier if we broke up he asked the last thing i want to do is cause you pain when she looked up she was close to tears you know two people who have been shot to death in the last week do you know how scary that is to someone who loves you and then you sayyou apparently believethat theyre not related to you or each other she shook her head back and forth with great sadness of course they are john of course they are roy panos was buying he insisted he cut into his steak and met the eyes of both inspectors across the table he put a bite of meat into his face then put his utensils down and held up his right hand i swear to god terry was off i stopped in around eight i thought theyd quit paying you guys russell said roy nodded yeah but since silverman i figured it cant hurt to keep up on em am i right youre right cuneo was having petrale with capers and lemon sauce humming as he chewed so holiday worked the night shift last night yep you talk to him russell asked he was having the speciallamb chops with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes said hi when i looked in i bought a coffee he asked me where mattie was creed cuneo put down his fork whyd he ask that roy shrugged cause normally mattie walked the north beat first but last night i took it why russell asked no reason really change of pace he say anything else holiday panos had had a rye on the rocks before lunch now he finished his second glass of wine and started pouring the next he drank some more put the wineglass down twisted the stem of it pensively when he spoke it was almost apologetically i didnt want to spook him i wanted to let you guys get him fresh so you didnt mention anything about creed cuneo asked anything like what like he pointed the finger in their direction roy gave this some more thought i didnt go anywhere near there but now you mention it holiday did say if i talked to mattie would i ask him to stop in he wanted to ask him something the two inspectors exchanged a look suddenly roys heavy eyes lit up with the significance of what hed revealed he wanted to make sure mattie was on didnt he son of a bitch and i told him shit for a moment it looked as though roy would cry russell reached out and patted the table between them it would have been another night thats all its nothing you did the sons of bitches panos repeated and now without matties id dont worry about that cuneo said they made some mistakes last night were close how close he was one of them another cop so the inspectors told him the night before hardy drove twice around the downtown neighborhood and could not find a place to park even quasilegally nearly out of his mind with frustration and worry he had finally given up and driven the extra few blocks to his own office where he had his own spot under the building back up on the street hed run back to the emergency room entrance of st francis memorial hospital where gina roake had stood waiting by the admitting station how is he her face was blotched but she held it now under tight control not good hes been in there for two hours hes still unconscious they wont let me in what happened somebody beat him up dismas id been home an hour and some policemen knocked at the door he had his wallet on him which had his drivers license with the address and he had his wallet was there still money in it i dont know i didnt even she caught hardys shift of focus and turned a young woman in green scrubs had come out into the waiting room roake touched his arm and went to her he followed noting with a sinking heart the grave look on her face weve done all we can for the moment she was saying well be bringing him to the icu where we can keep a close eye on him but how is he gina asked the young doctors eyes quickly went to hardy came back to gina hes taken quite a beating hes got severe head trauma and internal bleeding and he hasnt regained consciousness she took in a deep breath and let it out id have to call his condition critical roake closed her eyes her shoulders seemed to collapse after a short moment she opened her eyes and nodded is there anything at all i can do there wasnt the doctor said she had to go and supervise the transfer to the icu and she went back behind the door to the er without a word roake and hardy sat down next to one another on the waiting room chairs to his surprise hardy realized that they werent alone in the rooma young black woman rocked a baby across the room and stared into empty space in front of her an elderly asian man was reading a newspaper a young person let out an agonizing moan somewhere behind them and sirens cried somewhere close in the night after a minute an orderly came out holding a large plastic sack he looked around and came over to them are you with mr freeman ive got some of his personal effects that you might want to take roake reached out for the bag and for the first time hardy noticed the ringtwice the size of frannies diamond newly mounted and bright she opened the bag and looked inside then closed it back up his good suit she said as though to herself i bought it for him turning to hardy her lip quivered for an instant she bit down on it how could this happen she asked who could have done this to him after a sleepless night hardys first stop at a little after am this morning had been the hospital again it was still long before visiting hours and though he believed he had no chance to get in and see freeman he knew hed get more information talking to a human being than to a voice on the telephone sure enough at the nurses station he had learned that freemans condition was unchanged from the night before but that at least there had been no deterioration he was no more critical than hed been armed with that news he walked down the hallway and looked in on the icu waiting room where the nurse had told him another of freemans visitors had spent the night roake clearly hadnt spent it sleeping either alone in the room at this time of the morning shed aged five years in the past six hours her eyes were heavy redrimmed her hair all over the place as hardy got to the door she was running her hands through it as though trying to still the ravages of a severe headache seeing him she stood and walked over put her arms around his neck and sagged for an instant he saw the plastic bag that held freemans suit on the floor next to the couch where roake had been sittingshe really hadnt gone home after theyd sat hardy delivered the latest prognosis in the best possible light then asked if he could do something for her drive her home anything her first reaction was to shake her head as though she didnt understand the question a random syllable escaped stopped again she ran a hand through her hair again squeezed at her temples i suppose ive got to get to my clients i know theres something this morning but but thats not you is it id better leave a message for betsy she looked out beyond hardy its morning already isnt it getting there hardy said you ought to go home and get some sleep gina it was hard advice but she had to hear it nothings happening here the nurse told me this could go on for a while i know then again i know i just wanted to stay i thought he waited but no further words came i can drive you to davids now he said you get a little sleep call your office when they open if they need you here you can be back in five minutes hows that sound she was perfectly immobile for half a minute or more then finally let out a heavy breath reached for the plastic bag stood up youre right you talked me into it fifteen minutes later he couldnt believe the amount of legal curb that was available just around the corner from the hall of justice then he remembered of course the time but hed wanted to get down here if he could while someone from the night shift might still be in the building miraculously he was talking to inspector hector blanca within ten minutes blanca was a darkskinned hispanic sergeant with the general work detail and hed pulled the call on the freeman beating it was not only fresh in his mind he was reviewing the incident report written by the patrolman who found freeman as hardy got to his desk after the introductions and hardys reassurance that he was a friend of abe glitsky and used to be a cop himself that he wasnt some ambulancechasing dick of an attorney looking to make trouble blanca must have decided it was okay to talk so this man freeman he was your partner technically david wasnt but hardy didnt think it mattered i hope he still is the sergeant grimaced sorry i didnt mean that whats the word at the hospital hardy told him but hed come to blanca to get information not give it his fiancee gina roake told me he still had his wallet thats how you guys knew to come to his house thats right beat him near to death but didnt take his wallet his watch nothing was there money in it blanca tried to keep his face neutral but it wanted to react six hundred fourteen dollars right there in the regular section hardy sat with that a minute so it wasnt any kind of robbery you saw him what was it about ive got no idea it was about as brutal as ive seen he fucking somebodys wife anything like that no hardy said what i mean is maybe if it was personal yeah i know i cant think of anything he stopped what blanca asked i just thought about this pretty ugly lawsuit were working on but ive never seen anything like that before and ive been practicing twenty years blanca gave him another chance you sure ill grab at anything but after another minute with it hardy shook his head no couldnt be all right but whatever it was let me tell you this was deliberate damage boots and blunt objects not just fists hardy didnt want to think about freeman lying helpless curled on himself as a group of vicious assailants worked him over so there was more than one guy a shrug i cant say for sure but id bet on it he drummed his ringers on his typewriter keys then met hardys eye i guess theres no nice way to put it sir whoever it was these guys left him for dead but took nothing he shook his head nothing obvious at least so whats that leave blanca frowned in concentration it leaves the whole universe to tell you the truth people nowadays you wouldnt believe how many are just nuts i bet i would you think it was just some kind of rage it looked like that but who knows it might have been just for the thrill something seemed to nag at him an old guy like this though it doesnt make any sense not that it has to tell you what ill do ill pull some other reports from the general vicinity maybe come up with something similar mo something thanks hardy said id appreciate it okay hardy told himself hed done his little bit with detective work and without any conclusive results but the real reason the hospital and the hall had had to come first and early this wednesday morning was because he had to get to his office freeman amp associates kept formal hours from to like most law firms f ampa expected its associates to bill two thousand hours every year with a twoweek vacation that computed to forty billable hours every single week even weeks where there was a holiday or two working at perfect efficiency the best attorneys could perhaps get all their administrative and other unbillable work such as lunch for example done in two hours every day this meant that if they did not doublebillif discovered a firing offense at freemansassociates averaged about ten hours at their desks every single day often working weekends to make up for holidays or the rare day off when they needed to bill but the office was closed the awesome burden of billing two thousand hours was perhaps the main reason hardy had never joined freemans or any other firm not that he didnt work round the clock and then some when he needed to but at least in theorythough meeting his monthly nut kept it from being his common practicehe could make his own decision to put in fewer hours and therefore make less money this wasnt an option for freemans fulltime associates but since it was the norm everywhere else what were they going to do so although it was still a few minutes short of am when hardy walked up the stairway and entered the lobby the place wasnt deserted but the somber tone was decidedly unusual word must have gotten out at the receptionists desk although phyllis wasnt in yet they had the radio tuned to the allnews station a group of maybe ten associates stood around listening murmuring hardy knew three of them quite wellamy wu jon ingalls and graham russoand russo broke from the knot when he saw hardy all the other eyes followed him do you know anything about david he asked amy heard the end of something in her car but russo and everyone else could tell from hardys expression that what wu had heard was both true and bad the knot coalesced around him and hardy gave them the very short version and answered as many questions as he could while he was in the middle of one of them phyllis came up the stairs behind himher usual grimlipped uptight self she stood behind hardy for a moment clearly perplexed at the gathering hardy stopped midsentence and cued by his audience turned whats the matter she asked what is this about davids in the hospital hardy said simply somebody beat him what do you mean beat him hes not in trial not that kind of beat somebody mugged him beat him up for a long moment she still appeared not to comprehend finally she backed up a step and put a hand over her heart why i mean is he all right i was just telling the folks here its bad hes unconscious phyllis looked down to freemans office door as though she expected him to appear from behind it one of the associates yelled from back at reception here it is here it is and as a body the mass of people turned and fell silent flamboyant and famous attorneys in the city was found beaten last night a few blocks from his home police have no known motive yet in the brutal attack which has left mr freeman in critical condition at st francis memorial hospital robbery doesnt seem to have been a factor although police are refusing hardy and the rest of the associates all missed the rest of the report at the word critical phyllis had uttered a small cry and crumpled to the ground in his office hardy had three voice mails from jeff elliot his friend and the writer of the citytalk daily column for the chronicle they shared the basic information that each had independently gathered then elliot asked so where does this leave you you mean me personally or the firm here both well hes the rainmaker here so people are freaked if hes even out for a couple of weeks the work dries up phyllis fainted you know hed just asked gina to marry him a short silence elliot hardy knew trying to digest it whatd she say she said yes he gave her a ring another pause was she seeing anybody else whod want to kill david and thereby eliminate the competition i dont think so she was at the hospital all night still i think its a dry well jeff but you can ask her if you want elliot seemed to accept that so how are you doing im worried unconscious isnt good theyre saying critical and the nurse this morning wasnt what youd call optimistic blancayou know blancahe seemed to think that whoever did it meant to hurt him bad at least what for no theories not robbery unless he was carrying something unusual with him which he never did but not his wallet not his watcha rolex by the way so what do you think im totally stumped at the moment im tempted to think it might even have been random easy target cheap thrills its been known to happen hey im getting another call you want to wait no thanks im crankin here i hear anything ill let you know dismas hardy he said punching into his call waiting diz dick kroll i just heard about david my god yeah i dont know whats happening yet did we have a depo today we do dont we hardy brought his hand to his forehead squeezed his temples kroll was sympathetic we can put that off as long as you need the important thing now is david hows it look for the hundredth time hardy ran down what he knew answered the same questions no robbery no motive no clues a senseless beating of an old and defenseless gentleman when he finished the line hummed open for a long beat i dont know what to say diz im in shock really is there anything i can do hardy gave it an instants thought maybe see if any of your clients men noticed or heard something or will it wasnt one of wades beats though was it i dont know where did it happen exactly two blocks north of here right around the corner actually no then thirtytwo ends down at post hardy kept on it was his usual route home which he always walked because he was bullet proof jesus what hardy blew out nothing i just remembered i offered to drive him he swore dont blame yourself it wasnt anything you did kroll cleared his throat so listen i dont want to add to your troubles today why dont you dig out call me when you want to start up on these depos again im assuming if davids out youll be taking the lead its too early dick okay i dont want to go there yet fine fine ill wait till you call me meanwhile is there anything else i can do anything at all i cant think of anything but thanks ill pray for him how about that hardy hadnt ever considered kroll much of a religious mancertainly he was an unscrupulous attorney and dirty fighter but you never knew couldnt hurt he said thanks yet another call was coming in on the heels of the last he looked at his watchthe regular workday still wouldnt begin for seven minutes and hed already been going for two hours he punched the button on his phone stifled a weary sigh dismas hardy he said it was the first time hardy had been to glitskys new domain on the fifth floor the lieutenant was leaning over a computer terminal in a claustrophobic room occupied by two women one of them with an enormous girth glitsky was saying something to her about the new software they should be getting sometime in the next decade that would do it all faster and better hardy in low enough spirits already found the moment nearly unbearably sad perhaps sensing a shadow behind him glitsky stopped in midsentence straightened up and turned around quickly everything from his stance to his fierce glare announced his readiness to fight whoever it might be when he saw it was hardy something went out of him for an instant he seemed almost disappointed but immediately the expression shifted to concern you all right he asked is everybody all right by this he meant of course their families hardy showing up unannounced in the middle of a wednesday afternoon looking shellshocked and drawn set off every alarm in glitskys head hardys reply didnt ease his mind got a minute excusing himself to his staff he led his friend to the next office and closed the door behind them what you havent heard about david glitsky read his friends face and his gaze went flat dont tell me hes dead not yet but it doesnt look good the telling took less than a minute during which glitsky took a seat behind his desk hardy remained standing drained hands in his pockets ive just come from the hospital again ginas back down there too glitsky slouched in his chair ringers templed at his lips hardy was rambling on i dont even know why im here to tell you the truth i answered calls all morning at the office but the thought of work he shrugged sorry to just barge in if memory serves glitsky said ive done it to you a few times but the usual banter couldnt find a toehold and the two men filled the space managing their silent emotions finally hardy pulled a chair around and sat heavily i really dont know why im here he repeated glitsky let another minute pass he was walking home thats it hardy nodded he was wrestling with something and finally came out with it i almost told blanca i thought it was panos at this glitskys eyes sharpened he stirred in his chair do you he shook his head i cant see it kroll called me up this morning as soon as he heard he seemed genuinely upset and that rules out panos that he didnt inform his lawyer i wouldnt tell my lawyer if i was planning to beat up or kill somebody not before not after but what was david to panos i know youve got that lawsuit but just keep repeating thirty million dollars abe and everything will become clear if we win all the way large say its not impossible panos is on the street talking about specifics somehow took hardys mind off the big picture and he too became more animated kroll offered david four the other day to settle four million whatd the old man say he laughed at him kroll then got huffy and said he was going to go around david and talk to me directly i guess on the theory that im a wuss and id cave david said he was welcome to try but id probably just send it back to him which was true anyway kroll got a little mad and told him hed better watch out for what maybe for what happened glitsky cocked his head you really think that im not really thinking anything yet abe were talking boots and clubs maybe nightsticks your average street banger doesnt have a sap but you said maybe nightsticks true but were also talking downtown unless youre walking around with lumber youre not going to find a club lying on the street are you maybe a tire iron or the butt of a gun hardy shook his head disagreeing a couple of whacks on the head with a tire iron and youre dead directly wouldnt you think maybe a gun though so what are you saying its coming to me as were talking so im not sure whoever did it didnt come to rob him they showed up carrying heavy tools and ambushed him the phone rang twice the answering machine picked up with its warm and sunny greeting glitsky payroll leave a message some sergeant left his number and asked if he could get a call back about his accumulated comp time neither glitsky nor hardy acknowledged the interruption as soon as the sergeant had rung off hardy continued you might as well know the other thing that happened yesterday both blanca and jeff elliot thought it might have something to do with it but i just came from talking to gina and it doesnt okay what he told glitsky about the engagement the ring the remote question about ginas possible involvement with another man anyway i asked i dont know whether it set our friendship back two years or if she was flattered that i could think she was somehow keeping a stable of men on the side but either way she wasnt lying enough for me anyway id take that so there we are suddenly he found he had talked it all out and again it left him exhausted and so what huh nobodys even looking glitsky almost said that if freeman came to he would be able to tell them what happened if he died the case would go to homicide and maybe paul thieu would get it and discover something but he realized this wouldnt be a consoling thought and if anybody else besides thieu picked up a case like this an old man who lingered no clues it would remain a mystery forever so he shrugged blancas okay he said maybe hell get something yeah hardy dragged his old bones up and stood well the phone rang again glitsky glared at it then got up himself making no move to answer it he was coming around to let hardy out when he heard the voice of marcel lanier he stopped and picked up the receiver talk to me he said hardy was at the door and raised a hand in silent farewell glitsky listening with one ear snapped his ringers got his attention waved him back in yeah im here he said into the mouthpiece he listened intently for almost a full minute then said i appreciate it marcel thanks hardy stood right at the door what was that about glitsky raised a hand and settled a haunch on the corner of his desk his face hardened in concentration hardy couldnt take it what for christs sake glitsky expelled a lot of air one of panoss guys got shot last night the kid who found silverman creed matt creed you knew him i only met him once monday night a couple of hours after i left you in fact but he made an impression remember i told my dad it was a bad idea to go to silvermans when nobody in homicide called him back hardy nodded sure well he went that night anyway and i had to pull him out creed was there doing what just walking the beat he saw the light and stopped then i showed up we had a little party together but a nice kid and somebody shot him glitskys head dropped came back up last night on the beat he paused to let hardy digest it marcel was just talking to paul thieu and heard about the connection to panos he thought id want to know whys that we had a talk about wade recently marcel and i i thought maybe he could pass a message along to gerson save him some trouble a shrug turns out he couldnt what was the message that maybe panos wasnt the guy to help out homicide on silverman or anything else for that matter and hed been doing that trying hed given them some names among them your friend holiday who creed originally idd as one of the guys who broke into silvermans by the way well thats wrong john had glitsky held up a hand relax creed changed his mind no id he was calling the case inspectors and letting them know did he i dont know id assume so besides what does it matter you said holiday has an alibi and youd never lie for a client hardy declined to comment found his chair and was sitting again finally he said suddenly im willing to believe that panos had something to do with david glitsky nodded slowly the professional cop in him less than completely willing to commit it does invite inquiry so how do we do it do what inquire glitsky scratched his cheek you might profitably mention something to blanca maybe something got left at the scene davids but this could be nothing just a coincidence theoretically i agree with you ill keep it in mind just so were on the same page and also so youre clear im not going anywhere near it the latest poll results are in and the consensus is its not my job san franciscos crime lab one of several buildings in a facility that had originally been built by the navy had recently been refurbished and was now pretty much state of the art the facility also housed the ttf unit or tac squad and served as the pds armored car lot although its location in hunters point was as far from desirable as possible the ancient hamburger stand called dago marys just outside the compound made it something of a destination for the law enforcement community russell and cuneo had finished their lunch with roy at johns grill then theyd gone back to the ark pounded on the doors again sat outside for most of another useless hour apparently the place wasnt opening today at least not before nighttime finally cuneo gave up on the stakeout and theyd driven to the marina district to holidays address where several newspapers in the doorway argued that hed been away for a while russell couldnt pass dago marys without a pit stop hell they were right here anyway russell argued it wouldnt take fifteen minutes they would have plenty of time to pick up their ballistics results from the lab and roll back uptown on the undoubtedly related creedsilverman murders get some warrants kick ass by the time they got past the guard tower parked and arrived at the labs reception theyd burned fifteen more minutes a small room with a desk phone and computer enclosed on their side with glass blocked any view of the lab itself within when the inspectors entered the lobby area there was no one at the desk they waited awhile in the hopes that a body would appear cuneo craned his neck trying to be seen he sang out a strong hello here we go russell said there was a button next to the door that led inside and he pressed it silence maybe it rings inside he pressed and held it this time hey hey enough with the bell were coming the door finally opened to reveal a small pale middleaged man in dockers and a buttondown plaid shirt a wash of wispy dark hair fell sideways across his forehead if hed had the right mustache he would have been a ringer for hitler the plastic name tag over his left pocket read m lester and mr lester was frowning keep your shirts on boys whats the problem cuneo pointed at the reception desk nobody seems to be minding the fort is all yeah well sherrys out today sorry well cuneo said were here for some ballistics results homicide my partner here russell he marked it urgent the frown grew more pronounced as lester turned to russell i emailed you about that i never got it the man persisted i sent it off as soon as i got yours couldnt have been five minutes later i still didnt get it russell said what was it about your evidence i asked if you could pick it up while you were still at the hall and bring it down here were getting killed by the flu half the staff is out sick we got nobody to drive the shuttle even cuneo drew a breath kept an exaggerated calm in his voice and so because my partner had marked his email homicideurgent and you didnt hear back from him you called a patrol car or got a messenger to bring this critical evidence down to your lab so that wed have our ballistics results in time perhaps to save a life or two or at least get some scumbags off the streets thats what you did right tell me thats what you did in spite of the strikeout on ballistics cuneo reminded russell that for all their efforts they still needed to talk to john holiday he might have come in to the ark since theyd last been there and cuneo voted that they go back for the third time that day and try again theres no way dan hes gone i dont think so why not he doesnt come to work his apartments deserted he knows weve put him with terry and wills on silverman if it were me id be long gone except that if you recall roy panos said he talked to him last night stopped by the ark and there he was working behind the bar nothings changed between last night and today except creed got shot not exactly nothing cuneo glanced across the seat agreed but if holiday was bartending and roy says he was then he didnt do creed did he he knows were not after him for that so no way does it get him to run if silverman didnt this shut russell up for a half block or so dont get me wrong he finally said im itching to drive back uptown and talk to him but if we dont have ballistics what are we talking to him about especially if he wasnt any part of creed i never said he wasnt any part of it he just didnt pull the trigger but that still leaves terry and wills in which case terrys the shooter both times we might mention some chance of immunity for holiday if hell give them up see if he bites if hes there even if hes not well learn something maybe get another chance to talk to terry and if he is were his friends thats the ticket cuneo said give him a chance randy wills checked his lipstick in the bathroom of his apartment hed bathed and shaved all over less than an hour ago looking down he smoothed the front of his skirt then came back to the mirror luckily hed never had a heavy beard and now a close shave and makeup base gave him the smooth cheeks of a very pretty woman with luminous eyes a delicate nose and jawline he wore a luxuriant naturallooking chestnut wig a black turtleneck covered his adams applethe only giveaway that he wasnt what he seemed outside it was coming to dusk the back window in the bedroom let in a thin lateafternoon light and he looked around the room and then into the front roomsthe kitchen and living roomwith something approaching real contentment he and clint lived in a streetlevel apartment on jones less than a quarter mile from the ark it didnt look like much from the outside but theyd turned it into a nice homethe best place randy had lived in since hed left new mexico at sixteen when randy got to the ark he struck a momentary pose in the doorwayhip cocked breasts thrust out clint was behind the bar of course talking to a couple of customers and he looked up without any sign of recognition at all only a friendly nod as if randy were just another customer could it be he didnt recognize him at all was he that beautiful tonight taking a stool next to one of the customers he crossed his legs and arranged himself at the bar hello clint randy said id like a vodka gimlet please clints customer a puffyfaced man was staring at him the other man black leaned over the bar whos your friend clint randy smiled all around and made some eye contact he offered his hand to the closer man im randy wills he said in his most feminine voice randy with an i then to the other man hello hed get a rise out of clint yet he thought but clint simply looked down shaking his head surprisingly the puffyfaced man didnt take his extended hand instead he proffered a badge introduced himself and his partner clint reached across the bar and put his big hand over randys im sorry he said they just got here theyre looking for john why randy turned to the inspectors what did he do we want to talk to him russell said we understand he was working here last night thats right terry said but youre here tonight for another hour or two then john comes on tonight cuneo asked i understood he worked mostly days though mostly i guess youre right but it varies were pretty flexible here really good for you russell said so you werent here last night then no i already told you we cuneo butted in thats right you did he turned to randy we were just talking to clint here about what he did last night id like to ask you the same thing what you did clint started to say something to him but russell leaned in one ringer extended in warning uhuhuh no hints what i did randy checked with clint who nodded almost imperceptibly when last night thats right last night cuneo said eyes over the bar i was with clint why well get to why russell said just now wed like to know how you spent your night last night unless theres some reason youd rather not tell us no nothing like that why would there be another look at clint well early we had dinner at home then we went to finocchios for the show he said we were there together i used to work there into their stony silence he added im a dancer well used to be cuneo said that was pretty good he turned to his partner theyve got some code russell jumped right in you talk to anybody at finocchios while you were there what time was that by the way i dont know what time clint eleven twelve somewhere in there no hints cuneo repeated my partner asked if you talked to anybody i suppose the waiter he might remember uhhuh and what time did you get there i really dont know exactly i dont remember later than ten maybe it seems like it why what happened last night what happened last night he asks cuneo said to russell back to randy as if its news to you a patrol special named matt creed got shot dead about three blocks from here shocked and appalled terry put his hand to his heart not matt he said cuneo pointed a ringer at him spare me that shit he threw an ugly look at his partner tapped twice on the bar obviously reining himself in after a minute more still righting himself he picked up a glass from the gutter and spun it finally he whirled on randy so im asking you again tell me what you did last night i told you we ate and then went to a show and you were there until what time cuneo pressed where suddenly cuneo grabbed a glass from the bars gutter and flung it at the bottles behind the bar where everything exploded in a spray of glass and noise you want to fuck around you fucking queen you want to fuck around with me ill show you fuck around but russell was up next to cuneo ready to restrain him if he took it any further terry had ducked then backed away and now hed come back forward his hands shaking on the bar really inspectors really we didnt do anything we didnt do anything for a long dead moment there was nothing but the sound of labored breathing in the bar then russell leaned over and punched a finger into clint terrys chest this isnt close to over he said dont leave town stay where we can find you he turned to cuneo lets get out of here before somebody gets hurt the inspectors killed an hour at the building housing the tenderloin task force talking to the patrol special liaison to see if any information had surfaced on the beat or with any of the regular patrol cops during the day nothing then calmed slightly and primed to finally get a word with john holiday they came back yet again to the ark it was full dark outside and the place had six paying customers terry and wills were gone and a man fitting the description of holiday was behind the bar before theyd even sat he had napkins down in front of them good evening inspectors he said they hadnt even started and he was ahead of them whatre you drinking were not cuneo said he put his badge on the bar and sat on his stool wed like you to answer a couple of questions sure he said then smiled give me just a minute though would you he walked down the bar had a word with a customer and pulled a bottle of beer out of the refrigerator after hed opened and poured it he was back in front of the inspectors its bad luck in the bar business to let your customers get thirsty another smile you sure you dont want anything its on me cuneo had gotten himself seated the ringers of both hands were already tattooing the bar enjoying yourself arent you a nod every minute inspector lifes short enough and this isnt dress rehearsal now what did you say i could do for you fellows you can answer some questions russell said like where were you last thursday night holiday clucked as though he were sorely disappointed oh that kind of question this is about a crime isnt it you know what its about cuneo snapped actually im not sure holiday said i was working here last night when matt creed got shot so its not for that but if its about any crime at all im sorry but i cant help you last thursday night russell said again darn holiday said its sad too because i know the answer to that one and i think youd like it but my lawyer told me hed kill me if i answered questions from you guys about any crimes without calling him first so you talked to your lawyer russell said whyd you do that holiday had his smile stuck in place were close friends he said we talk all the time hes a great guy really dismas hardy you know him and he told you not to talk to us cuneo asked why was that i had some legal troubles a while ago he just found it a better policy your lawyers not there some policemen take advantage you wouldnt believe so call him cuneo said tell him to come down i would but its date night he and his wife they go out every wednesday he says its the secret to his happy marriage it wouldnt do any good anywayif he came downhe wouldnt let me talk to you hes really strict about it how much money did you lose at silvermans cuneo asked holiday sighed cant say question oops look at that another customer with an empty glass back in a new york minute dont go away holiday went down the bar again took two drink orders as he was pouring the second the inspectors filed past him on their way out nice talking to you he called after them have a nice night john lescroart hardy first law the date night might have been the key to the hardys marriage but they werent having a happy one it had started naturally with another stop at the hospital hardy hadnt wanted to go againit would be his third visit there todaybut frannie insisted that she wanted to see david before shed seen the damage she had some sense that in some way she could help make him more comfortable maybe bring him cookies tomorrow something shed heard the word unconscious of course but the concept and reality of deep coma hadnt yet struck home she confessed this forty minutes later to her husband before shed even gotten her glass of wine while she was silently crying in their back corner booth at fior ditalia i couldnt even see him really ive never seen anybody so bandaged his whole face her eyes pleaded with him as though somehow hoping he could make any part of it better hardy knew that she was trying to find a place to order her impressions but theyd assaulted her too violently for that he put his hand over hers on the table she just needed to talk it didnt even happen to me and i feel so violated she said i dont know how this kind of thing can even happen thats almost exactly what gina said and poor gina and after the whole wedding she stopped while the sensitive waiter delivering their drinks averted his own eyes from her hardy had ordered pellegrino the waiter took their meager ordersthey were splitting the antipasto and then a plate of carbonara sensing that it wasnt the night either for a sales pitch on the special or for glib he retreated no appetite hardy said except for maybe killing whoever did that to david you think that would help i dont see how it could hurt hardy wasnt speaking ironically he had no humor left in him with his jaw set staring fixedly ahead he slowly turned his glass of water in the circle of its condensation sons of bitches he said if they think this is going to soften me up theyre making the biggest mistake of their lives who is i thought nobody knew anything about who did this nobody does so whos trying to soften you up clearly hed let slip something hed have preferred to hold close his mouth twisted in a slight grimace frannie knew his looks and in his rage he was very close to losing control dismas he picked up his glass and drank it all off i dont even know how to find out find out what how to prove it he hung his head in disgust i should just go shake their tree that is definitely not a good idea if they did this to david and of course thats what theyre counting on everybodys scared and nobody does anything she leaned in toward him do you really think you know who did this ive got some idea i might be wrong but i bet im not well then tell the police i know theyll look they know you uhuh you and i may remember me as the cop i once was or the hardhitting prosecutor i became but thats all ancient history now im a defense attorney im not on their side anymore theres no side whoever beat up david but he was shaking his head according to the cops best guess whoever beat up david is probably either a bunch of kids or a wellcoordinated band of random muggers neither of whom stole anything do either of those theories make even the tiniest bit of sense to you no which leaves what somebody with a reason exactly somebody who stands to lose thirty million dollars if david takes him to court for example the man in your lawsuit whats his name wade panos good guy private cop pillar of the community hes not beating people up dismas that doesnt make any sense either he doesnt have to do it himself frannie hes got people so were back to where we were tell the police hardy calmed himself with a deep breath no now were back to where we were im a defense attorney what does that mean it means you susie citizen can have something bad happen and you go to the cops and give them some reasons why your suspects might have done it and theyll listen to you with something like an open mind whereas i defense cretin that i am i say something and first its got to make it through the prism of doubt and especially when im accusing somebody whos facing me in court you knowing me as the caring human being that i am possibly cant see that in reality every word out of my mouth is a selfserving lie and every act of kindness is a cynical manipulation i think youre exaggerating not by much abe doesnt see you that way maybe not all the time but youll recall weve had our bad days and even with abe its always been over this same issue this inherent lack of credibility when i walk in the door first its whats my agenda what am i really doing the idea that ive got something to give them for free that might help in some way just never occurs to them and they wouldnt believe it if it did and besides abes not really a cop anymore she frowned at that characterization i bet hed help you with this if you asked its funny you should say that because just this afternoon i did and he didnt the frown grew deeper what did you say exactly maybe he didnt realize it was personal hardy raised his shoulders an inch he knew it was david thats close enough he knows the lawsuit is my case now hes even the one who got me really considering panos well thats helping you okay as far as that goes but hes not intervening with any other cops ill tell you that it was loud and clear not his job frannie was swirling her own glass so whos investigating what happened to david have you talked to him surprised hardy sat back in his chair for a moment sometimes the obvious solutions could be the most elusive everything hed told frannie about the police prejudice against defense attorneys was absolutely true but just that morning hed actually encountered a great deal of cooperation from hector blanca maybe the general work inspector would be the exception that proved the rule in their conversation back then hardy hadnt even mentioned panos in the freeman context because it had been the barest wild notion on his part with nothing to support it but since then hed learned about matt creed and his undeniable connection to the patrol special it wasnt much but if blanca in fact wanted to find davids assailantsnot a sure bet by any meanshardy thought that with suitable upfront disclaimers he might get him to listen what frannie asked what are you thinking just that sometimes youre a genius youre right freemans guyhis names blancahe might look why wouldnt he dismas its his job isnt it yep hardy said sure is and guess what its still his job whether he does it or not what does that mean well it means hes got a guy beating his neighbor up lets say or theres a fight in a bar both cases and most of his other cases hes got a victim and a suspect whos got a motive with an apparently random mugging case like freeman and leaving me and my ideas out of it the odds are good to great that theyll never no matter what get to base one about who actually did it so every minute blanca spends looking is potentially a pure waste of his time frannie stared disconsolately at the tablecloth between them and even if they find him it doesnt help david does it at the truth of that the futility of the entire discussion hardy blew out heavily the waiter returned with their plates to a silent table picking up the mood he said nothing as he checked the basket of bread and placed the antipasto platter between themolives red and yellow roasted peppers anchovies salami caponata the restaurant was one of their favorite places and the antipasto a longstanding traditional beginning to their meals here but neither hardy nor frannie reached for a bite after a minute or so frannie sighed and took a tiny sip of her wine it seems a shame to come to a great place like this and not want to eat should we just pack it up and go home but they didnt get to go straight home theyd found a parking place three blocks straight up the hill in a dark stretch of union street above grant the wind was cutting into them even huddled together and they leaned into it as they walked neither really looked up or paid much attention until they came up near their space hardy drove a fiveyearold honda on which he had long ago disconnected the alarm since alarms only went off by mistake anyway never to alert you of anything but this time it might have been worth having the front windshield had been completely and thoroughly smashed there were four or five obvious impact pointstwo of them had pierced the safety glass the rest of the window was a network of weblike fissureswhite lines in the distant dim light from washington square down the street oh god frannie said her hand over her mouth hardy didnt hear her he was caught up in his own reaction a veritable flash flood of unleashed obscenity spinning all the way round in frustration and anger he whirled again and threw a vicious backhand fist up against the windshield spraying more glass inside the car and onto the street another spasm of swearing overtook him as he was cupping his bleeding hand against himself and again he lashed out at the windshield the immediate anger spent now he leaned heavily with his one good hand on the cars hood ragged and desperate gasps punctuated by staccato exhalations frannie had found that shed backed herself against a building shivering in her heavy coat she couldnt have said whether it was the biting wind or the chill of fear her husbands reaction struck her as more upsetting and in some ways almost worse than the vandalism itself the violence and obscenity so unlike him under normal circumstances something like thisa car window smashed would make dismas mad of course hed be scathing in his wrath for a while and probably funny about it but that was nothing like this nothing close to how shed just seen him whatever this was it had rocked dismas to his core coming forward tentatively she reached out and touched the windshield brieflyit crinkled almost like cellophane as some glass chipped off onto the dashboard inside involuntarily she backed away a step another one dismas what is this his face was as grim as his words this he said is a warning against what me the lawsuit she didnt know what to say to that he was obviously reeling from david of course that would occur to him but she didnt think there was any way he could be certain but this was no time to argue or even discuss he was too wrought up and obviously in pain moving close next to him she put a hand on his back is your hand all right it was frannie who took control getting the passenger door for her husband helping him inside eventually they were both inside the car against the wind they turned on the engine for the eventual heat to kick in now her husband sat beside her unspeaking cradling his injured left hand she finally ventured a suggestion we ought to call the police it didnt call for a reply and none came frannie got out the cell and reported their problem and location then called her brother at home to ask if hed like to come and get them all the while hardy sat ramrod straight well back in the passengers seat he stared straight ahead through the kaleidoscope of broken glass since they were patrolling in north beach anyway the squad car got there in under ten minutes by the time hardy saw the redandblue lights turn up at the corner he felt he could face another human talk with some semblance of reason he and frannie opened their doors and were standing out in the street as the two uniformed officersreyas and simms from their name tags he turned and watched them walk away it was obvious enough what had happened and the officers took their statements with professionalism and even sympathy while simms went back to his car to call the towing service reyas began walking around the car with his flashlight he hadnt gotten very far when he stopped and leaned over for a closer look at the hood this looks like blood here he said it is hardy said its mine i lost my temper and popped the windshield he held up his hand not my finest hour he added or my smartest reyas nodded shifted his attention to frannie mrs hardy he asked you two havent been fighting have you the question surprised her and instinctively she threw a look at hardy before coming back to reyas no sir we were just coming back from dinner as we said at fior ditalia he appeared to be considering something coming back around the front of the car again he sprayed his beam over them both mrs hardy he said would you mind accompanying me for a minute over to the squad car again she looked at hardy and though not happy about this development he nodded once its okay he turned and watched them walk away hardy knew what was happening here officer reyas wanted to get frannie alone so she could answer a question or two without interference or coercion from her husband he also wanted some better lightthe squad car was parked directly under a streetlampwhere he could observe her more closely to see if she had any visible bruises if it seemed that the broken windshield was really part of a violent domestic disturbance hardy knew theyd handcuff him and take him downtown as well they should he thought but they wouldnt find anything to indicate that his hand was throbbing now looking down trying to make it into a fist he realized that he might have broken a bone in his little finger the blood had mostly dried by now but even with the cold the swelling was substantial the pain and this inconvenience to him and to frannie struck him as being a twopronged and just sentence for having been such an idiot a fierce and quite deadly calm settled upon him he knew without any doubt what this had been here tonight it was part of david and perhaps part of creed his earlier explosion was the wrong use for his really unprecedented anger the calm would serve better he looked again across the street reyas and simms were both talking to frannie and fortunately hardy thought his fiery redheaded wife was keeping her own famous temper in check after perhaps three minutes both policemen escorted her back to where he waited frannie had evidently explained to them that moses was on his way to pick them up but they werent done yet simms had a notepad out mr hardy your wife tells us youve got some suspicion of who might have done this hardy struggled for a genial tone some he said im suing somebody if i win and i will theyre out of business you want to give us a name i could but it wouldnt do you any good he wouldnt have done this himself hed have sent one of his men he drew a breath to maintain his control and there wont be any evidence here they wouldnt have touched anything the windshield looks like your traditional blunt object he indicated the car you can see where they hit it yes sir simms said but if you want us to include anything specific in our report now is the time as you say theres a chance we wont get anywhere with an actual investigation on this incident but it would be good to have a name if something else happens later you call us and say this is the second time and somebodys going to wonder why you didnt report the first one what do you mean if something else happens frannie asked the two cops looked at each other surely this was clear enough but hardy saved them from having to answer nothings going to happen he told his wife they see theyre not scaring me off and theyll stop trying like they did with david she asked with some asperity whos david reyas asked hardy sighed my partner in this lawsuit david freeman he got beaten up last night hes still hospitalized in a coma frannie added in critical condition again reyas and simms consulted silently finally simms tapped his notepad maybe you better give us a name he said moses mcguire arrived a little after the tow truck and after the hardys car was on its way he packed the two of them into the cab of his pickup it hadnt been a cheerful ride back from north beach but moses had talked them into stopping by his bar to eat their dinner and calm down now hed plied his sister with wine and hardy with some first aid for his hand and then a double martini most of the immediate tension had passed they were eating their fior ditalia antipasto at one of the coffee tables at the back of the little shamrock mcguire tipped up the last of his scotch ive got an idea he said ideas are good hardy said id take an idea paul mcguire called to the bartender and held up his empty glass pointing at it then back to hardy where does panos live uhuh frannie shook her head bad idea no really moses said no really yourself you dont escalate things you dont why not i think its a fine idea drop by his place pop a window or two have a little fun hardy thoughtfully chewed an olive it does have a quaint sort of inyourface appeal mcguire was getting into it especially if i just do it and dont even tell you he smiled at his sister she put down her wineglass her face had gone hard dont even think about it i mean it moses she turned to her husband for support but he just shrugged i cant control him fran hes a big boy boy is the key word then to her brother you just dont do this mcguire got his new drink service tended to be good for him at the shamrock but he hadnt lost the thread so what do you recommend the question seemed to fluster her i dont recommend anything the police said they were going to look into it mcguire barked a deep and scathing laugh and then when they find nothing what maybe theyll find something frannie said shes right hardy said hed had enough discord for one night moses and frannie were threatening to really go at it and he thought hed try to slow them down maybe they will mose it could happen a couple of scotches now into the wind mcguire fastened a cold eye on hardy traitor and how pray is it going to happen one of panoss guys leave a card in the gutter he took in both of them get real guys youve already told me that they dont have anything on who beat up your mr freeman and hes a moderately important person you think theyre even going to look with your stupid car this my naive friends is not going to happen my cars not stupid hardy replied in fact now that i think of it its smarter than some of my clients go ahead diz make a joke of it i dont think its funny mcguire put a spoonful of caponata on some focaccia and stuffed it into his mouth these guys really piss me off i intuited that hardy was working on his newfound calm he put his injured hand on frannies knee shot her his craggy grin were a little angry ourselves tell the truth but you dont go breaking his windows she said then youre just like he is sorry lil sis but no youre not before vietnam had killed the scholar hed been as a young man mcguire had earned a doctorate in philosophy at berkeley theres one tiny little difference no theres no difference and dont lil sis me all right strike the lil sis but dont give me that no difference bullshit hardys efforts to defuse the sibling fireworks werent working the area at the back of the shamrock was small enough to begin withmaybe ten feet across and twelve deepand mcguires voice reverberated off the close walls drowning even the jukebox theres a fucking huge difference and you know what it is they started it how bout that for a concept he pointed at his sister his brow knit his eyes dark they did it to you first you dont think that makes a fundamental difference youre dead fucking wrong easy mose hardy said were just talking okay mcguire whirled on him what do you think that was you see anybody throwing a punch here i dont think so but dont tell me were just like them cause thats just plain bullshit were nothing like them but frannie was evidently much more accustomed to mcguires outbursts than even hardy was and hed seen a lot of them she got up and sat down next to her brother put an arm around him and people wonder where i got so feisty she said she kissed him on the cheek okay youre nothing like them just promise me you wont go shoot out anybodys windows not completely mollified mcguire came forward heavily he grabbed for his scotch picked it up then put it back down and sat back after another moment he leaned over and kissed his sister i wasnt going to shoot them he said smiled the fight was over i was thinking maybe a slingshot he said the call came into homicide at am as soon as he heard the tentative identifications paul thieu thought he knew what he had but for his own reasons not the least of which was pride in his work he proceeded in his own ordered methodical fashion he had to get to the scene and make his own determination first gerson wouldnt thank him for a call at this time of the morning anyway if the crime scene was anything like what it promised to be from the dispatchdouble homicide or possibly homicide with suicidethe csi team wouldnt even have gotten a good jump by the time it was reasonable to call the lieutenant in the cold dark morning thieu left the hall of justice through the front doors a couple of blackandwhites were parked on bryant just down the stepsthe dim light of cigarettes visible in the front one thieu didnt want to waste even the few minutes it would take to walk to the back lot and get his assigned ford taurus he walked up to the drivers window and pressed his badge up against it the window came down in a fog of smoke and coffee sorry to interrupt your coffee break officers but ive got a very hot homicide eight blocks away and id like to be there ten minutes ago he slapped the roof of the car how fast can you make this thing go sirens screaming all the waythieu saw no reason why commandeering a squad car couldnt include an element of funthey dropped him at his address in under five minutes two other squad cars were already parked in the street but there was no sign yet of the coroners van or any of the csi people the building had no aspirations to stand out among the other worn and tawdry fourstory structures on the block with its common entrance yellowing paint and graffiti in a hundred hands and colors the apartment house squatted all but anonymously amid its identical neighbors each more depressing than the next inside thieu knew the apartments would also be more similar than not every one squalid stained ancient mattresses with no coverings broken furniture without upholstery bare walls and sagging wallpaper hanging in sheets no one ever thought or cared to remove in every kitchen dirty dishes would lie piled in the sinks and on every flat surface the stoves would be buried in grease and carbon the refrigerators nearly living with mold the stench of the roomsof tobacco urine alcohol vomit decay and muskwould thieu supposed never come out when homicides are reported the sergeant from the local precinct is supposed to come out and maintain security at the sight until an inspector from the homicide detail arrives in this case things were working as they should and sergeant r penrose from his name tag out of the tenderloin task force was standing talking to another uniformed patrolman at the buildings entrance out of the wind inside the open doorway thieu introduced himself and noted the look of relief on penroses facethe scene wasnt his direct responsibility anymore thieu pegged him at about his own age midthirties but a kind of rigid nervousness made him seem younger this is officer lundgren he said although thieu was anxious to get inside he knew it was smarter to get everything from the beginning he and his partner out in the car there they got the original complaint in this part of town complaints to the police were decidedly unusual so this in itself piqued thieus interest who complained about what he asked the landlady lundgren pointed into the halfshadow behind him where a small asian woman dressed now in a heavy overcoat hovered by the stairway mrs chu her english isnt so good but evidently she was trying to sleep and excuse me officer thieu said stopping him he turned to sergeant penrose maybe i will see if i can just talk to her for a minute please penrose nodded if he was surprised he didnt show it he motioned to mrs chu to come forward thieu was not a tall man but mrs chu didnt reach his shoulders she looked to be about sixty years old and as she emerged from the shadows thieu took in her threadbare coat the thin short gray hair a pair of red converse tennis shoes she too like penrose exuded wariness that was it thieu was thinking everybody here looks asleep sergeant he addressed her in mandarin in which he was fluent and at the familiar sounds she relaxed slightly she told him that shed been watching television not in fact trying to sleep as officer lundgren had volunteered trying to drown out the loud radio from directly below her usually the tenants down there were quiet and polite but tonight it seemed they were partying they came in a little after midnightyes she thought several people at least three but maybe moreand first thing had turned on the radio very loud she couldnt hear her television over the blaring radio but noise was a fact of life in the building and people tended not to get involved thieu knew that interrupting parties that is drug use or sex or both was a typical cause of violence in the tenderloin besides one of the men downstairs was very big and she did not want him to become mad at her so she put it off a long time but eventually about an hour ago she needed to sleep and so came down and knocked but no one answered although the radio kept on and on finally she called the police and they thieu thanked mrs chu and turned back to sergeant penrose id better go in i expect the coroner and crime scene investigation unit any time im afraid youre not going to be getting much sleep sergeant sorry i think its going to be a while anyway penrose said every time i close my eyes i he stopped motioned toward the closed door again that spooked quality he reached out and touched thieu on the arm a dramatic gesture under any circumstances and not at all coplike prepare yourself he said its bad dawn ambushed him one minute thieu was opening the door to the apartment flipping on the light against the blackness outside thinking not only that it wasnt bad it was incredibly wellkeptthe flowers the polished surfaces a sense of order and cleanliness to say nothing of the matching furniture highend magazines framed prints on the fauxpainted terracotta walls a minute later he stood squinting up at blue sky through the back window that opened on an alley in three plus hours he hadnt grown appreciably inured to the sight of the carnage behind him in the bedroom hed been wrong about the csi team hardly getting a jump before it was time to call gerson they were getting close to finished already they wanted to remove the bodies but much as it sickened him to refuse thats exactly what he did after a long while working here someone had opened both the back windows and the front door and the temperature in the apartment now barely made it into the forties although it felt like one hundred degrees to thieu he knew it was time to call gerson but he checked his watch anyway and made sure turning around he resolved to go outside for a momenthe wanted to get out of this roomand patch into the detail from one of the squad cars or maybe the coroners van he stepped carefully to avoid the blood tried again without much success to avert his eyes from the horrific tableau but before hed made it out of the room lennard faro stopped him faro was the crime scene specialist thin and intense he had recently begun sporting a soul patch under his lip which he called his bug both of his ears were pierced the right one twice he wasnt yet thirty years old yet in his profession believed that he had seen everything even the almost unfathomably grisly scene here today failed to elicit any response and thieu found himself wondering if it was all simply a defense he knew that he himself came across as very professional and knew the reality behind that guise maybe faro was simply better at it than he wasbut even if it was your job thieu didnt think most humans could handle the butchery they had here without reacting viscerally but faro seemed to be holding up certainly better than thieu was he and thieu had both spent the previous night crawling around the driveway where matt creed had been shot so when the specialist had first arrived he greeted thieu with the old weve got to stop meeting like this but that was before hed seen the bodies now having seen them his voice held a suitable gravity but no real sign of personal revulsion suddenly thieu realized what it waslennard faro wasnt spooked and it was hard not to be so we got a refrigerator here paul you still wanna leave em where they be i do thieu said im going out to call gerson on it right now couple more hours isnt going to hurt them i dont suppose faro cast an unfeeling eye back at the room no theyll keep but the teams going to want to wrap it up and seeing thieus expressionanger and resolvehe stopped im just saying its two nights in a row now people get tired they dont do as good we got the place sealed off we come back early say or bring out the day team to tag and bag what do you say thieu knew that he could appear peremptory he forced a smile pointed to the front door lets go out a minute get some air okay by the time they had reached the front door finally out of sight of the bedroom thieu found he could control himself much more easily turning back to faro he spoke with an easy assurance even sympathy i hear what youre saying len but i think in this case itd be helpful if your team stayed around just awhile longer at least till the lieutenants here to let you go you think gersons gonna be coming down here faro clearly didnt envision that possibility that would be a first wouldnt it thieu didnt comment on that what i think is that whether or not he comes down himself its very likely hes going to assign this case to cuneo and russell which is what he did with creed last night faros hand went to his bug as he processed this id bet you anything that this ones part of that which is part of silverman so if you dont mind i think itd be helpful if you guys were around to answer questions when the new guys get here probably in fifteen minutes or less plus he added they need to see it faros face suddenly went slack nobody needs to see that he said thieu felt a wash of something like relief he decided to speak you know len im glad to hear you say that i thought it rolled right off you faro pulled at his bug shook his head slowly side to side nope he said when thieu reached gerson on the phone the lieutenant as expected wasnt enthusiastic about coming down and checking out the murder scene himself but he wasted no time at all with his administrative duties upon learning that the victims were clint terry and randy wills the two chief suspects in both the creed and silverman homicides he told thieuagain if he didnt mind and with other suitable disclaimersthat it sounded like efficiency would be better served if cuneo and russell were assigned to this homicide as well as the other two he told thieu that the two inspectors were running a little late getting into the office this morning since they were stopping at the lab for some ballistics results before reporting in but gerson would call dispatch and send them directly to the crime scene just as soon as he got off the phone with thieu which he did shortly leaving thieu and faro standing out in the street by the coroners van but when thieu started explaining gersons decision about cuneo and russell to faro the crime scene specialist stopped him before hed gotten very far wait a minute wait a minute you want to run that by me again youre telling me those guys in there they were suspects in the creed thing thieu nodded yeah and them plus a third guy named holiday for silverman faro pulled at his bug so the theory is what what do you mean i mean you just told gerson this homicide was related to creed and silverman so hes sending over russell and cuneo right right so whats the relation the relation is that theyre suspects in both those murders but faro was shaking his head they killed silverman then they killed creed now theyre both dead and this guy holiday hes the only one left yeah looks like which makes him thieu cocked his head whats the problem len faro took a long beat deciding what hed say finally he said this might be a hell of a coincidence okay and were trained to hate and mistrust them but they happen my take is that this isnt any of thatsilverman and creed i mean its completely unrelated it cant be these are the same guys be that as it may ive seen a half a dozen of these like this not like this thieu motioned toward the apartment like that faros head bobbed down then up spittin image or close enough this is a pickup gone bad id bet my badge on it which might close silverman and even creed okay except maybe for this other guy holiday but these stiffs here this casethey ought to stay with you with me in what way with me your case theyve got nothing to do with cuneo and russells other work thieu rubbed his hands together against the cold they do if nope not unless you think holiday did this which im betting he didnt youre thinking he did i didnt know i just assumed he must be in it somehow he fits a falling out among thieves something like that something like suddenly faro shivered jesus its cold im going to go tell the team were hanging fire another hour or so send em out for coffee he fished in his pockets brought out his keys pointed thats my car over there the brown one he flipped the keys to thieu get the heat going would you have a seat ill be right back thieu was still pondering the pickup gone bad theory when faro opened the door and slid into the passenger seat so where were we this should stay my case thats it and hey no offense to dan and lincoln nothing personal its just that their theory dont hold thieu crossed his arms hugging himself it hadnt warmed up much so whats yours what happened easy the two vies in there went out to party last night and found some guy who wanted to play so they brought him back here you see some of that powder on the bureau ten to one its coke maybe heroin or crank one of those so theyre getting a lot high and a little kinky maybe one of ems already nakedim thinkin the big guy thats terry why him first well get to that but see if this dont play so terrys tied up in the chair just like he is now maybe theyre playin a little with him and the two other guyswell the guy they picked up and the one he thinks is the girl wills yeah whatever so those two start to get it on then the pickup guy reaches down andwhoopsgets a handful of surprise wills isnt a woman he sure isnt not even a little so the perp goes ballisticthe coroner will tell us exactly what he did next but my guess is he strangled wills maybe knocked him around a little first but hes still flying on whatever drug theyre doing and completely out of his mind now with being fooled his masculinity if you want to call it that is all fucked up except he really knew all along plus hes just killed wills with terry tied up sitting there watching him whats he gonna do hes in a rage and completely freaked hes got to get out of there but first theres business so maybe hes gone to the bathroom since hes been there seen the straight razor wills shaved his whole body with he goes back in there i think i get it from there thieu said he might have been a hardboiled sixyear veteran inspector of homicide but he was shaking now not with the cold but with the recitation he didnt think he could bear to listen to faros certaintobevivid clinical description of how the throats of both of them had been slit or the individual steps as randy wills was undressed trussed and finally castrated faro needed a moment to extract himself from his imagination at last he turned to thieu anyway my point is that whatever happened here this was separate nothing to do with creed or silverman or anything else this was its own thing and the case ought to belong to you if you want it john holiday loved clint terryhe really didbut he was going to have to fire the irresponsible son of a bitch he was thinking this as he pulled the chairs off the tables that hed put on them when hed closed the place last night at two oclock why did he bother he set the last chair in its place and checked his watch noon hed closed the place up a mere ten hours ago and thank god hed come by just on a random check to find the door closed and nobody behind the bar this was his only source of income and it had to be open for him to actually make some money stay solvent and not be forced to sell cheap he still believed he could get a lucky streak going maybe at poker lucky streaks werent out of the question look at him and michelle with just a few solid months and a bit of luck he could make the ark presentable and then maybe sell at a profit go back into something more legitimate what was the matter with people he wondered a gay exconvict like clint with a questionable reputation and no real skills where was he going to get another job as good as this one with a laidback boss flexible hours decent pay what if anything was he thinking as he undoubtedly slept in this morning making it two days in a row knowing he was blowing the job off all holiday asked essentially was that the big galoot show up and especially especiallywhen holiday had pulled the night shift the day before but first yesterday then today enough was enough he was going to have to do it that was all there was to it fortunately when hed closed last night hed prepped the back bar and cleaned up every bit of the glass and messgood guy and great employer that he wasso that clint could have it easy when he opened now at least he was close to ready albeit two hours late as he unlocked the front door and flicked on the open sign as sometimes happened a man was waiting just outside and pushed open the door while holiday went around the bar the man a wiry asian of some kind was seated by the time the two men were face to face a cocktail napkin down on the bar between them morning holiday said what can i get you how about a beer bottled draft we got sam adams and anchor steam which ones colder anchor holiday said naming the citys own brew its lived here longer so its had more time to chill but you sure you want cold today theres plenty of that outside but the play had run out anchors good the customer said holiday turned and grabbed a glass from the refrigerator tipped it up against the anchor spigot and drew off the pint coming back to the bar he noticed a twenty dollar bill in the gutter the mans wallet out on the pitted wood the change he put the beer down carefully i told the guys who came by yesterday that i wasnt talking to you without my lawyer here im still not you want me to call him im off duty and ive got the worlds simplest question i promise whatever answer you give me i drink my beer and go home and get some sleep for some reasonclints absence or this mans easy manner or even his own fatigue at having his guard up all the timeholiday called him on it okay what the hell one he said where were you last night at midnight holiday actually laughed out loud thats it thats the one question we could play this all day i was here and by here i mean right herehe tapped the bar twice tending this twentytwo feet of antiquated glulam with dedication and some might even say panache so you had customers people you knew six or eight at least but i just gave you another question two actually thieu said he lifted his glass and closing his eyes drained half of it great beer he said then thank you he picked up his wallet got off his stool and walked to the door where he stopped and turned again keep the change the evidence bonanza that was the terrywills apartment was almost enough to overcome the revulsion felt by both cuneo and russell when they had first arrived and taken in the appalling scene thieu had still been there with them of course they didnt know it but gerson had overruled his request based on faros theory of the case that on reflection he should remain the inspector of record thieu didnt argue with the lieutenant but simply hung around until all three inspectors signed off on the release of the bodies to the medical examiners with a great sense of relief once the overwhelming presence of the corpses was removed and thieu had gone faro and the other members of the csi unit began walking the two new inspectors through the masses of evidence theyd acquired and bagged in plastic cuneo and russell were both tightly focused and slightly flushed with the successful results of the ballistics test they had finally shepherded through the crime lab that test performed on two remarkably undamaged slugs had conclusively shown that sam silverman and matt creed had been shot with the same caliber weapon and now among other items they were looking at just such a gun a smith amp wesson revolver with its serial number filed off found under a pile of socks in the bureau drawer in the bedroom two empty bullet casings remained in the cylinder with four live rounds additionally the same drawer yielded a box of ammunition minus eight shells a stack of bills of various denominations in all each one marked with a small red dot in the upper righthand corner wade panos and sadie silverman both and separately in their respective interviews had mentioned this habit of silvermans reddotting the bills hed be depositing when they had nearly finishedfaro had already gone home for the day without burdening the new inspectors with his theory of the casecuneo had an idea and went to the bedroom closet the csi team had already looked inside it and found nothing then had reclosed the door of course the clothes the two victims had been wearing were already bagged and tagged but cuneo had read thieus report on the creed crime scene and had something specific in mind he wasnt a minute looking before he stopped humming bolero and turned back to the room lincoln get me another bag would you goodsized he came out holding a pair of large shoes they were nicely made expensivelooking loafers of light brown braided leather with a tassle the soles were worn smooth but there was some gunkstill tackystuck where the heel started a little more around the edge on the right one if this is what i think it is cuneo said we got this thing wrapped up as it turned out they didnt need the analysis of the garbage effluent this time the two inspectors of record didnt email the lab and request that someone drive up to the hall and pick up their new evidence they had the gun the probable murder weaponand since they hadnt been back to the hall to return the earlier slugs to the evidence locker they had possession of them too so they had another hamburger lunch at dago marys while the lab fired the gun and compared this new bullet to the earlier rounds by one oclock they were back uptown talking to gerson in his office ten minutes after that they appeared in the chambers of judge oscar thomasino a venerable presence on the bench who was on his lunch break from the trial over which he was presiding this was his week as duty judge which meant he was the person responsible for approving search warrants and he was already well disposed to both cuneo and russell the dna evidence that had led to the arrest of the alleged rapist and murderer shawon ellerson last week had come from a search conducted by these two inspectors at the suspects apartment and thomasino had signed off on the warrant for that search he got up from his desk and the paperwork on it and ushered the two men over to a small seating area by the rooms one window you boys are having yourselves quite a week he said russell nodded soberly it never did to gloat were getting a few breaks your honor thats true its funny how breaks come to the good cops ive noticed a definite correlation thank you your honor this one looks pretty solid cuneo added he handed the warrant across to the judge thomasino looked it over carefully these may have been good cops but the decision to violate a citizens residence by allowing a legal search was never a casual one and thomasino took it very seriously indeed when hed finished reading he looked up so this man holiday how does he fit exactly im not sure i see it cuneo took point we believe he was with the other two menthe victims this morning in the apartment where we found the gunduring the silverman robbery and murder plus weve confirmed that the same gun was used to kill a security guard two days ago matt creed but these men were not shot this morning no sir somebody had cut their throats russell said and you think it was this holiday yes your honor cuneo exuding urgency came forward in a kind of a crouch we didnt get a positive match on the slugs for silverman and creed until this morning and based on them we were planning to arrest terry and wills except they went dead on us but not holiday why not russell shifted in his seat hes a bartender he was working when creed got shot so we think that creed was just the two of them terry and wills maybe holiday didnt even know they were planning on killing him cuneo added he might have felt they were getting too triggerhappy and were a risk which is why holiday decided he had to kill them but russell said its probable he did know about creed that they all decided and why would they do that thomasino asked cuneo straightened up the tag team continuing because creed had identified all of them as the guys whod killed silverman so they figure he cant testify if hes dead russell jumped back in and me and dan repeating what creed told us would be hearsay and inadmissible anyway isnt that right a faint trace of smile tugged at the judges mouth the rules about hearsay have fooled better men than me but youre saying you had an id on holiday then why isnt he in jail already the id was in the dark at fifty feet your honor russell said the da wouldnt have charged it if thats all it was we needed physical evidence tying him to silverman cuneo added and we didnt get any until this morning when we got plenty thomasino stroked his chin pulled at his ear rubbed his neck something about all this still bothered him i see youve got a lot for these two dead men although its a little late now im still not sure i see the connection to holiday so clearly cuneo had started tapping his thighs in agitation your honor he killed them both last night the other dead man creed put holiday with them both during the silverman robbery and murder im a hundred percent certain well find evidence we can use at his place tying him to four murders this man needs to be off the street but you need probable cause for a search warrant you gentlemen know this and im not sure youve got anything yet that rises to that standard your honor russell reached over and touched his partners arm stopping the agitation playing counterpoint to cuneos intensity he leaned back in his chair crossed a leg over his knee i personally heard matt creed positively identify the three men who robbed and killed mr silverman as clint terry randy wills and john holiday he pointed to the form in thomasinos hand as the affidavit indicates we found bills with mr silvermans distinctive mark at willss and terrys apartment we will be searching for similar bills at mr holidays we know they were together chewing the inside of his cheek the judge sat with it for another moment finally he narrowed his eyes and leaned forward inspector russell you heard this mr creeds identification with your own ears yes sir inspector cuneo same question yes your honor thomasino nodded all right perhaps the warrant application just isnt as clear as it needs to be i want you to handwrite that right here initial and date it each of you im calling that good enough for me he came all the way forward and placed the warrant on the small table between them the pens scratch was the only sound in the room holiday called michelle at her apartment from the ark she had a restaurant review for a place on chestnut street and theyd been planning to go there together for lunch but now that wasnt going to happen he told her that clint still hadnt shown up and he was going to have to pull a double shift hed see her tonight late after he got off he wondered since the restaurant was near his own duplex if shed mind swinging by his place for a clean shirt or two and some underwear he might be pulling backtobacks at the bar and he could be with her sooner tonight if she could save him the long walk or bus ride home hed lost the last car hed owned at a poker game then found he didnt need a car for his normal life anyway since he lived all of it within such a relatively small radius most days he walked to workchestnut to taylor or mason then all the way down to ofarrell wasnt even two miles and the hills gave him some badly needed exercise so after lunch sometime between and michelle found herself climbing the stairs to his flat hed lived in the same upper duplex on casa street in the marina for over fifteen years had bought it with emma lived there with her for their three years together in a fit of fiscal probity during emmas pregnancy the young couple had actually bought mortgage insurance and because of that after her death the place was now paid off it still had ghosts for him evidently and he spent as little time there as possible although he had told her that he recognized the necessity of holding on to it he could never afford to rent a similar or even a far less desirable place it was just something he possessed like his bar part of his life there had been three newspapers in the little area at the foot of the stairs and michelle was carrying them as she got to the upper landing and noticed that his door was open she pushed at it gingerly and it gave another few inches inside she heard unmistakable sounds of movement and male voices hello she sang out is anybody home the voices ceased footsteps approached the door opened all the way a welldressed cleancut black man stood in front of her scowling can i help you is john home she asked who are you the man pulled out his wallet and showed her his identification another man this one white appeared in the hall behind him inspector lincoln russell my partner dan cuneo were with homicide homicide she backed away a step is john okay that would be john holiday yes maam as far as we know all right but then what are you doing here were searching his apartment inspector russell reached into his coat pocket and produced a piece of paper we have a warrant the other man came forward while were getting to know each other can i please see some identification from me yes maam if you dont mind it didnt seem to her that it was a request she could refuse flustered going for her purse she dropped the newspapers around the welcome mat finally she fished around and brought out her drivers license which she handed to russell since he was nearest to her he glanced at it showed it to his partner then gave it back to her and said all right ms maier you mind telling us why youre here michelle was thinking as fast as she could showing them nothing ive been trying to get in touch with john and hes not answering his phone so i thought id come by and leave a message on his door im going away for a couple of days and he always watches my cats she knew she was blurting and realized at the same time that this might not be a bad thing hes really good with cats he never forgets anyway so when i got here i thought id pick up his papers when i saw them all down there and then the door was open a little so i well you know she stammered to a halt im sorry to have interrupted you she said the black inspector turned to his partner came back to her you dont know where mr holiday is no thats why i came by to see if she gave them both her most plaintive look is he in trouble cuneo came forward a step you might want to find somebody else for your cats if he comes by well see he gets the papers it was a dismissal she couldnt believe it but as long as she stayed cool they were letting her just go away okay then she forced herself to wait another moment then raised her hand tentatively as though wondering if it would be appropriate to wave sorry to have bothered you bye so what gerson said the three of them were in his office sitting around in something like a circle the door was closed you left his copy of the warrant taped to the front door inside yes sir i dont want any technical error to screw this up no sir cuneo said neither do we it was a righteous search by the book and where was all this just lying out he was referring to the three baggies the inspectors had brought in with themtheir winning streak growing to truly absurd proportions in holidays bathroom one of the drawers under the sink didnt appear to be as deep as the counter over it upon pulling it out russell discovered a battered old dull red leather pouch stuffed to near bursting with over in mixed bills each one marked with a red dot in the upper righthand corner as if that werent enough at almost the same instant cuneoin the bedroomlet out a yelp when he opened a cigar box on a shelf in the back corner of the closet it rattled when he picked it up and he found that it contained seven rings five of them womens engagement rings with large diamonds two of them for men one of the mens rings was truly distinctive inset with what looked to the inspectors to be a huge and brilliant star sapphire two of the rings including the sapphire still had the tiny price tag attached with a small length of thin white string the price tags also had red dots on themsilvermans cuneo nodded we talked about it on the way in he said if i were more cynical i wouldnt believe this could have fallen together so perfectly all by itself you are more cynical dan his partner said he turned to gerson it wasnt just lying out sir holiday had it hidden just not well enough dont get me wrong cuneo said im not complaining ill take it makes up for all the times nothing works its just so weird im tempted to go buy a lottery ticket gerson nodded and thomasino signed off on the search yes sir russell said okay so what i suggest you do is go back to him right away hes at trial cuneo said interrupt his honor gerson replied he wont mind i promise print yourselves out an arrest warrant and show him what his wisdom allowed you to discover youll make his day you have any idea where mr holiday is at the present time dan called the ark sir from the phone at his place as soon as we found this stuff when a male voice answered we hung up we figure he cant have a clue weve made this kind of progress enough to arrest him and its got to be him working there now his other bartenders dead good point all right so after the judge signs your warrant youre going down to pick him up you want some backup cuneo answered we can handle it sir he wont give us any trouble gerson considered for a beat okay but by the book every time sir russell said nodding in agreement every time glitsky payroll it rankled every time lieutenant barry gerson again yes sir no emphasis what can i do for you well first i wanted to apologize for going so territorial on you the other day i cant blame you for being interested in silverman your father knew him of course youre interested i was out of line thank you whats second the brusqueness of the reply slowed gerson for a second but then he recovered second is i thought youd want to know that cuneo and russell have been doing some incredible work these last couple of days i believe theyve gotten to the bottom of this thing with silverman at least theyve got plenty that you can pass on to your father suddenly the flat tone left glitskys voice im listening gerson gave him the rundown on the evidence that so unambiguously pointed to terry wills and holidaythe gun in terrys drawer so clearly and demonstrably both the silverman and creed murder weapon but also the reddotted bills from both the jones street apartment and from holidays duplex in the marina although the lab hadnt finished its analysis of the gunk yet gerson threw in for good measure the shoes found in terrys apartment and their probable relation to the creed killing the pawnshop jewelry articles in holidays closet the case was solved soup to nuts when gerson finished glitsky exhaled heavily so thats it thats it and holiday killed the other two last night was it looks like theres really no other option thomasino gave cuneo and russell a warrant in about five seconds theyve gone on down now to pick him up glitsky spent a second or two adjusting to this new reality the fundamental rule of his thirty years of life as a cop was that evidence talked and in this case it positively screamed he had been completely wrong and his meddling had possibly even inconvenienced the good inspectors working the case maybe he thought bitterly payroll was where he belonged after all hed obviously lost his edge he drew in a deep breath let it out slowly then im the one who should be apologizing lieutenant if wade panos put your guys on the trail that led here i must have pegged him wrong thats not an issue for me abe glitsky noted the first name a far cry from the lieutenant hed started with you thought you were doing me a favor i really did i believe you some of these rentacops well you know theyre not all righteous we can go that far but panos had something real this time were lucky he felt cooperative anyway if youve got something i need to hear in the future my doors open you put in a lot of years at this desk id be an idiot if i didnt take advantage of that thanks barry i appreciate it but its your gig now im out of it maybe but im reserving the right to come to you if something stumps me deal deal when they hung up glitsky sat unmoving turned away from his desk staring out the window into the bright afternoon he heard the wind whistling around his corner of the building a deep sigh escaped in spite of the kissyface words the hard truth settled over him like a shroudin the real world glitsky would probably never set foot in homicide again no one was even going to have to try to keep him out the thing was done a fait accompli it was the termination of all those years after a minute he swiveled his chair stood up and went over to the printing room to see how the paychecks were coming along they were due out tomorrow morning that was the priority now the sum total of his professional importancemaking sure those checks got out on time holiday got michelles frantic call to the ark during the afternoon lull he had one customer a fiftysomething dotcom bankrupt named wayne and he shooed him out pleading illness he was going to have to close up after hed locked the door behind wayne he took all the money from the cash register walked to the back room and unlocked the bottom left drawer of his desk the drawer contained a walther ppk automatic wrapped in a greasy old tshirt and a quarter box of ammunition that was at least six years old and possibly more than that holiday had bought the gun when hed first opened his pharmacy fifteen years agohe had no memory of when hed last taken it to the range or bought any ammunition in all his years in business hed never had occasion to take it out even to brandish but he believed with all his heart that he had a reason now he cranked a round into the chamber and snapped the safety off he tucked the gun into his belt and the bullets into the pocket of his threequarterlength leather coat letting himself out the back door of the ark he doublelocked it up and started walking he arrived at michelles an hour later now they had been holed up inside for about another hour it turned out when michelle accidentally saw the gun that she wasnt much a fan of firearms there had never been a gun in her parents house when she was growing up she wasnt going to tolerate one now she had wanted to warn john about the police but had never considered what it might really mean who this man shed been seeing really was when he showed up with a loaded gun it more than worried her it made her feel as though hed duped her somehow so shed told him no gun he didnt need it here she wouldnt have it in her apartment if he was intent on keeping the gun he had to leave in the end she reluctantly agreed to a wimpy compromisehe would unload it and put the gun and the ammunition out of sight in one of the bedroom drawers she agreed not because she wanted to she realized but because suddenly some part of her was afraid of him shed been attracted to him at the beginningand consistently sincebecause shed chosen to ignore all the outward signs that he might finally at heart not be the man he pretended to be now she was forced to consider that he might in fact be a true criminal the seedy bar the nomadic lifestyle exconvict associates heavy drinking even his own drug arrest he had explained away all of those dark and telling realities with a lighthearted and eloquent insouciance and shed wanted to believe him in large part because of the powerful chemistry between them clearly he had a sensitive side hed apparently endured great pain and loneliness after the loss of his wife and child he was smart as a whip he could be very funny he was a great lover she had convinced herself that most of the time he simply chose to hide his essential goodness from the world because people would take advantage of it the same way she handled her physical beauty this was something she could relate to a defensive coloration but now here he was in her private and special place with a loaded gun the homicide police had been searching his duplex how blind was she and now shed not only helped him escape she was harboring him when he had stowed the gun he came over to where she stood looking holding a crack in the blinds open with her finger out the window over the city when he put his arms around her from behind he felt her stiffen whats the matter she let go of the blinds shrugged out of his embrace took a step away turned to face him oh nothing john whatever could be the matter he smoothed the side of his mustache i just put the gun away michelle thats what you asked me to do she crossed her arms where did you go friday night he cocked his head what was friday night the night after thursday a week ago today when you walked out on me i know you remember chinatown where were you i dont know home i guess he strove to sound casual i cant believe how many people are interested in where i was every night this past week maybe i should make up a calendar and pass it around or maybe you could answer me i just did didnt i i was home on friday night he gave every indication of counting back the days making sure yep i worked the day handed it off to clint ate at little joes went home watched tv went to sleep thats funny she said what is when i went by there today when the police were there i picked up your papers down at the bottom of the stairs and there were three of themfriday saturday and sunday michelle she held up a hand never mind dont even start im going out for a walk you and your gun dont have to be here when i get back roake had been a defense attorney for twentyone of her fortyeight years after graduating from king law school at uc davis she passed the bar and at twentyfive took her first job with the san francisco district attorneys office two years later genetically predisposed to favoring the underdog and the dispossessed the unfortunate and the unlucky she switched to the defense trade there she was often unsuccessful although typically defense attorneys would under the normal definition be considered to fail most of the time a ripping success is often an accepted plea to a slightly lesser offense or eight years in the slammer for the client instead of twelve after thirteen years working mostly with and for other lawyers she finally hung out her own shingle and had done exceedingly well exclusively handling criminal cases unlike lennard faro who believed he had seen it all gina roake had seen it all she had defended clientsand come to know them as people as far as this was possible from the netherworld of the gene pool all the way up to educated professionals and wealthy business people suburban housewives turned murderers children whod killed their parents addicts of every drug known to mankind sexual criminals from simple misfits to the truly perverted thieves rapists con men pickpockets shoplifters lots of shoplifters lowlifes gangbangers and muggers a million drunk drivers nothing surprised her humans were flawed but worth defending and so she felt was the system her job her lifework keeping some balance between the twomeant providing the best defense the law allowed to those who had fallen everyone had a demon most people had several from grinding poverty to sexual abuse from unseen psychic trauma to pampered irresponsibility and these demons would be served forcing their victims to commit crimes against themselves and against the society that had maimed and scarred them shed always believed that the crimes should be justly punished but that the criminals themselvesthe human beings who did these thingsought to be viewed with an eye to mercy with an understanding of what had led them to their acts this was why now she felt so adrift so foreign to herself along with the grief to which she had not even begun yet to grow accustomed her desire for vengeance against the people who had done this to davidto davidwas making her feel quite literally insane if i knew who they were dismas i swear to god if they were here in front of me i would personally beat them to death gladly unable to concentrate hardy had left work early again he had a bandaid of a splint around the pinkie and ring fingers on his left hand but the others were intertwined on the table between them in the hospitals tiny coffee shop cups sat untouched in front of them id say thats natural gina its not for me thats my point its the polar opposite of everything ive ever believed i would literally kill the sons of bitches i doubt that try me she brought her hands up to her face and wiped a palm down each side of it oh god what am i saying im losing it here dismas i really am what am i going to do with this have you slept yet at all a brittle laugh collapsed into a pitiable cough im sorry she said when shed caught her breath no sleep has not happened not to you either id say he didnt want to burden her with his own problems his own fury and fears he forced a smile i had a little bit of a tough night last night thats all car problems have you seen him she nodded they let me in whenever they can now an hour or two i try to tell myself hes squeezing my hand back or something but she shook her head in misery bit her lip then as though if she said it aloud it would be more true she whispered his kidney function seems to be slowing down is that bad its one of the things they measure of course if it stops entirely it would be bad closing her eyes she sighed deeply im trying to prepare myself i just feel so so helpless and then so goddamned furious im in there pleading with him talking out loud like he can hear me like im the words stopped she looked across at hardy you dont need to hear this you know he reached across the table and put his hand over hers youre a big girl so i dont have to tell you but if you could sleep it would help especially if you cant do anything here i keep thinking maybe hell wake up and if he does i wont be there hed get over it he might not even notice no never mind its david hed notice he shrugged still still youre probably right oh and sergeant blanca came by here for a few minutes he said hed talked to you he didnt have much he still doesnt not as of about a half hour ago a silence then gina said theyre not going to find anything are they i wonder if its somebody i got off if some scumbag was back on the street because i was such a goddamned whiz of a lawyer wouldnt that be special hardy squeezed her hand dont go there i dont know where im going hardy hesitated for an instant then decided that hed known her for a long time he could push a little gina sorry to be a broken record but how about going home then to bed give the nurses your number theyll call you if theres any change this isnt doing anybody any good ill still want to kill them she said somehow the comment didnt seem off the subject it was as though theyd been talking about it all along i hear you hardy said gently if its any help so do i when she saw holiday wasnt gone michelle stood just inside her doorway uncertain about whether she should simply turn and give him more time or walk out and call the police herself but she hesitated long enough for him to start explaining the television droned near him he stood in front of it his coat back on she assumed he had rearmed himself im sorry i didnt expect you back so soon he took a tentative step toward her then stopped look im sorry about everything i didnt mean to lie to you ive got a bad habit of never mind it doesnt matter anymore im going now in a minute i just wanted to catch the news maybe see if theyll show what im up against still in her camo gear including hat and boots she came up next to him as the program began then backed up and sat on the corner of the bed since it was both local and lurid they didnt have to wait long the handsome and serious anchor hadnt gotten twenty words into the lead story when holiday nearly jumped forward to turn up the volume these grisly tenderloin murders the victims have been identified as clint terry and randy wills terry a bartender at a downtown watering hole was a former football star with the oh my god holiday folded himself down to the floor crosslegged as the anchor continued with the details his head fell forward after a minute he reached up to support it with his hands rocking his whole body from side to side on the television the story continued running through a cursory review of the related killings and a tantalizing film clip of crime scene investigators removing allegedly highly significant evidence from the scene and closing with the not entirely surprising news though no less unwelcome for that that the chief suspect for that crime and also the murders last week of sam silverman and matthew creed was john holiday he finally glanced up again at the mention of his name his fouryearold mug shot filled the screen as the anchor finished up with the words that a warrant had been issued for his arrest and that he should be considered armed and dangerous as they cut to the next story michelle walked to the set picked the remote off the top of it killed the power head in his hands holiday still rocked his whole body on the floorback and forth side to side john she reached over and touched his shoulder john are you okay when he looked up she wasnt sure he even saw her his eyes shone with panic his voice when it came was a suddenly ravaged and hoarse whisper i dont believe clint and randy are dead they cant be just dead she lowered herself down to the floor facing him he kept shaking his head from side to side she reached out and put a hand on his knee and she left it there the sun descended enough so that a few bars of sunlight through the blinds inched up the wall over her bed a dog barked somewhere in the neighborhood the call was taken up by another then both died away eventually holiday cleared his throat one time again didnt meet her eyes then began quietly matteroffactly what i do see is find somebody like you and then try to fuck it all up cheat on you or do something else you cant forgive shut up she said just shut up i get it you dont think i get it i know what you do what you always do you know why cause i do it too it keeps things manageable doesnt it making people you might love hate you when they start to get close so my question to you is what are you going to do now im talking with you and me you told me to get out right and you didnt leave you had most of an hour what does that mean about us anything or were you just afraid to go out because of because of all this and dont tell me you needed to find out what they were saying on the television no what then if your plan is to hang around and have a few more fights and go out on me to make me hate you i can save you some trouble just walk out now no hard feelings because do it again and i will hate you i promise she stood up and went back over to the window checked the blinds again she turned back to him you didnt kill any of those people did you no ive never killed anybody do you know who did he nodded soberly the same people who planted whatever they found in my apartment he looked up at her i dont understand this at all michelle the last i heard the police were talking to clint about mr silverman and now theyre both dead shed been pacing and now stopped over by the bed that lawyer who defended you last time suddenly her hands came up christ i dont believe im talking about this lawyers and killers and planted evidence i dont want this stuff in my life john i really dont he got up and came over to her its not my first choice either michelle im not making this happen i dont want to be around it either i dont even know what it is if this thing ever ends maybe ill make some changes maybe some wow all right not maybe definitely and maybe a lot but first theres this wouldnt you agree what were you asking me about my lawyer just that arent you still friends so where are you now john at a friends i locked up the ark and im not going home ah intelligent behavior at last and so what do you want me to do i dont know talk to somebody whatever you do i didnt do this diz none of it i loved clint i liked sam and matt i dont know how anything got into my apartment this whole thing is too weird i havent had much luck with the tooweirdtobereal defense john hardy sighed all right you said there was a warrant for your arrest thats what was on the news you can check it out for yourself i will but in the meanwhile i want you to think about something if in fact theres a warrant out on you my only option as your lawyer is to advise you to turn yourself in if you dont i cant have anything more to do with you turn myself in for what see if you can guess john but i didnt do it all right you dont believe me thats beside the point if theres already a warrant for your arrest about the best i can do is arrange your surrender thats you the lawyer diz what about you my friend im afraid were the same person john look if you wont take my advice why dont we both think about it overnight you think about it ill think about it one of us might come up with something what about now what about it i come over now to your place we get something figured out then if i dont call the police im harboring a fugitive and lose my license and though i love you like a brother i couldnt do you any good if im disbarred he paused look why dont you call me at my office tomorrow morning something might have changed by then ill talk to the da see what theyre going with meanwhile you say nobody knows where you are im guessing youre not that uncomfortable just lie low diz this isnt exactly what i was hoping to hear what can i tell you john its the best i can do watching his television at home nat glitsky had heard the news of the awful tenderloin murders and then of the arrest warrant that had been issued in sam silvermans death now he was in his sons kitchen sitting at the table having tea with his dessert abes dayold macaroons for the first time since rachels birth the hardys hadnt shown up yesterday at the conclusion of their date night so there was a full plate of them nat dipped his cookie into his tea blew on it put the softened morsel to his granddaughters lips your daughter she loves these he said everybody loves them treya was standing behind her husbands chair her hands on abes shoulders dismas hardy thinks abe should go into business making them abes manna macaroons such a name nat said a name is an important thing that dismas hes not so dumb abe liked that ill tell him you said so hes a glutton for praise not so dumb ought to make his week nat teased rachels lips with the remainder of his macaroon then brought it to his own mouth and popped it in the babys little hand reached out her face fell in shocked surprise a second later her smile returned as a fresh cookie appeared in nats grasp he let her grab it and they played tug of war for a second or two before he let it go she laughed in pure joy stuffing the spoils of victory into her mouth such a good girl nat said i see great things someday she becomes the owner of abrahams manna macaroons abes treya said not abrahams shorter glitsky said punchier maybe i will go into baking after all treya had come around behind rachel and gave him a look he gave her the same look back bakings a noble profession bakers have been baking probably longer than cops have been copping treya offered a tight smile it wont be too much longer a couple of months he said two months can be a long time if youre in thumbscrews nat nearly sprang forward out of his chair leaning over the table he says thumbscrews plural i dont even see one he sat back down as though hed proven something and for all the moaning and groaning who did they call as soon as they knew about sam i believe that was lieutenant glitsky treya said the pariah of bryant street courtesy only courtesy he says nat wasnt buying i heard him neither was treya she finally sat down at the table and since the only thing of interest and importance in the world and hence the only thing worth talking aboutnever mind the precious lives of infantsis a homicide investigation it just occurred to me that ill bet this is why dismas and frannie didnt come by last night hes still john holidays attorney isnt he abe nodded i would think so but nat exploded wait a minute what am i hearing here this man who killed sam hes with dismas he was abe said id bet he still is hes trying to get him off i havent heard holidays even been arrested yet dad but when he is yeah thats what diz does nat sat unhappily with this intelligence for a second hed do this this defense work for a man whos killed four people did you see what this animal did to those men last night he shook his head no id only heard theyd been killed only killed would have been mercy nat said he went on to tell his son some of the details hed picked up when he finished treya made a face of disgust then asked and holiday is wanted for all of these murders abe picked up something in her tone he wasnt going to pursue it aloud right here but in the past year he and treya had met john holiday a few times at the hardys he had seemed okay to abe treya had positively liked him and glitsky very much trusted his wifes instincts he had seen enough of killings and murderers that he considered almost anyone under the right conditions capable of the act but hed never seen a sign nor heard from hardy that holiday used drugs the great instigator of horrible irrational violence if holiday had been robbing silvermans store and got interrupted if creed had chased him into a blind alley maybe but the scenario with terry and wills as his father had just explained it what nat asked seeing the look between them abe hesitated then nothing he said rebecca sat down to the plate of scrambled eggs her father had cooked for her this morning hed cooked them for frannie and vincent as well but neither of them typically appeared at the breakfast table until ten minutes after the beck by this time whatever hot meal hardy had prepared would have cooledto him cold scrambled eggs were an affront to naturealthough his wife and son didnt seem to notice much less mind his daughter took a first bite said yum then looked around she didnt miss much and wasnt easy to fool wheres the paper she asked her father he casually sipped his coffee i dont know she put down her fork whats in it what do you mean whats in what the paper i just said i didnt know where it was she gave a threatrical sigh as if as if he repeated striving to match the teenage inflection she ignored that as if you didnt go out to the porch and get it like you do every single morning is it one of your clients it was his turn to sigh he and frannie had discussed it along with the spin they would put on the smashed car window and had decided it would be better for the kids if hardy could get a few facts about the crimes for which john holiday was likely to be arrested before he tried to explain it to them holiday wasnt exactly uncle john yet as uncle abe was but hed been by the house a few times in the past year almost immediately endearing himself to both children although for different reasons he treated rebecca in a sincere and courtly manner that flattered her vanity vincent he treated like a grown man no kid stuff he played catch with him arm wrestled had taken both hardy men to er and giants games as the kids had gotten older they had both become as hardy was addicts of the morning chronicle rebecca particularly loved the back page of the scene sectionthe columnists and the in crowd vincent emulating his dad would peruse jeff elliots citytalk column every day but his favorite was thursdays when mchugh and stienstra did their respective great stuff on the outdoors page hardy and frannie had promoted this interest from its first flowering over the comicsit was important to keep up on the news on what people thought what was happening in the world life wasnt lived in a vacuum but there could also be the occasional drawback as for example when your client and friend happened to be the main suspect in four murders two of them incredibly grotesque who is it rebecca asked hardy threw a glance at the ceiling then looked straight at her john holiday no way im afraid so not john theres no way dad what are they saying he did she was going to find out anyway still he hesitated then decided it would be impossible to soften it theyre saying he killed some people thats the stupidest thing i ever heard john wouldnt ever kill anybody he couldnt i dont think so either and what you do mean some four four dad come on its not me beck i dont think he killed anybody either but they found some evidence in his house he stopped reached out and put a hand over hers look beck im going to talk to him today then ill have a better idea where we stand but i didnt want you guys to see the paper this morning okay two of the but her temper was up and she cut him off what are they saying he did well thats just it you dont want to know not right now yes i do suddenly she pushed back from the table her chair fell over and she was on her feet hes my friend too you cant censor us like that hardy knew he sounded like a pathetic adult still he couldnt stop himself its not censoring its it is too where is it i want to see beck he was up too please dont but she ran by him through the kitchen and out to the little anteroom in the back where they stored their recyclables by the time he got to her shed already dug it out from where hed buried it she was emitting little whimpering noises as an injured puppy might finally she turned to him with her hand over her mouth her eyes overflowing oh god she said oh god then vincent was standing behind them what whats going on most of an hour got killed while hardy dropped his rental and picked up his own car with its new windshield again he stopped at the hospital again david had not improved when he finally arrived at s utter street it was close to nine oclock normally a bustling hour but the office had an extremely subdued feel the reception desk phylliss domain sat empty as he stood there one of the phones started ringing he just let it go the lights in the lobby had yet to be turned on the door to the office at the far end of the lobby that housed norma the office manager was closed and through the blinds he could see phyllis in there she seemed to be wiping at her eyes the solarium was empty no secretaries were gossiping by the coffee machinexerox area hardy took a few steps so he could see down the hallway and was relieved to see peoplesecretaries and paralegalsat their desks but most of the doors to the associates cubicles seemed to be closed people were hunkering down lying low one of the doors was open in the long hallway on the main floor and he walked down to it and looked inside amy wu was at her desk scribbling furiously on a yellow legal pad hardy knocked on the door and she looked up smiling feebly out of politeness hi hows david the same im sorry to report its pretty quiet out here is it i havent noticed jonmy paralegalhe called in sick so ive been running pages to word processing all morning ive got this memo that needs to be filed today so suddenly she stopped put her pencil all the way down im sorry who cares right how are you doing what happened to your hand he held it up stupid accident me im trying to get motivated to go upstairs and face some work join the club i think im the only one down here whos been able to get going on anything and thats only because id fire myself if i was late on this filing after all the work ive already done she motioned with her head everybody else well you noticed he nodded i cant blame anybody i feel the same way he paused took a breath came out with it but i wonder if i could ask you a favor then youll owe me one but sure what is it could you could keep an eye out down here give me a call when people start coming out their door getting back to work at her questioning look he added i was hoping i could tap some of the talent down here i need some people in a hurry if we want to keep up with depositions on panos were talking megahours something was going on in wus brain her eyes narrowed then she nodded sure first sign of life ill buzz you thanks in fact after youre done with your memo maybe but she was shaking her head no i cant diz im overwhelmed especially if davids out for a while ive got to call jon at home though it just occurred to me if hes not really sick if he just decided this was a sinking ship she stopped and sighed heavily if he dies then what is all this keeping up with his work just me being stupid hes still got clients amy theyre still going to need good lawyers thats what davids been training you for isnt it its why i need a few bodies around here david or no david panos is going to be huge so youre really going ahead on that i really am he narrowed his eyes of course i am why would you even ask that no reason really but after wrestling with herself for a minute she came out with it ive just heard some rumors around here that thats why david got beat up that it had to do with panos with scaring him off evidently david himself mentioned something about it to graham talking about his bulletproof self of course now with thiseverybodys heard it by nowso even if youre assigning billable hours people might be a little reluctant especially with you not really in the firm this was the first time hardy had run up against this question hed always considered his irregular status visavis freeman amp associates an unalloyed good thing he was merely the upstairs tenant and friend of the firms owner and as such was neither fish nor fowlnot associate not partner not even of counsel and a bit of a loose cannon at that he loved the freedom of it the independence when david threw him work he was often happy to take it but now he wondered if he could successfully assign it back to the formal associates who in davids longterm absence to say nothing of his death might be out pounding the pavement for work before too long among the associates hardy thought he could count on graham russo who had once been his client and with whom he still had a good personal relationship and maybe in a week or moreafter she worked down her current loadhe might be able to use amy but other help from among davids legions was problematic at best and if david died the ancillary supportnorma and phyllis and the secretaries and paralegals who worked with the other associateswould all dry up overnight with his limited resources hardy wouldnt stand a chance he could promise all the billable hours in the world but none of the associates would be laboring under any illusion since it was a contingency lawsuit if they didnt win those hours would be written off and what could he pay them in the meanwhile hardy couldnt float an island of suits betting on the come the way freeman could the panos lawsuit would be over before it began it was a morning of first revelations aside from his realization about the tenuousness of his position among the associates for the first time it struck him how effective the violence against freeman had been was especially if he didnt survive far from being the blunt instrument it had first appeared to be the mugging was effectively a scalpel that separated him both from the lawsuit and the other associates for the sad truth was that hardy alone had no power in the panos matter the plaintiffs were all the clients of david freeman not dismas hardy some he hadnt even met hardy wasnt any kind of real player any kind of significant danger or threat to panos but merely a fly to be flicked away without a second thought the realization washed over him like an acid bath he must have shown it diz are you all right he flashed a false grin fine he said im fine im just thinking about how to do all ive got today if norma comes out of her office would you ask her to please give me a call hardys office was one flight up from the lobby the only occupied room on the third floor he took the stairs two at a time his office door was closed but a light shone under it from within he stopped short of the opening heard a quiet and dull but unmistakable thud then after a moment another onesomeone was pounding something against his wall while he waited for hardy to arrive putting down his briefcase he stealthily tried the knob which didnt give at all hed had enough experience with muggings and surprise mischief over the past couple of days that he wasnt anxious to get any more and he turned back to the stairway the police could be here in ten minutes and whoever had broken into his office could explain it all to them halfway down the stairs a voice stopped him diz holiday stood at the top of the stairs grinning down at him holding three darts up i thought i heard somebody pounding on up the stairs but i wanted to finish my round where are you going hardy climbed back up the seven steps hed just descended i was just going to call the police john that would have been a good time he reached the landing again and led the way inside then closed the door behind holiday how did you get in here wasnt the door locked it was and what were you doing just shooting some darts there was a bunch of keys down at the reception desk and nobody was there i thought youd be up here in your office to tell you the truth then when you werent i figured id just let myself in i put the keys back good for you this place is a ghost town today where is everybody its a legal holiday hardy said it without a trace of irony hmm well but youre here i notice although you are a little late arent you hardy wasnt even slightly in the mood to explain his various delays of the morning especially since the beginning of it all had been the breakdown of his children over the very client he now faced we had an appointment hardy said by way of explanation except if you remember you were supposed to call me do you remember that wasnt that what we decided holiday shrugged and walked back over to the dart line either way were talking hardy got around his desk and put his briefcase on the top of it thats true john but im your attorney and i happen to know that theres a warrant out for your arrest so all i can do now as i thought i explained rather clearly last night is help you turn yourself in hardys voice took on an edge how about putting those things down a minute and talking to me immediately holiday whirled all contrition he placed his two remaining darts on hardys desk and spread his hands apologetically i thought we were talking what happened to your hand hardy glanced down at his bandaid splint he was going to have to invent a witty response pretty soon but he didnt have the energy for it right now i whacked it against something he sat down behind his desk look im sorry john but im a little stressed but i suppose you are too naw its just another arrest warrant holiday went over to the couch plopped himself down on it so what do you think whats the plan i wish i had one im assuming youre not inclined to give yourself up good guess well as your attorney thats all im allowed to suggest how about not as my attorney i havent paid you anything have i cant we just be friends hardys mouth turned up an inch cant we all just get along exactly and apparently not too well but you and me we could but even as just your friend im still harboring you and youre a fugitive holiday shrugged tell them i held you hostage or something though it might not be a bad idea you know turning yourself in holidays eyes went wide youre out of your mind diz i wouldnt last fifteen minutes in jail why not youve been there before it wouldnt be any worse than last time yeah except this time someone would kill me why would they do that because thats what these guys are doing diz think about it im the only one left and the case is closed as soon as im dead its a tight little package nobody goes looking for who really did it and who are these people a grin flickered around hardys mouth youre saying theyre cops they can get you in jail they planted stuff in my apartment the cops did why i dont know why but its not as farfetched as you think it happens im sure it does john im sure it does hardy scratched at the top of his desk blotter look humor me a minute if youve got solid alibis for all the murders we could press for a quick prelim and have you out of there and cleared of all this in a week or two at the most not if im dead first thats not going to happen not in jail do you know where you were when any of these last three men got killed sure two of them randy and clint im positive i was at work in fact you know a cop came by the ark the other day before i even knew about randy and clint and asked me if id been tending bar there the night before what do you mean a cop a real cop sfpd i thought so the badge looked right some chinese guy he wasnt with panos ill tell you that and he asked you what just if id been working at midnight the night before and could i prove it i told him yeah and it seemed to satisfy him thats why im blown away they got a warrant for me i mean they know i didnt kill clint and randy i dont get it so what about creed same thing it was a work night though there werent as many customers but somebody would remember so maybe they think i wasnt the actual shooter with creed anyway i was just in cahoots with clint and randy holiday had gone into a full recline on the sofa his hands crossed behind his head hardy sat for a long moment picking at the bandaid you mind telling me again where you were the night silverman got it last time we talked about it not to put too fine a point on it your alibi sucked holiday got himself up to sitting again he ran a hand through his hair tugged at the side of his mustache when he spoke he wore a sheepish expression if you want to know the truth my girlfriend and i had a fight and i went out and picked up somebody else who i couldnt find again to save my life thats what it might be john to save your life he shook his head did you go to her house hardy asked yeah well apartment i think so where was it she drove holiday said i dozed i dont know what about in the morning holiday made a face there wasnt any morning i left right after anyway i think i wandered around a bit drunk possibly likely hardy frowned which means you really have no alibi at all for silverman is that right he didnt wait for an answer so where did you call from yesterday my girlfriends a beat another one the real one the one you broke up with on thursday yeah her names michelle im staying at her place im happy for you thats so special so the story about the important mans wife i made it up great hardy said swell let me ask you this the paper said you lost a lot of money at silvermans game the night before he died is that true okay but i didnt go to steal it back i didnt diz i swear to you you swear to me that helps you swore to me about your alibi hardy shook his head angrily it might have been nice to know some of this a week ago collecting himself he drew in a long slow breath and let it out heavily okay john suddenly my idea that you turn yourself in because you couldnt have committed any of the murders isnt so doable any one of them is good enough he looked straight at him how am i supposed to believe you didnt do this after all you got any suggestions im telling you you know me diz right but these lies john i cant think of a reason youd lie to a friend if you werent trying to hide something i felt bad about the way things had gone with michelle i didnt want to bring her into it thats the truth i swear to god hardy was still working on his response to that when on his desk the telephone rang his direct line he reached for it dismas hardy listening for a moment he sat up straighter uttered a syllable or two listened some more he put a ringer to his lips and pointed at holiday he talked into the receiver sure i read all about it this morning i wondered whether as he spoke he reached out and pushed down on the button breaking the connection in his midsentence that was a homicide inspector named russell he said asking if id seen you recently somebody must have told him that i represented you last time and he thought you might have looked me up again that was probably me he and his partner came by the bar and you gave them my name yeah terrific john just great youre batting about a thousand here with bad moves i know diz i know im sorry did he say where he was he didnt get a chance we can hope it was the hall but i think youd be smart to get out of here right now i dont want to know where you are when they ask me which they will id be surprised if they think youre here now but to be safe go down through the garage and out the back now go call me in an hour well think of something ill be here go go when the phone rang a minute later hardy picked it up again inspector russell sorry about that were having the devil of a time with the phones lately here i dont know what it is except aggravating you too huh i think its everybody but you were asking about john holiday im afraid i dont know where he is hes no longer my client russell said hed talked to holiday just two days before and hed mentioned hardy by name as his attorney said they were close friends saw each other all the time i hate to say this inspector hardy said but the mans been known to lie sure anytime good luck the lab tests from the terrywills crime scene indicated that the stuff on the shoe in terrys closet closely matched the gunk thieu had collected at the creed scene the day beforebrake fluid animal fats peanuts and pepper flakes no doubt from kung pao chicken thieu was at his desk comparing the written transcription of a taped recording of one of his witnesss interviews to the tape itself while russell was on the phone with holidays lawyer trying to track the suspect down cuneo read over the lab report on the shoe and decided to thank the veteran inspector and to share the good news with him pretty cool huh thieu put the report down thats enough matches for me its the same stuff all right nice work and i see you found more evidence at holidays place its been a lucky couple of days cuneo said if you believe in luck what do you mean by that nothing really its just so rare when things fall together so well i said the same thing to gerson but what am i supposed to do look a gift horse in the mouth this is about as solid as it gets thieu made no comment to that he had put down the transcript and his pencil now he took off his earphones and hooked them around his neck he looked piercingly at cuneo after i left the terrywills scene yesterday did you find anything that put holiday there not directly no but later in the day we did find money and jewelry from silvermans at his place thieu acknowledged that with a nod i heard about that but no bloody clothes or shoes anything tying him directly to terry and wills there was an awful lot of blood he hadnt been back there where he lived there were three or four days worth of newspapers down on his stoop ah that would explain it then maybe he slept in his bar i dont know or hes shacked up with somebody cuneo had pulled a chair around and was straddling it backward he started tapping a beat with his fingers but thats a good call well check the dumpsters and alleys between the ark and terrys you cant ever have too much i dont believe thieu leaned back in his chair and folded his hands over his middle then he smiled politely and wishing cuneo luck again said he had to get back to his editing holidays phone call did not come one hour later as hardy had suggested so he had filled his increasingly wideopen morning with visits downstairs to lessthanenthusiastic associates and calls to his deposition witnesses in the panos suit he needed to bring them up to date on freemans condition and rearrange his calendar so that they could get back on some kind of schedule by say the middle of next week if david still wasnt up to appearing then hardy would try to go it alone or with minimal help for a while it galled him but he knew he might have to revisit the question of krolls settlement offerfour million was starting to look pretty good to him about now but whether that or any offer was still on the table was uncertain hardy himself had already billed something in the order of three hundred hours to the matter in the past four months and now stood to lose all of that time and money if he couldnt make some magic in the relatively short term so he talked to clients and filled time three full hours after holiday had ducked out of his office his callwaiting signal went off in his mind by now he had just about come to the conclusion that inspector russell had staked out his office after all and that john had been arrested leaving it and that after he was processed hardy would get the phone call he asked the client to hold a second connected to the other line no hello no identification of any kind just the words big dick repeated twice then a dead line after he finished talking to the client hardy hung up and stared into the empty space between his desk and his dartboard the voice had been holidays and he had obviously formed the impression that hardys phone might be tapped hardy reflected that he also thought someone might kill him in jail he might have found this paranoia amusing if he had any patience left hardy thought about it for another thirty or forty seconds then stood threw the last two of holidays morning darts into his boardtwo elevensand walked out making sure the door was locked behind him in the lobby some semblance of normalcy had returned phyllis had returned to reception and her presence was somehow reassuring one of the associates sat with a client visible through the glass walls of the solarium normas door was open and he saw her at her desk talking on the telephone above all a slight but audible hum permeated the open space people were here trying to carry on okay he thought okay when hardy pulled his car out of the garage he saw that the day had become overcast again gray with hovering wisps and banks of fog that he drove into and out of as he fought the noon traffic he decided that the first thing he would do when he got to holiday was have the billing conversation friends or no friends he was going to get a retainer up front before doing any work for john holiday he couldnt afford to work for free anymore he was going to charge his top defense fee and three times that for every minute he spent in the courtroom holiday could sell his bar or his duplex to cover his costs for all hardy cared he was done with charity fortunately the phrase big dick meant something to hardy besides the standard readingit was holidays name for coit tower the phallic landmark and vista point at the apex of telegraph hill hardy had worked himself up to a fine fettle by the time he serpentined up the winding streets and reached the parking lot this spot with its mounted binoculars all along its retaining wall was premier sightseeing turfalcatraz the golden gate bridge sausalito and the marin headlands seemingly a stones throw across the bay at this time of day normally the lot was cluttered with vacationers and tourist buses but as hardy pulled into one of the parking spaces and opened his car doorhed had his windshield wipers going from halfway up the hillhe marveled at the sense of desertion the place was wrapped in a thick bonechilling gauze of cloud and drizzle he could barely make out the tower itself looming there right behind him he was completely alone up here today his car the only one in the lot leave it to holiday he thought why couldnt they meet at some restaurant or even his new girlfriends house hell anyplace else would be more convenient and comfortable than here but of course holiday hadnt given hardy any chance to argue or suggest an alternative and now there was no sight of him here either hardy looked again back toward the tower out over the low retaining wall into the empty fog john he yelled into the nothingness he walked halfway through the lot into the very middle of it toward the tower he called out again turned waited cupped his hands around his mouth hey john ollie ollie oxen free i havent heard that in forever jesus christ when hardy landed he whirled around and found himself facing holiday who stood a foot in front of him grinning where did you just come from right here did i scare you i did didnt i no i always levitate when the fogs in hardy put his hand over his heart god a little jolt like thats good for you clears the arteries well theyre clear then now all ive got to do is start breathing again he looked all around great place you picked here especially today why dont we get in my car before we freeze to death you make any decision they started moving about what oh i dont know how about hardy paused as out of the corner of his eye he noticed a gray sedan pulling slowly into the lot maybe fifty or sixty feet off to his right the driverside window all the way down possibly gave him some subliminal sense that something was not right and he instinctively grabbed holidays arm just above the elbow what before he could answer the car suddenly accelerated and turned hard to its left exposing them to the passengerside window from which an arm protruded hardy could be wrong and look like a fool or they could both be dead in two seconds it wasnt a hard choice down get down he yelled hardy crouched and pushed holiday away then hit the pavement rolling himself as two quick shots then two more exploded behind him he rolled again and came up running and stumbling his dress shoes slipping on the wet surface under him toward the protection of the retaining wall behind him tires screeched two more shots deafening in rapid succession the low wall directly in front of him pinged with a ricochet he saw the gray mist of a shatter of concrete felt a scratch across his cheek had the bullet hit him but he was still moving he had to keep moving forward and then he was over the wall rolling and sliding steeply downhill under the canopy of low evergreen and bramble the thick trunk of an ancient cypress stopped his free fall and knocked the breath out of him a murderous blow high on his ribs under his arm but he didnt stop were they still up there had he heard another peal of rubber did it mean the car was gone whatever he was still exposed forcing himself to roll he half collapsed into the fall line of the slope and didnt come to rest again until he was within a first down of lombard street still within the treeline sheltered from below and hidden from above he couldnt move never wanted to move again his ribs was he shot in shock the silence all around him was complete the fog enveloping but now not cold he was sweating heavily his breath came in gasps the pain from his broken left finger kicked in again agony he squeezed at the skin around his mouth took his hand away and saw blood he rubbed at his cheeka faint sting a smear of red suddenly aware of movement behind him and to his right up the slope he turned and saw holiday traversing half sliding toward him but he was moving smoothly quickly unhurt he was with hardy in seconds diz you all right hardy tried a deep breath his ribs hurt but he could breathe he definitely wasnt shot the scratch on his cheekhed done worse damage shaving then they were both on their feet dusting themselves off checking back up the hill a car passed below them on lombard and they both froze until they saw it was a large white suv nothing like the gray sedan for a moment neither man could find anything to say the right arm of hardys suit coat hung by a thread and he shrugged himself out of it and rolled it into a ball under it his shirt too was badly ripped at the sleeve holiday reached over and flicked at the tear ive got to get myself a real lawyer clothes make the man diz he said you look like absolute shit from a certain point there was only one way up or down telegraph hill and deciding they didnt like the odds of taking the only street up where their assailants might still be lurking they made it back to the retaining wall uphill through the trees and brush hardys car was still the only one parked in the lot right there ten feet away crouching he got to the door and opened it got his cell phone made it back behind the retaining wall he and holiday moved a few yards back down the slope where they could still see any activity within the lot but there was none okay youve got your phone now what now i call the police i dont think so not while im here so you go but im reporting this why what are you going to say im going to tell them what happened and then what theyre going to investigate theyre going to find something you dont already know and thank you for it i dont know john what do i already know you know somebody followed you here and tried to kill us your pal freemans in the hospital put it together its panos im not arguing with you john im telling you the cops need to know it too and then theyll move right on it thats the theory holiday shook his head man youre hopeless twentyfive long minutes passed before the patrol car showed up in that time two tour buses had pulled up into the center of the lot the exact spot where holiday had surprised hardy additionally several cars had arrived and parked willynilly all around it had turned hardy was thinking into a goddamned tourist extravaganza a fitful breeze had blown off the worst of the fog revealing the usual stunning panorama a knot of japanese tourists in overcoats had gathered at the retaining wall where the bullet had chipped it near the front of hardys car they were enthusiastically sharing the mounted pay binoculars and exclaiming over the view hardy didnt even see it his ribs throbbed hed turned the cars heater on so he was no longer cold but he was still shaking as he opened his door and raised his hand to call the blackandwhite car over he was struck with a sense of the surreal nature of the whole afternoon of what hed gone through of what he was doing now when hed first returned from vietnam before hed gone to law school hardy had been a cop walking a beat with abe glitsky he liked cops empathized with them generally understood their concerns prejudices methods and now here were two more twin tight ends named jakes and warren and at a glance very much like the men from the other night with his windshield in north beach hardworking sincere dedicatedand most importantly living every day in the line of fire which tended to breed a certain defensiveness even cynicism they pulled over and parked in the space next to him got out of their car together expressed their concern over hardys appearance asked him if he needed medical attention which he declined finally officer warren took out a pad of paper and the interview began so what happened here dispatch said there was a report of a shooting you mean right here checking out the tour buses around them warren couldnt quite picture it hardy really couldnt blame him this was about an hour ago and the place was pea soup with fog you couldnt see twenty feet there was nobody else up here nobody not a soul the two cops looked at each other but warrens expression remained neutral just myself and a client id come here to meet hardy knew this would be tricky but once hed decided to call the police he had to tell them the truth it was the only way the system worked so he told them about holiday but the truth wasnt scoring points jakes broke in to ask you mean to say that this client of yours hes wanted for murder theres a warrant out thats right so where is he now i dont know you dont know jakes repeated hardy started to shrug his ribs stopped him when i called you he thought it would be smart to leave i couldnt really argue with him you didnt try to make him stay warren asked of course hardy kept it lowkey i told him he should turn himself in he might be safer in jail after all but he didnt see it that way hardy met their eyes in turn but the point is that he was here earlier with me if you dont mind id like to get back to what happened finally jakes said okay shoot hardy gave it to them succinctly in less than five minutes we waited for a while down there at the bottom he concluded then climbed back up here through the brush wait a minute jakes said he walked over to the retaining wall and looked down you came back up through that why didnt you use the road hardy explained but by now no longer felt they believed him he walked them over to where the tour buses were parked describing the gray sedan and its course through the thenempty parking lot hardy had distinctly heard the tires squeal but the pavement had been wet and now there was no sign of skid marks six shots had been fired but no one had been hit and there were no bullet casings the chipped cement at the retaining wall could have happened an hour or a week or six years ago back where hed parked he said i know how weird this sounds but it happened he indicated his own ruined clothes his face i didnt do this to myself really and my partner david freeman is in the icu right now mugged a few days ago thats real and verifiable so is the fact that somebody smashed my windshield a couple of days ago in north beach there ought to be a report of that on file so youre saying you think you know who did this all this stuff warren asked yes sir his name is wade panos hes a patrol special you may know him and youre saying you think hes trying to kill you and your partner i do and what about your client holiday how does he fit in with all this that hardy said uneasily gets a little complicated clarence jackman did not normally hold open offie hours for defense attorneys nor for anyone else after a long and successful career in the private sector jackman a darkly hued africanamerican sixtyfiveyearold physically imposing and impeccably dressed had been appointed to his position of district attorney of san francisco by the mayor about three years ago since then hed come to appreciate the power and influence that came with the job to the extent that he was committed to running for election to his second term he was now even more so than when hed been in the lofty reaches of the private sector a true august personage but abe as well as trey a glitsky who was his personal secretary considered him something of a friend so did dismas hardy and for that matter so did david freeman all of these people along with gina roake and a few others had been regularly meeting at lou the greeks for a couple of years with the da and serving as his informal kitchen cabinet so when hardy had called requesting a meeting with the da saying he needed a word with jackman right away treya cleared it with her boss and set to work rescheduling the afternoon when he actually arrived battered worn and dirty and gimped his way into the outer office sans coat his hands and face scratched and bloody she ushered him directly in closing the door behind them after expressing his genuine concern and making sure hardy was comfortable in one of the offices easy chairs jackman listened with his trademark intensity he sat slumped at the near end of the couch leaning heavily on an elbow the thumb of his right hand under his chin the ringers regularly caressing the side of his mouth when hardy finished jackman sat still for a very long while hardy knew better than to interrupt his thoughts or try to prompt him at length the da straightened up slightly and looked hardy in the face panos a nod yes sir hardy knew that jackman couldnt take this as anything like good news it was no secret that panos contributed to every major political campaign in the city so that no matter who won he never lost influence you seriously believe hes behind these attacks not personally probably not but some of his people yes youll pardon me for saying soyoure obviously upset right now diz and i cant say i blame youbut that seems like just one hell of a reach wades not a gangster with respect clarence maybe youd like to take a look at some of my deposition testimony hes not exactly mr clean jackman shook his head maybe not hes in a tough field where admittedly some of his tactics especially with let us say not the cream of society might have come close to crossing the line but here youre talking attempted murder of regular citizens theres a huge difference and frankly i cant see wade going there why would he even risk it maybe because david and i were threatening to put him out of business and how would you do that do you think he doesnt have insurance no he has insurance well then a pause you know and i know how it works diz panos sees this as just another nuisance lawsuit in all probability he wont personally pay a dime even if it goes to trial which it probably wont all parties will settle its not personal hardy sat back take a look at me clarence id say its gotten personal im going to try like hell to shut him down i want the son of a bitch in jail jackman sighed well but all right so then assuming youre successful hed be out of business hes close to retirement age anyway he might even welcome the break he came forward to the edge of the couch and spoke with a quiet intensity look diz theres no denying that something bad is going on david and then you today im willing to concede that theyre related hell theyd all but have to be but related doesnt mean it has to be wade except that it is jackman frowned if it is there are two very good and experienced inspectors investigating davids mugging and they should come up with something two two jackman played it as a trump it may not be clear to you diz but i myself am really really pissed off about david i dont think you or anybody else has any idea how angry i am so i asked dan rigbythe chief of policeto assign another inspector to assist hector blanca they had the csi team out all morning combing the site and you know how often that happens for a simple mugging never but it happened now and it happened because i wanted it to and they get anything else they need too ive even given the investigation an event number this was a huge commitment from jackman the assignment of an event number meant that all expenses related to the event were paid out of the citys general fund and not out of any departments budget it essentially meant unlimited resources jackman continued so if they find anything that points to wade panoshell i dont care if it points to the pope ill charge him or whoever it is so fast itll make your head spin in his agitation jackman had stood up he leaned back against his desk arms crossed so if youve got even a small show of proof that wades any part of this of you or david id like to hear about it right now hardy sat silent wrestling with how far he should push this thing its not just me and david he said and its not attempted murder its murder and in fact its more than one his patience clearly frayed jackman nevertheless nodded cautiously im listening hardy launched into his conspiracy theory that led through silverman and creed terry and wills and on up to the arrest warrant that had been issued for his client jackmans scowl had grown darker as the recitation progressed by the time hardy finished with the suggestion that the da convene a grand jury to investigate panoss companyhe was sure theyd find something tying at least his employees to these murdersjackman finally lost his temper albeit in his quiet fashion in other words your client didnt kill these people panos did now hes a murderer yes sir and what about the police about the evidence theyve collected the witnesses theyve talked to the da kept talking if im not mistaken diz when you defend people its often not because they didnt do something but because no one can prove what they did do isnt that right yes but but without proof of any kind youre telling me you know your client is innocent and that in his place wade panos is guilty am i stating your position accurately hardy spread his hands im saying its worth looking into thats all no thats not all as a matter of fact you want me to use the power of this office to investigate a private citizen who happens to be your opponent in a lawsuit clarence thats neither here but jackman raised a finger please let me finish and at the same time you accuse this same private citizen of the very crimes your own client stands accused of and all in the name of what of davids mugging is what it comes down to and the rage i feel about that if i didnt believe i knew you so well i might be tempted to think you were a cynical lawyer trying to manipulate the da to harm his adversaries thats not any but again jackman stopped him let me tell you something diz if one of your clients suggested you try something like this to me youd laugh at him if you were wades lawyer and i called you in to talk about any of these charges youd laugh at me wheres the proof wheres any sign of proof im betting its out there well if it is apparently neither you nor the police have found it and what they have found seems to implicate your client rather strongly from what i hear he crossed back and took the chair next to hardy where he leaned forward with some intimacy the vitriol seemed to have passed diz look whats happened to you today its got you shook up what youre telling me is that sometimes the process doesnt workyou and i both know that no ones looking in the right direction clarence im sure the police are looking where the evidence leads thats what they do and theyre never wrong are they and this finally was the wrong note jackmans shoulders fell and sighing heavily he stood up and went over behind his desk i encourage you to make sure the report on what happened to you and your client today is complete i will talk to chief rigby and try to make sure that inspector blanca gets a team out to coit tower before every trace of what happened to you is gone thank you he was standing up the meeting was over but jackman stopped him a last time before he got to the door diz hardy turned back jackman was pointing a finger for emphasis i want to be crystal clear here if we ever do get to the point where we can charge panos with something and theres any suggestion that the criminal charges were brought because youre my friend rather than because theres evidence sufficient to convict this case wont just go down the tubes itll embarrass us both capisce capisce so we wont ever have to talk about this again right more than anything else hardy wanted to go home he knew he looked a mess his ribs ached his whole left hand throbbed anew but it was already early friday afternoon and though he might get lucky with blanca deciding to pull weekend work his luck wasnt something he wanted to count on not today again the inspector for general work was in when hardy gave his name and they called blanca he said to bring hardy back to his area but when hardy got there blanca looked right through him until hardy spoke sergeant blanca blancas eyes settled on him recognition dawned mr hardy sorry i thought i was waiting for a man in a business suit what the hell happened to you thats why im here well blanca got halfway out of his chair come on back where we can talk he got hardy settled brought him some water picking up some of the details as he did so the smashed windshield the report hed be getting from the responding officers on the coit tower shooting today blanca wrote the names down made a note to look them up finally the sergeant got seated in his chair so youre thinking it was the same person who shot at you two people at least hardy said okay two maybe three and you say these might be the same people who beat up mr freeman hardy nodded ive got no proof none at all as mr jackman just reminded me but yes im lets say morally certain its the same guys last time you didnt want to give me a name but i did tell you about a lawsuit we were preparing sure suddenly his eyes alight with possibility blanca pulled the yellow legal pad hed written the officers names on up in front of him you also said that in twenty years or so of practice you hadnt ever seen anybody take it out on the lawyers true but im seeing it now blanca quickly took in his disheveled appearance again so you got a name now wade panos blanca reacted almost as if hed been struck the patrol special actually the king of the patrol specials he put his pencil down his people especially a thugi think hes wades nephewnamed nick sephia blanca didnt need to consult any notes ive heard of him im not surprised when he worked for his uncle his specialty was planting dope on working girls but hes been known to hit people too now hes muscle for the diamond center a real sweetheart finding a receptive official audience a nice change of pace hardy leaned back in his chair jackman tells me you got a partner to help with the freeman investigation yeah blanca said but what investigation we dont got witness one to interview and freeman still isnt telling us anything he looked up with some real sadness anyway even with csi going over the place a second time we got nothing and i mean nothing so unless somebody walks in off the street and confesses the investigation as you call it is closed i was thinking maybe what just happened to me might reopen it if there were two of you maybe you could shake a tree or two at least see if sephias got an alibi blanca shook his head skeptically thats an awful cold trail and if he had partners theyd cover each other anyway okay but im not a cold trail somebody shot at me in the last two hours sephias someplace to start maybe you can find out what he was doing no maybe about it but you didnt see him hardy shook his head i saw the car gray sedan late model then the gun which im afraid took all of my attention blanca chuckled yeah they tend to do that i guess i just wanted to put whats happened to me on your radar as part of freeman which of course i cant prove but if you could find anything either up at coit tower or talking to sephia hey im hearing you im on it it wasnt the kind of story he was dying to tell his wife in a fair just and kind world she wouldnt have been home in the middle of this friday afternoon and he could run upstairs shower change into a new suit or even some hangout clothesoh with david out of the office there wasnt much to do so i thought id spend some extra time with you and the darlings he could bury his ruined clothes under something in the garbage can explain away his scrapes with a humorous anecdote about one of his clients vicious cats except that frannie was sitting on some cushions in the bay window in the living room studying and saw him when he got up on the porch she made it to the door and opened it before he did what happened its not as bad as it looks he said twenty minutes later he was soaking in a hot bath upstairs aside from the scratches on his hands and his face the upper right quarter of his back was badly scraped and already swollen frannie sat on the edge of the tub twisting a towel anxiously as they talked i must be missing something then she said so who shot silverman that i dont know not specifically maybe sephia which gets you to panos right maybe if he even knew about it he let out a breath but there were three of them and another problem ive got the same people killing silverman and creed right okay so why did creed have to get killed so he wouldnt get to tell the homicide cops he wasnt sure about identifying john and his friends right and who does that benefit the real killers whoever they might be exactly so then they decideactually they probably decided at the same time as creedif they do away with terry and wills its going to look like john its got to the cops still were working with the three names and theres nobody else left so they plant the silvermancreed gun and some of the silverman loot in both places and bingo but they really dont want john arrested no they want him dead then all the questions stop because theres nobody around to ask them its just lowlifes purging each other from the gene pool its a tightly wrapped selfcontained case and everybody involved is dead not exactly theres still you he looked up at her shaking his head they had us both there for a minute but how could they have known about that that youd be together i dont know for sure but id bet they figured john would eventually come to my office or id go to him so they just decided theyd tail me for a while and everything worked like a dream except i saw them in time so if it isnt about davids case after all why did they attack him or us for that matter with the windshield maybe its both that seems like such a reach dismas im sorry but it really does hardy nodded ruefully those were jackmans exact words i believe and planting evidence in two apartments does that really happen are you sure john wasnt at silvermans he hesitated then shook his head no or that this nick sephia was no answer frannie tsked twisted the towel some more stood up and walked over to the door i mean i cant imagine john killing anybody either but he sure didnt kill his bartender and his boyfriend frannie not that way i dont believe that okay i cant see that either she turned back to face him maybe you could talk to the man whos got abes old job no thats not going to happen why not because hes got a suspect and im the guys lawyer my only function is to deliver john so they can arrest him as i mentioned to you the other night as a defense attorney i have no interest in justice only in getting my client off but abe used to talk to you about cases and its one of the things i always loved about him but it got him in trouble more than once and hes already told me he wont talk about this one he might though when he finds out they shot at you that might make it different he shifted in the tub and an involuntary groan escaped finally he got through the pain its worth a try i guess he said ive got to do something she was over by him again she sat on the edge of the tub put a hand gently on his shoulder youre not going to want to hear this but maybe you should consider dropping this lawsuit see what happens to david then take it from there he gave it a minute of real consideration it might get to that anyway i cant afford to keep it going by myself although i might be able to talk one of the big firms into taking it on it would be a big payday if you win there is always that but what id really like is to try to bluff them into making another settlement offer at least pay for expenses and the time ive already worked although i cant believe this thing this morning was about that with freeman out of the way the things going to pretty much dry up on its own anyway so im thinking it had to be mostly about john she rubbed her hand over the skin of his shoulder you want to hear another hard one from you anything unhappy she came out with it you could always drop him too dismas he sighed hung his head no he said finally its tempting as hell and maybe he deserves it but that i cant do and meanwhile someones trying to kill you maybe maybe me or maybe john probably not me notice the clever rationalization even though they broke your windshield and shot at you theyre not really after you he smiled at her im not saying its impossible just unlikely besides ive finally got this sergeant blanca looking at sephia if he finds anything and i bet he will then suddenly it all falls into place im talking silverman and the rest the murders it all falls into place how does it do that inevitably hardy going for the light touch but he couldnt quite pull it off what do you mean how does it do what how does it go from you and david getting attacked to the murders i mean whats the point of contact that connects them because from where i sit i must tell you i only see one and what is that john holiday blanca had what he considered a legitimately hot lead and wasted no time after hardy left he picked up the phone got information and found the number of georgia aaa he endured the usual runaround for a few minutes until he was finally connected to the diamond centers chief of security who told him that nick sephia was off today he was taking a threeday weekend a good sign blanca thought if he was off it left him free to drive around in a gray sedan and cause mischief so all right he knew where sephia wasnt the trick now was to find where he was the obvious answer was wgppanoss companyand sometimes obvious worked the efficientsounding woman in the panos office said she had no idea where nick sephia washe no longer worked for the companybut she took his number and said shed try to reach wade and have him call back three minutes later his phone rang and it was the man himself his tone was relaxed do you mind sergeant if i ask what this is about not at all i wanted to have a few words with nick sephia i tried where he works but hes taking a day off and you think i know where he might be i understand hes your nephew thats right panos paused and you think i might know where he is how many nephews do you have sergeant do you know where any of them are if hes not at work hes probably at home and i dont know his address offhand somewhere near gough i think maybe weve got it or his phone number in some files back at the office though he worked for me for a while but you probably already knew that yes sir but you know my little brother roy hangs out with him sometimes i could page him and see hes on the beat today id appreciate that good but you still havent told me what this is about i thought i did i wanted to have a few words with him panos chuckled excuse me sergeant but as one cop to another you can cut the bullshit okay the question is what do you want to have a few words with him about blanca thought for a minute his possible involvement in a crime a violent crime after a rather long hesitation panos spoke in a heavy tone of sadness i hate to hear that i was hoping he was doing better i heard he was what with the new job and everything hes got a temper sergeant but hes a good boy this wasnt temper blanca said and whoever did it wasnt a good boy panos sighed god poor rosie his mother what that womans been through he sighed again why dont i page roy see if he can help you oh but one thing yes sir im curious how you knew that nick used to work for me or that he was my nephew for that matter somebody i talked to knew him blanca said oh yeah was the guys name hardy by any chance it was just a witness i cant give out the name no of course you cant but you might like to know not saying it was him that this guy hardy and i are involved in some big litigationhes a lawyer in fact hes a sleazy lawyer if you want to know the truthand hes not going according to hoyle panos spent a minute or so outlining some of the salient points of the lawsuitthe plaintiffs and some of the issues and money involved he concluded earnestly look the truth is the guy makes things up if he needs to if things arent going his way im not saying he has anything to do with your questions about nicknicks a hothead all right but this hardy is well known for being unethical seriously unethical do yourself a favor and ask around only if it was him you heard about nick from of course anyway theres my warning for what its worth and you can probably expect a call from roy any minute it came as advertised and roy told blanca that nick and a friend of his had gone up to nevada last night to spend the weekend gamblinghe was a serious poker player before the crowded and crazy snow season began next month roy was planning on going up and joining them tonight when he got off work he expected theyd probably be just hanging around the cabin they rented during the daythey hit the clubs at night but roy had the cabins number if the sergeant would like it the area code was nevada no this is julio rez but nicks here hold on this is nick whos this blanca had never spoken to sephia before and so had no idea if this was truly him on the telephone but it seemed an impossibly elaborate ruse for someone to cook up in the fifteen minutes or less since hed first called panoss office it would never be proof in a court of law but blanca personally had no doubt that he was talking to nick sephia and that if hed driven where he was in no traffic he was four hours east of where blanca sat now which meant conclusively that he hadnt shot at dismas hardy three hours ago what it meant about hardy blanca couldnt quite say he wanted to trust and even like the guy because of david freeman and what had happened to him but now suddenly he didnt have a good feeling even about that blanca looked at the receiver in his hand he had everything he needed from nick sephia he hung up strikeout at the end of the day at the end of the week things were getting a little hot in barry gersons office in the homicide detail the small and airless place was packed with mostly large men and all of them were standing the two squad car officers who had responded to the coit tower call jakes and warren had come directly up at the end of their shift that had started the whole thing they knew that whatever had happened that noon at coit towerand they were very skepticalthe fugitive and murder suspect john holiday had been part of it if they did nothing else they felt they had to take their information to homicide as soon as he determined what the officers visit was about gerson had naturally called in both cuneo and russell who were finishing up some paperwork getting ready to go home after hed hung up on nick sephia hector blanca had had a full and interesting afternoon looking up and noting the name panos on the report on dismas hardys broken windshield deciding to take panoss advice and ask around about hardy he went directly to the best source he could think ofhe called the district attorney to whom hed had increased access since freeman had been mugged jackman had stopped far short of a glowing character reference hes a good lawyer then defense lawyer i should say in fact when blanca first mentioned the name dismas hardy jackmans tone had unmistakably cooled then changed by degrees until blanca concluded he was furious about something about hardy after that conversation he was trying to locate jakes and warren to get the story on the events at coit tower and was suitably stunned when their sergeant at central station told him that even as they spoke the two officers were possibly reporting to the homicide detail on the fourth floor of the hall of justice just upstairs from him maybe he could catch them there get their report in person so blanca was with them as well the last one to arrive for some not exactly rational reason when hed first heard the word homicide hed imagined that david freeman must have diedalthough of course freeman had nothing to do with jakes and warren but it was the only even remotely related homicide that came to his mind and so for the first few minutes after gersonsomewhat grudgingly admitted him to his office he stood against the door trying to pick up the gist of things as they went along finally he had to interrupt excuse me i keep hearing the name holiday he said i thought we were here about hardy and maybe freeman whos freeman gerson asked hardys partner blanca said hes in the icu over at st francis right now somebody beat him up bad but whos holiday hardys client gerson said arrest warrant out on him for murder for four murders to be more precise wait a minute excuse me blanca said this guy holiday he was with hardy today when when they got shot at warren said about noon maybe said jakes russell decided to get into the discussion maybe what maybe holiday was there you mean he asked no maybe they got shot at jakes answered or alternatively maybe it was just hardy no thats wrong obviously warren and jakes had discussed it between themselves and didnt agree jakes watches too many movies hey jakes said it wasnt playful you show me anything proves it happened i saw the guy hardy is what proves it happened he was beat to shit doesnt prove squat he could have done it to himself yeah but why warren shook his head people just dont do this shit hold it hold it hold it gerson had the rank and he pulled it officer jakes what are you trying to say the young man gathered himself only sir that we examined the area pretty carefully and several aspects of mr hardys story seemed well a little questionable like what like first his story is nobody else was there were talking coit tower noon it was foggy doug get it gerson snapped at warren button it go on jakes all right it was foggy like its never foggy hello this is san francisco people have heard of fog they still go to coit tower so anyway the first thing is he and holiday are all alone up there except when we arrive twenty minutes later its a car lot plus buses okay so then he talked about screeching tires except no tire marks then some chipped concrete where a slug hit it or maybe not oh and finally six shots fired just about point blank moving car warren blurted held up a hand to gerson sorry sir okay moving car but nobody even scratched we then interviewed down on lombard right below seven people home nobody heard a shot the only sound was a low musical notecuneo no one seemed to notice all right gerson said and all this means what he doesnt think it happened cuneo said he thinks hardy faked it thats right sir i do warren raised his hand gerson pointed at him and nodded go ahead i saw the man sir hardy he was ripped head to toe brand new nice suit cuts and scratches all over this didnt bother jakes that hills a monster you roll down it in a suit youll ruin it too youll get scratched up okay maybe but why would anybodyanybody much less a successful lawyerwant to do that blanca had gradually found himself growing astounded that hardy had spent so much time with him earlier in the day discussing the coit tower incident in some detail and never once seeing fit to mention his representation of the murderer john holiday or the fact of holidays presence at that scene deciding he had to speak up he cleared his throat raised his hand addressed himself to gerson if i may lieutenant i might have something to say to that all right gerson looked around were all listening blanca still by the door held up some paper this is a report about another incident that happened wednesday night in north beach also involving hardy while he and his wife were at a dinner at fior ditalia that they didnt eat supposedly somebody smashed the windshield of his car he first told the officers he suspected who it might have been but didnt think they needed to investigate the vandals he said wouldnt have left any sign he admitted that hed hurt his hand and that his own blood was on the hood of the carhed lost his temper when he saw the damage and slammed the windshield he said all right gerson said whats the point there are two points lieutenant first maybe it happened the way it looked but maybe he hurt his hand trying to break the window himself before he went to a tire iron or whatever got used again just like this incident today there seems to be no evidence that anything happened the way he said it did every man in the room was locked into blancas narrative he went on the second point goes back to officer warrens question of why anyone would do this kind of thing and the answer is that in both these incidents hardy accused a man named wade panos as wade panos cuneo exploded out of his trance wade panos isnt going around breaking car windows thats the stupidest thing i ever heard russell was just as outraged you mean to say that hardy actually told you wade was the person shooting at him he was looking for corroboration from warren and jakes and they were both nodding but blanca answered not exactly he said it probably wasnt panos himself he has a nephew named sephia sure cuneo said nick except nick was up at incline village today blanca said since last night roy panos gave me his number and i checked so he didnt shoot at anybody roys a good guy cuneo said you know him blanca asked either of them both russell said they gave us the list of names that led straight to holiday the room this time went completely silent jakes said shit after a long beat blanca picked up the thread again so heres the missing piece of this puzzle hardys suing panos right now damages in the millions for abuses in his patrol special beats and guess who else nobody offered the san francisco police department for negligent supervision the room grew blue with the obscenity of comrades when it had run its course warren was the first to get back to the issue so he faked all this to what im hearing two reasons gerson said first to ruin panos and give himself more ammo in court but even more and this really sucks to maybe try to get a jury to think this nick sephias got something to do with the people holiday offed the old soddit defense whats that jakes asked some other dude did it gerson said hey maybe the other dude was this guy sephia all hardy needs to get to is reasonable doubt if he can make the jury believe sephia shot at him and his client scumbag cuneo said he was one man but he spoke for the whole group unanimously john lescroart hardy first law the part three holiday had borrowed michelles car and was riding south through the city on surface streets hardy had ordered him that no way was he even to consider going outside until this thing had gotten settled the arrest warrant on him was still in force glitsky evidently was going down to make the arrests on the others that would somehow clear holiday then hed present the da and even the homicide detail with a fait accompli glitsky said he had the evidence he needed it was going to happen holiday just had to wait except that this was holidays fight far more than it was even glitskys or hardys fuck if hed let someone else fight it for him theyd already killed two of his friends tried to kill him set the police on his ass hardy could say what he wanted but after everything that had happened so far nobody doubted that if holiday got into custody they would find a way to get to him panos was connected inside the system enormous sums of money were at stakethey had killed to protect it and they would kill again as often as they needed to wherever it needed to be done even in jail holiday looked down at the gun on the seat next to him what was left of the box of old cartridges reaching over he picked it up felt the heft of it put it back down he wiped his hand across his forehead he was sweating he rolled the window down an inch outside it was cold overcast and windy he lowered the window further kept sweating he knew he could just keep driving south michelle wouldnt be home until late so nobody would even be looking for the car he could zip over to the freeway and be out of the bay area within a couple of hours out of the state easily by nightfall maybe even out of the country it wasnt yet if he pushed it he could cross into tijuana well before midnight and after glitsky and hardy had fixed things up for him after the authorities had come to believe that it was sephia and his friends after all he could simply come back reopen the ark continue as before it was his fight sure but did that mean he had to be in it wasnt that the sucker play and what about michelle holiday for years had been playing himself as the tragic figure who didnt commit he was too bruised by life too battered by love and loss the women had always understood as michelle would come to understand he felt his pain too deeply he was too sensitive the idea that his broken heart would ever heal just wasnt really on the table was he really ready to abandon that charade for good he was all the running around the scoring the drinking the moving on from woman to woman hadnt given him one minute of true happiness but michelle had by the same token dismas hardy had taken him into his life endured his jokes and visits and hangovers made him part of the familygod knew why so diz and michelle were they just to be more sacrifices that hed burn on the altar of his pathetic selfpity hed come to his last turn if he wasnt going to get on the freeway he didnt take it suddenly putrid with fear he realized that he wasnt going to mexico or anywhere else except pier where glitsky was going to need all the help he could get hardy had never said anything definite about going himselfin fact hed outright denied he would be there it was police business hed said civilians didnt belong would be out of place but holiday knew hardy he would be there when they got this cleared up holiday would start taking care of the ark of michelle of the rest of his business his life on saturday afternoon vincent hardy opened the front door of his house and stood in the entrance to his living room where his father and abe glitsky were speaking in measured tones having a serious discussion he wore a longsleeved jerry rice er tshirt tennis shoes and calflength baggy shorts mostly though what he wore was mud hardy looked at him with a wary expectancy but mostly with a poorly concealed lack of patience dad he said without preamble i need a chainsaw glitsky not really in the mood for it nevertheless broke a rare smile as who does not vin as who does not a chainsaw hardys back was still sore and he was reclining feet up in his reading chair a chainsaw everybody needs one sometime glitsky said vincent didnt get the joke maybe but i need one now we really do dad what for his father asked to cut stuff there glitsky said the question settled for all time what did you think he wanted it for diz to cut stuff you cant do much else with a chainsaw can you i saw some guys juggle one down at venice beach one time hardy said a chainsaw a bowling ball and an egg it was awesome he whipped on his son what do you want to cut vin some trees over in the park he pointed vaguely outside theyre hanging over the sidelines at the football field what football field just at the end of the block where we practiced for little league hardy grimaced as he came forward slightly theres no football field down there yeah there is were making one thats why they need the chainsaw glitsky said obviously hardy knew the little league practice area well it was a small plot just to the left of the entrance to the elegant and majestic palace of the legion of honor one of san franciscos premier tourist destinations hardy had been one of a contingent of local dads who a few years before had gone down to the parks commission and requested that they be allowed to bring in a backstop for baseball so that the kids could have a flat grassy place to practice the commission finally agreed but only under the condition that it would be a revocable permit good for a few months in the spring and that the lot should otherwise remain pristine and now judging from his sons appearance the place was at best a mudhole and they needed a chainsaw to clear more land after hardy had finally with much gnashing of teeth made the sad truth clear to vincent and hed gone down to break the news to his friends and teammates he lay back in his chair covered his face with his hands briefly let out a deep breath so where were we do you realize that none of my three sons ever said those words to me what words dad i need a chainsaw it kind of choked me up it is a beautiful phrase every dad should hear it at least once well glitsky let out a theatrical sigh at least i got to hear your kid say it thats some consolation when the guys in venice juggled it was the chainsaw going yeah with a bowling ball and an egg was the egg hardboiled i dont know id assume so but if it wasnt imagine i would have loved abe hardy held up a hand please glitskys mouth turned down okay but i think ive got a chainsaw in my garage if you change your mind and want to borrow one i wont can we drop the chainsaw then reading glitskys mind hardy said dont glitskys frown grew more pronounced hardy took his opening but on this other thing im still trying to imagine who might have shot at us if it wasnt sephia and youre sure it wasnt him blanca was sure enough when i talked to him last said he checked around and called nick up in nevada where hed been since last night so it wasnt him but who does that leave maybe wades got some other shooters on the payroll hardy had thought of almost nothing else in the twentysix hours that had elapsed since hed arrived at coit tower it showed in his drawn and worried face but theres no reason to come after me im no threat anyway if freeman his voice wound down maybe they dont know that hardys voice grew hard meaning maybe you think i should tell them im out of it just roll over glitsky spread his hands meaning nothing my favorite theory is they werent after you anyway whoever it was they wanted holiday howd they know he was there howd they know you were somebody followed somebody thats all happens all the time the tail figures out your destination is coit tower calls for the cavalry in the gray sedan youre there when they arrive twenty minutes later then its sorry no hard feelings but its bad luck to leave witnesses breathing maybe hardy said but whats the deal with blanca i mean early afternoon yesterday hes the perfect cop wanted to know everything i had impressions suspicions you name it we talked about david getting a lead on these cretins anyway three hours later hes a different guy maybe he ate lunch at lous in the meanwhile got a stomachache hardy kept talking he knows it wasnt sephia plus he wasnt going after panos until he got some physical evidence then he asks me how come i hadnt told him i was with holiday up at coit didnt i think that mattered its like suddenly im the bad guy what im making this stuff up to ruin his day i wanted to go hey remember me im the guy who got shot at i am the victim here anyway he tells me hell call if something comes up but im not holding my breath probably smart glitsky stood up walked over to the fireplace moved some of the glass elephants on the mantel so whats your next move thats why i called you though it pains me to admit it i think i need some advice strategic emotional philosophical strategic i dont care he came forward with some difficulty rolling his shoulder against the pain they whack my car wednesday they shoot at me on friday tell you the truth im a little concerned glitsky stared out through the blinds of hardys front window a muscle worked by his temple when he spoke it was with an exaggerated calm for what its worth its probably not you its holiday it was my car abe on wednesday holiday wasnt anywhere near it that in fact might really have been random vandals right just like david was hardy took a beat come on abe two attacks in three days you know it wasnt random id like a little hint about what to do here i dont like people coming after me to say nothing about my family it makes me a little uptight we had two crying kids last night frannies talking about taking them out of school all of us going away for a week or two glitsky just nodded what hardy asked you already said it if youre absolutely sure its panos of course its panos whether the target is me or holiday either way its panos okay so what you do is you call dick kroll and tell him youre out at least until freemans up and around again explain the situation without threatening him or accusing him or his client if thats in your arsenal of legal moves that takes you out of it am i right so far maybe all right meanwhile make friends with blanca again find out what happened its probably just some misunderstandingyou know how cops can be if they feel you havent been completely straight with them apologize then of course turn over holiday no way glitskys mouth went tight theres that flexibility youre so famous for hes not going to jail again abe hes been there once and didnt like it he thinks panos will have him killed in jail glitsky barked a laugh thats just stupid and you know it diz wade may be the big bad wolf on the streets but essentially hes a rentacop okay he doesnt have secret operatives working in the jail to enforce his wishes trust me on this the truth is that if somebody is out to get your client hes safer in jail than he is out of it and then what and then what what i mean after i drop my lawsuit and johns in jail then what they just win whats the hurry you let things cool off awhile see how things stand with freeman get some new partners to work on the lawsuit later then with holiday you press for a speedy trial and get him off on the evidence you said hes got alibis for all the murders if thats true hes out after the prelim and back on the street where they can try again glitsky broke his second smile of the day a personal record you cant have it both ways diz hes either safer on the street or safer in jail how about neither whoever really did these killings wants to pin them on him if he dies with the evidence they found at his place the case is closed glitsky walked back to his chair stood looking down at his friend because youve been through recent psychological trauma and i dont want to embarrass you ive kind of been avoiding that pesky little evidence problem hardys eyes narrowed abe i swear to god somebody shot at us yesterday really im not kidding you glitsky registered surprise i dont doubt it but whats that got to do somebody planted that evidence get used to it thats the truth and that happens to be nick sephias specialty which makes it especially unfortunate he wasnt here in the city im working on that well glitsky stood again he checked his watch you get something let me know meanwhile call kroll at his home talk to your client be convincing it could all be settled by tonight glitsky met his wife and daughter where hed dropped them at a bookstore on california street they presented a saturday childrens hour that rachel enjoyedit also got everybody outside of the duplex which was to the good in the car trey a drove while abe turned himself around and sang some nonsense songs to his daughter then tickled and laughed with her enjoying himself treya put a hand on his thigh what are you so happy about not that im complaining ive successfully resisted temptation so im taking a few minutes to bask in my virtue she threw him a look across the car seat thats nice was the temptation female he put his hand down on hers never in the world he was subtle enough about it but diz wanted me to check up on the efficiency of the current homicide team i politely declined what is it treya asked some kind of virus first your dad now diz i know but i cant be mad at him hes legitimately worried id be worried too but what did he expect you to do about it he thinks john holidays getting framed he wanted me to pass it on to lieutenant gerson who else he grunted my close friend barry who is hanging on my every word i told diz that wasnt the way to go you would have been proud of me always she said but somebodys trying to find who shot at him arent they absolutely he reported it so thats what theyve got to do he glanced across at her whats the problem people shooting at our friends thats a pretty serious problem dont you think he shook his head they werent after diz no what would have happened if say theyd killed holiday after all what do you mean what would have happened hed be dead and and that would be the end of it what about these other killings he supposedly did those cases would be closed too wouldnt they glitsky didnt answer right away you see what im asking doesnt it make sense he nodded its more or less what diz was getting at but it doesnt have to be panos or anybody connected to panos but whoever it was had to be at silvermans right i mean the money the jewels and didnt the young man you talked to matt creed right he told you it wasnt holiday and his friends didnt he no he only said he couldnt say for sure that it was but did he ever get to tell that to the inspectors in homicide did he have time before he got shot i dont know now that might be worth finding out they were going shopping next and pulled into a space at the safeway treya turned off the engine but abe didnt move to get out of the seat instead he sat there rubbing his scar with his index ringer i thought you didnt want me getting involved in any of this its not my job remember i know i do remember after a long moment she said youre right i just hope somebody really is looking for whoever shot at diz i might be able to ask around about that its not homicide that might not be bad they got out of the car and rachel whod fallen asleep in the baby seat was making some discontented noises as glitsky leaned in pulled her out and brought her in close to him bouncing her gently while treya walked a few steps ahead he kept up a singsong patter all across the lot by the time they got her fastened into the seat in the shopping cart she was gurgling happily again mimicking her fathers words ayso ayso what do you have her saying treya asked smiling glitsky his smile quotient for the day all used up fixed his wife with a serious look key childhood words he said one in particular whats that chainsaw he said nat had his own key and had let himself in abe and treya heard the stertorous rumbling that marked nats sleep from down on the sidewalk he was on the living room couch the rule was not to wake him up on purpose although occasional accidental noise in the background was considered kosher and often did the trick so abe put on a cd of the opera turandot which featured his middle son jacob in his first commercial recording albeit among the chorus where abe swore he could pick him out with the music at conversational level they parked rachel in the playpen with some toys and began unpacking their groceries in and around the kitchen they hadnt quite finished the first bag when nat was in the doorway scratching his white hair around his yarmulke pulling his sweater down over his belt for a minute with that music he said i thought i must have died and gone to heaven he sounds great doesnt he outstanding you guys talking about jacob treya asked i dont think hes on this track father and son exchanged a look you dont hear him nat asked he paused listening pointed there ah treya smiled at her fatherinlaw turned back to her groceries oh there she doesnt hear him abe said i do she insisted right in the middle of those other voices he really stands out she pushed it for her husbands benefit its like hes in the next room but then something struck her and she turned suddenly all business but wait a minute its saturday nat what are you doing here is everything all right nat was an observant jew and spent a great deal of time inside his synagogue he took the sabbath seriously and normally he would not move from his apartment except to walk to temple where hed remain until sundown but at treyas question his expression went blank for a beat then he remembered ach this silverman thing again abe stopped pulling groceries from his bag what about it he shrugged im talking to sadie today outside temple hows she holding up treya asked you know a good few minutes a bad day or two its still so soon we only just laid him down when nat lost his thread to sadness for a second anyway she asks would i please thank you for telling her about this man they arrested this friend of your friend hardy they havent arrested him yet dad hes still at large nat took on a querulous tone i swore you said they arrested him no not yet after a moment nat shrugged again well maybe thats just as well just as well why do you say that because this morning shes watching the television and the news has the story of all the evidence they found at this mans housethe money and the rings and so on especially this one sapphire ring what about it what about it is that sam only had one ring like they describedthis oneand it definitely wasnt missing when sadie and i went to take the inventory there remember when you came that night we never got too far but we looked in the jewel case the ring was in there that night she was sure of it maybe the one they found was another ring like it dad this one had sams tag on it he shook his head thats what im saying abraham listen to me it was sams all right but it was still in his case when we went there so whoever killed him didnt take it during the robbery somethings got to be wrong with this dont you think treya too had stopped unpacking groceries she stood with her arms crossed leaning back against the counter does sadie think shes sure about this nat he looked at the two of them not just sadie i saw it too we even talked about it how it was good sam never had to sell that one his favorite piece in the shop he thought it was lucky for the cards you know so no no question it was there anybody shoot at you recently no you call kroll yet im still deciding how about holiday how about him why whats up you know how i wasnt going to get involved it filled me with admiration me too but alas shortlived theres been a development talk to me the way glitsky decided he had to play it was to have sadie call the police and appear to take care of the matter herself his own involvement under any guise wasnt going to be appreciated no matter what spin he put on it he felt pretty much out of spin in any case sadie lived in a standalone bungalow on palm avenue not far from the synagogue inside the place was a pinneat kitsch warehouse every conceivable surfacethe top of the television set the breadbasket in the kitchenevery inch of flat space was covered with a doily and then a knickknack or doll a porcelain piece or souvenir coney island disneyland niagara falls the grand canyon tiny dogs and cute little cats pincushions sadie cleared a spot big enough to hold a teapot and cups on the small table in front of the sofa in the living room it had grown dark outside by now with two small sconced wall lights by the door providing the only illumination glitsky thought it probably wasnt light enough to read but neither his father who sat next to her on the couch nor sadie herself seemed to mind or even notice she poured his tea and sat expectantly while he tried to explain i know that because im with the police it seems like i would be the natural choice to take your information especially since i know you you know nat were all a little like family but thats not really how it works i know how offices work she said laying a frail hand on his somebodys afraid youre going to get the credit maybe theres some of that but basically there are two inspectors in the homicide detail who are handling the casein this instance probably all of these casesand whatever information comes to the police ought to be funneled through them sadie was smiling at him as though he were somehow feeble she had left her hand cool and crepeskinned over his and now she exerted some slight pressure for emphasis ill do whatever you tell me and talk to anybody you want all i know is what i saw i saw it too nat repeated and sadie rewarded him with a grateful look and thats the ring this sapphire ring well yes that one stands out but really there wasnt any jewelry taken at all although that would of course be harder to prove and why is that because they may have taken something id never seen maybe sam had taken in some stones or something that day i wouldnt have known they were there then would i no of course youre right glitsky decided hed fallen into the error of assuming that sadie wasnt as sharp as a younger person might have been enough of that so you could swear that the sapphire ring was in the case when you went there with nat yes no doubt of it wenat and iwe even wrote it on the inventory before you stopped us ive got it saved given the condition of the house this didnt surprise glitsky but he was still glad of it thats good you might want to bring that with you when you talk to the inspectors well shall we call them now she asked id like to get this out of the way it just doesnt seem right that this other man john holiday yes that was it that this mr holidaywell i dont see that he killed sam lets put it that way i think somebody must have been trying to be too clever by half maybe they didnt knowthey must not have knownthat nat and i had been in the shop that other night if it had only been the money that would have been stronger glitsky felt a small shiver at the back of his neck let me ask you something else if i may didnt i hear that sam had stopped using the patrol specials last summer she nodded it just didnt seem to be worth it mr panos was asking more and more we hadnt had any kind of trouble for years and years we talked about it but just finally thought nat reached over and patted her hand its all right he said they were there that night and it didnt save him anyway did it no she said with great sadness youre right youre right it wasnt that but my point abe said is whether they still had a key to the shop the ers had a good day and beat green bay the tickets roy panos had given dan cuneo were at the fortyfive yard line fifteen rows off the field perfect seats the sun was out and there was no wind though it was chilly enough here at candlestick point that now walking back to his car liz snugged up close up against him her arm around his waist she felt the vibration too whats that pager he said he pulled the little unit off his belt my partner from home as he held it it vibrated again and he sighed smiling at her and heres another one mister popularity she said thats me but when he saw the number his smile faded my boss from his home he had a cell phone in his car and he called gerson first the lieutenant told him that the silverman widow had called earlier in the day saying she had discovered some new and important information about her husbands murder gerson wanted cuneo to go and talk to her he gave him the address im on it cuneo said he hung up turned to liz work liz wore a halfmocking pout you dont really seem too sad about it its a big case he said this silverman thing again i thought you had a suspect for that we do maybe somebodys found where he is that could be what this is and then what and then maybe i get to make the arrest all by yourself modest he shrugged if i have to she smiled at him now you love what you do dont you yes maam i sure do but how do i know for sure those two calls really werent other girlfriends he turned to her in the car seat first because im a policeman and cops dont lie second i dont have other girlfriends im not even sure i have one girlfriend to tell you the truth although i was kind of hoping to find out about that before too long smiling she took the cue and leaned across the seat brought her lips up to his the kiss went on for close to a minute and there was nothing platonic about it when they separated she said on that girlfriend question you can say you have one if you decide you want to for the first time in quite a while cuneo was tempted to let something else come before his work he struggled to get a breath leaned over and kissed her again his hand found her breast one of her hands went to his leg his pager went off again the kiss ended and he groaned pulled the pager from his belt lincoln again he said would you like to call this time make sure its really him and not a girl thats all right she said i think i believe you will whatever it is youre doing this afternoon take a long time its hard to say i dont even know what its all about yet but if im done early i could stop by again and maybe we could her finger traced his lower lip shutting him up no maybe about it she said on its way back to san francisco from the truckee airport the kamov ka helicopter thwacked its boisterous way down the little grand canyon the littlesung but majestically beautiful passage cut into the sierra nevada by the american river its two passengers nick sephia and julio rez were sitting strapped in behind mikhail their pilot perhaps they should have been relaxed from two nights of gambling and four women between them but this morning sephias uncle roy had called waking them at ten oclock not even five hours after nick had paid off trixie and finally fallen into a comalike sleep roy told nick he needed them both back in the cityhe was sending the kamov back up for them it seems they had made some mistakes and still had work to do even with the windows closed they could barely hear inside the chopper but that didnt stop the sleepdeprived sephia from bitching about things its not like we didnt do enough these last couple of weeks roys crazy to want us back in town we ought to be lying low rez shrugged he told us to make it look good didnt he didnt we both figure the ring would lock it up so now hes all what if somebody noticed who the fucks gonna notice and what are we going to do about it now anyway its done rez put a fish eye on his partner you shouldnt have shot sam i had to shoot him he had us made me anyway and fuckin roy stopping to admire the jewelry hes the only reason its his fault as much as mine yeah but hes getting us out of it so we just let him work it hey julio heres a tiphes not working it were working it maybe you didnt notice who was there with creed who didnt even show up for the faggots whatever its working its his plan we just stay cool itll be over i am cool rez looked over at him snorted oh yeah youre cool hey who missed holiday and hardy both of em six shots didnt touch either one rez threw it back at him who drove like shit they lapsed into a sullen and angry silence sephia closed his eyes and crossed his arms trying to get some more sleep after two or three minutes of looking down into the wilderness rez leaned forward and put on his pair of headphones hey mikhail the pilot tilted his head yah how much time we got the pilot shrugged all we need shipment till tomorrow you mean not till tomorrow you dumb polack why dont you swing us around mikhail didnt completely understand the complicated and unexpected request so he turned in his seat rez pantomimed that he should turn the craft around and fly lower got to piss mikhail asked rez laughed and shook his head no he repeated the order sephia felt the lurch the change in altitude and direction and sat up eyes open whats happening he yelled across to rez who didnt appear to hear sephia hit him on the arm and asked again youll see a little fun he pointed at his earphones put them on youre going to need em then into his microphone mikhail good down down okay now slow the pilot put the helicopter into a steep dive leveling off over the river at perhaps sixty feet the sides of the canyon rose up on both sides towering over them then suddenly on the right one of the canyon walls disappeared to reveal a grassy plain upon which grazed a herd of deer rez unstrapped his seat belt and suddenly pulled open the door rez tapped mikhail on the shoulder and pointed down there he said there he pulled a automatic from his shoulder holster and turned to smile over at sephia the herd of perhaps twenty head didnt seem to know what to make of the noise from above them as a body it made a false start then stopped again and huddled together mikhail getting the idea hovered over them circling the fired three times in quick succession deafening even over the noise of the prop rez whooped with a mad laughter as the chopper dipped and turned and he squeezed off two more rounds the remainder of the herd was moving now out under the helicopter rez slammed his own door crossed to sephias and yanked it open slapping the gun with a yelp into his partners hand pointing down the deer were right under him forty feet below milling in confusion sephia nodded took the gun and aimed with both hands then fired three times in three seconds he pulled the trigger again then noticed the slide all the way back the chamber exposed no more ammo but rez pulled a fresh clip from his jacket pocket and handed it over sephia ejected the old one dropped it onto the floor and jammed the new one up in place the slide slapped forward the first round in the chamber he took aim again the standing deer had at last begun to run and mikhail was chasing them toward a grove of trees sephia took his shot squeezed again but this second time there was another empty click misfire the first cartridge had jammed bent now halfway outside the chamber sephia swore again but the sullen look had left his face the two partners were ecstatic with the noise and the mayhem the rest of the deer reached the grove and mikhail pulled up steeply then whirled back around rez leaned out the open door and looked down smiling in the pasture six deer lay still in the brown grass cuneo rang mrs silvermans doorbell out here in the western half of the city the wind had come up intermittent high clouds scudded overhead permitting only a milky sunshine through them suddenly cuneo realized from a sunny morning of great promise at his home in alameda it had become a depressing lateautumn afternoon mrs silverman looked worn out as though she hadnt slept well still in mourning she wore a black skirt and matching sweater a demure string of pearls after hed gotten seated at the dining room table and declined her offer of something to drink he placed his tape recorder between them delivered the standard test and preamble with his name and badge number the date and the identification of the witness then he asked mrs silverman to tell him why she had contacted the police she got to the crux of it immediately with no prompting by cuneo when shed finished for a long moment he couldnt think of a question he sat back in the dining room chair and crossed one leg over the other finally but the ring was at holidays place maam i found it myself im not denying it was there im saying it wasnt taken the same night my husband was shot it couldnt have been and what does that mean to you she settled back in her chair a blackened figure in a dim room i dont know exactly i was thinking it meant that mr holiday couldnt have taken it after all why not well maybe he saw the rings while he was there the first time and went back another day but i locked the place up after i left the night i started to do the inventory i dont know how he could have gotten in maybe he had a key wasnt he a regular at these poker games yes but sam didnt give those men keys to our shop sam wasnt stupid inspector no maam no ones implying anything like that but maybe he found an extra key somewhere in the shop when he was there the first time or even in the red pouch itself cuneos suggestions seemed to upset her i didnt think of that but im not sure sam had many extras certainly he wouldnt have left any of them lying around it would only have taken one cuneo came forward put his arms on the table mrs silverman we appreciate your coming forward with this this is a very difficult time im sure and you want to do all you can to help if nothing else youve given us something else to look for at holidays place if theres a key to your shop weve missed there well go back and find it i promise the little speech didnt seem to help much but cuneo got the feeling that nothing would mrs silverman sighed deeply i just wanted to make sure that the wrong man didnt suffer for what sams killer had done i wouldnt worry about that weve got the right man the money proves that without any question wouldnt you say i suppose unambiguous as it was to cuneo somehow mrs silverman seemed doubtful you dont seem too convinced no i its just that i had a thought that it might have beenwhats the wordplanted there planted by who someone who could have gotten into the shop which brings us back to the key doesnt it he asked gently yes i suppose it does but then i think wade panos and his people might still have one really are more likely to have one than this man holiday dont you think from when they patrolled for us cuneo suddenly was all attention and focus on the drive out he had tried to dredge up from his memory all he could recall of mrs silverman her name had stuck with him and not just because she was a victims spouse he finally had remembered the name from gersons story about abe glitsky now when he heard the name panos again the connection came back to him glitskys earlier use of mrs silverman as a wedge to get back into homicide glitsky helping out some lawyers in their lawsuit against panos beyond that john holiday out beating the streets for witnesses and plaintiffs in that same lawsuit holiday and glitsky and by extension the lawyer too hardy the guy blanca had told them about yesterday all of them coconspirators and now glitsky hitting a new low using this grieving old woman to float the idea that the ring had been planted a word she hardly knew cuneo smiled and kept his tone as pleasant as he could mrs silverman he said i wouldnt torture myself with all these dark imaginings if i were you are you still talking to lieutenant glitsky about this case just last night she said his father nat was sams best friend i called him when i remembered about the ring he told me to get in touch with you ill bet he did cuneo thought after hed coached you about your testimony but to her he simply nodded well that was smart of him but if you ask him hell tell you the same thing were so used to tv and movies nowadays we sometimes feel theres always got to be some unlikely twist like somebody planting evidence in the real world most things are just what they look like he came forward in his chair lowered his voice to a near whisper if it eases your mind at all whenever and however he got the ring john holiday probably wasnt the one who shot your husband but he was there doing the robbery getting his poker money back when clint terry lost his head and panicked and shot sam all the evidence supports that maam thats what weve got pumped up with adrenaline cuneo walked up the dark driveway to the refurbished garage that liz rented just off silver avenue around at the side door he saw candlelight flickering on the walls through the window he knocked once lightly and a bulb came on over the door who is it liz its dan cuneo dan who but then another light came on in the window and the door opened she stood there smiling at him barefoot she wore a green terry cloth bathrobe her hair wasnt yet completely dry and framed her pretty face in a black halo of curls she had a glass of wine in her hand he became aware of the thump of a jazzy bass line caught a heady whiff of a musky perfume and unmistakably marijuana did you get to arrest him she asked an hour later cuneo was as relaxed as he could ever remember feeling the bed was a mattress on the floor and he lay naked flat on his back upon it one arm thrown back over his head the other around the shoulders of his new lover the music shed had on when he got there had ended and now the apartment was silent more incredibly to him his own head was silent liz had pulled up the blanket and now lay pressed up against him her left hand resting flat against his belly her leg thrown over both of his the candle cast the room in an amber glow so somebody ought to tell wade and roy to watch out he said these guys are serious i mean glitskys up there in the department hes also tight with clarence jackman the district attorney his wife get this is even jackmans personal secretary and theyre all in this together my boss didnt know how high up it went he didnt want to think it went to jackman but it might but theres no doubt a conspiracy here trying to frame wade thats what it looks like glitsky had this poor old lady prepped like you couldnt believe didnt wade still have a key to sams place i doubt she even knew what she was saying but glitsky sure as hell knew what he was feeding her liz came up on an elbow and the blanket slipped down to reveal the arc of her breast i havent heard glitskys name before around this although i know dismas hardy of course and david freeman theyve been out to get us for most of the past year now i dont know why wades the nicest man secretarys day last year he took me to masas it must have cost him three hundred dollars and flowers every day that week you dont have to sell me he basically did my job for me on this one youre being modest i dont know about that but i do know wade had better be careful this glitsky is a very serious man wades got to be clear on that ill sit him down and make him listen except what can he do really thats the problem with being a good guy you cant stop anybody until they do something to you first so maybe somebody will do something to wade i dont want that either no i mean stop glitsky the da or somebody might step in i cant believe hes with the police and hes so bad i know cuneo said its a problem motor running and heat on paul thieus car was parked across the street from glitskys duplex on monday morning when he and treya came down their steps at a little after thieu turned off the engine opened the door and got out glitsky stopped said something to his wife and left her on the sidewalk while he crossed over you could have come up and knocked paul he said we would have let you in thieu said i thought it would be better if we didnt talk at the hall thieu wasnt yet thirtyfive years old and glitsky suddenly realized that except for marcel lanier he was now the oldest inspector in homicide he recalled when hed pulled thieu out of missing persons six years ago to translate as hed interviewed the vietnamese mother of another murder victim then as now the face had been graveif the man had a flaw he was too serious this morning he exuded gravity i was going to be driving in with treya glitsky said i could take you drop you off a block down it wasnt really a request glitsky had years and rank on thieu but neither played much of a role in their connection thieus brains commanded respect and glitsky simply nodded then walked over to treya to give her the news she didnt exactly embrace it unless im mistaken she said pauls still in homicide then you didnt sneak out and call him did you he tried a feeble joke maybe its about his overtime maybe its about sam silverman last night nat had called with a recap of the interview sadie had had with cuneo not that the inspectors theory was any less defensible than glitskys certainly it was possible that holiday had reentered the store with a key and then stolen the ring on another day but at the very least glitsky thought cuneo should have been open to the possibility that someonenot necessarily panos but necessarily silvermans killershad planted the ring at holidays it made him wonder somehow homicide and panos kept seeing factseven ambiguous or incriminating factsin the same light when hed been in homicide hed never had that experience with the patrol special it still wasnt his job but with the attack on hardy it was at least his business treya even had come to agree with that she kissed him goodbye and said shed be around if he wanted to have lunch he watched her walking away for a few steps then put his hands in his flight jacket pockets and crossed the street ive been wrestling with guilt thieu began after they were rolling whos winning i guess the guilt im here he threw a quick look across the seat at his old boss you know anything about this double in the loin wills and terry glitsky chuckled treya just called it what silverman thieu took that in nodding as though it confirmed something hed been thinking i didnt draw silverman it wasnt ever my case you know cuneo and russell not personally thieu shrugged well they got silverman few nights later i pull this kid creed who was the main witness for silverman i heard glitsky said you know about this some he looked over qualified it what i read in the papers stopped at a red light thieu tried to find a clue in glitskys expression apparently there wasnt one all right ill cut to the chase creed and these two poor schmucks in the loin suddenly theyre connected because creed had idd them for silverman then a guns at their place ballistics confirms it killed both silverman and creed everybodys happy right i know i am glitsky said except theres a third guy creed named john holiday the trace of a smile lifted thieus mouth but youre not following the case glitsky shook his head straightfaced hardly at all then maybe you wouldnt know they pulled a warrant for him i did hear something about that okay heres where the guilt comes in none of these are my cases gerson yanked two of them out from under me after id already worked the scenes let me guess glitsky said youre conflicted about telling them they screwed up another red light had stopped them thieu turned to his mentor worse i want them to screw up glitsky sat with it a minute whatd they miss he asked it wasnt a long laundry list but it was compelling enough thieu told glitsky that when it had become obvious that holiday by default was going to become the prime suspect in all the murders thieu had gone by the place he worked and to his own satisfaction verified that he had a reasonably good and more importantly verifiable alibi for the time of his bartendersterrysdeath thieu had questioned dozens of killers and witnesses in his six years in homicide and was all but positive that if the arrest warrant hadnt been hustled through so quickly holiday would have supplied the names of his customers who would have eliminated him as a suspect at least in the deaths of wills and terry beyond that thieu said it flew in the face of reason that this grotesque and sexually tinged double murder had been a result of thieves falling out among themselves there was also too much of silvermans money lying aroundif it was about the robbery holiday would have known it was there somewhere and at least searched for it then taken it in thieus opinion and hed given it a lot of thought only two scenarios worked here one was faros this was a pickup gone bad the other was his own that whoever killed these guys was some kind of psycho who enjoyed it all right but whose true motive was to implicate the only suspect left alive holiday who unfortunately for the actual bad guys had an alibi the whole thing screamed overkill it was far too neat a package the dope the money the gun the shoes oh and while were on the shoes thieu had been talking for five minutes and now suddenly paused for a breath you read about the gunk all well and good nice italian shoes size thirteen but guess what terry wore a thirteen all right but the italian thirteen is at least a half size smaller than our thirteen no way he wears those shoes they werent his especially when every other pair in the closet was crappy six pairs of sneakers some birkenstocks flipflops one laceup wingtip anybody who looked would see which pair didnt belong there but they didnt look and you didnt tell them another source of my guilt i figured if theyre going to be on the case they can work it so the closets got all these junk shoes and then this italian braided beauty with the gunk on it and half a size too small thieu shook his head it doesnt make any sense you want my opinion somebody knew what wed be looking for and planted this stuff glitsky kept his face impassive funny you should use that word he said and gave thieu the gist of sadie silvermans testimony cuneos interpretation after thieu heard it out he sat drumming his fingers on the steering wheel ive got to tell the lieutenant about these clowns abe ive got to except then he didnt have to say it cops didnt fink on other cops gerson might appreciate the news but thieu would forever be tainted in some way out of the club more than he already was by virtue of his race brains physical size itd be sweeter if gerson found it out by himself it wouldnt only be sweeter glitsky knew but it would save the good inspector thieu from the suretobethorny explanation of why he hadnt told cuneo and russell everything that hed discovered and theorized instead of leaving them to find out for themselves thieu felt guilty about it and glitsky empathized with where he was coming from but the fact was that he should have felt guilty he hadnt done the right thing they pulled up to the curb a couple of blocks before they reached the hall glitsky had his hand on the door handle but paused a last second look paul i happen to know holidays lawyer hed be motivated to verify some of those alibi names maybe he could talk one of them into volunteering to come in tell his story you know thieu said its not that i care about this john holiday i sure as hell dont want to help his defense if it needs it but i dont believe he did wills and terry he wiped his eyes as though banishing the image i screwed up too didnt i its a big club paul welcome to it at least you feel bad about it maybe not bad enough to tell gerson well the plain fact is that he done you wrong too he opened the door got out and leaned back in give it a day or two ill call holidays lawyer make something happen holidays lawyer felt a hundred years old the bruise on his back had blossomed into a dinnerplatesize blackandblue mark that woke him up whenever he shifted in bed over the entire weekend the whole left hand continued to throb glitsky called on and on about sadie cuneo holiday the planted or notplanted ring and of course the client never got in touch sunday night hed taken a vicodin left over from somewhere then drunk two scotches with his brotherinlaw before dinner two bottles of red wine with moses after up too late near midnight moses at his most passionate and most drunk pressing for retaliation against panos and his people now before they could strike at hardy again hardy halfwaymore than halfwayinto it really really pissed off embarrassingly so he supposed foolishly frannie supervising the kids homework far in the back of the house where maybe it wouldnt sound so awful susan finally packing moses up and driving him home both women angry with their men frustrated exhausted afraid out of bed badly hung overdyingat and no chance of going back to sleep not with the back the head the hand for the first time in months he couldnt even be bothered with the newspaper out of the house before anyone else was up he stopped at st francis to check on david who perhaps on his deathbed looked just like hardy felt an hour in the office produced a cup of coffee and fourteen minutes of disjointed dictation he was never going to drink alcohol again getting nothing done he went back down to his car which was parked under the building paranoid he knelt and looked under the chassis not really knowing what he was looking for mosess warnings kept replaying in his brainthe brotherinlaw had not been mellow at all about hardy getting shot at he got into the drivers seat stopped himself then pulled the lever to open the hood got all the way out and around the front again and lifted it motor he said aloud disgusted with himself at the hall of justice hector blanca was busy hed be a while hardy waited in the outer office while time passed a half hour fortyfive minutes he asked at the desk again was told that it might still be a few minutes an hour the secretary finally suggested he come back another time sergeant blanca really wasnt going to be able to spare any time this morning well i wonder if youll be able to help me then he heard himself the clipped and impatient tone guaranteed in any bureaucracy to produce glassyeyed unfeeling incomprehension if not outright hostility he reined himself in fooling no one however listen someone shot at me last fridayshot at meand i was hoping to find out if sergeant blanca or anybody else had made any progress finding out who it might have been the secretary shook his head did you make out a report well then as soon as we have something the sergeant will let you know he walked back down a long hallway to the main lobby where the day had now progressed enough to where the familiar vulgar din reigned maybe even louder than usual the traffic court line stretched from the ticket window out past the elevator banks over to the coffee kiosk where he waited in another line to place his order a baby was crying up front while closer to him a couple of fiveyearolds chased each other screaming in the entrance to the courtroom hallway a man in a frock and collar was lecturing a group of fifteen or twenty people in spanish a shaggy young man barefoot fell into line behind him and hit him up for some spare change reaching into his pockets he found some coins and dropped them into the mans dirty outstretched hand the coffee line wasnt moving or maybe he had mistakenly wandered into the traffic line after all either way he walked to the elevators and stepped into an open one pressing glitskys old floor out of habit six people shared the car with himhe didnt hear a word of english when it stopped at his floor he got out and stood lost in the suddenly empty almost eerily quiet space the elevator area on all the floors looked almost identical so hed gotten well into the hallway that should have led to glitskys new digs when it struck him that something was wrong familiar but wrong he stopped again looked around out of a doorway further along on the right two men emerged and turned toward him onegrayhaired heavy and bespectacledwore a welltailored tan business suit the other was a policeman in uniform they were coming toward him talking easily to one another and at about twenty feet recognition kicked in hardy moved into their path richard he said to kroll diz how you doin i think you know roy panos roy dismas hardy sure roys smile evaporated he nodded cautiously but neither man offered to shake hands kroll put on the proper face so hows david coming along not well im afraid no change at all hardy shook his head it doesnt look too good dick he put a hand on hardys arm i am so sorry to hear that is there anything i can do or anybody can do anything at all i think theyre doing all they can hardy motioned with his head so you been down at homicide what oh yeah kroll laughed out of all context following up on poor matt creed did you know matt no afraid not good kid a real tragedy yeah hardy said im aware of the case oh thats right sorry no need to be it wasnt my client he didnt do it no of course not you going down now to explain about that to gerson hardy forced a cold grin something like that well good luck thanks hardy started for homicide as kroll and panos walked toward the elevators he heard their talking resume in modulated tones suddenly krolls voice pierced the silence again oh diz hardy turned on the other matter he walked a little back the way hed come lowered his voice i dont know if youve heard your witness labonte aretha what about her he moved two or three steps closer started to talk stopped started again i just heard about it from gerson you know they hauled her in for hooking again yesterday he hung his head for an instant when he looked up he met hardys gaze i know youre getting a lot of bad news this week diz and i hate to add to it but i guess she couldnt take the life anymore sometime last night she hanged herself in her cell hardy never intended to go to homicide anyway so deciding to climb to glitskys floor by the inside stairs wasnt much of a change of plans but he didnt go up them right away when the hallway door closed behind him he turned around and sat heavily on the second step he leaned over feeling sick elbows on his knees his pounding head resting on the heel of his one good hand hardy hadnt been arethas criminal defense attorney because frankly she couldnt afford him she was a professional girl who got busted two or three times a year nevertheless in the past six months hed come to know aretha fairly well she was twentyfour years old black functionally illiterate the fact that she did not have a pimp contributed to the continuing difficulties in her life because she had no street protection but she did have a steady boyfriend damoan quiet and polite although unkempt and gangdressed damoan often accompanied her to depositions and court appearances it seemed to hardy that the couple was happy with each other unlikely as that might seem with freeman hardy had spent several hours with her coaching her taking her statements but also having coffee joking driving someplace or another hed come to know her as an honest uncomplicated person with a surprisingly sunny disposition and outlook thingssometimes terrible thingsseemed to roll right off her shed probably spent two hundred nights of her life in jail shed told hardy and he believed her that she viewed the experience as a neutral one on the one hand it gave her some time off on the other it was a hassle and an inconvenience krolls statement that she must have grown tired of the life didnt wash with anything hardy knew about the woman she hadnt begun to lose her looks yet sephias plant on her notwithstanding she didnt use hard drugs unless she and damoan had broken up and hed seen them apparently happy together within the past week she was as unlikely a candidate for suicide as hardy could imagine he opened his eyes and raised his head slowly got to his feet he turned around looked at the stairs wondered if he could muster the strength to climb them when hardy first came in glitsky brought him a glass of water and four aspirin now the door to the office was closed glitsky sat behind his desk scowling tugging absently at a rubber band she must have though i cant accept it somebody got to her in her cell not as easy as it sounds diz he snapped the band a few times but dont get me wrong im not ruling it out entirely after a minute he added maybe you were right keeping holiday outside it wasnt my decision hardy said but id advise against it now not that ive had a chance you havent talked to him not since friday i dont even know where he is glitsky pulled the rubber band apart and sighted through it you can give me that look all you want hardy said but its a true story hes gone to ground all right lets say i believe you im still having trouble with panos somehow connected to the jail maybe he passes the word through homicide glitsky snorted now you are dreaming hardy lifted his shoulders and immediately regretted it he didnt care if glitsky couldnt see how it might happen something had happened aretha labonte was dead in jail and he didnt believe she killed herself and that left only one other option you can laugh hardy said but i just saw them down there the laughing if thats what the snort had been stopped who down where roy panos downstairs one floor down in homicide with my close friend dick kroll evidently checking up on the creed investigation glitsky sat up straight what were they checking on the shoes what about the shoes it didnt take glitsky long to tell it so youre saying terry didnt shoot creed after all he still might have half a shoe size is close going up okay but not going down if the shoe dont fit you gotta acquit glitsky frowned at the reference please he said spare me but my question is does panos even know about that thieu hasnt even told gerson yet hardy reached for his paper cup and sipped some water he realized that the aspirin had begun to kick in only slightly but hed take it if its any help i got the impression that they werent there about creed anyway kroll just said the first plausible thing that came to mind okay and this means what i dont know maybe nothing but maybe theyre all pals sharing information glitsky was back with his rubber band his face set so panos would know what evidence they still needed which would tell him what to plant and where to put it you said it not me its just what i warned gerson about when was that when this whole thing started back with silverman right after wade gave the inspectors his list of suspects a short silence settled then hardy said somebodys got to tell him gerson he doesnt want to know at least not from me how about clarence how about him hes not going to want to try this thing if the evidence is bogus youd be doing him a favor plus hed listen to you as opposed to someone else in this room why wouldnt he listen to you hardy didnt think he needed to give the complete explanation its my client abe he said think about it youre an objective third party glitsky knocked got jackmans yes and opened the door the da reading something at his desk and perhaps thinking it was treya looked up in mild pleasant expectancy but as soon as he saw glitsky his expression hardened by a degree his eyes went down then came back up flat controlled he smiled in a perfunctory way feeling something in the gaze glitsky stopped halfway to the desk sorry to bother you clarence but treya said you might be free and this is important the smile stayed in place jackman gestured at the papers spread around his desk freedoms relative abe and everything is important the job is important what can i do for you how do you get along with barry gerson jackman took a beat you mean professionally about the same as i did with you when you had his job why because hes being used hes going to be badly embarrassed somebodys got to get the message to him and it cant be me why not he thinks i want his job jackman pushed himself back a bit folded his hands on the desk you havent made that much of a secret abe youve told me the same thing ten times in the past year and a half glitsky took one of the chairs in front of jackmans desk true but for some reason hes thinking im interfering with one of his investigations trying to make him look bad get him fired or transferred so i can get back in why do you think that would be thats a long story but essentially because ive asked him for some information on the silverman homicide which has turned out to be connected to a few other cases youre right jackman delivered it as a surprise gerson is thinking that glitsky crossed a leg scratched at his scar youve talked to him a nod yesterday all trace of warmth had left jackmans face on sunday at home actually it was both lieutenant gerson and dan rigby conferenced in glitsky sucked in a breath dan rigby was the chief of police jackman continued the chief said that since you and treya were in my inner circle as he called it as is dismas maybe i should have a word with some or all of you and see if between us we can bring some reason to bear here so your dropping in today is fortuitous after all and as you say important his formal smile appeared briefly then vanished the chief mentioned the possibility of filing charges against both you and diz for conspiracy to obstruct justice in this rash of homicides for which his clientholiday is ithas been accused but the chief thought that in view of your record your past heroism and so forth i might be able to exert some influence and get you to stop what he called this misguided campaign to smear wade panos glitsky shook his head in anger and disbelief this is not misguided clarence this is real they shot at diz you know what theyve done to freemanyouve seen him and that was panos yes youre sure yes sir absolutely and your certainty is based upon what incriminating physical evidence at this glitsky sat back planted his elbows on the arms of his chair a muscle worked at the side of his jaw ive got a witness he said who gave them something that strongly indicates that their evidence is bogus im assuming thats what they called about sadie silverman thats accurate jackman inclined his head an inch let me ask you this abe why did you get this witness whats your role here why are you even involved at all she came to me clarence through my father i didnt seek her out all right grant that did you then speak with her about her testimony i didnt coach her if thats what youre implying i heard what she had to say then told her to call homicide you didnt indicate to her that perhaps one of mr panoss men planted some bogus evidence glitsky squirmed in the chair chewed at the inside of his lip ill take your silence for a yes the da sighed you know abe i hate to say this but some people seem to think youre involved in this for your own personal gain i wont dignify that with jackman held up a hand if youre any part of dizs team in this lawsuit and he wins some people think youd stand to make a bundle and at the expense of the city and the police department but im not on his team you havent supplied him with information about this lawsuit against mr panos yes but then youll admit theres an appearance nobodys paying me anything clarence even if they win i dont know if id brag about that if i were you jackman said it doesnt make you look very astute he paused but im not getting into the truth or falsehood or even the wisdom of any of this im simply telling you as a friend that the money motive is plausible to the point of certainty to several men of good will within the police department you are on very very thin ice here abe clarence the hand again let me just add a personal note if i may the voice was modulated controlled no sign of anger but glitsky wasnt much fooled this was the sound of jackmans purest furyhed heard him press for the death penalty with the same inflections its absolutely true that you and treya even dismas and gina roake and certainly david freemanare all in my inner circle were professional colleagues but more than that i think weve developed a real bond in the years since weve been meeting at lous were friends yes sir i feel the same way good so youll understand he came forward can you possibly imagine that i wouldnt do all i can to use the power of this office to help any one of you if there were facts evidence proof anything at all that could justify an investigation of mr panos and his activities or anybody else of course i would it hurts me that you could doubt that i dont doubt it clarence its why ive come to you today but you dont have anything i can use abe and by contrast lieutenant gerson has two experienced inspectors eyewitness testimony and lots of physical evidence i cannot in good conscience ignore all of that frankly im not even inclined to and closer to home i will not let it appear that im willing to manipulate the system to help my friends my problem is not mr panos its you and diz putting me in an untenable position surely you can see that thats not our intention no im sure its not but it is the result jackman straightened up drew a deep breath now i told diz the same thing that im going to tell you now unless and until new evidence comes to light through the proper channels and that means the homicide department i dont want to have to discuss this with you again i wont discuss it with you again is that clear abe yes sir all right then michelle was out shopping for food picking up something they could eat at home since dining in a restaurant together was not in the cards holiday stared out through the blinds at the overcast day then brought his eyes back to the sheet of paper in front of him on michelles kitchen table it was a little past noon and out of habit hed poured himself the last couple of ounces neat from the bottle of bourbon hed bought maybe a week ago and nipped at nearly every day since but today the taste for it wasnt there he hadnt touched the glass looking at it now his hand started to reach for it then stopped he came back to the paper on which hed written four namestom evan bryan or ryan leslie he knew there had been at least four others maybe five at the bar with him the night that clint and randy had been killed but he couldnt dredge them up from the sludge of his unconscious hardy when he finally got over berating him for not calling sooner said it could be extremely important the verification of his alibi his friend glitsky the cop had evidently suggested he try to come up with his customers names holiday had been his usual confident self telling his lawyer no problem hed have some kind of a list for him within an hour at the most and then hardy could run around checking up on them well he had made up some weak kind of list true but it wasnt likely to do him or anybody else much good these were the first names of his customers who were not even acquaintances of his and no sooner had he begun in earnest than he realized he had no more notion of their last names than he did of their occupations addresses the kinds of cars they drove they were in essence complete strangers cash customers he found it ironic that any one of them if they could be found might be able to save him from a murder conviction but what was the likelihood of that they were talking about last wednesday night already five days into the past it was the last night holiday had worked the bar and now even he highly motivated could only remember four possible names and in another day or two he knew it wouldnt be worth the effort at all the typical customer at the ark probably drank in some dive every night so his possible saviors were in all probability unsure about which night exactly they had been at the ark wednesday or was that lefty odouls or johns grill or was that tuesday john had been on bartending both nights he put the pen down and closed his eyes trying to remember anything distinctive that would set wednesday apart to him or to any of his customers nothing came to mind he opened his eyes and there was his neat bourbon he picked up the glass and took of sniff of itgreat stuff knob creekbut suddenly there seemed something distasteful about it not the bourbon itself but the hold it had over him the blurred memory that was right now hampering his efforts to save his own future had come a shot at a time from a bottle much like this one the blurred memory he stood up and walked over to the window separating the blinds slightly the city wasnt pretty today the bay churned graygreen dotted with whitecaps he closed his eyes again and tried to reimagine the bar as it had been that allimportant wednesday night the people whod been sitting there right in front of him no doubt hed had conversations with some of them told jokes listened to their stories he hadnt gotten anywhere near to blacking out that night and still now five days later none of it was there nor he was sure would it be there for any of the others it was as though he hadnt lived those hours they were simply gone as today would be he knew if he picked up that glass and drank it off and after all what difference did it make all he knew was that suddenly for some reason it did he shouldnt be so willing to fight for his life to try to clear his name if the days were just going to continue on a succession of empty and forgettable moments he did not want empty anymore if it took someone trying to take his life away to enable him to see it then at least hed seen it in time the feeling came as unheralded as it was undeniable he wanted michelle to come back through that door he wanted to be alive for it for her for him he picked up the glass and poured its contents into the sink he rinsed every trace of alcohol out of the glass went to the refrigerator filled it with orange juice and drank she did come back they had tomato and mozzarella slices on sourdough bread with olive oil vinegar sea salt the grocery store sold fresh basil in little handfuls and they ate it leaf by leaf with the sandwiches with pellegrino water they were just finishing when michelles cell phone went off she answered and gave it to him his lawyer any luck with your list three and half first names i dont know if one guy was bryan or ryan any last names hardy wasnt in a good mood today hadnt been for a while first names dont do us any good i know ill keep trying meanwhile what meanwhile not much if youre okay where you are stay put thats my plan diz but is anybody having any luck finding who shot at us not much in fact theres a healthy skepticism about whether it happened at all if course it happened except theres no sign of it apparently im capable of faking these scratches and bruises to make panos look bad you tell em it was sephia he was in nevada when when we got shot at well a couple of hours later so so its four hours away not by helicopter the diamond centers got a helicopter remember sephia works for them the line hummed with silence diz im here ive got another question for you battle of hastings ten sixtysix no good answer though the question is what made sephia go to silvermans i mean in the first place thats too easy humor me okay how about fifteen thousand dollars or so that might do it but what was that thats what he lost the night before hardy spoke hesitantly as though afraid hed unhear what hed just heard i thought you were the one who lost so big i did we both did although nick lost more sam had a great night john why didnt you tell me this before you never asked diz nobody asked it never came up he heard a sigh over the line okay so who else would have known about it anybody else who was at the game i heard the cops knew thats how they got to me i hate to bore you with another list but i doubt i can get my hands on the police version thirty seconds later hardy had the names of the poker players and another question this to holiday was as easy as the first one sure julio rez and roy panos the three of them are always together you notice they were at the game too so whos rez theres a woman in the room with me its hard to be frank but trouble that would be a fair assessment i bet it was him who rez who shot at us nick driving or vice versa it doesnt really matter but with roy panos it gives us three doesnt it and that does matter thats the magic number well whatever it is it sure looks like youve kicked up a lot of shit after a short pause hardys voice came back the tone harsh whats that supposed to mean john im doing all i can here for you im not denying it you have my undying gratitude but the sad fact of the matter is all youre doing is exactly what you should be doing for yourself anyway i should theres no should here john im doing you a favor plain and simple youd be advised to count your blessings kiss my ass diz youre doing this because i wouldnt be here in this mess if it wasnt for you me jesus christ jesus christ yourself who do you think started this whole thing heres a hint it wasnt panos who was minding his own business until some lawyers decided to take him down and make a pile of cash in the process you know what kind of business it was john so they broke some rules what are you and freeman all of the sudden the guardian angels of the tenderloin youre telling me you guys went after him because of your concern for justice and goodness my ass talk to some of my clients i have diz remember i know a lot of them hell i found half of em for you hookers thieves robbers con artists every one and yeah okay so some of them had dope planted on them big fucking deal none of them are strangers to dope anyway better than getting beat to shit which panos could have done to them just as easily as planting dope and just as illegally please please sanctimonious crap you got in it for the money the fact is panos was providing a service the cops dont so youre defending him now no im saying you were in it too from the beginning its never been a moral issue between you guys just a conflict of interest great i appreciate your input so nobodys right what was silverman or freeman collateral damage both of em the inevitable next step thats what what was panos going to do let his nephew go and take this rap be sued to death i dont think so hell he offered you four million dollars to just go away and you said no remember whatd you expect him to do send you a hallmark card i think we ought to just go michelle said where anywhere away from here and then what i dont know we just live we wouldnt be living wed be hiding he was on the ottoman in front of her she was sitting in the chair by the window she reached over flipped the blinds open then closed them again isnt that what were doing now he smiled at that it wont be too much longer my lawyers got some ideas oh yeah it sounded like you were great pals holiday glossed over that besides if i run it looks like im guilty of something i hate to mention it john but so does not turning yourself in i was hoping maybe you wouldnt notice that part he took her hands in his this is going to work michelle all of it our life i dont want to start it out on the run i didnt do any of this i believe you she said but it seems like they have so much its all easily explained a little turn of the prism it was three other guys and now hardy knows who they are hell get their names in front of the right people youll see another two or three days theyll cancel the warrant and itll be all over hardy was going to write a book someday and call it nothing is ever easy his companion volume to nothing easy about ita parents guide to raising happy and well adjusted children the inspiration for todays chapter after his fury at his client had ebbed slightly came from trying to get interviews with the two namesfred waring and mel fischerthat holiday had given him from silvermans poker game both were listed in the telephone book in hindsight hardy realized that he should have recognized this right off as one of natures headfakes making it look as though something about these interviews might in fact be easy he could have used some easy the morning had already wiped him out waking up with the worlds worst hangover hadnt helped then there had been david at the hospital then the long and fruitless wait for blanca running into kroll and roy panos their news about aretha finally the argument with holiday about whether he was to blame for some of this he really didnt need that shit from his client not today not ever even if being honest now that his blinding anger had somewhat subsided he admitted that it might be partly true for most of the past two hours hed been holed up in his office lying on the couch damp paper towels over his eyes finally still hurting hed looked up the numbers of his two witnesses found them then punched up the one for fred waring hardy found himself on the bernard rulker amp co broker hotline press one if youd like to continue in english now press one if youd like to open a new account two if youre an existing rulker client and so on eventually hardy negotiated the maze and reached the point where he foolishly thought hed soon be speaking to an actual person but the please hold until one of our brokers can assist you was in itself merely a prelude we appreciate your patience please continue to hold to an actual timed fourminute musak version of satisfaction when a pleasantsounding woman finally came on hardy got off his speakerphone asked for fred waring and learned that he was on vacation in hawaii this week no they didnt have a number where he could be reached could someone else help him mel fischer had an answering machine and hardy left three phone numbersoffice home and celland a message who he was what this was about the matter was urgent he considered adding that it was a matter of life and death but didnt wish to appear too dramatic twenty minutes later he raised his head off the couch again this was ridiculous he was doing nothing worthwhile and much needed to be done the telephone book once again held the promise of good luckfischers address was on taylor apparently only a few blocks from his office filled with selfloathing as he was anyway hardy thought that the steep climb over nob hill would be just the kind of torture he deserved he fought his nausea enough to get him up and down the stairs at the reception area really an ovoid island in the center of the rotunda that was freemans lobby norma the office manager her elbows on the counter was in deep conversation with phyllis both women had been with the firm forever certainly since before hardy had arrived as a tenant and neither could be said to be big fans of his after all he didnt work for david or the firm and yet he took great swaths of the great mans time and used the firms xerox fax and other machines and even associates time according to his own idiosyncratic whims hardy couldnt say he was overly fond of either of the two women either still the sight of themthey turned to look at him when he emerged from the stairwayforced him to square his shoulders put forth a positive image unexpectedly norma straightened up and motioned him over she was a bigboned solid woman in her midfifties who exemplified the competence that freeman demanded fashionable without attempting to be glamorous completely lacking the gene responsible for humor she might have been the prototype for all of the legal office managers hardy had ever encountered hello ladies he said his voice a completely sincere and solemn monotone how is everybody holding up down here not too well norma said really not well at all hardy had picked up the pervading malaise downstairs ever since the day after the mugging but he couldnt really imagine what norma would have to say to him about it but she continued with all of mr freemans many talents it appears he never really considered the possibility of anything like this happening as long as he came in every day things just seemed to run smoothly hes always had a good manager hardy said norma smiled grateful for the praise well thank you but i was just saying im very much out of my depth just now i cant even sign paychecks and some of the associates need to be paid soon she hesitated looked to phyllis and frankly so do we the staff phyllis unbidden chimed in clients have been calling every day wheres david whens david coming back what am i supposed to tell them the panic in the voice of freemans dogmatic capable and strong gatekeeper came as something of a shock and brought hardy up short id just tell them that their work is in good hands that were hoping david will be back before too long but they want to know when and i cant tell them that norma handed a kleenex down to her came back to hardy i just dont know what to tell everyone and we thoughtphyllis and ithat even though youre not really a member of the firm youve got more well youre more mature than any of the associates and we thought maybe you could say something her own composure broke suddenly mr hardy its all coming apart i dont know what to do hardy hung his head briefly his head throbbed his eyes didnt want to focus ill do whatever i can norma but i cant say anybody will listen to me i just rent upstairs and everybody knows it but if you think it might help he looked around the expanse of the floor into the open solarium the empty xerox room a truly ominous silence reigned how long do you think youll be able to hold it together assuming david doesnt he found he couldnt finish david always kept a lot in petty cash we used to argue about that but now maybe i could use some of that she bit at her lip closed her eyes in thought for a second the associates are still billing and were getting payments maybe i could access some of those assets again she stopped best case mr hardy lets say a month if he doesnt recover but hes going to right she nodded shaky of course i didnt mean but its just that no one else can do what he does no i know he put a hand on her shoulder you just tell me when ill be there much to his surprise she stepped forward and put her arms around him squeezing and sending fresh spasms of pain across his back thank you she said thank you after a few more words of encouragement he crossed the lobby then descended by way of the semicircular staircase that opened into an ornate streetlevel foyer it was the middle of the workday just after lunch hour normally the place hummed with activity and even enthusiasm freeman might be a slavedriver but he was also a great lawyer with an immense talent for motivating his associates hardy stopped and listened again to the silence above in some very real way the world seemed to be ending hardy carried his cell phone with him it didnt ring as he labored up the steep slope of taylor street over nob hill three blocks back down the other side it still hadnt rung when he got to fischers address reasoning that anyone getting home and finding an urgent message would of course call right away hardy didnt really expect anyone when he rang the bell but then the voice came through the intercom who is that mr fischer my name is dismas hardy i called about john holiday it was turning into a cold november the overcast had thickened again and the breeze had freshened to a true wind that had chilled him thoroughly and now gusted around him as he waited on the stoop a full ten seconds passed he was about to ring the bell againnothing was easywhen he heard the buzzer and pushed against the door it was a twostory building without an elevator and when hardy got to the second floor fischer was standing in his open doorway as though guarding the sanctum within he looked like he was pushing seventy thickshouldered with a tonsure of gray hair he wore khakis tennis shoes and a black oakland raiders sweatshirt though he barely reached hardys shoulders the old man projected a pugnaciousness and even resentment out of all proportion to the apparent situation all right he said before hardy got to the last step whats so urgent about john holiday the son of a bitch may he rot in hell still a dozen feet away hardy paused he held up his hands for a second advanced another foot or two i have a couple of questions thats all youre his lawyer thats right then i got a question for you how do you live with yourself john didnt kill anybody hah howd sams stuff get in his house then aliens maybe something like that hardy said i hear you were at that last poker game yep what about it suddenly hardy found himself asking a question he hadnt even thought about have the police talked to you yet and gratifyingly it slowed fischer down what do you mean talked to me you know taken a statement about the game who was there who won what fischer eyed him suspiciously no nobodys talked to me not the cops i mean so somebody has i didnt say that his look was pure defiance nobody talked to me doesnt that seem strange to you that you were at this game the night before sam got killed and nobody from the police wanted to question you i wasnt there when he got killed they knew who they were looking for they didnt need me so you believe that john went back and tried to get back the money he lost thats what theyre saying yeah did anybody else lose money that night a lot of money fischer did an overdone impression of thinking about it nope he said with finality shaking his head he repeated it no you had to think that hard to remember this riled the old man even further no i remember perfectly holiday was the big loser that night nobody else hey jesus what do you want i answered your question all right thats enough he backed into the doorway put his hand on the door behind him you seem a little nervous mr fischer are you nervous you think maybe im going to hurt you did somebody else tell you theyd hurt you if you didnt change your story now the nerves were unmistakable i never changed any story they found all that stuff in johns place theres no doubt he did it hardy stepped up closer anger in his voice so theres no point then in bringing up who else might have lost money that night is there they didnt kill sam they just dont want people asking questions that might be embarrassing that might make the police think it looked like they had a reason too isnt that it mr fischer isnt that it for a lengthy moment fischer stared with wideeyed fear at hardy then suddenly he brought himself up straight i dont have to talk to you he said and ducked behind the door slamming it in hardys face hardy yelled at the door his voice reverberating in the hallway youll have to talk to me at the trial breathing hard in a fury he waited eventually he turned and walked back downstairs out into the bitter and windswept afternoon hardy called glitsky on his cell phone walking back to his office maybe abes meeting with jackman had gone well no glitsky said he wouldnt even listen to you oh he listened all right but he didnt hear abe this is just plain weird clarence knows us apparently not well enough apparently you and i are conspiring to obstruct justice im screwing with gerson going behind his back undermining his inspectors so i can expose his incompetence and get my old job back im also working with you on this panos lawsuit so that if you win i get to retire in style you want to run by me how thats going to work exactly how are you making anything off of my lawsuit im sure theres some way when you find out let me know would you a pause and clarence believes this i cant say that for sure not personally but were smeared enough that he cant be perceived to be involved abe hardy said these people shot at me i mentioned that and what did he say to that hell he saw me afterward he knows im not making it up not the issue not for clarence but he knows us were the good guys although after his debate with holiday on this issue the statement nagged at him relatively he added not even that not today today the systems working as it should as people are so fond of saying evidence talks and all the evidence says john holidays a stone killer and youre on his side which makes you one of the bad guys no relativity about it and of course because you and i are friends so am i except that the evidence is no good yeah glitsky said there is that back in his office for the third separate time that day hardy was killing more time before the five oclock meeting norma had scheduled for him to address freemans staff in the solarium his shoes and jacket were off he lay on his couch again eyes covered and realized that he had no other quasilegitimate legal venue where he might be able to make his case he hadnt swayed jackman had no chance with the homicide inspectors but he might be able to get to them through public pressure he and freeman had done this many times and he was a little surprised that he hadnt thought of it before now jeff elliott his friend and the writer of the citytalk column for the chronicle had finished his column for the day he told hardy that if he could save him the handicapped space under his buildingelliot had multiple sclerosishe would be happy to drop by for an hour of gay repartee as long as there was a story involved hardy went down and stood in the spot until elliot pulled into it in a trice the columnist had done his magic with his wheelchair the two men rode the back elevator up to the third floor while hardy had brought over some coffee and eased himself down in one of his client chairs elliot watched him move so who beat you up he asked hardy tried to smile i thought i was hiding it pretty well you thought wrong youre walking like the living dead he put his cup down so what happened leaving out the hangover which is another story thats what i wanted to talk to you about he gingerly rearranged his body in the wing chair went on to outline the high points of the situation as it had developed so now the whole world thinks that abe and i are illegally conspiring to get panos and take him and why are you doing this exactly so we can win this lawsuit that david and i had been working on past tense its starting to look like it although lets keep that off the record for now with some difficulty he changed position in his chair it was one of davids brilliant ideas that had some chance of success as long as he was around to pursue it but i cant keep it going on my own i cant even pay me much less the associates weve been using and that was before my witnesses started dying in jail no less he filled elliot in on aretha labonte although the official line is she killed herself but you think somehow it was panos i dont know how but yes hes got people on payroll in the jail hardy lifted a hand i know it stretches credibility thats a fair assessment but the only thing more incredible is that all of this stuff is coincidence david okay maybe even the windshield thing with me but the shots at me aretha dying somebodys behind all that its not just happening elliot had a pad out and was taking notes okay weve got freemans lawsuit panos wants to drive you out of it hes already done it jeff he did it when he took out david but youve got no proof zero elliot was clicking his pen what hardy asked elliott shook his head im trying to understand the connection between your lawsuit and all these murders beginning with silverman they dont seem related theyre both panos jeff im not saying theyre not im perfectly willing to believe that they are just tell me how thats all hardy slumped back in the chair drew a heavy breath and started at the beginning ten minutes later hed laid it all out he brought his right hand up to his forehead and squeezed at his temples sighed a last time looked across at elliott dont think i dont realize how bad this sounds jeff but its not john he didnt break my windshield he didnt hire some stooges to take shots at both of us this is panos and his gang he lifted himself from his slump came forward urgently and i cant get a soul to believe me how am i going to stop them before they try it again elliot held his coffee still on the arm of his wheelchair hed given up all pretense of notetaking now to buy himself another few seconds he sipped at the cup heres the thing diz i believe you just so thats out of the way between you and me okay okay absolute belief you say it i buy it good enough hardy nodded good but that said the question now becomes what can i do to help you which i would love to do if for no other reason than its a terrific story so write it up crime boss bamboozles city hall youll win the pulitzer prize thatll be fun jeff said but first i need one little thing that an objective party such as my editor might take as evidence that there is something real here and not just the wild conjecture of a defense attorney who wants to get his client off no offense no of course not none taken but were talking murder here diz multiple and very ugly murder and wade panos isnt some smalltime gangster if i print any part of this without some show of proof well you know this what do you need not much elliot said but youve got an enormous big edifice going here its going to need at least a little tiny foundation in unassailable fact hardy took another run at it pointing out the various holes in the police casethe planted rings at holidays along with sadies testimony and cuneos interpretation of it the slightly offsize fashionable italian shoe thieus checkup on and belief in holidays alibi at the end of it elliot was frowning none of which im sad to say rises to the level of proof hardy had gotten out of his chair was creaking around the office elliotts words stopped him over by the dartboard they cant have done this so well if somebody searched their places but elliot was shaking his head who and why you need something to start with he closed his notepad maybe next time theyll make a mistake maybe next time will be me jeff or abe and maybe next time they wont miss i dont want any next time i hear you elliot looked toward the window dusk had settled he looked at his watch i dont mean to run but ive got to go dorothy batters me horribly if dinners done and im not home out at the elevator hardy pushed the button for the basement then stepped out in the hall as the door started to close jeff wheeled forward a couple of inches and stopped it he looked up at hardy the first thing you do the first bit of real evidence you find you call me hear thirty people more or less had gathered in the solarium some like graham russo and amy wu were hardys friends some of the othersphyllis and norma for examplehad been at best politely adversarial the rest comprised a pretty decent microcosm of the adult world the ages ranged from perhaps twenty to phylliss sixtysomething a quick glance around revealed every major ethnic configuration about half men and half women hardy thought it ironic that freeman who found san franciscos endemic runaway political correctness as offensive as affirmative action of any kind had staffed his own firm with such an incredibly diverse talent pool as hardy came into the conference area stooped and drained he gathered some sense of the rooms expectation he might be an outcast in the other professional aspect of his life but here he felt a strong and unexpected acceptance mixed with a real pride that he was affiliated with this quality group of individuals he wasnt really part of them yet clearly he had their respecteveryone had gathered to hear him someone closed the door behind them all and after a minute the room was silent hardy stood at the head of the oblong table made eye contact with norma graham amy some others and in his natural voice began weve all been attacked he said we feel violated angry and victimized were all of us afraid of whats going to happen next whether its tomorrow or next week or even beyond that weve all been working hard on projects and cases that may now have to be abandoned and were wondering what will have been the point of all those hours and all that work all i can say is that the value of the things we do lies in doing them as well as we can and that what we continue to do does matter i know that we are all hoping and praying that things here will return to normal but we must face the possibility that they may not so the real question is how we all of us deal with this uncertainty and this changing order my only suggestion is that we take solace and comfort in our families and friends our faiths if we have them and our work if it all ends here tomorrowand it mightthen well at least have had the satisfaction of knowing that weve done everything we can to preserve a great legacy with integrity and class if things do change well be no less ready to deal with that change for having kept up our spirits if on the other hand life here returns to normal how proud well all be of the fact that when everything looked the darkest we held our course treya and abe glitsky sat in their car where shed parked it near their place her last few comments sounded like she was defending clarence jackman and abe wasnt much in the mood to hear it so he accuses me and diz instead hes not under the impression that he did that then he wasnt paying attention well she said hes politically bound dont look at me like that im completely with you on this im just explaining his position and for the record i think it stinks im well into serious anger myself what else does he expect you to do thats easy stay completely out of it can you do that do you want to i dont know he said i keep telling myself it isnt my case it has nothing to do with me except that they shot at diz and beat up freeman and maybe had something to do with this prostitute who hanged herself and nobody seems to be trying to stop them which still doesnt make it your job does it she reached over and touched his leg thats not a criticism its a real question he put his hand over hers okay heres where we are then it seems to me diz tells me the lawsuit is pretty much over the attacks on freeman and aretha and maybe diz worked lets say it is nick sephia and his pals theyre done on that score right nobody caught them but the threats over they dont need to do anything else so i can let that go clear conscience not my job you with me all right but the other side wheres holiday in the picture that parts not over not even close even leaving out whoever killed everybody in the line leading from silverman meaning creed and wills and terry theyve still got to take out holiday if they want to be able to rest easy and maybe knock off diz and maybe you too glitsky pulled at an ear okay maybe that but it doesnt change the fact theyre going to have to try to get to holiday and maybe diz after him so given that if theres some way i can help stop them i dont see how i can keep out of it no she sighed i dont see how you can either which leaves what play by the rules whose rules i know she said i know jesus christ roy this was originally going to be one of the famous quick and dirties you remember that bang bang bang bang and its all over now shit they were in wades enclosed patio where he was finishing another jigsaw puzzle hed summoned his brother to his home after liz had told him about this new wrinkle shed found out from her boyfriendthat some lieutenant named glitsky who used to run homicide and now was somehow tight with silvermans widow had put it together that the ring hadnt been taken during the silverman robbery what kind of stupidity made em think up taking some rings nobody needed the rings and without em its foolproof what were they thinkin roy straight in from his shift was still in uniform a jumpy wariness clung about him as it often did when he had to confront his intelligent and powerful older brother i told em that wade the same thing the money and the pouch thats all but julio thought the ring locked it up tighter wade grimaced julios an idiot a psychopathic idiot hes not so bad he was trying to help dont give me that wade said you see what the little fuck did to freeman i say go out and put the old man off his feed a few days maybe get him thinking about his workload and whats he do fucking kills him i didnt hear that freemans dead not literally not yet anyway but not because rez didnt try he shook his head with disgust i tell you that guy scares the shit out of me i dont know why nickys got to hang with such an animal what he did to those two faggots jesus when a couple of quick shots would have done it as well better then the two of them get their chance to finish it up and they miss holiday for christs sake and again once hes dead its all over he saw something on the table in front of him and placed a large piece hed already connected into a corner of the puzzle so now its the loaves and fucking fishes we get rid of everybody we need to and weve still got three more and one of ems a lieutenant christ whens it gonna end roy hows it gonna end roy wiped his palms on the arms of his chair same as always wade same plan its going to end with holiday hell turn up maybe at his house maybe with his lawyer again maybe jail but someplace then he goes and after that nobodys going to worry about whether hes guilty or not anymore what about the lawyer with holiday gone whos going to pay him why would he care but if he does if this guy glitsky does they wont stop worrying worryings what i do roy forced a grin come on wade you know how it is holidays a job to these guys something they do to get paid hardy and glitsky they both have families for christs sake on the off chance one of em might get a wild hair around this we give em a nudge and they drop the thing like a hot potato maybe we even do that soon get them out of the way now what kind of nudge you hurt them youre asking for more trouble and if rez is part of that youll be covering up for what he does the rest of your life im not thinking about hurting anybody just make em think wade held up a hand dont tell me i dont want to know how just make it happen hardy was on his way out of his evening hospital visit when roake was coming in she was professionally dressed and told him shed had to be in court all afternoon life was going on since it had to how were things here any change there wasnt any news and the two found themselves again in the gift shop sitting at the one table roake in the nicest most concerned way imaginable commented on how terrible hardy looked how lousy he sounded was he eating getting any sleep he should try to take better care of himself im working on it he told her but in the meanwhile ive got a problem maybe you can help me with she nodded if i can he took a deep breath and came out with it i know who beat up david does the name nick sephia ring a bell it did roake remembered the earlier mistaken battery when sephia had turned and knocked freeman to the floor outside the courtroom during the summer youre sure its him hardy considered for a second beyond a reasonable doubt and you would be too okay so whats your problem he gave her a truncated version of his own interaction with blanca backfilled through jackman and glitsky then brought it around to silverman and holiday in any event he concluded blanca started out fine but recently hasnt been too inclined to bust any hump for me somebody convinced him im just scamming to get holiday off but somebody shot at you if you happen to believe that he shrugged i cant explain all this gina i dont think though that you have the stink that abe and i have somehow developed youre freemans fiancee youve seen blanca here hell talk to you and what do you want me to say or do at this hardy tried to smile first just deliver a message when i originally told blanca i thought i knew whod shot at methis was like two hours after it happenedhe checked on sephia and found out he was in nevada at least four hours away roakes brow furrowed in thought which leaves him out thats what blanca thought too and that seemed right even to me until john holiday pointed out that nicks got the use of the diamond centers helicopter fortyfive minutes to state line roake seemed to be waiting for more at last she said excuse me for thinking like a defense attorney but since thats what ive been my whole life nick having access to a helicopter doesnt mean he shot at you no of course not but at least it means that my accusation wasnt whole cloth i wasnt just getting in a random dig at panos and his people which is apparently what blanca has been thinking the thing is i believe that both jackman and blanca really do want to find who did this thing to david im telling you it was sephia if you mention this incident between david and sephia last summer or maybe krolls threat to david the night before before this happened maybe theyll listen at least enough to call sephia in to talk if theres a god its not even impossible blanca could be convinced to pull a search warrant roakes eyes had taken on a faraway cast what are you thinking he asked what oh she lifted her left hand displaying the diamond ring just imagining what i thought id be feeling like today married to him i mean her smile didnt come any more easily than hardys had not like this then abruptly but the answer is yes of course ill go see blanca or anybody else you suggest hes on in the morning yes all right again her focus shifted can i ask you another question how do you know know what that it was this sephia person do you have any proof the question obviously struck a nervehardy visibly reigned in a rising tide of temper she put out a hand and touched his dont get mad at me diz im on your side but its a legitimate question im sure it is jeff elliot had the same one well well im getting damn tired of it to tell you the truth i know it was nick what am i supposed to do let him kill more people while i try to find proof that hes killed others she drew a deep breath the short answer to that im afraid is yes if he did kill somebody else or even beat up david and god knows i want pure sweet revenge for that but still you need hardy cut her off so he shoots at you you dont fire back no somebody shoots at you you fire back at where the shot came from that as you know better than anyone is selfdefense if you happen to kill the shooter two things youve proven he was behind the gun and you get your revenge but you dont get shot at decide who it must have been then go to his house and shoot him back two days later because what if it could have been even should have been your guy but it wasnt that didnt happen here no whats different again she touched his hand my only point is youll hurt yourself diz after a minute of silence she added youve got to find something thats all at least for yourself if not for the law youve got to know really know hardy shook his head and swore under his breath another silence built broken finally again by gina heres a terrible thought she said terrible is my favorite what is it just that ive got the key to davids apartment she started running with the fantasy if something david owned found its way into sephias say pocket and blanca happened to see it that might get to probable cause for a search i cant believe im saying this they do a search of his place they got him hardy said rising to the idea the plant would only get them inside it would take some real evidence after thatsay blood splatter on his clothes and my guess is that there would be plentyto arrest him right wed just be facilitating a legal search they looked at each other with a thrill almost of illicit love both of them wondering how it would be to play outside the rules to beat these criminals at their own game finally hardy pulled out of it its a beautiful idea gina but maybe we wont need it i couldnt do it anyway she said i dont know if i could either probably thats a good thing she said its why theyre them and were us right hardy said if we dont do it by the book were as bad as they are does something seem wrong with this picture somehow hardy and frannie hadnt had the best night of their lives so far and now with glitskys urgent and atypical call inviting himself and treya over to talk about their options it didnt look as though it was going to improve they were in the kitchen an hour after a dinner that had featured a meltdown of sorts from the kids who had finally processed the reality that their father had been shot at and badly hurt in the bargain they might not know exactly what it was but they understood that something truly bad was happening uncle moses and aunt susan had been here until late last night rebecca and vincent banished with their younger cousins to the back of the house while the adults drank and argued this morning their father and mother had barely spoken were they getting divorced why was someone trying to hurt dad were they actually trying to kill him what were they going to do about that what was dad going to do he was trying to find who it was wasnt he get them arrested what were the police doing were they in danger hardy found it difficult to finesse these questions particularly since frannie wasnt helping much she was still mad at the situation mostly at her brother true but beyond that shed been dealing with the kids blossoming reaction to all this since six oclock this morning by which time her hung over husband was already long gone for work tears and fears what was going to happen to them what if dad died what was this all about i dont want to live like this frannie said i dont know how these people have done this to us they were keeping their voices abnormally low so that vincent and rebecca doing their homework in the rooms directly behind the kitchen would not have more cause to worry to hardy the tension in the house twanged with every sound he crossed the kitchen and put his arms around his wife she leaned up against him i dont know what to do she said i just feel so helpless thats what abe and treya are coming over for he said well come up with some plan the four of us but i dont understand why the police or clarence jackman for that matter why they dont believe you in the first place thats the part thats making me crazy you didnt do anything wrong thats funny john holiday seems to think i started the whole thing me and david at frannies look of disbelief he explained going after panos hello frannie didnt want to hear this nonsense youve got over a dozen clients hes harmed one way or another thats not you starting it i tried to make that same point myself evidently mr panos can do whatever he wants and if somebody like me calls him on it im at fault john really said that more or less that really makes me mad you must be a bad person too anyway i tried to explain that maybe im not a moral paragon but what im doing is within the law whereas everything panos has done and is doing is against it call me delusional but thats a big difference did he get it john not really hes not much into right and wrong he simply pointed out that i should have been prepared to handle this stuff before i started in on panos to begin with she moved back into his embrace its like this bad dream where youre drowning and calling out the names of everybody who could save you on the shore right around you but nobody hears i know hardy said i know what else could he say thats exactly what it was like he and frannie were having the same nightmare or maybe not exactly the same she boosted herself up onto the kitchen counter and she sat with her ankles crossed her hands clasped between her legs her head held low this has always been my biggest fear you know that that somebody was going to take all this law stuff personally and come after you or us me and the kids and you always told me that that never happened except now it has i know he rested his own weight against the opposite counter what do you want me to say i never thought it would but now that it has maybe we should reconsider what she raised her eyes maybe everything i guess hardy didnt like the sound of that at all everything takes in a lot fran youre not saying you and me i hope not specifically no but the life we have if its not safe this is one moment fran its not our life our life has been good it still is good but not living like this if we lost the kids hardy stepped toward her thats not going to happen dont she snapped it out stopping him dont say its not going to happen you dont know whats going to happen youve always told me that this wouldnt happen hardy backed off took a breath so what are you saying what do you want to do i dont know anger flashed in her eyes then after a beat with some measure of calm i dont know maybe we should just leave here start over someplace else with you doing something else and how do we do that exactly what do we live on for example wed find something something thats going to support four of us with two kids in college in a couple of years i dont know how were going to do that and then what sell the house we could frannie we cant he approached again but more cautiously listen to me i dont want something else this is what i do im trained in it and im good at it i may even be doing some good from time to time but your life is threatening all of us dismas cant you see that he gathered what he felt to be the last of his reserve hed come to where she sat and he set his hands on either side of her hips he felt that it would take all his strength to keep his voice modulated and when he spoke it was almost in a whisper cant you see that whats at stake here is exactly that the way we live the way we want to live some crop of assholes comes in and threatens us threatens that what do you want me to do what do you want us to do pack up and move i dont believe it because then what youre alive at least were alive now and were where we belong were just scared and so we live with this fear sometimes yes sometimes we have to hopefully not for too long he brought a hand up and touched her cheek look fran i dont like it any more than you do but you just cant let the bastards win sometimes they push you far enough and youve got to fight or else theyll take it all theyll just take it because they can because nobody will stop them and thats wherever we move whatever we do at a little before midnight in her camouflage outfit land with her heart pounding against the wall of her chest michelle walked all the way up one side of casa street crossed where it abutted on marina boulevard then all the way back on the other there were several mature trees sprouting from squares cut in the sidewalk and these blocked some of the illumination from the streetlights still she thought she could tell if a person or even two was sitting in any of the cars parked solidly against the curbs on both sides she saw none this time she left the newspapers where they were and took the steps to the landing quietly but two at a time at the top a sudden lightheadedness came over her so strongly that she thought for a second that she would faint straining to hear any sound that would mean discovery she could hear nothing except the beat of her heart throbbing in her ears unable to stop herself she walked back down the stairs and peeked out for another look at the street back upstairs she opened the screen door wincing at the squeak waiting another minute listening then suddenly in a great hurry she inserted the key opened the door and closed it behind her she stood in blackness letting her eyes adjust after a time some faint illumination of the streetlights through the front windows seemed to create spectral shadows and eventually these resolved into shapes and spaces and she felt she could walk safely the errand was simple enough she was picking up some of his clothes whatever bills might have accumulated a checkbook and atm card if she could find them in his rolltop michelle hadnt worried until shed gotten to the front stoop when suddenly the entire idea struck her as foolish beyond imagining except now she was already here inside it was an older building and the hardwood floor creaked as she moved back down the hallway toward johns bedroom shed made the walk several times and had never noticed the sound before but now the boards seemed to be screaming in agony at her light and cautious tread what if the people downstairs woke up and called the police she stopped pinned to the wall sweating now even in the chilled hall she was not cut out for this kind of work but there seemed nothing to do but continue and the back half of the hallway was blessedly more quiet if she walked faster she had brought a small but powerful maglite flashlight and a string shopping bag that could stretch to accommodate everything she needed and she went right to his dressersocks and underwear in the top drawer a couple of shirts in the next one down an extra pair of jeans tightly rolled her bag was nearly full but then she was almost donejust the checkbook and the mail the rolltop did not budge at first nor at her second try straightening up she took several deep breaths took hold of the two handles when she jerked at it sharply the old wood released and the top flew up with a rattle and a crash for a full minute she didnt move barely trusted herself to breathe but there was no sound from below from anywhere far in the distance a siren wailed but then stopped almost immediately it wasnt about her the checkbook with his atm card was in the top middle drawer where hed told her shed find it farther back a picture frame face down stopped her completely carefully she lay the flashlight on the desk and reached in lifting it with both hands setting it upright in front of her it was of course emma and jolie she should have known unable to tear her eyes from the image by the flashlights beam she studied the faces of johns lost loves it was the furthest thing from a posed shot with saycheese smiles and orchestrated effervescence perhaps because of that she knew why this was the one hed kept the one hed framed it was a feeding moment the baby in a high chair anticipating the bite which judging from her clean face might be the first of that meal the mom bringing a spoon toward her although she immediately recognized john in the infants face the mouth especially the baby took after her mother even more particularly in this picture where they wore the same expression a kind of rapturous expectation both so vividly alive both so young a noise close by shattered her reverie in her nerves and haste she reached both for the flashlight and the picture the frame escaped her grasp in the nowsudden dark and it came down the glass breaking with its unmistakable sickening sound in the aftermath the silence was complete again but she thought not quite as it had been before now glued to the chair shaking but immobile she imagined someone else within hearing distance listening as she was for another sound she put her hand over her mouth to stop her own breathing tried in vain to summon some saliva to swallow someone was at the screen door which creaked again a second later she heard a key turn and the hallway light came on a mans voice called out this is the police i have a weapon drawn come out where i can see you michelle went to stand up then thought better of it im in the bedroom down to your left she said my hands are over my head i wont move until you say so like last time there were two of them but not the same two the asian man the one whod been holding the gun when he walked in put the thing in its holster then approached her with his wallet out and badge showing after asking her to stand up he introduced himself as sergeant inspector paul thieu of san francisco homicide he didnt waste any time at all he patted her down quickly and thoroughly then asked what she was doing here she thought shed go with the same basic story that had worked before i watch johns apartment when hes away you do do you can i see some identification please she fumbled in the breast pocket of her camo shirt and brought forth a wallet insert with her drivers license which he took examined carefully and showed to his partner the partner carried a briefcase he was short dark welldressed with a soul patch under his lip returning the wallet insert to her thieu looked her up and down seemed satisfied with something all right let me ask you again what are you doing here i just told you i he was shaking his head no patiently but with a determined look he pointed to the string bag at her feet that bag is full of mens clothes and what looks from here like a checkbook which makes me believe that weve come upon you here in the act of burglary no thats not it really she implored each of the men in turn look she reached into her front pocket i have a key the key john gave me i didnt break in here hes a friend of mine i watch his stuff clothes thieu said pointing again thinking fast she offered a hopeful face i wash them he leaves them in the hamper i was bringing them back in the dark at one oclock in the morning youre one heck of a friend do you expect us to believe any of this well he pays me of course not much but do you know theres a warrant out for mr holidays arrest for murder i i know i heard that but that must be a mistake john wouldnt hurt anybody do you know where he is no you mean now thieu turned to the other man do you think i meant now len did you get that impression the other man nodded shot her the straight line he means now no i dont have any idea where he is i mean thats why i came here i havent heard from john in a few days almost a week now suddenly her eyes lit up look i came by here on friday too she blurted when the other officers were here what other officers the men with the search warrant they had identification a black guy and a white guy cuneo and russell the other man said all right and these inspectors talked to you same as you checked my id everything and you were here again why that day the same as now then picking up johns newspapers theyre still down there i notice she shook her head just the last three days i was going to get them on the way out and throw them away and you told all this to inspectors cuneo and russell if those were their names and they just let you go back home thieu was in a pickle earlier tonight at the house of glitskys lawyer friend hardy thieu had told the lieutenant that hed come here with faro it seemed a reasonable risk but it was turning out to be true what everybody saidthat no good deed ever went unpunished and thats what in theory this trip to holidays was intended to be a good deed albeit with elements of selfinterest glitsky hardy and their wives had been truly distraught over this problem with panos thieu hadnt seen abe so angry in years and treyain thieus opinion a rock of sanity patience and good humorwas if possible even madder thieu had come to glitsky this morning with his problem and this was he supposed why abe was such a valuable friend and mentor coming here could be the solution for both of them and for hardy as well thieu got the feeling that glitsky and hardy had come to their decision after quite a lot of internal debate between them and that neither was thrilled with deciding that their only viable option was to find evidence linking sephia roy panos and rez to these murders clearly they would both have preferred some kind of confrontation with these men but in the end they were lawmen and theyd do it according to the law finally hardy suggested that thieu come here with len faro and dust the place for fingerprints the csi team had already done the places where theyd discovered the incriminating evidence from silvermans photographed the stuff in place dusted the actual articles for prints where possible but they hadnt done a general sweep of the entire duplex unitdishes in the sink doorknobs bathroom fixtures the other three suspects had never been at holidays house and glitsky thought that thieu ought to be able to get some kind of statement to that effect even a verbal admission might do the trick though written or taped would be better once they had that if they found fingerprints of any of the suspects at holidays home the question of where the planted evidence had come from was going to drive the investigation either to one of the true conspirators doors or to wade panos the only wrinkle from thieus perspective was the imperative to keep himself out of it the problem as well as the source of his pique was that he wasnt assigned to any of the murders that came in the wake of sam silverman so what excuse could thieu plausibly invent for why he had to go to holidays duplex in the dead of night and dust for fingerprints he had to give it to these defense lawyers they were a devious group and hardy clearly belonged among them thieu simply wouldnt mention it until he had the results as far as lennard faro was concerned thieu was doing a routine favor for his two homicide colleagues cuneo and russell just being thorough with housekeeping at the home of a murder suspect the print lifts would go to the lab faro would neither know nor care what they were about and would never ask after the results came in if the fingerprints of sephia andor panos andor rez came in then having at least established the panos connection to the case thieu could come to gerson and man to man admit to his earlier reservations about the evidence and the interpretations of cuneo and russell perfect until this woman he believed no part of her story in his heart he was even insulted that she could think any part of it was plausible he ached to put handcuffs on her take her downtown and do a serious interrogation but that would leave him with the really insoluble problem of explaining to gerson why hed been here in the first place the entire house of cards would come down if he didnt have a positive match on some panosconnected prints to fall back on he could certainly find himself out of homicide possibly cut in rank and then there was the even bigger problem thieu was morally certain not only that this michelle maier knew where the fugitive john holiday was at this moment but that he was at her own home she had come over here to get him some changes of clothes obviously access to his money he and len could drive her back to her place put the cuffs on holiday and be heroes tomorrow except glitsky didnt think holiday did it from thieus perspective the evidence didnt say he did either it was simply good police work to verify whether an alternative set of suspects had a substantial evidentiary problem and the woman ms maier had given him a rationalization shed actually been here with cuneo and russell just three days ago and they hadnt seen fit to follow up it blew thieus mind it wasnt what they were looking for and so they hadnt seen what it so obviously was no doubt her explanations had been as lame then as now by her own admission theyd checked her identification so in theory cuneo and russell knew as much about her as thieu did though hed be surprised if either one of them had thought to write down her last name or address or remembered them as he did john holiday was their suspect it was their case not his let them work it all this passed through thieus agile mind during his brief questioning of michelle maier she had just begun blowing more smoke about the newspapers how she was planning on picking them up on her way out tonight and they just let you go back home yes sir he turned to faro shrugged extravagantly well ms maier it appears to be your lucky night inspector faro and i have a lot of technical ground to cover here and if you gave your name and address to the other inspectors im going to assume they followed up as they should that okay with you len faro tugged at his bug he held the rank of inspector but wasnt an investigator he did forensics and crime scene analysis as far as he was concerned the womans presence was only significant to the extent that it sullied the scene the sooner she was gone the better as long as she doesnt touch anything else going out leave the mail he told her michelle knew what she was hearing but wasnt sure she believed it thieu lifted his hand and waved as he would to a child drive safely he said really i can go thieu nodded impatiently thank you i mean im sorry i just she noticed the string bag at her feet and leaned over to pick it up then she walked past the two policemen and out the front door ever since hed finally gotten his doctors permission to go back to work after his year and a half of recovery glitsky hadnt missed a day over a very early breakfast thoughthe baby wasnt even up yethe was telling treya that he thought he could spend his time more profitably outside today but do you want to hear something funny more than anything i feel guilty about it about what taking the day off calling in sick when im not ive never done that before youre kidding treya put her bagel down never not once i told you it was funny hysterical except i dont think i have either no wonder were a good couple were probably the only two people in america which leaves me with a problem i was hoping youd be able to tell me the proper etiquette for when i call in but now it turns out you wouldnt know i dont think theres really much of an etiquette you call leave a message yeah but im supposed to be sick so for example do i try to sound miserable how would they tell the difference glitsky faked a pout that was cruel im in a cruel mood this was and had been true since yesterday since soon after glitskys meeting with jackman glitsky thought she was proving herself to be one of the premier grudge holders i havent decided if im going in either she said and im talking about ever how dare that man treat you that way it wasnt personal thats kind of my point abe it should have been personal you and dismas are about half the reason he got that job in the first place maybe true but were not going to be why he gets to keep it glitsky picked up a slice of lox rolled it up and popped it into his mouth when i was a kid i thought the ultimate food was lox you know that if you ate lox you were a mega success like a movie star if somebody had ever told me that one day i a mere cop would commonly eat lox at home i wouldnt have believed them and yet look at us sometimes i still cant believe it that was subtle she said but i caught it youre changing the subject away from clarence and i want to vent some more you can if you want but he wasnt all wrong diz and i really have nothing and clarences reaction was probably a good portion of why we decided we had to look rather than just accuse besides if hes getting calls from washington and rigbythe mayor and police chief respectively on the weekends its helpful for us to know how high panoss influence extends in a way his coming down on me was a pretty good heads up he might have even meant it that way im sure he shrugged as you so astutely observed hes playing the political game right now hes got his hands on the power and hes the best da weve had in years so he wants to keep it i cant blame him its high stakes and the ends justify the means sometimes not always i think clarence is trying to figure out that balance himself if diz and i actually get something that does break this case hell jump on it with both feet do you really think that after what hes already done to you both absolutely treya chewed silently sipped at her tea all right ill go to work but he can get his own darn coffee at a quarter to eight glitsky flashed his badge at the manager of the diamond center lot at he and hardy were still in hardys car in a vip parking space just to the side of the entrance and directly across the street from the georgia aaa diamond center hardy still hurt he dozed fitfully behind the wheel until glitsky backhanded his shoulder panos he said it was roy on foot and in uniform stopping at the huge double doors he checked his watch paced to the corner looked both ways then came back to the doors and looked at his watch again he wasnt sixty feet from where they were parked both men slumped in their seats awaiting developments they werent long in coming two men coming up out of the lot passed within five feet of glitskys window again he ticked hardys shoulder and pointed sephia in a black leather calflength coat and rez in tight black chinos and a tan torsohugging sweater that he tucked into his pants they crossed to where roy waited at the doors he wasted no time but immediately grew animated gesticulating all bulldog next time we bring one of those distance microphones tape everything they say glitsky said when hardy didnt reply he said that was a joke diz but hardy still didnt answer he just sat watching the trio across the street after a few minutes of back and forth roy seemed to have shot his wad in terms of aggression and then the meeting abruptly as it had begun was over roy resumed the walk on his beat sephia and rez went to the double doors of the diamond center and disappeared inside well hardy said theyre all involved in something together but we already knew that id love to go inside and have a few words with nick what good would that do i dont know maybe none but it would be fun to bait him a little cast aspersions about his mothers heritage or something see if i could get him to take a poke at me with witnesses around its nice to see you thinking about having fun again i wasnt going to mention it but your companys been less than scintillating this morning yeah but i had all the ideas last night speaking of which no word from thieu glitsky shook his head too soon his eyes had never left the double doors and now he bobbed his head that way see you wouldnt have had any time anyway keep low but they neednt have worried sephia carried a plain paper bag and he and rez passed them again close enough to touch but they were deeply into their own conversation now and never slowed now what hardy said gentlemen start your engines so they were ready glitsky looking back over his shoulder said okay hardy let them pass said thats the car and fell in behind them what car the gray sedan the one they were driving when they shot at me and john the bastards are so smug they didnt even use a rental or a throwaway can you believe that glitsky had his pad out and got the license number they were heading west on geary now back a couple of carlengths but no one in between speaking of fun if we can ever get somebody to start issuing search warrants it might be fun to dig around in that thing there it is hardy said fun again but as he said it he was rolling the muscles of his back he didnt look like he was having fun they followed as the car did the onewaystreet boogie until it was heading south now on van ness then down mission to twentyfirst street where it turned right and finally pulled to a stop at the curb in front of a nicely maintained freestanding victorian house hardy drove by as both men were getting out of their car there was no paper bag although sephia walked with both of his hands inside the pockets of his black coat hardy pulled over a couple of houses up the road whats this he asked i dont know glitsky was writing down the address though drug drop maybe i dont know he said again it wasnt a long wait perhaps ten minutes when they came out of the house this time rez was holding a briefcase they got back on the road and the tail continued by noon when they turned back into the diamond center lot theyd made four similar stops from the mission out to diamond heights and then to a palatial gated home in st francis wood by this time both hardy and glitsky had concluded that whatever the boys were up to it wasnt kosher but they didnt get much time to air any of their theories they were parked in a loading zone waiting for the two men to exit the lot again hardy had just turned off the motor when he looked into the rearview mirror and said okay here they come at the same moment hardys cell phone rang he watched sephia and rez each with a briefcase now as they crossed the street but he stopped paying attention to them when he heard his wifes voice crying dismas she managed to get out please what is it fran do you hear me easy i cant be easy she screamed then dismas youve got to come home i will but please now are you all right should i call nine one one no but its her breathing came in ragged gasps just get here okay sure im on my way but whats i cant explain youll have to see oh god ive got to call the school the school why are the kids ive got to call the school she repeated and hung up fran frannie he stared at the dead phone what is it glitsky asked not good hardy said a muscle twitched at the side of his jaw whatever it is its not good shes calling the school he turned to his friend listen abe im done here ive got to go now he hit the ignition i can drop you someplace on the way no glitsky was already halfway out of the car you go the car peeled out in a spray of gravel holiday was alone now in the yerba buena motel at the corner of van ness and lombard not even three blocks from michelles house she had come back home last night traumatized and panicstricken she was sure that the policemen that had been at his place had followed her home they both had to get out of there right away so theyd walked down here a few blocks and michelle had checked them both in under her name and now she was gone she had a deadline for a big article on bonzais for sunset and she needed to do a ton of research she told him he should just hang out here in the room and shed be back midafternoon with some lunch he called hardys office three times and redundantly left michelles cell phone number each time but it appeared that his lawyer had taken the day off the one time he ventured a look out the window a blackandwhite police car had been parked in the lot outside the next time he looked it had gone but the anxiety hadnt this was getting bad he knew he was going to have to do something he couldnt just sit here when the maid knocked he let her in and went out across the street and into the convenience store on the corner at least his picture wasnt on the front page of the newspapers out front today he bought a quart of milk a quart of apple juice six apples a snickers candy bar and a copy of the chronicle when he got back the maid had finished he drank the milk and ate an apple and the candy bar he read the chronicle was pleased to note on page two that they still hadnt found him although the search continued he tried hardy again but he still wasnt in finally he took a clean towel from the bathroom and used it as a tablecloth on the bedside table he took his gun from his jacket pocket made sure there wasnt a bullet in the chamber nor a clip in the handle after wiping it clean with the towel he tried the action sighted down the barrel squeezed off a succession of phantom rounds to his surprise he found that the clip had only four rounds in it and he opened his box and squeezed in another three so that it was fully loaded he worked the action to chamber a round then dropped the clip and put another bullet in its place finally he jammed the clip into the weapon loaded for bear thieu didnt get much sleep but he wasnt accustomed to more than five hours anyway so it didnt bother him after he and faro had finished their dusting at holidays he decided on his own that dismas hardys strategy had if not a flaw at least a difficulty thieu still had to find a way that he could plausibly inject himself into a discussion with sephia and rez about their possible presence at holidays duplex that wasnt his case on the other hand he had been the responding inspector to the terrywills scene any concerns he had about the inviolability of that scene would be completely appropriate so at a little before two he appeared at the diamond center and ten minutes later found himself in a small anteroom off the showroom floor explaining about his problem to the private security guards sephia and rez so the basic security of the scene is still my responsibility he lied and i know both you guys andhe looked down at his pad and roy panos have been helping out inspectors cuneo and russell isnt that right some sephia replied mostly thats been roy though yeah i already got him thieu passed over roy quickly he didnt want them to ask what he meant by saying he got him but they mentioned you too sephia looked to reza question then he shrugged we just talked to them a couple of times but you never went with them you never were at terrys and wills apartment why would we rez asked did anybody say we were why dont you ask them the other inspectors thieu played innocent theyre out today interviewing witnesses and they asked me to clear this up look were trying to get the neighbors and other folks to tell us who had been in and out of there its a simple question have either of you guys ever been there before rez looked at sephia they both looked at thieu no of course not now thieu had them he pulled out his tape recorder and they couldnt very well refuse to repeat the denial then when he got to the end he set the hook by the way he said with the tape still running have either of you guys ever been to john holidays apartment glitsky wandered around downtown for over an hour his mind jumping between hardys sudden emergency and the odyssey theyd witnessed with sephia and rez he ended up at davids deli where he sat at the bar and ordered a pastrami sandwich and a celray soda he checked his watch he was dying to know but wanted to give hardy time to work out the problem whatever it was it seemed serious but if hed have wanted glitskys company or help he would have asked in the car again he looked at his watch if he bolted down his sandwich he could get back to the hall in time still to get in a halfday he could just say he was feeling better and didnt want to be home if he wasnt really sick it would be a good example for the troops no he said aloud suddenly he stood up took off his jacket and hung it over the back of his seat to save his place at the pay telephone he called treya at work but a different woman answered at her personal number and this brought a crease to his brow im trying to reach treya glitsky im sorry but shes not in is this lieutenant glitsky yes it is treyas left for the day lieutenant she left a message if you called that you should get home or at least call as fast as you could and that you should be very careful call home thats what she said she left here in a hurry she said shed try and page you he hung up dug in his pocket for some coins as his pager went off and punched in his home number treya its me tell me rachels all right when treya had her voice under this much control she was dangerously angry shes fine but i think youd better come home what is it i guess youd say a threat a threat to rachel what kind of threat just a picture of her a polaroid probably taken yesterday from what rita and she were wearing ritas holding her on the steps somebody circled rachel in red suddenly glitsky understood the urgency of hardys problem as well as frannies panic she too had gotten a recent polaroid of her children the message was unequivocal its meaning clear we know where your children are we can get to them anytime we want back off or they die a fingerprint search is nearly always run first by a computer against a local database of known criminals in this case since thieu had some specific people in mind hed asked faro to hand check the prints theyd lifted from holidays and terrywillss places directly against rez panos and sephia thieu got the results at a little before and figured he could make it back uptown easily even with traffic and get the news to gerson before the lieutenant went home for the day first he wanted to share the news and tell glitsky though so he stopped by the fifth floor only to discover that his old mentor had called in sickastounding certainly thieu had never known him to do it when he was in homicide he had his home phone number however and closing the door behind himno one seemed to be minding the store in glitskys absencehe borrowed the phone on the desk to make the call abe whats the matter you dont sound so good no im fine paul maybe coming down the flu or something thats all whats going on whats going on is i got the results on the fingerprints and you were right hardy was right sephia and rez were all over holidays place and i have them on tape denying ever being there glitsky sounded weary beyond imagining even this terrific news of thieus didnt seem to cheer him in the least thats great paul he sounded as though he were almost bored by it so what are you going to do now lieutenant are you all right i dont know a long pause i may not be in for a few days after all so i assume youll be talking to gerson sure showing him the results its naked eye stuff almost gerson was my next stop im in your office now well you want to do me one last favor sure anything i want you to leave hardy and me completely out of it i cant do that lieutenant you were the ones who had the idea if we get these guys from this evidence people here i mean in the department have got to know it was you glitskys voice suddenly became far more familiar to thieuterse biting brooking no resistance paul i want you to hear me good people have not got to know it was me or hardy for that matter in fact its criticalcritical do you understandthat it look like we had nothing to do with it nothing but no buts if you get this into the system now with gerson youll be the hero and you deserve to be the hero you did all the work i dont care about being the hero abe i dont want to hog your credit forget my credit ive already got way too much profile around this case as it is youve got enough now with this that from here on out its by the numbers with any kind of hustle these guys should be under a lot of heat i dont want them to come back on us so no me no hardy just good police work did these guys in and thats all that did it okay okay thieu didnt like it if it were me though id at least want to remind the people whod accused me make them eat a little crow i dont care about that i really dont im payroll remember a silence then you still dont get it do you no sir im sorry but i dont all right i guessed youve earned the real reason suddenly glitskys tone changed again it became nearly intimate quietly intense theyve threatened my family paul my daughter same with hardy his kids its what youd call a credible threat so i dont want them to think we did this in fact i want them to think we didnt after theyre in prison for life plus a hundred maybe then we can go back and gently remind some people on our side that we might have had something to say but as far as the public needs to know im done hardys done we were done before you even started thinking about fingerprints okay okay just get this to gerson direct dont go through cuneo and russell that was my plan its a good one youve still got time today i see go thieu looked out glitskys one window the sun had just set but he might just get lucky and find gerson still at the job im gone he said behind gersons closed door thieu had been sitting now for over twenty minutes and still couldnt believe he was hearing this the lieutenant had at first been reasonably enthusiastic listening to thieus explanation of how his earlier suspicions at the terrywills scenethe shoe the plethora of convenient evidencecombined with the suspicion of planted evidence at holidays what suspicion of planted evidence have you been talking to glitsky lieutenant glitsky no sir i havent talked to anybody this is just me just you yes sir who got these prints for you that was len faro but he was just dusting he had no idea what it was all about and nobody at all knows about this taped statement not a soul gerson let out a heavy breath all right so where did you hear about this socalled planted evidence thieu fidgeted in his chair remember sir from sadie silvermans statement dan cuneo didnt believe it but i thought nobody believed it sergeant nobody suspected planted evidence at holidays he shook his head in profound displeasure but go on you were saying and he did go on but instead of gersons approval thieu sensed a growing impatience and even anger the point is sir he concluded that in fact these fingerprints from sephia and rez do prove that they were there at holidays and they flatly deny it so they could only have been there to plant the incriminating evidence gerson crossed one leg over the other leaned an elbow back against his computer table im trying to see where you get this sergeant i really am and maybe i am slightly blinded by my anger at the fact that you took it upon yourself to go investigate these cases that id assigned to other inspectors buthe held up a handof course if you did find a smoking gun it would be a different matter more easily overlooked anyway but with respect sir this is pretty much a smoking gun maybe thats what im having trouble seeing you have statements from both sephia and rez that they hadnt been in the terrywills apartment but you dont have their fingerprints from that scene i didnt really expect there would be sir they went there to kill these guys and either wiped the place down or more likely wore gloves but the fact remains no prints where they said theyd never been i fail to understand how this can be compelling to you whats compelling is that their prints were at holidays where they also deny ever being they didnt know i was going to ask that until the tape was already on so they told a stupid lie gerson drew a large and histrionic breath sergeant these men played poker together at least several times in the past year they may have had some kind of falling out recentlyi dont know about thatbut they certainly shared each others company quite possibly at mr holidays house so now they simply admit that they lied to you they say they knew holiday was a murder suspect and didnt want to be more closely associated with him gerson already had the tape in its case under a paperweight on his computer table but sir the bare fact thieu paused you have to admit this looks a lot like something fishy at the very least sephia and rez should be thoroughly interrogated in my opinion he added finally the lieutenant seemed to break through some barrier he leaned back let out a long exhalation you might be right he said i dont know why im righting you so hard on this everything youre saying makes sense its just that this case has been nothing but a headache from day one gersons hand in fact went to his head he sighed again ive got to use the can a minute be right back thieu came forward his elbows on his knees his head tucked he had of course considered the objections that gerson had made nothing was simple okay so whats new the point was thieu thought that any conscientious cop would see enough questions for sephia and rez to at the very least jump all over them and move them up to the realm of legitimate suspects in the multiple slayings if only to avoid the embarrassment and hassle of falsely arresting john holiday when there were obviously so many other possible interpretations of the evidence but until tonight just now gerson had seemed congenitally blind to these subtleties he had a suspect and evidence and an arrest warrant and goddamnit why should he keep looking at all now the lieutenant returned got back in his swivel chair made some kind of conciliatory gesture i apologize for being such a hardass about this paul its actually nice to have an inspector with this kind of initiative it certainly wouldnt hurt to put these two guys in an interrogation room and sweat them on videotape would it if they broke gerson brightened up met thieus eyes but i would be more comfortable either way if we got dan and lincoln on board does that sit all right with you thieu remembered glitskys admonition that he should go directly through gerson without involving the two inspectors of record but the reaction here had rendered that suggestion moot if there was going to be any resolution to this case there was no avoiding cuneo and russell now sure your call sir gerson turned and punched numbers into the phone hey is cuneo or russell out there do you know when they oh really okay thanks he hung up evidently theyre coming in by chopper right now five minutes the police helicopter as well as others belonging to the highway patrol and even private companies such as georgia aaa often landed on the target painted on the roof of the hall of justice i dont think ive been out of this room all day paul you mind if we get some exercise and meet them up there i could use the air sure why not gerson grabbed his jacket from the peg by his door while thieu went to get his off his chair they passed out of the homicide detail and into the hallway where gerson turned right and thieu followed they went into the inspectors bureau unoccupied at that time of the night and pulled a key off a hook in a side room this enabled the elevator to go all the way to the roof they ascended in a companionable silence watch out gerson said as he stepped over a low sill and out its gotten a little dark and indeed it had come to full night with a chill and biting wind thieu had his hands in his pockets and shuddered against the cold with the stiff breeze he wasnt surprised that he couldnt yet hear the thwackthwack of the helicopters approach but he turned a half circle and looked for it anyway the city was all dressed up thanksgiving was still a couple of weeks off but already the christmas lights were burning in several locations some of the hotels uptown taking in the sight thieu wondered why he didnt come up here more often there was a splendid isolation especially at this time of night when the traffic was heavy but mostly unhearable the stars close enough to touch he moved a couple of steps toward the low edge of the roof then started to turn back to ask his lieutenant if he knew from which direction the chopper might be approaching but he hadnt really begun the turn when a pair of strong hands hit him low in the back with his own hands stuck deeply in his pockets he could offer no resistance wait was all he could think to say wait but his feet hit the bottom of the wall almost before he realized he was being pushed and there was nothing to stop his body from pitching over into the air thieus last whole thought in the instant before the falling wiped his consciousness clean of anything but terror was that gerson had made that call to the outer office to check on the whereabouts of cuneo and russell hed talked to someone out there and then less than a minute later theyd left the office to come up here but no one had been in the office when thieu had gone to retrieve his jacket he should have remembered that grown suspicious he should have susan weiss mcguires wife was doing her best to cope with the unexpected crisis but it had thrown her off balance thisthe sudden arrival of her sisterinlaws family at her threebedroom apartment in the haightwas not something she felt equipped for or trained to handle she listened to their talk about fleeing from their house after the darkness had become complete all of them making certain no one was behind them with an air of disbelief was this really happening no one was acting as though the threat to the hardy kids extended to the mcguire family to her own children brittany and erica but even though susan doubted that panos knew that moses and frannie were brother and sister she couldnt get that thought out of her mind a cellist by profession and a true pacifist susan went through the motions of dinner and sleeping bags for the cousins and the foldout couch for dismas and frannie with a wary sleepwalking quality susan knew the degree of protectiveness that moses felt for frannie her husband might be a good man with a pure nature but at heartand it had always troubled herhe was also a fighter the veteran of dozens of bar brawls rugby skirmishes shillelagh altercations moses like her brotherinlaw dismas had seen action in vietnam both of them had actually killed people although she preferred to forget that most of the time here though tonight that was not possible rebecca and vincent wouldnt be going to their school for at least the next day and perhaps several more frannie wasnt going to her classes either after he talked to glitsky tonight dismas would decide if the family needed to go into true hiding they could get on a plane for somewhere or at least check into a hotel out of town now it was way past bedtime and still her girls sat spellbound on the floor caught up in their cousins fear and excitement suddenly through no fault of susans here was her whole family involved in a world of threats and violence of intrigue and terror she couldnt help herself couldnt stop a great wave of resentment from washing over her at her husband for insisting that they all come here at dismas and frannie for agreeing and now dismas had gone off to discuss the situation with glitsky and moses was back at the shamrock susan went to the kitchen where poor frannie was rinsing dishes and piling them in the dishwasher busing a few more dinner items from the table over to the sink susan fell in next to her and shortly found she couldnt sustain any resentment toward her sisterinlaw frannie too moved in a slightly robotic fashion as though the strain of all this was just too great to contemplate and susans heart went out to her frannie finished rinsing a plate then put it back down on top of the others turned off the water and hung her head susan put an arm around her what are you thinking she asked frannie sighed that maybe were going to have to move after all where to it doesnt matter away from here at least for a while i cant imagine ever letting the kids go back to that school or really to the house for that matter susan understood what she was sayingshed of course seen the polaroid that dismas had brought with him in a ziploc bag the two kids were at the gate in front of their house knapsacks on leaving for school frannie behind them a little out of focus whoever shot the picture couldnt have been more than thirty feet away a red circle enclosed both of the childrens torsos smack in the crosshairs it was an image that would live with susan for a long time maybe she said it really is just trying to get dismas to stop working on this case frannie turned the water back on reached for the already rinsed plate hes already called their lawyer but what if its not who he thinks she shuddered i just see the man who took the picture sitting in his car right there susan close enough to touch except next time not with a camera god suddenly the shuddering seemed to gather in on her and her shoulders were shaking she brought her wet hands up to her face and covered it completely susan tightened her arm around her sisterinlaw she could think of nothing to say nat glitskys onebedroom made abes duplex feel like the taj mahal by comparison as the hardys had done abe and treya decided that theyd feel safer for this night at least somewhere other than their homes they too waited until it had gotten dark they too watched for following headlights on the way over making sure there were none now all the adults were in the postagestamp living room while rachel slept next to grandpas bed abe sat hunched over all knees and elbows on the end of the coffee table his face was set and expressionless his eyes dark and forbidding after much discussion with treya and his father hed decided to call the station cops hearing who he was theyd bumped it up to the station captain whod come over from his home and the duty sergeant all right at this point hardy felt hed take any sign of cooperation at least thats some action what did they say glitsky shot him down basically they werent too interested wasnt that your impression trey that might be overselling it she said turning to hardy they couldnt have cared less is more like it and you showed em the picture told em the whole story of course hardy sat forward using only the front two inches of a wooden chair nat had brought in from the kitchen how could they not care whats it going to take its probably a prank treya said bitterly this kind of stuff happens all the time all the time they said that not those exact words they seemed to expect abe to take it that way and were a little uncomfortable that he didnt even after i pointed out to them that i had been a cop for a while myself and really didnt run into something like this every day or even every year whatd they say to that nothing they didnt care enough to argue but more to the point glitsky added what would we like them to do so i told them go rattle some cages we know who it was but let me guess they said theyd do passing calls at the school and your house more than that would need to come from downtown youve been reading his mail treya said nat whod been sitting listening to all this at the end of the couch suddenly piped in what i dont see is how they dont care nothin happened they say i go nothin look at this picture this is a threat on my granddaughters life something like this happened to you what would you do he threw up his hands they look at me like im an old man like i got nothing left up here it wasnt you dad abe said he came back to hardy and it wasnt even that they didnt believe me which was kind of a relief after the past few days it was just hey we can send the picture down to the lab but after that what yeah but my favorite part treya said is the captain starts telling us about dopesellers in the projects who threaten the families there you dont let us do our thing here you get in our way were going to kill you and your kids get it and this teaches us what hardy asked treyas mouth formed a kind of smile though she wasnt amused the actual message got a little lost in the telling i think but we should realize people get threatened all the time abe picked it up and we of all people ought to know that cops cant really prevent crime from happening we can only clean up after it great im thrilled to hear it hardy enthused so in the meanwhile what do weand by we im not talking society in general i mean uswhat do we do i called clarence treya said and the good news there is that i think hes come around to believing you both finally hes really worried about this good for him hardy snapped better late than never whats the bad news same as usual glitsky said whats he supposed to do now what can he do hes not unsympathetic but so what he hopes whoever it is doesnt kill anybody me too hardys fuse was just about burned all the way down and its not some unknown whoever its panos wade glitsky asked or roy or sephia and rez or somebody else on the payroll we dont even know about hardy knew what he was saying he shook his head in frustration finally raised his eyes i called kroll you know told him i was out of the lawsuit it was over whatd you say about holiday nothing and he didnt ask why because im not involved in your lawsuit whatever some people might have thought so if that was it the lawsuit theres no reason to threaten me he took a long breath on the other hand if either of us is still looking to get at the truth behind these murders and this finally gets homicide to rethink holiday whos that leave glitsky nodded thats what theyre warning us off both of us yeah well hes my client what do they think im going to do give him up i think its crossed their minds you might hardys hard stare went around the room i cant do that no one here is asking you to treya said but hes not abes client what does that mean glitsky straightened his back im not trying to clear holiday im letting the law take its course from here on out hardy snorted our friend the law sometimes it might be i talked to paul thieu late this afternoon i apologize with all this madnesshe gestured around himi never told you he went last night as we recommended and found some sephia and rez prints at holidays then he got a statement from them saying theyd never been there son of a bitch hardy pumped a fist i knew it so hes off glitsky temporized maybe if gerson does the right thing its possible but the point is i told paul that no matter what i was out of it no credit no blame no nothing im done if theyve got sephia and rez at johns we both are i repeat glitsky said maybe id hold off on the party until i got the official word id feel better if i heard that these guys were already behind bars in any case even if they pull our guys in they still might be a long way from dropping any charges against holiday id be tempted to keep a low profile if i were you hardy left nats place at he called frannie from there and susan who was still awake told him that his emotionally drained and exhausted wife was asleep on the foldout hardy no less depleted was nonetheless wired and would not be able to sleep even if he had a truckload of valium on board but a black and tan or two might do the trick he told susan he was stopping by to see her husband and might not be home until the bar closed nobody should worry things might be looking up when he got to the shamrock the forty or fifty patrons were kicking into the kind of manic mode hed seen hundreds of times over the years suddenly it was the kind of night that developed out of nowhere when a critical mass of humanity encountered just the right cosmic mix of alcohol noise and sexual possibilities the juke which had been audible down around the corner on tenth where hardy had parked blared out toby keiths wanna talk about me at the absolute limit of its speakers some football loud on the two tvs the four dartboards had games going all the stools were taken at the bar chairs couches floor space packed hardy made his way through the crowd nodding and talking to the many familiar faces a steady line of patter going since he knew most of the patrons at least by sight the shamrock was the oldest bar in the city now going on but it wasnt big side to side the public area from the bar stools to the wall was maybe twelve feet back at the dartboards it widened to eighteen or so he worked his way through the mob to the back of the bar then hung his coat on the rack and ducked under the opening mcguire was tending working hard keeping up with the orders hardy filled a pint glass with ice a squeeze of lime and gunned it full of club soda after he drank half of it off in a gulp he jumped in to help and for most of an hour didnt stop moving it wasnt just a large crowd but a remarkably friendly patient and orderly one they were mostly localsthirsty but not belligerent the jukebox kept cranking out the hits although at one point hardy realized that most of them werent hits anymorethey were oldies but then again he thought so was he pouring his drinks pulling his drafts ringing up the charges shooting the bull in fivesecond sound bites since it was far too busy for conversation he and mcguire worked back into the rhythms theyd perfected back in the days twenty years before when hardy had been the lead man behind the bar before his marriage before kids and his career nowadays and for a long while all the other parts of his life had felt so different from this nowhere was there this simple busyness the pleasure of doing something uncomplicated good and well here if somebody ordered a drink he could be pretty sure that they werent lying to him that was the drink they wanted he gave it to them they paid him he gave them their change maybe they tipped him end of transaction when he looked up surprised to find that he finally had a minute that most of the customers had left he was sweating with the exertion and activity but something had given inside him the tremendous pressure almost as though hed taken a weeks vacation on a warm beach he realized that the ache in his back had at last subsided he could still feel his injured hand when he squeezed it but hed been using it with a natural ease all night he allowed himself to hope for a minute that with paul thieus information his enemies would be thwarted and with them the threats to his family ended mcguire muted the televisions turned the volume down on the jukebox then came down from the other end of the bar he put a heavy hand on hardys shoulder and sincerely thanked him for his work where did that come from he asked meaning the crowd the word must have gotten out that id be here damn celebrity seekers but hardy was grinning first time in a week or so almost directly over his head and behind him paul thieus picture showed up on the television for a minute the late news and mcguire glanced up but he didnt know who thieu was so he never mentioned it not that it would have made any difference theyd made last call a little early shagged out the stragglers locked up by and restocked they counted the money unheard of on a tuesday night moses didnt ask but poured hardy a stiff macallan to match his own and the two of them sat at the dark end of the bar away from the windows kittycorner to each other hardy never needed to sleep again but then again two days ago he was never going to drink alcohol again and here he was the nightlight above the register worked with the reflected streetlights outside to illuminate the place with about the intensity of a full moon while theyd been pulling bottles and rolling kegs hardy had been trying to convey some sense of his guarded optimism to mcguire but now they were able to really talk and his brotherinlaw wasnt buying yeah he said all thats great but what if they dont get to panos and his people soon enough and in the meantime they decide to come after everybody anyway you willing to take that chance i dont know what my other option would be mose i do i know go out and shoot them first youve already told me have another drink you think im kidding hardy took his first sip of the scotch a small one no but youre not thinking you go out after them youre a murderer thats the whole story id argue selfdefense how would you do that nobodys threatening you mcguire grunted im not letting anybody kill frannie diz never no how no way if its any consolation mose im not either but youre not doing anything to stop it hardy put his glass down slowly as a matter of fact ive been doing quite a lot which is why i now have some reason to suspect that this threat is less now than it was even three or four hours ago theyre going to bring these guys in and then theyre going to put them on trial or maybe cop some lesser plea this is multiple murder mose thats special circumstances life without so youre safe right theyll get them all youre sure and they dont have family they dont have people wholl know youre behind it mcguire put his glass down i guess what i dont understand diz is why after youve seen all the ways the law doesnt protect you for squatim talking in the past couple of weeks aloneyou still think its something you can count on maybe because thats the deal we make we dont break the law and in return the law protects us and you believe that you got any poor black friends diz you got any cabrons hardy rolled his eyes here we go here we go is right you ever think about why theres so much more violence in the barrios huh or the projects no mose thats never crossed my mind i never think about anything like that cause im a rich white guy hey you said it hey yourself hardy pointed a ringer in mcguires face it turns out youre arguing my point exactly you know why theres so much violence in the hoods because the people there have lost their faith in the law and you know why that is because it doesnt protect them they feel like theyve got to do it themselves right exactly my fucking point but what im saying is take a look at what you get once you decide thats your position youre taking your protection into your own hands outside the law at least youre alive actually no probably not youve got a much better chance at getting to be dead in fact why cause pablo threatens to kill you if you mess with his dope business you dont want dope around your kids but you cant go to the law so you decide youve got to kill pablo then pablos brother jose who also doesnt think the law is going to punish you comes and shoots your ass so then your brother or father or mother anyway you see where this is going except look at you right now your familys driven out of your house wheres your law there whos protecting you now still the law look mose if panos wasnt worried about somebody doing something about it he would have come for me long ago he could have grabbed the kids or shot them when he took the picture maybe youre forgetting he did shoot some people maybe im not but if i believe that the whole purpose of law is to take violence out of the hands of individuals like you and me and panos for that matter how am i supposed to justify going after him myself as soon as i do that i am so fundamentally like him that theres no moral distinction between us oh no shit he hits you you cant hit him back are you giving me that im saying that if i go outside the law then i cant expect anything from it anymore and im not willing to give that up its pretty basic its pretty bullshit you ask me oh yeah so what happens then after one of the shots you fire at panos or sephia misses them completely but kills the poor old lady eating her cheerios three houses down or the mom pushing her baby half a mile away you dont think that happens you dont think thats the main thing that happens with every fuckedup driveby shooting you ever heard of once these things start theres no controlling what happens next people get killed who had nothing to do with it and then guess what those innocent people want to see the law punish you and theyve got every reason to expect that it will whether or not you started the whole thing once youre in it youre the bad guy period moses tipped up his glass rattled the ice a little tipped it up again if i knew for a fact who took that picture id get real close and put a slug in the fuckers brain id do it tonight swear to god and then your life from then on is never the same i wouldnt tell anybody and nobody would know my connection to you and frannie the cops would never even think to talk to me except if they did and then what about susan and your girls mcguire was shaking his head not going to happen listen diz you got gangbangers killing each other all the time youre telling me the cops even look real hard so you get a known dirtball like say sephia who dies violently and whos going to get all worked up over it nobody probably not even his family if hes got one hardy acknowledged that truth with half a nod i wouldnt exactly weep and gnash my teeth myself see but theres a difference between someone being dead and you making someone be dead thats what you keep saying but you and i have both pulled a trigger diz killed people we didnt even hate we both know we could do it again if we had to my question is how far do they have to push you before you do something on your own pretty far id guess where it turned into real selfdefense which is pretty much after the fact isnt it yep i think it has to be and youre okay with that you can live with it his brotherinlaws face was etched in concern that showed as though magnified by the dim light no let me put it another way he said i hope you can live with that i hope your family can i really do hardy drained his own glass me too mose me too hardy was still dressedjeans and a pulloversitting on a twoperson love seat in the back of the apartment in the old laundry room that susan had converted into a studio for her music students it was quiet here away from the beds and he didnt want his own restlessness to keep anyone else up a single large northfacing window revealed a smattering of lights stretching out toward the presidio he was up six storiesbut the view so lovely in the light didnt captivate he stared out more through it than at it aware but unthinking or at least not thinking discrete thoughts since hed gotten into bed then given up and come in here his mind had returned again and again unbidden to david freeman visions of him in his bed in the icu the damage theyd done to him even should he survive it a result about which hardy had little confidence a cold premonition had entered his gut along with the renewed conviction that these were very dangerous men now perhaps made more desperate by their inability to isolate and destroy john holiday and without him hardy believed they were surely eventually doomed they had to get to him any way they could as quickly as they could and no mistake about it hardy believed that the surest route to holiday was through him another nonthought a bother a twinge like a pestering insect alighting again and again on the surface of his consciousness was that he should in fact disengage himself from holiday at least until things shook out here somewhat call kroll and get that message delivered as moses had argued he should save his family above all else and he could do it without going outside the law hed never even taken a retainer from holiday there was no legal issue after all he told himself holiday would probably be okay without him now the evidence would set him free hardy didnt need to stay involved the rationalizations gnawed dad he started as though from a doze but he hadnt been sleeping hey beck are you all right sure having some trouble sleeping thats all hows my little girl sixteen years old five foot five pounds his little girl i know you hate it she said but im scared oh babe he looked up and caught the shining streak of a tear on her cheek come here he shifted to one side patted the cushion next to him have a seat next to your old man he longed to tell her that there was nothing to be scared ofthe perhaps comforting lie was almost out of his mouthbut he couldnt make himself say it she was too old for that now shed feel patronized and he didnt want that in a moment her feet tucked under her she was curled up against him under his armall flannel and bathrobe long hair and a slightly stale breath that he loved at first this seemed to be all she needed and he absently stroked her hair as he had done since shed been a baby he felt her weight settle almost imperceptibly and she exhaled a shallow sigh quietly but audibly you okay he asked a little better a little but still scared he felt her head move up and down well he couldnt resist the impulse to comfort her maybe its really not as bad as we thought originally but those pictures daddy i know i know what they were trying to do there and thats what makes us afraid and it worked didnt it but i went and saw uncle abe tonight and i really think theres a good chance now that the police will be able to to do something like what like maybe arrest these people some new stuffs come up theyre going to have to act on it and when they do well get back to normal but what if they dont hardy sighed they probably will beck you dont have to worry about that and thats why you cant sleep either because youre not worried anymore hardy tightened his arm around her sometimes she was too perceptive he thought for her own good im still a little worried he conceded the beck squirmed out and sat up facing him its just that i dont understand these people even if they wanted to hurt you why would they want to hurt your family because they know that nothing really would hurt me more okay but then what do they think that youll just go away i mean the logical thing is that youll just get crazier and come after their families doesnt that make sense hardy again didnt feel that he could be completely forthright i wouldnt do that i couldnt do that that wouldnt be right why not if they came after us i bet you would i know you would well luckily they havent done anything physical to you or vince yet so we dont get to find out i dont really want to find out im plenty mad at them for what theyve already done this time he couldnt stop himself from lying but i really think this is pretty much over beck tomorrow night at this time were back in our own beds youll see but what if were not then the night after she frowned now youre just trying to make me feel better not just now he said all the time but i need to know whats really happening whats really happening he drew a deep breath came out with a deeper truth i dont know for sure whats really happening beck i dont want you to have to go through this but im already in it daddy were here i know he gathered her back against him i know the city lights blinked in the windblown dust outside hardy tightened his arm around his girl i dont think ive been much of a help tonight have i im still a little scared if thats what you mean hardy sighed thats what i mean you cant protect me against my feelings daddy i know hardy said and that just breaks my heart he wondered anew whether he could protect her from anything at all and a fresh wave of anger swept over him all the words in the world to the contrary he suddenly knew he would kill without mercy if anyone harmed his girl and maybe it wouldnt hurt her to have some intimation of that in spite of what hed just told her to the contrary you know how i said i wouldnt do anything if something happened to you yes well if i could stop it before it could get to you if it got to that he didnt finish im speaking hypothetically now beck but theres absolutely no way id let anybody hurt you her tentative question nearly brought him to tears so what are we going to do im not completely sure yet hon but your mother and i were going to take care of you no matter what maybe he said if i can get myself to abandon john holiday but you cant do that hes your friend right out of the mouths of babes hardy thought i know but maybe i can make them think i stopped he stopped himself again he was about to say then set some kind of trap for them but look he did say lets believe for a minute theres a really pretty decent chance that in a day or two theyll have these people in jail and then they wont be after us no he chucked her gently under her chin but theyre probably already not after you now not really she looked up at him hopefully promise hardy hesitated they had a rule about a promise being a promise sacred and unbreakable i really dont think so he finally said he felt a small shudder pass through her thats not a promise no i know he said but close hardy pushed open the street level door to the freeman building he crossed the foyer and got to the top of the staircase then stood still a moment where it opened into the reception lobby for the first time since the attack on david he felt some sense of life here again a half dozen people in the solarium appeared to be taking depositions three of the associates and a couple of paralegals stood by the coffee machine deep in conversation the steady whine of the copying machines filled in the background noise maybe hed just happened upon a flurry but the telephones kept phylliss head down and hands busy mr hardy dismas suddenly norma appeared at his elbow we missed you yesterday is everything all right he didnt know the answer to that certainly everything didnt feel all right his family was still in hiding at mcguires he was going on less than four hours sleep freeman was still unconscious he hadnt heard that sephia and panos had been arrested i mean you never came in she said some of us were worried i had some work out of the office he said it hung me up all day smiling politely he pointed across the lobby to the other set of stairs that led to his office i dont even want to look at the clutter on my desk but id better get on up there of course but i i wanted to thank you for what for your inspiration the other night she gestured vaguely around the lobby the steady hum of industry well in truth after hardy had finished his little speech on friday night the solarium hadnt exactly exploded into wild applause hed told everybody good night and gotten out of there as quickly as he could slightly embarrassed that hed gotten caught up in the moment and exposed himself so openly as basically uncool he felt sure that hed given some of the younger people especially but also a few of the more cynical associates and paralegals fuel for the fires of ridicule he could easily imagine the snickering after he left all in all he wished he hadnt done it at all or failing that that hed thought of something light and gotten everybody laughing but now norma had her hand on his arm you shouldnt be modest look what that did for everybody here hardy couldnt deny that the buzz was better but i dont really think that was me well be that as it may norma said everybody else does and i just wanted to thank you again to tell you how much it meant to me and to the firm it was the perfect note you can see the results for yourself look around hardy had already seen enough and it did gratify him with david in the hospital though and so many other problems hanging fire he wasnt quite ready to do cartwheels still he gave the lobby a last glance well he said im glad i could help and nowhe pointed againthe grind awaits he crossed over to the reception area looked a question at phyllis who held up a finger asking him to wait after an impressive trifecta of freeman and associates would you please hold got the switchboard under control she looked up and actually smiled as though she were happy to see him new ground lieutenant glitsky has already called three times this morning he says its urgent glitsky had found out about thieu when he opened the morning paper and read about his apparent suicide it didnt much convince him or rather it finally did convince him of what hed begun strongly to suspect he decided on the spot that he wasnt going into his office again today a sworn policeman with a clear duty he was going to do some real police work at last on his own if need be hardy had already talked to holiday continuing in his counsel that the client should stay out of sight dont worry theyd found strong evidence that might clear him before too long he should just remain patient by the time gina roake called hardy was on the other line with his second judge of the morning oscar thomasino the first one this weeks magistrate timothy hill had shot him down about quashing holidays arrest warrant almost before hardy got the question out surrender your client diz then we litigate thats the process and you know it and thomasino whod known and respected hardy for many years told him he didnt see what he could do hed be happy to put in a good word to jackman or batiste on hardys basic trustworthiness even glitskys but didnt think it would serve much purpose when he finally got back to gina at her office filling him in about her talk with hector blanca specifically about the helicopter to nevada she was in a clear and quiet rage the general work inspector had told her that hed really like to help but that the consensus among his superiors and he tended to agree was that the supposed attack on hardy and john holiday never took place at all as to david freeman blanca had just checked with the hospital this morning and he was very very sorrymaybe ms roake hadnt heardbut freeman seemed to be going into renal failure his kidneys hadnt produced more than a teaspoon of urine overnight blanca liked roake right away and was possibly more straightforward than he would have been with someone else very probably he told her this would soon be a murder case and hence outside of blancas jurisdiction but by all means gina should bring her suspicions to homicide hardy took her phone call as an opportunity to bring her up to date and she heard him out shed really been unaware of the escalations the threats to the families the probable murder of paul thieu it seemed to galvanize her somehow and when she heard that glitsky would be at hardys office to discuss possibilities she told him she was coming too something had to be done and she wanted to be in on whatever it was hardy told her to come right on up so at a little before noon on a blustery and overcast wednesday morning glitsky roake and hardy had all gathered and now they sat in varying degrees of unease around the coffee table in hardys office hardy had put on a pot and two of them were drinking coffee glitsky of course had his tea facing hardys office door he was explaining that after he read about thieu this morning he had finally been driven to speak to special agent bill schuyler of the fbi who had expressed interest in abes theory but who said it would take at least a couple of days to arrange any kind of task force and thats if he could get his field directors approval was glitsky really saying he believed the head of homicide was involved in coverup and murder this could be a lot of fun schuyler agreed but it was going to take a degree of manpower and some time which is something we dont have isnt that a little dramatic diz roake asked we get the fbi involved in a week or so theres plenty of but hardy was shaking his head if they do anything it will take years wiretaps following people background investigations maybe trying to infiltrate the gang by then all of our physical evidence has disappeared thats if they do anything at all and meanwhile were dead besides which glitsky added these people have just killed paul thieu allegedly roakes kneejerk reaction no really glitskys dark scowl ended that debate and theres every reason to think theyre at this moment planning the same thing for diz or me or our families diz is right gina its not overdramatic drama happens theres no time so what do you propose to do roake asked glitsky sat quietly looked down at his feet said in an uncharacteristic almost inaudible voice i was hoping im going to go down and make some arrests myself hardy stared looking for a sign that glitsky was being ironic he saw none which made his friends message clear and unambiguous at least to hardy and it shocked him first moses now abe glitsky raised his eyes to hardy then roake continued with the charade maybe park em in san mateo county overnight get some judge to listen this hardy knew would never happen no judge would ever listen under those circumstances as no judge had given hardy the time of day this morning this wasnt what judges did and he glitsky and roake all knew it but it didnt make any difference glitsky was simply padding the pretense but hardy didnt get to call him on it at that moment there was a quick knock the door to hardys office opened and john holiday introduced his lanky figure to the proceedings howdy yall he said a genial grin in place he wore a heavy sheepskin coat that reached midway down his thighs hed tucked his longish blond hair into an australian shepherds hat one side of the brim tacked against the crown smiling all around with the obvious surprise hed pulled off he turned to close the door behind him by the time he turned back around to face them again glitsky had stood up and now hardy did the same saying john what in the hell are you doing here glitsky a baleful glance at hardy took a step forward he had no choice he was a cop and here was a man wanted for murder im afraid youre under arrest he said for holiday the surprise element suddenly and completely lost its charm he glared with startled incomprehension at glitsky for a beat shot a look at hardy then with no hesitation half turned again as though he were going back to the door but when he came back around he was holding a gun in his right hand it was pointed down at the floor but nobody in the room missed it or its import i dont think anybodys gettin arrested just right now he said the quiet tone and soft tennessee accent taking nothing away from his resolve now lieutenant you just sit down would you i wont ask for your gun because im gonna assume youll act like a gentleman but please keep your hands out where i can see them then we can have a civil discussion all four of us glitsky found his chair and took it hardy remained standing folded his arms over his chest jesus john what are you doing howd you get here holiday made no effort to put up the gun my lady dropped me by the alley in the back i came in through the garage and up the elevator dont worry nobody followed me im sure thats not what i was worried about havent you ever heard that when youve already dug yourself into a hole you ought to stop digging glitsky concurred this is a big mistake holiday was all agreement i can see that now lieutenant youre probably right but i didnt know anybody else was going to be here why dont you put away the gun though roake asked then to hardy this is your client i presume hardy made the introductions and holiday bowed in a courtly fashion although without ever taking his eyes from glitsky so why did you come here hardy asked again tell you the truth diz part of it was cabin fever mostly though i was thinking you and i might come up with a way to turn me in and guarantee my safety that thing with your kids the words petered out anyway i figure if panos thinks they got me that ends am i right hardy shrugged maybe not all wrong but the kid thing you know abes got the same problem holiday looked across the room at glitsky have i got to keep this gun out lieutenant or could we come to an understanding for the time being as far as im concerned youre still under arrest when i leave here youre coming with me i dont think so glitsky almost laughed you going to shoot to stop me so you can do whatever you want with the gun its not helping your case as im sure your lawyer will agree he shot a glance over to hardy an invitation to back him up but hardy had gone bolt upright in his chair his eyes glazed and faraway roake across from him spoke up diz are you all right he came back with them what yeah sure john put the damn gun away would you the rule is you dont wave one around if youre not prepared to use it what if i am then youre a bigger idiot than even i think you are which is hard to imagine nobody here thinks you killed anybody okay youre not about to start now he didnt wait to give holiday a chance to respond but turned directly to the other two abe and gina check me on something would you were assuming that gerson pushed thieu off the roof right out of the corner of his eye he saw holiday moving sticking the gun back under his belt the question is why why right then glitsky had clearly given this a great deal of thought because thieu put sephia and rez at holidays when they denied theyd ever been there and johnhardy turnedhave they ever to your knowledge been to your place are you kidding ill take that as a no thats what i thought so he came back to the others doesnt this mean that gerson must have thought thieu was the only person with this information otherwise why kill him if somebody else is going to show up tomorrow and confront him with the same problem except by now gerson has probably destroyed the tape glitsky said maybe not roake said especially if he figures nobody else knew about it hardy nodded at glitsky assume abe that gerson doesnt know that you know im sure he doesnt i specifically asked paul to keep you and me out of it and if anybody in the world was capable of that it was him well there you go he held up his hands as though hed proven something where though glitsky asked call me slow but i dont see where youre going okay slow what exactly did paul tell you glitsky wasnt sure where this was going but hardy seemed to have an idea and at this point anything was worth pursuing just that hed lifted sephias and rezs prints from holidays house he had this tape he was going down to play it for gerson he lifted and dropped his shoulders thats about it hardy looked across the room gina you see it she nodded back at glitsky abe now you can go to a judge and do an affidavit which ought to be probable cause to search gersons office maybe even his home for the tape odds are theyll even have a copy of thieus original fingerprint request and the results with the tape showing gerson knew its significance roake had come forward to the edge of the couch so youre saying abe should get a warrant for gersons house and office without telling anyone else in the pd thats the general idea yeah weve finally got some probable cause and heres our chance to use it glitsky didnt buy it impossible he said even if gerson hasnt already gotten rid of the tape and every one of those reportswhich i know if i were him i would haveif we do find them we have no real proof of anything and my career would be completely over it seems to me like our only chance youve got to get something on gerson and squeeze him glitsky was all concentration dont get me wrong i love the idea but it doesnt go anywhere he looked up at hardy and at best it still leaves panos wholl then know wethats you and me dizwe havent backed off he shook his head im not sure i want to dare him to see how far hell go holiday whod been listening all this while suddenly butted in quietly how about this instead you call this gerson and tell him youve got me what do you mean got you glitsky asked in custody you want to turn me over to him but diz here my whizzo lawyer doesnt trust the normal procedure he wont give me up to anybody but you lieutenant gerson would believe that and how does that help us john or help you hardy asked im not exactly sure about the nuts and bolts but if gerson knows that you lieutenant are going to be some place at some time with me youd get ambushed hardy said no way is that happening but glitsky liked it if we could in fact get them all together on some pretext roake went with it the fact that theyre all there together is probable cause right there abe and you arrest the lot of em glitsky holiday and hardy just looked at her after a moment she turned pale then crimson then added in a flat tone there would have to be backup im talking police of course glitsky went on as if she hadnt spoken so i call gerson and tell him where and when and that its just me and you diz and your client turning himself in to me and that after i have john in custody i will personally take him downtown for booking i also tell him its imperative that no one else including him is there to blow the deal especially not him but hes going to think the three of us are out wherever it is all alone okay hardy said then what then we fieldtest our theory which all along has been that this ends when holiday is dead dont sugarcoat it holiday said glitsky ignored him the point is if gerson does show up i know there could only be one reason roake was shaking her head its no good abe youd be absolutely exposed no way would gerson come alone glitsky nodded thats probably right and that would remove any doubt about his guilt and conspiracy wouldnt it not that i have any but that would be rocksolid proof no question proof is good hardy agreed except when it leaves you outnumbered four or five to one any trace of the rest of them glitsky said and i call for backup sure you will hardy thought to himself glitsky went on then i go to batiste and let him know what happened and then they have to listen hardy got up and walked over the window he turned back around no way abe this cant happen youre talking suicide well if they succeed in killing me which i strongly doubt theres three witnesses in this room can swear to what happened be that as it may abe i wont allow it glitskys mouth turned up a fraction of an inch i know it runs counter to your worldview diz but youve got nothing to say about it this is my job so get your backup there and in place first on what pretext im the payroll lieutenant remember besides then it would just leak and scare everybody off now glitsky stood up full of resolve this is a good plan people it might be the only one before they can hit us again and that i cant let them do he was over behind hardys desk reaching for the phone punching the numbers the three others watched in a kind of helpless mute panic as glitskys few words put things into irrevocable motion lieutenant gerson please lieutenant abe glitsky here yeah i heard i know its awful about paul but thats not what im calling about john holiday and i told them they should go to you but as you may know his lawyers a friend of mine and in under five minutes they had it all arranged holiday and hardy glitsky said would be showing up to surrender at four oclock at pier a mostly abandoned and completely deserted dock of dilapidated boathouses and razed ancient warehouses glitsky didnt know why theyd picked such a godforsaken place but because then theres no way gerson can argue that he just happened to be in the neighborhood so how about if john and i really do show up with you glitsky looked straightfaced from one of them to the other over to roake i hope i havent given you the impression thats an option because its not now wait a minute holiday stood up glitsky raised his voice against any interruption so im just running down the hall to the bathroom for a minute maybe less diz your client is your responsibility i expect you as an officer of the court to keep my prisoner here under your watch until i get back i need your word on it hardy solemnly raised his right hand youve got it all right then and glitsky was gone roake glitsky and hardy were standing downstairs in the lobby upstairs in hardys office glitsky had put on a perfectly convincing display of anger and disappointment when he returned from the bathroom to find that holiday had escaped both roake and hardy swore hed pulled his weapon on them again theyd been helpless to stop him now hardy noticed phyllis as she stood up behind her switchboard she caught his eye as she came around her partition and motioned with her head toward normas office where she stopped and stood expectantly in the doorway hardy reached out for ginas arm and turned her guiding her that way as well glitsky followed they all were there crowding behind phyllis in time to see norma put down the receiver and hang her head her shoulders collapsing around her when she finally looked up tears streaked her cheeks wordless she nodded at the assemblage in her doorway it seemed the limit of all the acknowledgment she was capable of phyllis next to hardy put her hand over her mouth and began to sob after leaving hardys office glitsky returned to ws empty home he was tempted to stop by nats to see his father and his daughter but in the end decided that this would serve no purpose he kept trying to convince himself that today was in a fundamental way no different than any other the situation was personal and extreme true but basically it wasnt too far removed from the work done by most cops every daysometimes you had to put yourself in the line of fire it came with the territory he still wasnt clear in his mind about how the logistics would play out but this uncertainty again was if not exactly comforting at least familiar enough he remembered earlier in his career making busts in places where he had little or no knowledge of what hed be facing after he hit the doorway most often at or before the very first light of dawn would there be three small terrified children and their mother huddled in a corner a wired junkie who might decide on the spur of the moment to take a nearby and convenient hostage a pit bull with a bad attitude a dark room with a desperate gunman in each corner or maybe just a sleepy and strungout loser whod just as soon wake up tomorrow in jail anyway where it was cleaner warmer and they had better food so hed done this kind of thing before many times you knew the basic rules you tried to keep your options open stay flexible and be prepared you wore your vest for sure you had enough ammunition and at least a couple of loaded guns so you didnt have to reload at an inopportune moment his experience had taught him that ejecting a spent clip and slamming in a new one wasnt as easy in the heat of the moment as it might appear on television even when hed been younger his hands tended to shake in moments of stress and danger they still did he could more easily imagine himself fumbling and dropping his reload to the ground at the worst possible moment than otherwise so he took out two guns from the safe in his bedroom his everyday weapon was a glock mm automatic and it was a fine gun easy to carry and to handle but in this case he reached for his matching colt revolvers with custom rubber grips the damn things bucked like horses with the kind of heavy load hed be using ammunition special handloaded hot rounds hollowpoint bullets but if things developed the way he thought they might he wanted a bullet that could spin a man around twice and bring him down if it nicked him on the pinky a hit in any large muscle and the slug would flatten and pretty much take the fight out of its target guaranteed a body hit was a death sentence sitting on his bed glitsky slid the bullets into the cylinder on the first gun snapped it closed did the same with the second twelve shots less than hed get with two automatics but less chance of a jam or a misfire speed loaders for quick reloads people disagreed with him but hed take a revolver every time taking off his shirt he went to his closet and pulled his vest off the nail where it had hung undisturbed for probably ten years he realized suddenly with a pang of regret that if hed continued wearing the darned thing to work as a matter of course his last eighteen months of medical madness and recovery might have been avoided he might have only had a bruised rib for a couple of days a blackandblue stomach instead of ivs and antibiotics tubes and monitors to say nothing of the pain the guilt the selfdoubt he shook himself to clear those thoughts no point in whipping himself further on that score it was what he had donegone into a potentially violent situation unprepared he would not do the same thing again with his regular shirt back on and buttoned over the vest he checked himself in the closet door mirror with a jacket on no one would be able to tell since he wore a shoulder holster every day it felt natural under his left arm even with the slightly unwieldy bulge of the rig he used for the revolver he hadnt worn a belt holster though since hed been on a beat and he was slightly surprised at how comfortable it felt high on his right hip it had been unusually cold even for november in the city and it would probably be worse on the pier jutting out into the bay so he forsook his standard leather flight jacket in favor of his old dark blue goosedown ski parka snapping the lower buttons he pulled the hem down and checked the mirror again to make sure that it covered his hip weapon glitsky almost never looked at himself when hed come to college as a kind of private joke to himself he started telling people that he got the scar through his lips in a knife fight with some gang kids in high school in reality it had been a prosaic accident on parallel bars when he was in junior high but whatever had caused it the scar itself didnt heal perfectly and came to be something he tended to avoid looking at the same thing with the blue eyes in his dark face they made him uncomfortable was he in fact black like his mom or a nice jewish boy like his dad as a young man all the superficial stuff was too confusing to him and in the end he realized meaningless he was who he was inside and so was everybody else now though he stood an extra moment before the mirror trying to glean in the image there some hint of his essence as he was today why was he doing this he had an incredible wife and a new daughter and everything to live for had it really gotten to the point where he had no other choice werent there other cops he knew friends and allies over the years to whom he could turn or at least from whom he could request backup what was he hoping to accomplish but then he ran down the numberschief rigby no deputy chief batiste no jackman no lanier impossible the fbi no time paul thieu dead what was he going to do next go to the mayor any man on the force who joined with him now risked his career at the very least beyond that glitsky had always been a loner on the job a solo inspector for his entire career and then as lieutenant mostly a bythebook justice freak hed always believed that although people might not like him he was at least respected recent events called even that minimal standard into question now he couldnt afford to care about that public opinion he only had to answer to his family these threats to them could not be allowed to stand if he could not enlist help among those whose job it was to provide it then it was up to him and him alone if need be he glanced one last time at the middleaged man in the mirror knocking three times on the kevlar over his heart he drew a deep breath then let it out heavily okay he said hed chosen pier quickly and intuitively out of several possibilities that had occurred to him as hed spoken to gerson the more obvious spot might have been the outer edges of the parking lots at candlestick point where there would be no opportunity for his enemies to ambush him and where frankly if it came to a gunfight there would be less chance of bystanders becoming victims but to his mind more than equally balancing out the ambush question was the parking areas total lack of cover for himself if gerson came out with enough friends to surround him glitsky didnt want to be standing alone in the middle of a concrete field where gerson could see holiday was in fact not with him where even a mediocre shot with a rifle could take him down from outside the county by chance glitsky along with most of the workers at the hall of justice had come to know pier very well about three years ago when it had been the major crime and finale scene in a movie one of the bigshot hollywood directors was always shooting somewhere in town for about three months the tinseltown crew had worked out of the hall of justice and everybody had become starstruck to some degree one of abes inspectors billy marcusik even got tapped for a credited speaking role in the eventually awful film playing essentially himself after shooting wrapped billy quit the force and moved to la but so far he hadnt been in any more movies that abe had seen in any event in the glory days just about every cop and clerk and even a few judges in the hall thought they might turn out to be the next big thing if they hung around the director enough if nothing else they might get five seconds with one of the stars for a week or more near the end of shooting hordes of city workers would descend upon pier either in hopes of working as an extra or to watch the fools who entertained those hopes now not much after one oclock glitsky pulled over and parked hed told gerson hed be there at but it would be bad luck to be late he wanted to be absolutely sure he was the first man here he wanted to walk over every inch of the area he stopped on an unnamed industrial street of lowrise warehouses and garages a few blocks west of a dent in the bays shoreline called the central basin an abandoned railroad line ran down the middle of the road when theyd been shooting the movie out on pier this street had been the glamorous albeit slightly funky production basetrailers for the stars incredible catered spreads of food for everyone with a pass lights and gurneys and hundreds of people now glitsky sat behind the wheel for a short while letting his senses take it in warn him of anything that resembled trouble there was nothing but the empty street a gust off the bay skipped some heavy dust off the cars hood some newspapers and candy wrappers fluttered in the recessed doorway of an empty storefront across from him another car was parked at the end of the block but glitsky had already driven by it once and it appeared empty he got out and walked to the corner looked out toward the bay on his right pier was the last of a series of six or seven piers jutting north into the water in front of them was a relatively large open expanse of cementreminiscent in some ways of candlestick pointalthough in this case there were few if any individual parking spaces the area had once been used for loading and unloading and container storage but for the past ten years or so the piers on this stretch of the bay had been allowed to fall into disrepair hands in his pockets head down against the dusty wind glitsky crossed the shortest distance to the squat yellowish building that marked the entrance to the first pier the next three piers were similarly constructeda large warehousestyle building out of which protruded the actual pier and boat loading area behind it everything was deserted pier itself was nearly a quarter of a mile long a little over sixty feet wide it was the farthest east of the halfdozen sister piers although there were a few open areas leading down to docks at the water level most of the piers entire eastern exposure along the bay had been built up into various onestory structures many of them open to the elements some of them railroad cars to service its trade this left a relatively broad asphalt roadway on glitskys left as he walked out along the pier his shoulder weapon drawn now and held in his hand mostly concealed in his jacket pocket he looked into the various doorways and openings there was no mystery in why the famous director had chosen this spot for his finalewith its ramshackle low or openroofed wooden buildings facing a wide thoroughfare posing as main street the pier resembled nothing so much as an old west movie set false fronts and all but glitsky wasnt in much of an aesthetic frame of mind to appreciate the art of it all when he reached the end of the pier water on three sides and no escape he realized where he had to set himselfback where hed begun maybe a few structures in let whoever was coming next get in behind him and cut themselves off with no escape except past him he made it back in half the time hed taken going out but it still seemed to be one of the longest walks of his entire life doorway to doorway one at a time his gun in hand eyes always on the head of the pier the open expanse in front of it nothing and no one he was a hunter now not a cop cops didnt draw weapons without suspects or specific situations at hand they didnt conceal the weapon if drawn they called for backup if even the remote chance of gunplay loomed a gull landed on a post across the way studied him for a moment then flew off with a series of derisive squawks somehow rattled by this natural display glitsky turned quickly now impatient to find a suitable place to wait he found it in a low barnlike structure maybe sixty feet from the front of the pier it had no front door and was also open in the back but halfheight partitions within created several eightbyfourfoot spaces that might have served as horse or cattle stalls he had looked cursorily into the place on his way out and had concluded that because there was light from the front and back openings and they were only four feet high the partitions would be inadequate for hiding he hadnt even looked behind them when he passed now for the same reasons suddenly they looked good to him he put his gun back in his holster at the back opening he scanned along the waterline then turned and came back to the front another gull or maybe the same one had landed on the nearest post and now was squawking continually glitsky looked around in the barn and found a large rusty hinge of some kind which he chucked at the bird it missed and splashed into the water below with a noise that sounded to glitskys ears loud as a depth charge the bird didnt so much as shift its feet and kept on squawking he pushed back the sleeve of his jacket and checked his watch it was ten minutes until two the wind whistled through the cracks in the structures around him not a streak of blue showed in the dungray sky overhead somewhere in the white noise of the background he thought he heard a chunk like a car door closing he looked at his watch again it was the same time as before his hands he realized were damp with sweat on the cement nomansland a body appeared a man alone walking once glitsky was sure he came back into view and stood in the barns doorway where he could be seen surprises among armed men could turn unlucky very quickly and he had no intention to be part of one he found that he was unprepared for the wave of relief he felt at john holidays appearance here he hadnt let himself consciously acknowledge that some part of him had half expected reinforcements of some kind to show up in any case he was glad of it glitsky motioned him to move it forward holiday broke into a trot and in a moment they were together back in the shadows of the barn but able to look out wheres hardy glitsky asked i dont know i thought he might be with you no then you came down here by yourself what for ive asked myself the same question he shrugged you told gerson you were going to turn me in i thought it would play better if you actually had me here maybe give you fellows something to talk about for the first minute or so he might not come at all glitsky said and if he doesnt youll have to take me in i know weve already done that once today holiday pulled at his mustache maybe to keep from breaking a smile well lieutenant whatever way it works out if it comes to a fight i figure its mine as much as anybodys i belong in it these boys dont play fair glitsky looked him up and down the heavy sheepskin jacket to midthigh are you still packing john this time holiday did break a smile i dont know why you want to go and ruin a perfectly fine afternoon asking a question like that no i am not my lawyer advised me that it was against the law and my appearance here today points to my good faith id be offended if you asked to search me glitsky allowed an amused grunt sounds like youve been talking to diz all right did you see anybody when you were coming in here if not i thought wed wait behind these partitions and let people get by us if anybody comes how does that sound thats your call im just here to help with the fuckin glitsky frowned at the profanity gazed out again at the nomansland if its gerson alone i want to let him walk past come out behind him alone you wait back in here and listen up if we both come back to pick you up and take you downtown ill pat you down and it would be smart if you didnt get yourself armed between now and then a cold smile do you understand me if you try to escape say out the back opening there youve got an excellent chance of getting shot is that clear enough its clearer than why hardy thinks youre a sweet guy glitsky nodded hes notorious for being a bad judge of character suddenly he narrowed his eyes twisted his head slightly did you hear that gerson eyed the length of the pier he squinted out along the asphalt roadway through the midday overcast the last structures way out there were blurry and indistinct the actual end of the pier seemed to fade into the graygreen water of the bay he hadnt slept at all last night the business with pushing thieu off the roof so suddenly conceived and hurriedly executed might have been a mistake not so much that he would ever be suspected of the actual murder that had been clean enough but the real problem was that now and forever any thought of getting out from under panos was completely impossible because naturally wade knew about thieu wade always knew hed called as soon as hed heard said hed figured it out and appreciated the consideration would not forget who his friends were the death of the woman in jail had locked him in with wade too of course but that hadnt been gerson personally it had been someone in the sheriffs department and all gerson had to do was ignore it but thieu was different not that gerson had ever liked the selfrighteous brilliant little shit but when he saw the nooses tightening around nicks and julios necks he should have tried some other tack firstoffered thieu money maybe a raise or a job at the diamond center big money for mostly doing nothing gradually get thieu involved in the racket at least gerson might have talked to wade and gotten a sense of things but instead hed panicked and now here he was at pier lieutenant gerson turned around hed only come up the pier about seventy feet and somehow glitsky was already here had already gotten in behind him lieutenant gerson echoed he stepped toward him i thought i asked you not to come out here that i was bringing holiday in the smile faded i dont see him though do i and you might not now if he sees you first hes going to see me anyway downtown half turning to look around behind him glitsky intended the movement as cover while he reached in to get at the weapon in his shoulder holster he was going to place this son of a bitch under arrest and let the chips fall but a movement out in the nomansland completely got his attention first two men were doubletiming toward the foot of the pier while a third was already down on one knee arm extended a glint of metal someone was aiming a gun at him glitsky jerked his gun from the holster and dove hard to his left just before he heard the noise of the two shots formal firearms training stresses the advisability of twoshot volleys and glitsky was still rolling as another two shots much closergersonexploded behind him still exposed on all sides he lay flat on his stomach his gun extended in a twohanded grip gerson still perhaps thirty feet awaythe outer limit of accuracy for a pistol shothad turned sideways and was now advancing presenting very little target but glitsky took aim at his torso and squeezed off two quick rounds then rolled again as the return fire pinged around him he found himself wedged into a corner where a building jutted a foot farther out than its neighbor this sheltered him slightly from gerson but left him wide open from the foot of the pier where he now clearly saw sephia rez and roy panos drawing down on him theyd come onto the pier itself he couldnt forget gerson approaching now under the same cover glitsky was using from his right but he had to get off a shot at the trio on his left or he was surely dead he got on his feet just as other shotsa volley really exploded and a bullet smacked the stucco six inches from his head reaching around the corner of the building he took another wild shot at gerson then whirled in time to see that part of the volley hed heard must have come from john holiday in the barn the thugs had been coming at glitsky three abreast almost casually now that they had him cornered but now suddenly roy panos was down on the ground rolling back and forth screaming that hed been hit sephia and rez had scattered pressed up against the covering building facades at the unexpected fire theyd just got their vests on when they heard the first shots from back on the street and now mcguires pickup flew in a spray of gravel across the nomansland and skidded to a stop at the mouth of pier hardy was out before theyd stopped moving the situation clear to him at a glance this was already a heated firelight the smell of cordite acrid in the breeze one man was already down with glitsky pinned out in the goddamned middle of nowhere sephia and rez were in a couple of adjacent recessed doorways and somebody else hardy didnt recognize him by sightwas beyond glitsky along the wall of a warehouse sephia and rez looked his way and without hesitation opened fire a shot ricocheted off the hood of the pickup mcguire exposed on the drivers side got down and slid across the seat coming out with his shotgun beside hardy squatting behind the front tire peering out on the pier another shot rang and he saw sephia and rez pull back whos that mcguire asked i dont know hardy said but if hes shooting at those guys ive got to believe hes with us yeah but hes still shooting in our direction what kind of shit is that thats what happens when youre all in a line and this clearly was the problem from this angle mcguire couldnt use his shotgun to fire at anyone this side of glitsky since the buckshot pattern risked hitting glitsky beyond by the same token any shot of glitskysor holidays for that matter though hardy and moses didnt know it was himwas essentially in their direction somehow they needed an angle and there was no way to get to one that wasnt immediately lifethreatening another couple of shots slammed into the pickup rocking it on its wheels fortyfives hardy said weve got to rush em mcguire said its the only way at that moment john holiday perhaps coming to a similar conclusion about needing an angle broke running from the shelter of his barn ten or twelve feet out into the road he stopped abruptly whirled and with an almost agonizing slowness took careful twohanded aim at gerson who snapped off a shot of his own then hit the ground himself in a continuous roll back away from glitskys position holiday squeezed off a first shot now now now mcguire yelled more shots from the pier but there was no time to analyze or even look at what was happening farther down there now it was all movement with a focus on sephia and rez as mcguire using holidays break as a distraction cleared the back end of the truck comin in abe hardy yelled and sprinted out of the trucks protection two steps behind mcguire both of them running full out low to the ground go right right right mcguire screamed as he brought the shotgun up moving out onto the pier itself now still running hardy got a glimpse of sephia hunkered down against a kind of covered doorway on the left moses was going to take him rez was his target he stood six feet closer toward the mouth of the pier to hardys right he raised his gun with his left hand tried to draw a quick bead and fired but he hadnt reckoned on the broken bone in his hand the immense kick of his weapon his grip didnt have the strength it needed the recoil knocked the gun from his grasp sent it clattering onto the asphalt a deafening explosion to his left as first sephia opened fire with everything he had emptying his gun while mcguire straightened up and fired first one load then almost immediately the second out of the corner of his eye hardy saw sephia thrown backward glass breaking down over him as he fell slumped to the ground but rez had an automatic in each hand now both of his arms pointing straight out in front of him he seemed to be laughing taking aim at hardy from no more than fifteen feet starting a desperate dive for his gun hardy was in the air when something hit him in the chest and he went down at first sideways then over flat on his back john holiday was down he lay in a hump out in the fairway of the pier mcguire and hardy were charging up from the truck it was glitskys only chance to move and he took it pushing off from the building turning to get a gauge of where gerson had gotten to glitskys own position caught between gerson and the panos crowd had been completely untenable but holidays intervention and then the trucks arrival had given him a few seconds off to his right by the mouth of the pier glitsky heard the blast of a shotgun then another intermingled with several explosions of pistol shot in rapid successionsomeone was firing an automatic with both hands a quick glance caught hardy going down zigzagging glitsky broke for the cover of the barn mcguire the lone man standing now out on the pier had fired his two loads at nick sephia if the man wasnt dead mcguire figured his dancing career was over at least mcguire had ejected his shells had two more in his knuckles ready to insert but it all took time not a lot of time but enough for rez who jumped out of his doorway now and ran toward mcguire one of his gun hands extended with the automatic in it screaming a long wild note he closed to three or four feet pointed the gun at mcguires head and pulled the trigger but there was no report the automatic had misfired staring at it in fury for the briefest of seconds rez swore and threw it down onto the asphalt glitsky less than twenty feet away in the door of the barn could almost see the moment when rez realized he still had his other gun in his other hand mcguire was finished with his reload though snapping the barrel back up into place as rez extended his other arm glitsky braced against the barn door aimed carefully and holding his gun with both hands fired twice the first bullet taking rez under the right arm passing through both his lungs and his heart the second missing entirely but the second shot wasnt needed firing squads had killed people more slowlyrez was dead before he hit the ground but the reverberation from that shot hadnt died when another two rang simultaneously one to glitskys left from the front of the pier and the other behind him spinning around his own gun in his twohanded grip glitsky saw gerson not ten feet behind him slide slowly down the front of the stucco of the warehouse next door leaving a trail of blood on the faded wall he turned back to see that hardy was now slowly getting up his gun in his hand and moses crossing over to him glitsky suddenly wasnt sure that he could move at all in the sudden and deafening silence he let his hands go to his sides and leaned heavily against the barn door but there was holiday whose early volley had certainly saved glitskys life lying without any movement on the asphalt if he was alive if any of them were alive they would need to call an ambulance and seconds could matter glitsky had to check hardy and mcguire had something of the same thought and the three men converged on their fallen ally holiday wasnt moving at all they had gathered in a knot around him glitsky going down on one knee a hand to where the pulse should be on holidays neck when suddenly the silence was again defiled a womans voice harshly commanding put it down guys look out they all turned scattering with their weapons pointed but then immediately came one last and again nearly simultaneous round of gunfire gina roake walked slowly ignoring them warily approaching the body of the man whod turned and squeezed off a shot at her when shed called out glitsky hardy and mcguire had all seen it roy panos lying flat on his stomach his gun extended where hed been aiming directly at gina before shed called out he was obviously intending to take out at least one and maybe all of the men before they could finish him gina stopped at his body and kicked at it as she might have some dead vermin her pistol pointed the whole time at his head then she looked up at the three other gunmen her shoulders fell and she walked toward them none of the principals could have guessed the length of the battle although none of them would have believed it lasted less than ten minutes but from the first shot to the last the total time of the engagement was one minute twentytwo seconds len faro stood outside the lit perimeter of thecrime scene for a moment before wading in thinking that this had been about the deadliest two weeks since hed come on with the force by the time he arrived at pier dusk was well advanced and the place was a madhouse of activity with three tv and a couple of local radio crews six or seven blackandwhites several unmarked cars two ambulances the coroners van and a limousine that he guessed would belong to one of the higher brass which now that he thought of it made little sense if this was a gang shooting and thats what he would normally have expected in this location so wondering now making his way through the phalanx of vehicles he showed his badge to the officer at the tape and stepped over it the scene was lit by the television lights as well as headlights from the cars but even without the illumination faro could see at a glance that thered been significant carnage he passed the first body only a few feet onto the pier itself and paused by the knot of daytime csi people attending it gangbangers he asked gretchen tonights photographer after all four bodies were lying in plain sightthere might be more inside any of these buildings and faro had up until now only seen this kind of slaughter in a driveby or other organized retaliation environment but gretchen looked shellshocked herself and in a woman to whom violence was literally a daily event this was surprising gerson she said and at first he thought she was asking him if the lieutenant had been notified to come to the scene i assume he began then stopped what about him she motioned with a toss of her head back down the pier another forty feet or so where another group of men were standing around another body propped under a thick streak of brown on a stucco wall was that frank batiste down there the deputy chief did not come to homicide scenes unless something was radically unusual faro broke into a trot was with them all in five secondscuneo and russell from homicide john strout the chief medical examiner two daytime csi people everybody with hands in their pockets against the biting wind to get to them faro had to pass a third corpse on the pier on his way down and a fourth buried in a hail of broken glass in one of the doorways other homicide inspectors half the lot of them barrel bracco sarah evans marcel lanierappeared as recognizable suddenly in the glut of faces still getting up to this victim faro slowed before hed quite reached it took a last step or two stopped dead in his tracks jesus christ he thought barry gersons eyes were open he hadnt yet been moved and so sat with his legs almost straight out tipped a little to his right side at the bottom of the brown line which disappeared into his back faro leaned down closer made out two small holes in the front of his jacket he straightened up and turned to the knot of men how did this happen were in the process of trying to piece that together right now sergeant batiste had come up through homicidehed been lieutenant before glitskyand so he knew the drill im hearing from these inspectorshe indicated cuneo and russellthat theres been some history among these men faro out of the loop glanced at his dead lieutenant came back to batiste but cuneo pointing up the pier was the one to speak the first stiff back there is john holiday len beyond him is roy panos that speak to you at all john holiday i know faro said a nod the name only he paused knowing that his next words would be a bomb decided he had to say them i was at his house a couple of nights ago with paul thieu all heads snapped toward him russell and cuneo exchanged a meaningful look what was he doing there cuneo asked what were you doing there holiday was our suspect russell bitching about turf but batiste cut them both off i dont give a damn about any of that sergeant youre telling me paul thieu was in this too it seems like he would have had to be somehow sir doesnt it and killed himself over it that might not have been over this cuneo said it might have been something else or maybe he didnt even kill himself at all faro said maybe somebody killed him what for russell snapped i dont know shut him up about what cuneo faro shrugged he didnt know he motioned back toward the other bodies so who are the other two batiste provided the identifications when he heard the names faro nodded just yesterday sir inspector thieu had me check fingerprints we found at holidays house against these guys theyd been there which means what i dont know sir he looked around holiday and these men must have been into something together though the deputy chief didnt like this turn of events at all and it showed all over him his eyes strafed the men knotted around him went back to gerson over to holidays body took in the whole scene what the hells going on anybody got any idea yall hold the fort here john strout said im going to take a walk see some other clients jimmy the medical examiner moved back up the pier with one of the other crime scene inspectors after hed gone cuneo and russell shared another look and batiste caught it lets hear it boys you even think you got anything at all nowd be a good time to share cuneo cleared his throat took the lead lincoln and i weve been working a little with roy panos he jerked a thumb the first body up there what do you mean working with him batiste asked he was an assistant patrol special related to wade yes sir his brother he became a source for what first the silverman murder then matt creed the other patrol special the admission was costing cuneo he cleared his throat again and the tenderloin multiple batiste crossed his arms youre telling me this man panos was a source for what four homicide investigations russell jumped to his partners defense they were all related sir i would hope to smile okay so where does paul thieu come in again the glance between the homicide guys but there was no hiding it and cuneo took it again he originally drew both creed and the tenderloin guys batiste trying to get it clear but you wound up with both of them thats right cuneo nodded the lieutenant handed them off to us there was a connection with both of them to silverman which was ours already he thought it would be more efficient but thieu stuck with it anyway why would he do that blank stares all around and batiste turned back to faro sergeant id be interested in anything youd like to contribute faro tugged at his bug the tuft of hair under his lower lip he had some questions i guess what kind of questions with the evidence at the tenderloin scene he told you that in vague terms only but nothing specific not really sir or if there was he didnt share that information with me so what did he tell you when you were going out to holidays what was that about i told you to lift prints faro turned to the inspectors he told me it was a favor for you guys thats bullshit cuneo said we never sent anybody out there he was angry and was making very little effort to hide it if batiste hadnt been there he might have swung at faro we would have made any request like that directly to csi len like we always do and you know it this really pisses me off he added to no one in particular batiste ignored him all right he pointed at cuneo and russell put that on your list way up there maybe first again he surveyed the area all around so what the hell happened here what got barry out here it had to be something with these patrol specials wouldnt you think how many of them are dead now two russell said roy panos and matt creed but cuneo couldnt let that go you might as well include nick sephia he used to work for panos too hes his nephew he indicated the spot thats him in the doorway up there shit batiste blew out heavily anybody call wade yet wheres lanier he turned and called out marcel lanier came trotting up from where sephia had fallen yes sir youd better get ahold of wade panos and get him over here asap thats his brother roy and his nephew nick this has got to have something to do with him weve got to find out what he knows what are you thinking lanier asked im thinking somebody with panos tried to broker some kind of a deal not with holiday cuneo put in panos and him dont get along thats interesting batiste said i wonder where he was when this was going on well well get to that meanwhile marcel did i read somewhere you finally passed for lieutenant yes sir all right then congratulations youre the point man on this he gestured around all of it the detail reports to you you come to me i know youll thank me some day guysthe deputy chief turned to cuneo and russell everything through marcel clear batiste then turned around and looked down at the body of barry gerson he went to a knee shook his head with great sadness what the hell were you thinking coming down here with no backup marcel lanier had been a homicide inspector for twenty years and during that time had formed some of the same conclusions about wade panos that glitsky had reached the last time lanier had done anything even tangentially connected to the patrol special hed been trying to do a favor for both his new and old lieutenant bridging the gap between them that had backfired awkwardly now he was coming to his interrogation of wade panos with a different and mostly negative set of preconceptions before hed sent cuneo and russell off to the lab to check on thieus fingerprint question lanier had pressed the two inspectors for a brief recap of the events and their interpretations of them since sam silvermans death the roles of both roy and wade panos struck him as unusual to say the least lanier had been at pier for over three hours and hadnt been in a good mood when hed arrived by now he was frozen to the bone overwhelmed with his new and sudden responsibilities sickened by all hed seen the media had if anything multiplied they had set up camps at the pier fighting for exclusive quotes and breaking bulletins in the pools of artificial light from the departments portable lamps all five bodies had been tagged bagged and transported but several teams of crime scene specialists were still doing their painstaking work up and down the pier panos had arrived with his lawyerhis lawyerin time to see his brother and nephew packed into the coroners van and lanier had asked them both as a courtesy if they could wait for a few minutes and have wade answer a few questions try to clear up some of the mystery here he had managed to keep himself looking busy with the various teamsit wasnt terribly difficultso that the few minutes could grow to a half hour now lanier knocked at the window to panoss car opened the back door and slid in reaching a hand over the seat he shook hands all around offered condolences everybodys pal he then took out his pocket recorder and getting their permission placed it on the seatback between them he got right to it so do you have any idea what this is about damn straight i do and a pretty good one tell me he didnt really say that that he thought i was actually there glitsky shook his head in disbelief that mans a piece of work was there any physical indication that i was you didnt carve your initials into anything did you abe treya calm and relaxed making a joke its an old habit hes trying to break marcel everywhere he goes if theres a tree hes worse than a dog lanier smiled no trees there no initials either how can i put this marcel thats because i wasnt there glitsky had crossed a leg and leaned back on the couch his arm around his wife it was close to eight oclock and the family including grandfather had finished dinner about twenty minutes before because inspector lanier had come by nat offered to babysit rachel in her playpen while he did the dishes and they could all hear him singing songs from fiddler on the roof to keep her entertained now lanier sat across from them in the living room with a diet coke lanier made an apologetic face ive got to ask abe panos didnt actually say you were he said he thought you might have been then when i found you hadnt been at work sure of course no offense id ask the same thing glitsky came forward look im not making any secret of it marcel panos isnt a friend of mine i told you about him when a week ago so you could warn barry not that it did him any good but you werent at work thats right and i wasnt sick either so where was i right thats the question what time more or less twoish glitsky remembered right away i was at david freemans apartment with gina roake you know freeman sure well you may not have heard but he died today too around noon roake wanted to get some of freemans clothes picked out for the funeral and i thought she could use the company she was a mess marcel anyway freeman had this one suit but it had gotten ruined and shed forgotten anyway long afternoon sorry but shell vouch for it unless panos thinks she was there too out at the pier i mean maybe she brought a howitzer treya added with scorn was there any sign of a howitzer shell out there marcel easy glitsky said to his wife its just the job i hate it treya said and stood up abruptly sorry marcel im a little impatient lately she went into the kitchen roake will back me up marcel i was there if shes not at her office glitsky said roake try freemans theyll know where to find her dismas hardy probably will have her number too lanier scribbled on his pad let some air out okay one more abe if you dont mind if you were working with hardy howd you get connected with roake glitsky sat back again relaxed she came by to check with freemans office which is where hardy works he and i were just about finished and roake needed some help at freemans so i went with her good samaritan and what were you doing at hardys in the first place its why i took the two days off we were both trying to get somebody interested in investigating these same guys who got killed today why because somebody had threatened us and hardy thought he knew who it was the plan theyd all agreed uponhardy glitsky mcguire roakewas to keep as close to the truth as possible during all the interrogations that were likely to follow so did i so whod you try to get interested management and control this was the department formerly called internal affairs that investigated police misconduct no lets just say hardy went to some judges and i went to another law enforcement agency outside the department youre saying you went to the fbi i went to another agency glitsky repeated its moot anyway marcel the point was i was doing some work at hardys office because it could have been embarrassing at the hall glitsky held up his hands palms out all innocence look you know about gerson calling me off silverman right after i talked to you yeah well i didnt stay all the way out he leaned back again matter of fact sam silvermans widow is a friend of mine she had a question and asked me i forwarded it on to cuneo and russell then paul thieu had a bit of a moral dilemma about some evidence and he came to me about it and you talked to him briefly you think any of this had to do with his death i think its possible i dont think he killed himself then who killed him i dont know marcel i wish i did know lanier grimaced an objective observer might say you were involved at this point abe i never said i wasnt after my family got threatened i got proactive you would have too all right thats what panos said today you were trying to take these boys down the same ones who got shot and i wanted to take out barry gerson too glitsky allowed a trace of asperity and i wanted to do all of this with the help of john holiday who was wanted for murder are you saying you believe i could have been part of that marcel he leaned back softened his tone i was trying to find a way to do this kosher he sighed all right i might as well tell you you know bill schuyler fbi talk to him so what was hardy doing hardy thought these guys were trying to frame holiday he was calling judges you can ask around on that too look marcel i dont know what got barry down there to the pier or holiday for that matter but these guys are bad people im not surprised they got themselves killed but if you think i was there or had anything to do with it he let the words hang in the room marcel put down his empty glass and sighed heavily if you werent there you werent there abe ive just got to touch all the bases tell your wife im sorry i upset her would you and you too when lanier got to the door glitsky held it for him stopped him for a second so panos aside marcel how many people are they saying were down there laniers eyes were drawn with fatigue csfs saying at least six maybe as many as ten lots of hardware different calibers but people might have been doubled up at least one shotgun could have been seven thousand macedonians in full battle array he shrugged wearily you ask me abe nobodys got a clue that was norma hardy said from the office frannie was at the dining room table studying she looked up how is she okay considering she put the book down what she just got a call from lieutenant lanier homicide one of the associates was working late and gave him her home number he wanted to know where id been all afternoon shed never had anyone from the police call and ask her that before she hoped it was okay with me that she just went ahead and told them without checking with me first i told her sure why not she gave him phylliss number too wanted to know what it was all about what did you tell her that i had no idea frannie pushed her chair back brushed a rogue hair from her forehead she rested her hand over her heart and what did she tell him lanier that id been in my office the whole afternoon until a little after three working hardy had changed out of the kevlar in the truck and asked mcguire on his way to ghirardelli square and the municipal pier where he was going to ditch the guns and if he could the vests to drop him back at sutter street he had come in through the garage up the inside elevator all the way to the third floor in his office he changed into the business suit he kept hanging in his closet thenit had been just three oclockhed walked back by the staircase into the lobby carrying his old clothes hiking boots and all in a laundry bag that hed dropped at st vincent de paul on the way home in the lobby hed said hello to phyllis and shared a moment of commiseration after that he looked in on norma and said he wasnt able to concentrate at all after the news about david he been trying for a couple of hours to do some simple admin stuff but he really couldnt work at all and was going home maybe she should do the same tomorrow they could start picking up the pieces if they could shed gotten up and hugged him again hed nearly passed out from the pain where the bullet had smashed into the vest but she probably thought the tears were for freeman and in some sense maybe they were she was positive i was there all day she hoped that was the right thing to say what did you tell her that it was the truth how could it be wrong overtime was being had by all at lanier was out at his desk in the detail he might have just been named the provisional and nominal head of the unit but he wasnt going into gersons office for a good long while even if it got announced officially cuneo and russell both wore hangdog looks as they sat there and lanier couldnt say he blamed them something about their investigations must have gotten seriously out of whack early on and now in the wake of todays slaughter they both seemed lost and confused cuneo had it all going tonight playing the whole invisible drum kitsnare and kick drum riding the high hat the occasional crash of cymbal lanier wondered what track he was using in his brain because part of him obviously had no idea that any of this percussion was going on what i cant figure out is why thieu would have even thought to look at holidays i mean what did he know that we didnt know the question is dan what do we know now about what about the fingerprints at holidays house for example what do they mean were these guys friends or what they played poker together at silvermans cuneo said but otherwise did they hang out together no id say not but theyd both been to holidays place i doubt it cuneo was upping the tempo no i cant see that wait a minute dan wait a minute lanier said i wasnt asking if theyd been to holidays we know they went there the prints were there the question is why maybe they played poker there too once or twice but why if they werent friends lanier focused on each of them in turn i dont know anything more than you do okay in fact i know way less on these cases im asking you both to think why these fingerprints might have been enough to get paul killed if somebody killed him what they might mean blanks until cuneo suddenly stopped all his frenetic movement it was like a vacuum in the room when he first spoke it was almost inaudible whats that dan lanier asked cuneo looked up let out a long sigh it means they did plant the evidence he said its like mrs silverman thought if they did plant he stopped again stared across laniers desk if they did plant what dan marcel said the evidence at holidays cuneo said he gripped his temples and squeezed so that his ringers went white man oh man oh man michelle sat in the big chair by her picture window that afforded no view of the black night outside the reading light glared next to her and reflected the room back at her her own pitiful image in the glass of the window shed cocooned herself into a comforter that offered little comfort huddled into as small a position as she could get herself next to her on the light table there was an untouched glass of white wine and an envelope in her hand she held what had been the contents of the envelope two pages of her own personal stationeryno letterhead no border just fivebyseven heavy rag not quite white bits of pulp throughout shed been sitting empty now unmoving for the twenty minutes since shed finished reading the letter for the second time and now her eyes had cleared enough to read it yet again dear michelle she read as you know better than anyone its been my tendency to want to come across as the worlds most easygoing guy it keeps the expectations low both mine for myself and my friends for me i dont ever promise anything other than perhaps a good time in the here and now and since i dont pretend to have any depth or seriousness no one can be disappointed in me when i dont deliver when i flake out when i get drunk or loaded and do any one of the many stupid and embarrassing things that have cost me friends and selfesteem when i think back on the time that i was married to emma especially the few months after we had jolie i sometimes wonder what happened to the person i was then where suddenly for that short time it was okay to feel like things mattered like everything mattered in fact it was strange but i found i actually wanted em and jolie to have expectations for me to want the best out of me when before id always run from that telling myself that i was just a clown deep as a dinner plate maybe also though because i was afraid that if i tried to be more id fail its a true fact that if you dont try you can never fail foolproof but a funny thing happened i found out with my girls that the more i acknowledged how much i cared about them the better my life became i started trying all the time in a hundred different ways and stunned myself by succeeding i was faithful for example and wanted to be suddenly i didnt need women on the side as a backup position if em dumped me because i didnt deserve her or if she cheated on me i just knew that wouldnt happen ever i believed in all of us pathetic though that may sound some of my core bedrock had shifted and settled and now i could take down my guard and breathe and enjoy i dont know what it was about my hardwiring that had made me fear commitment so much before that but gradually the life i was living with them became the only thing i really wanted me and em and jolie the whole world which of course ended and then what a massively gullible fool id been huh to believe in all that to think it could last talk about pathetic talk about stupid well none of that was ever going to happen to me again ever the goal was get a nice buzz keep it going risk your money and your job and everything else because then you really could fail completely you could get to zero hope rock bottom which was pure freedom and none of it mattered anyway right take every single opportunity for physical pleasure and make sure it was purely physical nothing more happiness was a moment and that was all it was any thought that a life could take on a shape and be fulfilling was out of the question so why am i writing this now because something has shifted inside me again knowing you has changed me once and for all i really feel as though ive laid those awful ghosts to rest i dont know where you and i are going exactly but i wanted you to know that suddenly i want you to have expectations of me i want to find my best self and be that person i want to try and try and keep trying even if sometimes i do fail its all in the trying does this make any sense now this afternoon theres something else ive got to do another commitment a matter of honor if thats not too overblown a word it seems all of a piece somehow expectations and responsibilities and suddenly im okay with them i even welcome them if youre reading this i didnt come back this time its because i cant not because i didnt try but whatever happens to me i want you to know that life is good and that i left this apartment today as happy and filled with hope for the future as i have ever been in my life i love you with all my heart epilogue in late november a highpressure front settled in off the coast and the last three days set records for the cold with highs in the low forties newscasters were saying that with the wind chill it was equivalent to the midtwenties vincent hardy was the first one up on the holiday morning theyd used the living room fireplace the past few nights and all he had to do was crumple up yesterdays chronicle and blow on the embers to get a flame by the time his father came downstairs at a little after eight three oak logs crackled vincent sat indian style on the floor four feet or so in front of the blaze staring into it his father barefoot wore jeans and an old gray sweatshirt he had his coffee in a mug and put it on the floor when he sat down good fire nice job thanks happy thanksgiving silence the beck sleeping i think so on the floor in your room again yeah then its okay i dont mind no i know youre a good guy hardy picked up his mug stared at the flames vincent moved over a few inches hardy put an arm around him drew him in for a minute shes just afraid you know she keeps seeing that picture how about you hardy asked he felt his sons shoulders lift then drop i dont think about it really yeah with a sharp crack the fire spit flared settled hardy stole a sideways glance at his boy his hands were clasped he appeared mesmerized by the fire cause if you do hardy finally said if youre worried about anything vincent shuddered then shook himself away was suddenly on his feet i just dont think about it okay okay vin okay his son looked down at him eyes threatening to tear he started to walk away out of the room hardy stood turning after him hey vin wait dont go running away please its okay cmere its all right vincent stopped and turned to him come on back over here please give your old man a hug the boy sighed deeply eventually came forward he was soon going to be fourteen years old his dad still had a foot of height on him when he got close enough hardy reached out and put an arm around his shoulders quickly kissed the top of his head its okay he said one last time then he let go of his son and walked out the door and over the frost on the lawn to get the morning paper dinner was the classic turkey and stuffing mashed potatoes cranberry sauce and brussels sprouts treya brought her famous marshmallow candied yams green beans with almonds susan her spinach salad with mandarin oranges abe some macaroons for those who didnt like pumpkin pie even nat chipped in with creamed onions a surprise hit theyd extended the table out with all its leaves so that it took up the whole dining room and half the living room and could accommodate fifteen people mcguire was there with susan and the girls the glitsky contingent included not only abe treya and the baby but also nat and the older kids home for thanksgivingorel and raney from their respective colleges and even abes eldest isaac made it up from los angeles where hed gotten ontemporarily he saidwith a construction crew the only missing glitsky was jacob the opera singerhe was touring perennially somewhere in europe after dinner theyd closed the table back up the older kids had pitched in on the hundred and fifty dishes while the adults had more coffee or for some drinks in the living room now almost everybody had gathered at the front of the house and they were playing games games hardy thought were good talkingthe stories and jokes the whole time they atethat was good too throwing the football around all afternoon out in the streetgreat idea as was the communal cooking the daily things the simple things no reason to mention wade panos or the fact that he was still very much alive possibly even more of a threat than hed been everyone was aware of that every waking minute sometimes during sleep hardy drenched in sweat and gasping for breath had jolted himself awake more than once frannie and the kids cried out between them every night the first week a couple of times since although now a couple of weeks into it hardy had privately begun to consider that maybe their show of force had made panos at least cautious at best theyd scared him off but hardy wasnt going to say that out loud not yet after dinner the games had started with several rounds of st peterst paul and now they had moved on to charades abe was trying to pantomime peter paul amp mary and it wasnt going very well unless he was lucky it would be a while before he was through hardy took the opportunity to get up and walk back to the empty kitchen the highenergy laughter from the game in the living room still rang through the house and hardy found hed run out of tolerance for it he opened the kitchens back door which led to his tool and workroom and was surprised to find moses there sitting alone on the countertop nursing a drink hey hardy said youre missing a great showabes trying to emote its something to see moses raised his eyes youre missing it yourself i notice hardy closed the door behind him took a hit from mcguires glass handed it back to him how you holding up a shrug good you sound like my son one syllable per sentence good fine great okay maybe im not so good he drank an inch of scotch i worry about it and dont say about what i worry too is panos done are

every day at home so what do you want i dont know i wish it had never started thats all you mean you wish there wasnt evil in the world mcguire drained his glass brought his bloodshot eyes up to hardys yeah maybe that well there is hardy said he rested a hand on mcguires shoulder i guess were going to have to get used to it citytalk by jeffrey elliot shock waves are still rippling through the various halls of the city over the raids yesterday by local police and federal marshals on several upscale homes in various san francisco neighborhoods as well as on downtowns georgia aaa diamond center and the disappearance of its chief executive officer dmitri solon the young russian immigrant with a penchant for fine clothes and a luxurious lifestyle had in a very few years become just as wellknown as an art aficionado and political contributor he had welldocumented and close ties with many highly ranked and now plenty embarrassed city officials including the mayor and district attorney and his russianbuilt helicopter had become a familiar albeit annoying presence over the citys skyline as it ferried jewelry and gemstones to and from the airport this reporter has learned that yesterdays raid which netted over million in cash and nearly thirty pounds of cocaine and heroin followed a sixmonth investigation into alleged money laundering and drug trafficking activities occurring out of several homes in the mission diamond heights and st francis wood neighborhoods activities financed by diamonds from georgia aaa which in turn had been smuggled out of the russian treasury by that countrys own minister of precious gems and metals and delivered here to san francisco in diplomatic pouches carried by commercial airliners also implicated in the scheme and arrested in yesterdays raids was wade panos another influential political donor whose company wgp enterprises inc provided formal security for georgia aaa as well as the pool from which the diamond center selected its drivers mr panoss drivers allegedly coordinated and executed the actual deliveries of contraband among the various drop houses sources with the police and fbi confirm that the initial investigation into irregularities at georgia aaa commenced last november when lieutenant abraham glitsky inadvertently stumbled upon two of mr panoss drivers acting in a suspicious manner on a hunch he followed them to several addresses when local authorities many the recipients of panoss political contributions declined to act glitsky forwarded the information to federal authorities on a related front as the story grows and in light of the principals involved lieutenant marcel lanier of homicide expressed concern and interest in reopening the investigation into the socalled dockside massacre of last november two of the victims in that gunfight nick sephia and julio rez had been couriers for georgia aaa and a third roy panos was employed by his brother at wgp speaking on condition of anonymity highly placed police sources have opined that these two men sephia and rez were the security guards who originally attracted the suspicion of lieutenant glitsky additionally sephia was a nephew to wade panos the fbi believes that several of the employees of georgia aaa may in fact have been recruits from organized crime syndicates within russia and that the intimate and perhaps conflicting connections between the panos group and these people may have played a significant role in the pier gunfight where five men including homicides lieutenant barry gerson were killed police have theorized that as many as seven more people besides the five victims took part in the battle none have been arrested to date and lanier does not dispute the possibility that they may have used some sort of diplomatic immunityand the diamond centers helicopterto perpetrate the slaughter and then leave the country finally lawyer dismas hardy has asked that the police reopen the investigation into the death of sam silverman that led to a warrant for the arrest of john holiday who was a client of hardys and one of the men killed at pier hardy is confident that the evidence upon which his clients murder warrant was issued was planted by sephia and rez hardy could not explain holidays presence at pier but noted that lieutenant gerson s presence has been equally confounding to authorities hardy offered the possibility that in possession of evidence linking rez and sephia to the crimes for which holiday had been charged holiday had arranged his surrender to gerson and that the panos group had somehow been tipped to the plan and ambushed them he was a great guy hardy said id like to see his name cleared often in early june snow remains in the high passes on the john muir trail michelle maier and her companion had packed out of tuolumne meadows in yosemite yesterday camping last night at lyell fork though the rangers going out had warned them that the way would be snowblocked todays goal was to get over donohue pass elevation and then descend a thousand or so feet down the other side this early in the season the sight of other campers up here wasnt always a daily event and neither michelle nor her companion had seen a soul all day michelle was planning to spend four more days in the back country then get to san francisco in time to catch her flight to barcelona where shed enrolled in a gourmet cooking class for the entire summer this had entailed giving up the apartment shed kept since college possibly she could have sublet the thing but she didnt want to be bound to return to the bay area when the class was complete what if she got offered a souschef job somewhere or just wanted to stay overseas her companion was a new friend gina was the first new friend although not the only one shed made since john holidays death michelle had thought it was probable shed be the only person at johns burial in colma certainly she expected to be the only woman there but gina roake had been at the gravesite with some men one of whom had been johns lawyer after the interment theyd invited her to an irish bar thinking roake must have been another of johns girlfriends michelle didnt want to go at first but then ginas situation had become clearshe had lost her own fiance also to violence and evidently on the same day john had died so all of them from the gravesite sat and talked until it got dark and the men had to go home she and gina had stayed on at the bar gotten smashed the next day both of them dying of alcohol poisoning she had accompanied gina to her fiances funeral attended by the same three men whod been at johns as well as about six hundred other close personal friends and acquaintances of david freemans who had evidently been somebody important although michelle had never heard of him but the connection between the two grieving women had become strong theyd gone on their first hike together a couple of miles around tilden park in oaklandlast january a few weeks ago theyd walked the bay to breakers race getting in shape having some fun at least once every two weeks they went out to dinner usually at someplace michelle would recommend the first time theyd gone to jeanty at jacks michelle had shown up in her usual camo gear and afterward felt like a bit of a fool gradually she rethought her style or lack of recently both women had taken to dressing up for these dinners even in san francisco where the odds did not favor single women to say the least they would almost always have the clear opportunity to meet men offers to buy drinks none of these advances had gone anywhere but they were flattering nonetheless nonthreatening michelle wondered what in the world she had been so afraid of and knew the answer of course everything her funky stupid hideme clothes hiding out in the corners of restaurants and libraries communicating by email the small familiar world of her small familiar apartment now well into early evening the two women had been hiking in long shadows for an hour or more when they came around a bend in the path and found themselves suddenly squinting into the sunlight that reflected off a field of ice that covered the entire trail at least now we know why we havent seen anybody coming the other way roake said she unshouldered her pack and took a long drink of water grimaced this iodine pill thing i dont think im getting very used to the taste i stopped using it michelle said roake stopped in middrink then why am i still gagging on this stuff i thought there was giardiaa particularly unpleasant intestinal parasiteeverywhere up here there is i suppose but my dad used to hike up here all the time and he never used it either and never got sick she shrugged if ive learned anything the past year gina its that the worlds a dangerous place its never really been safe although its comforting to pretend it is but really theres risk everywhere might as well embrace it and enjoy the days so im going to drink the goddamned goodtasting noniodized water roake took another pull at her canteen made another face will you think im a wimp if i dont absolutely a big grin but who cares what i think you do it your way ill still like you michelle stood up brushed off her bottom stared at the ice shelf looming up ahead of them talk about risk she said do you want to go for this maybe we should give it up roake too was on her feet and miss the best view in the sierra id rather die trying so we go lead on girlfriend lead on
