mercedes lackey and larry dixon mage wars the black gryphon one silence cold wind played against skandranons naresa wind as frigid as the hearts of the killers below their hearts pumped blood unlike any other creatures thick black blood warmed when their commanders willed itonly when they flew only when they hunted only when they killed their blood was cold and yet it ran warmer than their masters this much skandranon rashkae knew he had fought their masters since he was a fledgling himself they were cruel and cunning these makaar and yet the worst aspects of these manufactured horrors paled before the cruelty of their creators silence stay still quiet skandranon remained motionless crouched feathers compressed tight to his body he was silent to more than hearing that silence was but one of the powers that had made his master and friend so powerful although it was the power that had given him his nameurtho the mage of silence urthos champions had invisibility against magical sightto mindscanning to detection spells to magical scrying the enemies of his monarchy had spent much of their resources on foiling that edgeto no avail it seemedand now concentrated on more direct methods of destroying urthos hold on the verdant centrallands riches skan kept his wings folded the leading edge of each wing tucked under the soft black feathers at the sides of his chest it was important to be quiet and keep his head down even this far from the encampment the journey here had been one of long soars and kiting and although he was in his best physical shape ever flight muscles protested even yet better now to rest and watch the chill wind rippled against his coat of feathers this day had turned out unseasonably cold which hadnt helped him anyexcept that it kept the makaar willing to make only the most necessary flights he watched them sleeping restlessly twitching in their dreaming did they know how transient how fleeting they were how their creators built them bred them refined them letting the bad stock die out by assigning them to the border did they know their masters designed them with short lives so the generations would cycle quicker to reveal the defects more conveniently they were despite their horrifying appearances and deadly claws quite pitiful theyd never know the caress of a caring loverthey would only know the heat of imposed breeding they knew their lot was the searing pain of a tortureweapon if they failed they never lay in the sun with a friend or dashed in the air with their wingmates theyd never risk their lives to do something because they felt it was right perhaps that was the greatest pity of all they could not be broken because they had no honor to compromise no will to subvert the makaar and the gryphons were a study in contrasts despite the darker mages obvious attempts to mimic the mage of silences handiwork if gryphons were sinuous graceful storms makaar were blustering squalls the gryphons were bold intelligent crafty the makaar were conditioned to blind obedience and one need only ask skandranon which was the more attractive hed likely answer i am vain bird youll make a lovely skin on a commanders wall skandranon breathed deeply behind the line of trees atop the hill before him was the pass of stelvi the coming army had stormed it at the cost of but a few hundred of their soldiers compared to the thousand of urthos garrison farther down the pass was the split valley which once supported a thriving tradetown laisfaar was now the armys quarters and the surviving townsfolk made into servants no better off than slaves in the other fork of the valley the commanders had stationed the armys supplies and creatures including the sleeping makaar they might as well sleep they did not need to fear sorcerous spying the armys mages had shielded the area from magical scrying and none of urthos many attempts to search the valley by spell had worked that had left the need for study by stealthrisky at best suicidal at worst skandranon had of course volunteered fly proudly to your doom laughing vain bird the best of the best more suitors than sense more wealth than wisdom sharp claws ready to dig your own funeral pit his meeting with urtho had been brief by choice the offer was made to send guards and mages skandranon declined urtho offered to bolster his defensive spells as he had done so many times before it was declined as well what skan asked for was enhancement of his magical senseshis magesight had been losing sharpness of late due to disuse urtho had smiled and granted it and skandranon left immediately from the tower itself leaping broadwinged onto the winds shivering back that was three dozen leagues and four meals ago a long time to cover such a distance it was a tactical disaster for his side that the enemys army had advanced this close to urthos tower now it appeared they were prepared to march on the tower itself the layout of the encampments showed three separate cadres of troops the makaar had been assigned equally to two of them and between those two was the weaponsmasters coach staked firmly and blanketed flanked by two canvascovered wagons hold a moment now with a town nearbyhearths and comfortable beddingthe weaponsmaster is staying in a tent each side in this war had seers and diviners whose powers could throw secret plans however perfectly laid awry a seer waking with a premonition of an assassination could thwart the attempt for instance the night before stelvi pass was taken a seers vision told of a horrible new weapon that would devastate the garrison urtho had placed there it was something magical the woman had said but was in the hands of common soldiers that warning alone was enough to make the gryphon wary and had made him determined to explore this valley in a war of mages the limited number of adepts and masters made tactical planning easier you could study your opponents guess their resources even identify them by their strategies without ever seeing the commander himself what alarmed skandranon was the idea that the power of a mage could be put in the hands of untrained peoplethose who did not have the innate powers or learned skills of a mage the units that could be fielded with such weapons would be an unwelcome variable difficult to guard against if at all a master could ride onto a battlefield and call on his own powers unleashing firebolts lightning hurricanes of killing windyet he was still just one man and he could be eliminated but soldiers that could do that would be devastating even if the weapons were employed but once each and if an adept had discovered a way for the weapons to draw on power from magical nodes that was too horrifying to think of further skandranon had faced the adept commander of all the troops below the kiyamvir maar twenty months ago he had volunteered for that mission too and had limped home wingbroken stricken with nightmares he had seen his wingmates skinned by the adepts spells feathered coats peeled back in strips by the adepts will alone in full daylight despite skans attempts to counterspell the nightmares had left him now but the memory made him determined to protect urthos people from the kiyamvirs merciless rule skandranons eyes focused on the town of laisfaar urthos garrison had not all been human there had been hertasi a few tervardi and three families of gryphons his eyes searched the ramparts noted the wisps of smoke of fires still burning since the attack there were the aeries of the gryphons the ramps for visitors the sunning beds the fledglings nests the bloodstains the burned feathers the glistening rib cage all the usual atrocities damn them she had been alive until very recently she had escaped the worst of it by dying of shock and blood loss the makaar had no love for gryphons and their masters gave them a stillliving one after a battle as a reward often it was a terrified fledgling like this grayshafted gryphon had been the rest of the garrisons gryphons had doubtless been wingcut caged and sent to the kiyamvir for his pleasures by now skandranon knew well that unless maar was distracted by his business of conquest there would be nothing left of them to rescue by days end if he could skandranon would insure the captives would not last that long crippled as they would likely be he couldnt help them escape but he might be able to end their ordeal before that he had a larger duty to attend to now he moved slinking bellyflat to the ground catlike one slow step at a time eeling his way through the underbrush with such delicate care that not even a leaf rustled the weaponsmasters wagons had plenty of guards but not even the weaponsmaster could control terrain the mountains themselves provided brushfilled ravines for skandranon to creep through and escarpments that overlooked the wagons the encampment was guarded from attack from above by makaar but only over the immediate vicinity of the camp it was guarded from penetration from below by the footsoldiers but only outside the camp itself no one had guarded against the possibility of someone flying into the area of the camp behind the sentry lines then landing and proceeding on foot to the center of the camp no one could have except a gryphon no one would have except skandranon the omission of a defense against gryphon spying told him volumes about the military commanders who led this force the kiyamvir would reprimand them well for such a mistakebut then maar was the only one of their side who understood the gryphons abilities most commanders simply assumed gryphons and makaar were alike and planned defenses accordingly so skandranon stayed in the shadows moving stealthily as unlike a makaar as possible time meant nothing to him he was quite prepared to spend all night creeping into place even in the most strictly ruled of armies discipline slackens after a victory soldiers are weary and need rest victory makes them careless skan had timed his movements to coincide with that period of carelessness he noted no sentries within the bounds of the camp itself his sharp hearing brought him no hint that the commanders prowled about as they were known to do before a battle doubtless the commanders were as weary as the soldiers and slept just as deeply he spent his moments waiting committing details to memory even if he died if his body were somehow recovered urtho could still sift his last memories for information that would only work if he died swiftly though otherwise the memories would be overcome by sensory input thus the immediate torture of gryphon captives daring rescues had occurred before and once retrieved the gryphons bodies were tremendous sources of information that could also be a clue to where the rest of the gryphon families were it was also not unheard of to use captives as bait for rescuetraps captives minds were often stripped of the will to resist the prisoners forced to give information to the enemy this was why skandranon held a horrible powera spell of death keyed to gryphonsfor mercy and he hoped with every drop of blood that he would never be required to use it again halfway to his goal he froze as he heard footsteps approaching the stand of tall grasses where he lay hidden the cover that had seemed adequate a moment earlier seemed all too thin now clever bird hiding in grass better hope the wind doesnt blow but the footsteps stumbled and skan held his breath not wanting to betray his position by breathing steam into the cold air he froze in midstep right foreclaw held a mere thumb length above the ground he could not see the human who approached without turning his head which he would not do he could only wait and listen the footsteps stopped there was a muffled curse and the sound of hands fumbling with cloththen clear and unmistakable the sound of a thin stream of water hitting the matted grasses the human grunted yawned the sound of trousers being hitched up followed the footsteps stumbled away again skandranon unfroze and lowered his claw to the ground there were no other incidents as he made his way up the escarpment and slid under the shelter of a knot of wild plum bushes to wait until dawn he could feel the beetles and spiders of the thicket exploring their newlyarrived piece of landscape as the minutes went by despite the impulse to yelp and swat them though he stayed still their irritation provided a blessing in a way something to feel to keep his senses alert after nightfall skandranons tentative plan was to wait until darkness then sneak out to explore the camp other warriors suspected his stealthiness was a result of urthos magicking although the elder denied it citing the gryphons nearobsessive interest in dancingmovements he had often watched skandranon mimicking human tervardi and hertasi performers in private skandranon had trained himself with a dedication he would never admit except as a boast applying that knowledge to flight to lovemaking and to combat that in truth was what made him quieter than a whisper of wind no spells or tricks just practiced grace silence alone is not enough urtho has learned that the hard wayweve lost border towns for half a generation and only now begun doing more than simply defending our borders eh well urtho had never intended to become archmage hes more suited to crafting silver and carving figures than deploying armies such a pity that a man so kindhearted would be pressed into the role of a warlord but better he than a heartless man and id certainly rather be off making little gryphlets that would have to wait until the world became a safer place to raise young though for now skandranon waited until a shriek rang out from the town echoing off the walls of the valley only practiced selfcontrol kept him from leaping into the air claws stretched to rend and tear one at least still lives im coming friend im coming just hold on a little longer just a little feh icant wait any longer skandranon stood and surveyed the layout of the encampment again hed heard screams like that too many times in his life not again he spread his wings halfopen and leapt down toward the weaponsmasters wagons depending on speed to be his ally knifelike wind whistled against his nares chilling his sinuses sharpening his mind all the sights and sounds of the world intensified when he was in motion sizes and details of shapes all taken into account for the entire span of his vision snatch and fly thats your plan isnt it damned foolish bird youre going to die the hero they all call you for what because you couldnt stand another moment of another gryphons pain couldnt wait any longer the wagons rushed closer in his sight and their magical alarms blazed into light waiting like barbed snares to be triggered were they traps too besides being alarms would they trap him were they the bait not the tortured gryphon would it matter youre too damned predictable skan too sensitive couldnt stand to wait shed die anyway you know it by the time youd have gone in why do it colors and textures rushed past him in three dimensions as he dove ever closer to the wagons its because youre not bright enough stupid gryphon stupid stupid gryphon well death is inevitable anyway so dying for the right reason is just as final stupid gryphon too late for reconsideration though the wagon alarmfields loomed nearer and skan had to risk a spell to disarm themthe easiest was one which made them detect another place nearby instead of the place they were supposed to protect he focused on them released the flow into them diverted their field away to an open part of the camp and they did not sound now his troubles stemmed from the soldiers who might still be outsideand the makaar he might be invisible to the alarms but he was still pitch black to anyones vision a soldier of maars army would not wonder at a shadow that moved through the skyhed call an alert he halfhoped for detection since he would likely have the quarry before any spells could be leveled against him once discovered he would not have to skulk about any longer he could blaze away with a detection spell to find the gryphon whose scream hed heard earlier otherwise there would be delicate searching around forwho knew how long of course discovery also brought such pesky distractions as arrows and firebolts and snares and spells he backwinged and landed kicking up clods of dirt next to the wagon and his head darted from side to side looking for spotters none yet but that could change all too quickly two steps to the back of the wagon then under itno one ever guards the bottoms of things only sides and doorsand he began prying at the wagons floorboards next to the struts and axles where the mud water and friction of traveling always rots the wood he was curled up under the wagon completely on his back tail tucked between his legs wings folded in against his ribs hind claws holding the wingtips he didnt dare rip at the canvas of the wagons bonnetpast experience had shown that apparently flimsy defenses were often imbued with alarmspells his claws glowed faintly with the disruptionspell he was using and the wood shriveled above where his claws slowly raked silent from the soundmuffling of his cupped wings the enemys wagons traditionally had an aisle down the middle and that was where skandranon was working another four cuts five six and hed be able to pull the boards down under the blanket of a silencespell then hed get a look inside at their coveted prize he began mentally reciting the silencespell calling up the energy from inside himself and releasing it around the wagon he was careful to mold it short of touching the wagon itself building it up from the ground the wagons defenses might yet be sensitive to the touch of just such a spell it was hard to tell anymore so many variables so many new traps he hoped that the mages under maars command did not sweep the camp for magic at work things were going so well so far skan reached up claws digging firmly into the crossbrace cracked through it and the entire aisle section fell to the ground inches in front of his beak and skandranon found himself face to face with a very upset recently awakened weaponsmaster who was drawing somethingsurely a weaponup from beneath his bedding the weapon pointed at the gryphon and started changing skans right claw shot out and struck the humans scalp and squeezed finding yielding flesh his thumb pierced the mans eye socket and inside the envelope of silence a gurgling scream faded into the wet sounds of skan withdrawing his talons from the kill the mans hands twitched and dropped the weapon which was still pointing at skandranon it was a polished rod wrapped in leather with a glowing spiked tip revealed where the leather ended it rolled from the dead mans fingers and fell to the ground and the tip withdrew into the rod on your back underneath a wagon in an enemy camp you kill a weaponsmaster onehanded no one will ever believe it ever that was too close too close stupid gryphon someone will come by soon skan move get the whateveritis and get away thats all you need to do get away skan released his wingtips and pulled himself across the body of the slain human keelbone scraping against the ragged edge of sundered wood his wingedges caught pinning him in the opening and he wheezed with the effort of pulling himself through it was dim inside only the waning light from outside leaking through the canvasopenings provided any illumination around him stacked in open cases waited glistening objects the same as the weaponsmaster had held each the size of his foreclaws each far more deadly than his claws he was sure they must be some entirely new kind of weapon and he needed no spellcasting to know their magical origin they exuded magic their collective power making his feathers crawl like being in the heart of a lightning storm abrewing now to grab one and leave skan reached toward the cases almost touching one of them when his inner voice screamed no the weaponsmaster had one he was guarding these these may all be trapped a hairthin crackle of reddish energy arced between the weapons and his extended foreclaw confirming his fears then there may be only one that isnt trapped he moved slowly wings folded so tight it hurt up onto his haunches then back down to all fours until he faced the rear of the wagon then he reached down through the shattered floorboards groping for the slain masters weapon it didnt make sense to skan that the man would trap his own weapon even if he was a mage weaponsmasters as a rule tended to be terribly impressed with themselves and thought they could handle anything too bad so sad first mistake and last whats that stupid bird youre getting cocky because youve lasted this long more to do and every second is borrowed time at last came the feel of the rod warm to his touch despite the thickness of his scaled skin he reared back eyes closed to the thinnest of slits concentrating on not touching the racks of trapped arms he transferred his prize to his mouth clenching it tightly above his tongue and fell forward across the gaping entrance hed made stretching across it toward the untied flap of the wagon bonnet all right whats the worst that could happen i touch the canvas and the entire wagon goes up with all the energy in these things thatd be just like maar if he cant have them no one else can id better count on it skandranon bunched up his leg muscles preparing for a massive leap through the exit when he heard bootsteps outside and a moment later a shadowy figure opened the flap cursing in the enemys tongue now now in the same instant the figure opened the canvas and the gryphon leapt skan used the mans shoulders as a vault crushing the mans face against the back of the wagon from his momentum he snapped his wings open catching the edges as the human crumpled underneath him then a deafening sound exploded around them as the wagons massive final trap was set offa crimson circle of fire spread across the ground incinerating the human catching the other wagon a thrashing body was engulfed in the flame arcing from it as skandranon gained altitude the makaar roused end of your charmed life gryphon at least now you can cast freely before you die find her wherever she is accomplish that at least skans wings rowed at the air clutching for distance from the camp there was one thing yet to do before his conscience would let him leave somewherehis mind searched through the camp and town for wherethere was one of his own kind being killed slowly he searched and found her tortured mind as he crested the ridge it felt as if her body had been lanced deep by thousands of needles cut on by a hundred mad surgeons broken by mallets yet still she lived there was a wrenching moment as skans mind reeled from the backlash of what had been done to her and he felt his wings fold involuntarily kill me she screamed stop them somethinganything open up to me skan sent to her open up to me and trustthere will be pain at first then all will be dark youll fly again as urtho wills she halted her scream as she recognized the code sign for the deathspell no one had made a move to block it yet he pulled back from her for a bare second trying to steady himself in his flight he reached out again riding the wind then unleashed the spell caught her mind pulled it free of her body for one gutwrenching second the spell struck home and stopped her heart iam sorry so sorry you will fly again after the dark then he released her spirit to the winds somewhere in the captured inn a bound and wingcut body convulsed then lay still above the valley skandranon raced away desperately unable to cry out for her as seven makaar surged skyward to destroy him at last the general slept amberdrake started to rise then sank back down to his seat on the side of the generals bed as corani woke convulsively with a tiny gasp the anguish was still there filling the room palpable even to the weakest empath for an empath as strong as amberdrake the impact of coranis pain was a blow to the heart amberdrake waited for the general to speak while radiating warmth and reassurance concentrating on the soothing scents still flavoring the air as a vehicle for that reassurance the gentle hint of amber incense the chamomile in the oils he had used in his massage the jessamine covering the taste of sleepherbs in the tea hed given corani he ignored the throbbing pain in his own temples his tensionknotted stomach and the terrible sense of foreboding that had come upon him at the generals summons his feelings did not matter he was a kestrachern and his clientmore patient than client as was often the caseneeded him he must be the strong one the rock to rest against he did not know corani well that was all to the good often men of power found it easier to unburden themselves to a stranger than to a friend the generals suite was in urthos keep and not in a tent in the camp easy enough here to pull heavy curtains to shut out the light and the world with it to burn dim scented lamps that invoked a feeling of disassociation from the armed camp beyond the keep the general himself had not summoned amberdrake the few times he had called to the camp for a kestrachern it had been riannon silkedre he had wantedslightly inferior to amberdrake in skill an accomplished and wellrespected female no one of urthos aides had come to the tentquietly with his livery hidden beneath a cloak which said more about the aides visit than the boy himself did urtho was still closeted with his general when amberdrake arrived but when he finally returned to his quarters he did not seem surprised to see amberdrake there he was clearly distraught and yet it had taken amberdrake hours and every bit of his skill to persuade him to unburden himself and he knew why urtho had chosen him and not riannon there were times when it was easier for a man to reveal his pain to a manand amberdrake was utterly trustworthy whatever was revealed to him remained with him forever he was many things to many people tonight he had been something of a healer something of a priest something of a simple noncommittal ear you must be disappointed the general said into the lamplit dimness his voice resigned you must think im a weakling now that was what corani said amberdrake being what he was heard what corani meant he was really saying i must disgust you for falling apart like this for looking so poorly composed and you must despise me and think me unworthy of my position no amberdrake replied simply to both the spoken and unspoken assertions he did not want to think what the generals collapse meant to him personally he must not think of it must not remember the messengers that roused the camp last night the premonitions that had awakened the more sensitive and marginally gifted among the healers and kestrachern from nightmares of blood and fire against the outline of the mountains must not think of the fact that coranis family came from laisfaar at stelvi pass and that while his sons had posts with the army here his wife and all his relatives were back there there where skandranon had gone he and gesten did not know why or for what reason amberdrake only knew that he had gone off without a farewell no amberdrake repeated taking the generals outflung hand before corani could reclaim it and massaging the palm and fingers carefully the muscles felt cramped and tight coranis hand was cold how could i be that stupid you are human and mortal we are the sum of our weak moments and our strong everyone has a moment at which he must break this one was yours it is no shame to need help and know it somewhere deep inside he wondered if it was also his there was pressure building inside him that threatened to break free at any moment he was not so selfconfident that he thought he could do without help the question was would there be any there for him too many battered spirits to mendtoo many bruised bodies to comfortthe resources of healers and kestrachern alike were stretched and overstretched that he was near the end of his reserves made little difference far too many of his clients had gone out to battle and had not returned and skan had been due back this morning it had been near sunset when the aide left him in coranis quarters skan was never overdue but for now this moment he must put his own strain aside none of that must showhe shouldnt let it break his concentration or his focus corani came first corani must be comforted enough given enough reinforcing as if he were a crumbling wall that he could function and come to heal something had gone wrong terribly wrong at stelvi pass corani had not told him what but amberdrake knew with dreadful certainty stelvi pass had been overrun laisfaar and coranis family with it was no more it would be better for them to be dead than in maars hands unless theyd hidden their identities and vanished into the general population and that was unlikely corani accepted this as wise generals accepted all facts corani had accepted amberdrakes comforting as well for the moment anyway that was another of amberdrakes abilities it bought time time to bring distance time to heal my sons i think that urtho has seen to them as well amberdrake replied quickly urtho would have seen to everything it was his way skan quickly he suppressed the thought and the anguish it caused the drugs in the generals tea took effect in the dim light corani struggled to keep his eyes open eyes still red and swollen from weeping the general had fought those tears fought to keep them properly held inside with the determination that had made him the leader he was amberdrake had fought his determination with a will of his own that was no less stubborn its time to sleep amberdrake said quietly corani blinked but held him with an assessing gaze im not certain what i expected when i saw you here he said finally based on riannon what riannon gave you was what you needed then amberdrake replied gently touching the generals shoulder what i do is what you need now sometimes neither is what the recipient expects he laid a soothing hand on coranis forehead that is what a kestrachern does after all gives you what you need and not necessarily what i want corani said quickly amberdrake shook his head no general not necessarily what you think you want your heart knows what you want but often your head has some other idea it is the task of the kestrachern to ask your heart and not your head what you need and answer that need corani nodded his eyelids drooping you are a strong man and a good leader general corani amberdrake continued but no man can be in two places at the same time you could not be here and there as well you cannot anticipate everything the enemy will do nor where he will strike the war thinks its own way you are not answerable for the entire army you did what you could and you did it well the muscles of coranis throat tightened visibly as he fought for control amberdrake sensed tears being forced down corani was on the verge of more than tears he was on the verge of a breakdown this would accomplish nothing worse than nothing the man needed rest and with amberdrakes hand resting on his forehead he was open to amberdrakes will you must sleep kestrachern amberdrake said imposing a mental command on top of the drugs corani closed his eyes and this time he did not reawaken when amberdrake rose to go gesten would be where he had been since dawn at the landing field waiting for skandranon to return amberdrake left the keep slipping unobtrusively out into the scarlet of a spectacular sunset the landing field was not far away and amberdrake decided to head there rather than going straight back to his tent depression weighed heavily on his heart a depression that was not relieved at the sight of gesten alone on the field patiently making preparations to wait out the nightwatch amberdrake held his peace for a moment then spoke hes not coming back this time amberdrake said quietly his hertasi companion gesten looked up at him with his expressive eyes and exhaled through his nostrils he held his pebblescaled snout shut for a long minute hell come he always does gesten finally said somehow amberdrake wished with all his heart that the little hertasi would be right this time skandranon had flown from the tower two days before and stelvi pass was less than a day away flying he had never been delayed by so much before gesten was going about the task of building a watchfire for their friend laying out colored smokepots amidst the kindling it might be a useless gesture but it was all he could really do right now with dawn so far away light up a pattern of blue and white to welcome the flyer home let him know from afar that safety was close amberdrake tried to help but he was awkward and his heart wasnt in it how odd that one so graceful in his calling could be so clumsy outside it urtho has called a council that much was common knowledge no harm in telling the hertasi now two gryphons came streaking in from laisfaar straight to the tower and two hours after that urtho sent a message ordering me to tend general corani gesten nodded apparently taking amberdrakes meaningthat corani needed the peculiar skills of a kestrachern the general had been permanently assigned to the pass until urtho needed him more than his home district did for the last week hed been at the tower pleading with urtho for some special protection for stelvi pass and the town that much was common knowledge too what can you tell me gesten knew very well that there was only so much amberdrake could reveal to him what did corani need amberdrake paused searching for the right word he needed sympathy gesten he said as he laid down a stack of oily fire fuel logs something happened in the tower that he didnt want to talk about and i can only assume that from the way he acted the news was the worst kept talking about blind spotshe was near to a breakdown thats not like him and now skandranon is late amberdrake smoothed his silk caftan brushing the wood chips away he felt worry lines creasing a face even his enemies called handsome but he was too depressed to care absently he pulled his long hair back from where it had fallen astray i dont think hes coming back this time i can feel it in my gut gesten picked up a small log and pointed it up at amberdrake he will be back i feel it in my gut drake and i wont put up with your whining about poor skan he always comes back always understand and ill be here with this watchfire until either he comes back or this army runs out of firelogs amberdrake stepped back thoroughly chastised and more than a little surprised at the vehemence of the normally quiet lizards speech gesten stood pointing the stick at him for a moment more then spit at the air and threw it on the growing stack of kindling im sorry gesten though he meant he was sorry about angering the hertasi gesten would probably take it some other way its just that you know how i feel about him feh i know everyone knows you seem to be the only one who doesnt know the hertasi opened the latch on the firebox and withdrew a coal with blackened tongs his tail lashed as he spoke you worry about everything drake and you dont listen to yourself talking there is no one in urthos service who is better than him no one else more likely to come back gesten dropped the coal into the folds of cotton batting and woodchips between the two smokepots even if he doesnt come back hell have died the way he wanted to amberdrake bit his lip gesten thought he was right as usual nothing would dissuade him nothing amberdrake could tell him would persuade him that the situation was hopeless only the things amberdrake could not tell him would do that and he was right skan had died the way he wanted to illkeep quiet until we know damned right you will now go back to your tent you can manage your clients without me tonight gesten turned his attention to lighting the center fire then the blue and white smokepots blazed into light amberdrake walked in the cooling night air toward the tower and the semimobile city that clustered around it stopping once to look back at the lonely figure whod wait for all eternity if need be for the black gryphons return his heart already heavy was a burden almost too great to bear with the added weight of tears he dared not shed oh not now i dont need this skandranon struggled against gravity and rough air jaws clenched tightly on his prize his heart was beating hard enough to burst from his chest and the chase had barely begunthe makaar behind him were gaining and he was only now past the ridge as if it werent enough that makaar were quicker than gryphons they possessed better endurance all they had to do was cut him off and fly him in circles that was clearly what they intended to do his advantage was his ability to gain and lose altitude more quickly than they with cleverness he could make them react not act at least they werent terribly well organizedit wasnt as though kili was leading them skandranon twisted his head to assess his pursuers and spotted an alltoofamiliar black and white crestkili the old makaar leader skan had taunted numerous times kili who had almost trapped him once before with a much smaller force aflight was streaking to a pitch a thousand feet above the other six screaming commands three graypatched makaar canted wings back and swept into a shallow dive gaining on him all the faster by trading height for speed their trajectory took them below and past him a few seconds laterand they were followed by another three he tried to watch them all eyes darting from one to the other as they split off and rejoined why head below him when altitude was so important against a gryphon altitudedamn instinct took over even as he realized kilis gambit he folded his right wing completely rolling sideways in midair as the elder makaar streaked past him by a featherlength a shrill scream of rage rang in his ears as kili missed and skan threw himself out of the roll by snapping his wing open again and spiraling nosefirst toward the earthand the six makaar there that bastardhe had the audacity to learnfrom me skan clamped his wings tightly and plummeted through the massed makaar below him seeing the claws and razoredged beaks of the surprised makaar as a blur as he shot past he followed dead on the tail of kili the chances of surviving that move were slimhed gambled on his swiftness and the makaar did no more damage than removing a few covert feathers distance for speedlets see if they can follow this kili was so very close ahead that skan was tempted to strike at him but he couldnt afford to be distracted from his primary objectiveto survive and escape already the two flights of makaar behind him stroked rapidly to pursue crying out in rage he passed the makaar leader who predictably took a swipe at him and lost precious speed and kilis recovery was further fouled by the wind turbulence of his passing underlings the six rowed past kili gaining on skandranon as he coursed back toward laisfaar stupid gryphon the point is to get away from this place the barrier range swept inexorably closer skandranon narrowed his concentration to the rockface before him and studied the erosion channels cut into the stone by ages past his breath turned ragged through his nares as he struggled against fatigue from the edge of his vision he saw the other makaar winging through the pass cutting an arc toward the pursuit theyll see my wings flare and assume im braking to turn or climb skan cupped his wings as he streaked in a straight line for the sheer cliffface feeling but not seeing the bloodthirsty makaar gaining on him from behind the barrier stone filled his vision as he executed his desperate move he folded his wings until their leading edges curled under him with a clap and his straining body rolled into a tumblers somersault he plummeted in a descending arc as lift abandoned him and momentum hurled him toward unforgiving stone gravity reversed itself his head snapped into his chest as he fell numbly detachedly he realized the new tiny pain in his chest was where the sharp tip of his beak had pierced it disorientation took him all he could do was keep his jaws closed as his world went black and wonder how many bones this last trick of his would break follow throughdo it bird do it he stretched his hindlegs out and fanned his tail wind rushed against the lay of his feathers as he hurtled backward in the next instant he was surrounded by shocked makaar three above three below whose attention was locked on him instead of the rock rushing to strike them from the sky its going to worklucky stupid gryphon the dizzying sensations of gravitys pull momentums throw and the rushing of blood mixed with the sound of six makaars screams and the crunch of their bodies against stone skandranons feet touched the unforgiving rock behind himand he pushed off the strange maneuver stabilized his tumble gave him the chance to spread his wings in a snap and break his fall turn it from a fall into a dive only the ground was awfully close pull up stupid bird pull up wings straining heart racing he skimmed the rock at the bottom of the cliff so close that his wingtips brushed it using his momentum to send himself shooting skyward again past the spreading stain on the rock that was all that was left of his first pursuers now get out of here idiot he reversed his course away from the pass back toward home and safetyand looked down at several hundred crossbows of course they couldnt see him except perhaps as a fleeting shadow but they knew he was up there and they only had to fill the sky with arrow bolts and rocks and one or more of them would probably hit him a quick glance to either side showed that hed been flanked by the two new flights of makaar they hemmed him in and had several gryphonlengths worth of altitude on him kili was not in sight he was probably up above somewhere waiting his only chance lay in speed if he could just get past the archers before they let fly too late from below came a whirring sound the air around him filled with a deadly reverserain of crossbowbolts and slung shot he pulled in his wings in a vain attempt to narrow the target area at first he didnt feel pain only impact out of the corner of his eye he saw a mist of his own blood as his right wing came forward on the downstroke then it crumpled then it hurt he tumbled again only nominally under control shrieking incoherently around his beakful of stolen weapon he shuddered under the impact of two more hits the pain came quickly this time but he forced himself to ignore it once again he tumbled out of control and this time there was no handy cliff to push off of he pulled in his left wing and rolled over completely righted himself still falling he dared not try and brake completely the injured wing wouldnt take it instead he extended just enough of both to turn the fall into another steep dive angled away from the battle and toward friendly territory just after his wings flared he saw kili whistle past where he had been a little farthera little farther the ground was coming up awfully fast he was over urthos territory now on the other side of the enemy lines but he could not dared not flare his wings completely his dive was a steep fast one but it was still a dive the ground had never looked so inviting or so hard ah sketi this is going to hurt two amberdrake could not sleep weary as he was there was no point in lying awake and watching the inside of his eyelids he wrapped a blanket around his shoulders and made his way down the dark aisles between the orderly tent rows to the landing field as he came out into the open away from the lights of the camp he saw that the sky to the west was a haze of silvery light from the setting moon it could not be long now a few hours at most until dawn gesten waited patiently beside his fire as he had waited all night amberdrake had left the last of his clients to join the little lizard but gesten was clearly not in any mood to talk the hertasi tended to be silent when something affected his emotions amberdrake shared that tendency in his case it was due to long selftraining for both of them it was to preserve the illusion of immutable and eternal stability it was amberdrakes duty to convey an impression of serene concernfor amberdrakes clients were always damaged in some way these days sympathy worked better than empathy more often than not clients didnt want to know their kestrachern had problems of his own since he couldnt be rid of them he mustnt let them show not even for a moment it was part of the burden or his avocation and though hed come to accept it it still caused a dull ache like a sympathy pain sympathy pain yes that was exactly what it was like the depression had worsened with every rumor every bit of camp gossip skan had never been this late in returning from a mission even gesten must know by now that he wasnt coming back he had often joked about how skan always rushed back at top speed from a mission that he couldnt be back to his rewards and admiration fast enough by now the news had leaked out of a terrible disaster at stelvi pass worse than any defeat urthos forces had faced before the reaction was not panic but amberdrake wondered if there was anyone in the ranks who guessed at what he already knew that the garrison had been overrun and wiped out completely as the night grew colder so did amberdrakes heart and wrapping his body in a spiralknit blanket over his silks didnt help at all gesten still hadnt spoken finally he could bear it no longer without a word he left his place beside the watchfire and walked away into the darkness looking back over his shoulder at the little spot of light and the patient figure hunched beside it his heart ached and his throat threatened to close with tears he feared to shedfeared because once they began he was not certain he would be able to stop them tears for gestenand for skan wherever he was waiting out in the darkness for someone who wasnt going to come home wasnt going to accomplish anything the war went on no matter who grieved amberdrake like so many kaledain had long been thinking of the war as a being of its own with its own needs plans and hungers those who chose to obey its will and those who found themselves swept along in its path had to go on living and pursuing their dreams even if it did feel as if they were constantly trying to bail a leaky boat with their bare hands the skills amberdrake possessed would be needed regardless of whether the war raged on or ebbed people would always feel pain loneliness instability doubt strain he had long ago resigned himself to the responsibility of caring for those who needed him nocaring for those who needed his skills they didnt necessarily need him they needed his skills it was that realization too that chilled his heart and had caused him to leave the smokywhite pyre gesten had only his duties to amberdrake and to the black gryphon and amberdrake could do without him for a while gesten clearly intended to keep his watch no matter what amberdrake required of him amberdrake on the other hand always had his duties and right now he felt terribly horribly lonely after all once youve given up a large slice of yourself to someone and theyre suddenly gonehow else could you feel hed never had a magical bond to the black gryphon nothing that would let him know with absolute certainty if skandranon were alive or dead so he only had his reasoning and the known facts and they pointed to the loss of a friend a trusted one he neared the camp he entered the lighted areas of the camp fixed a frozen slight smile on his face and checked his walk to ensure it conveyed the proper confidence and the other more subtle cues of his profession there were few folk awake at this time of the nightor rather morningbut those few needed to be reassured if they saw him a frowning healer was a bad omen an unhappy kestrachern often meant that one of his clients had confided something so grave that it threatened the kestracherns proverbial stabilityand since amberdrake was both those things anything other than serenity would add fuel to the rumors already flooding the camp and for amberdrake to be upset would further inflame the rumors as long as he was in a public place he could never forget who and what he was even though his face ached and felt stiff from the pleasant expression he had forced upon it urtho kept an orderly camp with tents laid out in rows every fifth row lighted by a lantern on a perchingpole anyone who happened to see amberdrake would be able to read his expression clearly it must look as if nothing had changed in the past few hours and yet before he could do anyone else any good he was going to have to deal with his own sorrows his own fears and pain he knew that as well as he knew the rest of it he strode into the healers bivouac his steps faltering only once there was a distant part of him that felt ashamed at that little faltering step he attributed that feeling to his tumultuous state of mindhadnt he soothingly spoken to others that there was no shame in such things still help was not far offif he asked for it it was his right of course he was entitled to counsel and healing and all of the skills of his own profession he wished he had taken comfort in such ways before and had given it many times and though a small internal voice might echo words of weakness from the walls of his mindtell him to just hold it in not to succumb to the strain he was not too proud to ask for that help not at this point not when he was a mass of raw nerves and trembling on the edge of a breakdown he had seen the signs of such things too often not to recognize them in himself in tents and shacks he passed small lanterns or lightstones illuminated solitary figures they carved surgical instruments or sewed torn clothing and bandages the surreal acoustics of the still night made an old healers worktime whistling seem louder than it should be as he cut and assembled arm slings by lantern light apparently oblivious to the world outside his opened tent on perches by the surgery tent messengerbirds slept with their heads tucked under softfeathered wings with kyree sleeping soundly in front of them the soft jingling of hanging harness and tackle sounded like windchimes from a tranquil garden how odd that such poignant moments could still occur even in the middle of upheavals healer tamsin and his lover and coworker lady cinnabar were on night duty for the next ten days or so he should be able to find them inside the surgery tent there past the healers and surgeons tents on the little rise ahead of him called healers hill stood the common tents being used for infirmaries and treatment centers several of the tents had been used in happier days to hold kaledain celebrations and had the capacity of housing a hundred or more their colors had been allowed to discreetly fade over the years since their current uses were anything but festive lights in the central tent and shadows moving inside it told him that someone at least was there he pushed aside the flap and moved quietly inside and found tamsin and cinnabar bandaging a middleaged landscout surrounded by tables bearing the debris of a thorough patching job a mercenary amberdrake caught sight of the badge on his shoulder and recognized the wolfhead of pedrons wolves urtho was very careful about the mercenaries he hired and the wolves had a particularly good reputation even the gryphons spoke well of them even skan had spoken well of sketi drake youre fixated its a downward spiral and its got to be brokenbefore you are he sagged against a tent brace and hid his face in the shadows as he lost control over his expression he wanted to be within sensing distance but he also didnt want to be obtrusive he shielded as much of his grief as he could but these were fellow healers empathsand the closest friends he had next to gesten and skan tamsin didnt look his way but amberdrake sensed his attention and in the next moment he said to the mercenary youll do well enough fireeater what you need now is some rest limit your activity to complaining for a few days heres your green chit for days off he signed the wooden square with a silverrod and handed it off three days and six more at light duty now tamsin looked up as if noticing amberdrake for the first time and added quietly i think i have a friend in need of a little help himself at the moment the merc looked up caught sight of amberdrake standing in the shadows and grunted thankee master tamsin i spect youll send me the charge eh tamsin laughed at the tired old joke and the mercenary shuffled off passing amberdrake with a nod and pushed through the tent flap into the warm dark beyond amberdrake laid himself down on the cot the scout had just vacated disregarding the binding of the silk caftan against his body as he rolled over he threw his arms over his eyes hand bunched into a fist a fist was a sign superstitiously avoided among healers as being bad luck but his mind was not on wards and omens he heard the sounds of hands being washed and toweled dry and instruments being laid back in trays minutes passed without a word and the afterhealing cleanup was concluded he heard a curtain being drawn around them for privacy the rumors about stelvi are truethe truths probably worse than youve heard he said to the waiting silence and skandranon didnt make it back he felt one hand lightly touch his cheek felt someone else take his hand both touches released the flood of grief he had pent up within him and lost in the dark waters of mourning he couldnt tell which of the two was touching him focus wavered in his mind it didnt matter which of the two touched him where what mattered was that they did he welcomed them both tears threaded their way down his face soaking the hair at his temples the knot in his throat choked further speech dont mourn for one who might still be alive tamsin chided gently wait until you know but they both knew that if skandranon were able hed have made it back by now or somehow have sent a message tamsin made a swallowing sound as if he had stopped himself before he said anything stupid i think its the fact that we dont know lady cinnabar said as amberdrake fought for control drake we love him too you knowbut weve seen too many times when people weve given up as lost made it back skandranon has never failed a mission in his life amberdrake cried half in anger half in grief if he didntif he couldnt the rest was lost in tears as he finally stopped trying to control himself and simply let himself weep the cot creaked as two weights settled beside him one of them kissed his forehead the other embraced him and he buried his face in the proffered shoulder as a wave of compassion and reassurance spread from both of them this is too much he sobbed bitterly as whoever was holding him rocked him a little like a child waiting here waiting to see who comes back in pieceswho doesnt come back at all not being there when theyre hurt and dying we know tamsin murmured a world of sorrow in his own voice we know but you dont know the rest of itrewarding the ones who survive when inside i cry for the ones who didnt there was nothing they could say to that im sick of detaching myself he burst out in another flood of tears they come to me to forget their pain but when am i allowed to mourn there was no spoken answer for that since they were the answer they simply held him while he wept held him and tried to give him the little comfort they had finally after he had cried himself out in their arms he was able to talk a little more calmly drake youve heard it all before cinnabar said as tamsin got up to retrieve a damp cloth for amberdrake but ill tell you again we are here to help you just as you help others youve been bearing up through all this better than anyone else no one has ever seen you lose control but you dont have to be superhuman i know that he said exhausted by his bout of emotion gods thats exactly what i just got through saying to someone else tonight but ive never felt like this before its skandranon this timehe was my constant i always knew hed be all right that it was safe to love him because i never thought id lose him he never comes back with anything worse than a lost tailfeather cinnabar smoothed amberdrakes damp hair back from his forehead with the cool cloth cool as winter skies as the ache in his heart struck him once again nowjust losing himi cant bear it it hurts too much early morning sounds muffled by the cloth and canvas of the tent punctuated the talk wasnt it too early yet for all of that maybe time had simply gotten away from them maybe that was the next lesson in all of thisthat no matter how amberdrake felt all would still go on without him still tamsin settled on the other side of him as cinnabar captured his hands in hers theres nothing i can say that you dont already know tamsin said quietly you have a harder task than wea double burden we have flesh to make whole again you have hearts and minds to heal as well the only comfort i can offer is to say you arent alone we hurt too skan is our friend and he the noise outside didnt settle to the dull murmurs of daybreak instead it kept rising it sounded in fact as if a small riot was approaching the surgery tent a pang of what have i done now struck amberdrake in his selfpitying state but left when reason returned a heartbeat later amberdrake pushed the cloth away from his eyes and sat upjust as a painfilled shriek ripped through the predawn air shattering his eardrums and ensuring that all three healers had their full attention taken by the noise outside what in tamsin leapt to his feet cinnabar beside him just as the tent flap flew open and the mob shoved its way inside in the center of the mob was an unholy mating of gryphon and brush pile all liberally mired in mud amberdrake would not have recognized it as skandranon except for the black feathers and the incredible vocabulary of halfdelirious curse words he rolled off the cot and to his feet as gesten directed the litter teamfor there was a litter under all that messto get what was left of the gryphon up onto one of the surgery tables the hertasi looked around for a healer spotted tamsin and cinnabar and amberdrake behind them youll do here gesten snapped gods if he ran the army but the three healers had begun their work before he spoke tamsin getting the clattering trays of surgical instruments cinnabar calling for their assistants and amberdrake pushing aside the litter bearers to get at the injured gryphon heedless of anything else amberdrake touched the black gryphon and felt skandranons pain as if it screamed through his own nerves striking him like a hammer blow to the forehead this was the drawback of working on so close a friend he shielded somewhat automatically but that pain also told him what was wrong so he dared not block it all out as cinnabars assistants scraped and washed the mud from the tangled flesh and cut branches away from broken limbs amberdrake took skandranons pain deeper into himself warning the others when they were going to cause more damage by moving something he could feel his mouth agape as he sucked in halting breaths felt his eyes widen in doublesight his mind split between seeing the physical and seeing inside it seemed an eternity before they got skandranons body free of the remains of the tree hed crashed into another eternity before they got him washed down so that they could see the external injuries clearly wordlessly the other two left the wings to amberdrake and concentrated on skans legs and body amberdrake was one of the few in camp who knew the gryphons anatomy well enough to heal wings to be flightworthy again muscle tendon bone vein all were dependent on each other in living bodiesyet in an avians body this seemed doubly true alter this and balance and weight distribution and control surface and a hundred other things would change the right wing had a crossbow wound still bleeding sluggishly the left was broken in several places amberdrake directed gesten to put pressure on the bleeding bolt wound gryphon wingbones tended to knit almost as soon as they broke like a birds and the sooner he got to the breaks the less likely that he would have to rebreak anything to set it properly skandranon whimpered a little and coughed until a fourth healer still sleepyeyed and robed from bed came to stand at his head and with one hand on either side of the huge beak willed the gryphon into slumber skandranons throat gurgled as his beak parted the wing muscles relaxed and amberdrake went to work he eased the shattered fragments of each broken bone together then held them in place with his bare hands while his mind forced the bits and pieces into the right order and prodded them into the process of knitting all the while drawing away the fluids that built up around the damage when the bone started healing he called for splints and bandages wrapped the section of wing tightly and went on to the next pausing only to wipe the drying blood from his hands before it caked so thickly it interfered drake gesten said barely making a stir in his concentration what he asked shortly all of his attention focused on getting the final bone to draw together i think youd better hurry that was all the hertasi said but it was enough he left the splinting of the final bone and the binding of the wing as a whole to one of the assistants and came around to gestens side of the table he knew with a glance why gesten had called him the sheer dead weight of the injured wing was so great that the bolt wound was tearing open and the great wing vein was perilously close to the site of the wound a fracture under that pressure could simply break wide open and sever the vein as it went quickly he directed gesten under the gryphons wing to take some of the strain off and reached out to hold the wound closed being careful not to pinch he closed his eyes and concentrated seeing the injury examining it with his inner sight bringing together the torn muscle fibers rejoining bleeding veins goading it all into the process of healing at a rate a thousand times faster than it would naturally and providing the energy the body required to do so from within himself infection threatened he burned it away ruthlessly he strengthened the rest of the muscles taking some of the strain off the injured ones when they threatened to cramp a fingers touch soothed them he found smaller broken bones wounds and cuts he had not noticed in healing the larger ones he dealt with them all searching out dangerous blood clots and filtering them from the bloodstream until the wings had been wrapped in a binding of energies that would in time allow skandranon to fly again skandranon moaned and coughed weakly as if something were caught in his throat his breathing steadied as the fourth healer pushed him back into slumber but he was taken by a fit of coughing again that caused everyone near to hold onto him tightly amberdrake was peripherally aware of tamsin putting his arm down skandranons gullet while an assistant held the beak open with a metal bar and then the badly wounded gryphon wheezed shook and fell into deep sleep again the assistants administered fortifying herbal and mineral infusions of all kinds into the gryphon while amberdrake set skandranons fractured forearms and splinted his foreclaws finally it was over and he swayed away from the table letting the assistants do their mechanical labor of bandaging and bracing he saw then that tamsin and cinnabar had already finished cinnabar was telling the litter bearers where to take skan and tamsin had disappeared the early morning sun shone brightly through the walls of the tent making them glow with a warm amber light the tables and floors were a disaster bloodhow could a flyer hold so much blood he thoughtand cutaway feathers pasted bits of bark and leaves to the floor on the table a length of a crossbow bolt lay amid the other debris next to something that was relatively cleana leatherwrapped handle of some kind perhaps a broken sword that must have been what was blocking his throat amberdrake thought numbly how would it get there amberdrake blinked once and staggered back no you dont gesten left skandranons side to go to amberdrakes getting under the kestracherns arm and bracing him upright its bed for you drake skans going to be finebut youd better lie down before you pass out i think youre right amberdrake murmured actually finding a chuckle somewhere skans going to be all right he made it back that was all that really mattered after all the cold place inside him had warmed the emptiness erased skan made it back with gestens help he tottered off down the slight slope to the kestracherns portion of the camp just beyond the healers he was so tired he hardly noticed when he was guided into his own tent except that the bright light of the morning sun dimmed and the cool fresh air took on a tinge of incense and bodyscent that was when he pulled away from gesten staggered to his bed and collapsed across it he managed to position himself the right way but after that he knew nothing more amberdrake felt skandranons pain and frustration as he awoke even afterhow manyhours of needed oblivion there was a dull ache in amberdrakes body in all the places hed helped heal in skandranons body the night before in all the places that amberdrake didnt have a direct analog tothe wings and tail especially the wingsthere was an ache it was an aftershock effect that healers knew well and had to live with in the case of the wing pain it bunched in amberdrakes shoulder blades and upper arms like a bruised muscle cramping to the bone amberdrake had awakened feeling as if he had run for days carrying a full pack as if he had worked for two days without a rest in short as if he had served his full roster of clients then healed a gravely injured gryphon gestenloyal competent gestenhad drawn the sleepingcurtains to block as much light as possible from reaching the exhausted kestrachern and was no doubt away from the tent clearing amberdrakes schedule of responsibilities amberdrake pulled the blankets from himself and stood up steadying himself on a ring set into the oversized bed frame he washed quickly and gulped down a meal of meat strips and flatbread then pulled on the caftan and belt gesten had laid out for him by his clothes was a rostersheet of appointments for the day all but one had been crossed out and that one was not due for another two hours amberdrake stepped out from the spellquieted canvas of his multiroomed tent into the afternoon daylight of the camp messengerbirds shot past brightly colored calling their descending chittering cry while smoke from cookfires scented the air they flew through three laughing children ran by wearing the green and yellow ribbons of their parents cadre chased by a playful kyree with a bright red ball in its mouth this was the way life should be amberdrake stretched then ran a hand across his chin and cheeks as he squinted in the light time to shave again before serving that client a thorough general grooming was in order after he insured that skandranon was healing properly being immaculately groomed always made him feel better he threaded his way through the shacks forges and service huts to the great tent where hed left the black gryphon languishing that morning in the daytime the camp was far more inviting despite the tension that was apparent everywhere you looked assistant healers and surgery aides surged past amberdrake as he stepped inside all intent on taking care of small administrative tasks and stocking supply shelves while the luxury of time was theirs casualties could course in like an overwhelming wave at any moment so any spare minutes had to be spent in preparation the war hadnt left the healers much time to rest they and the grave diggers body burners and clergy had few hours of leisure time that was the nature of a war after all it ate spirits and bodies it fed like any other creature war forced individuals and species together in ways no peacetime situation would duplicate and some of the oddest friendshipseven lovescame out of that amberdrakes affection for gesten was natural given the long association that hertasi had with the kaledain only the war and the needs of the fighters for support personnel had prevented amberdrake from acquiring an entire troop of the little lizardfolk as it was he had to share gestens services with skandranon but the bond between himself and the black gryphonthat was something that would never have occurred in peaceful times the gryphons were literally unnaturalcreations of urtho the mage of silenceand they would never have been found near the rolling plains that the nomadic kaledain called home at least not in amberdrakes lifetime he had heard urtho mention some kind of vague plans hed had of planting them in little aeries in some of the wilder parts of the mountains creating yet another population of nonhuman intelligences as urthos predecessors had done with the hertasi and kyree but that plan of course had come to nothing with the onset of war among the great mages urtho had tried to stay out of the conflict with the result that the conflict had come to him amberdrake wondered if he sometimes berated himself for waiting there had probably been a point early in maars career when urtho could have defeated him easily had he not stayed his hand but who could have known that war would have come to roost in maars willful head urtho couldnt be blamed for not bottling up the kiyamvir long ago there were little joys amid all the pain and some of those joys could come from the bindings of affection that just sprang up like wildflowers in a battlefield amberdrake sighed a little he loved skan as much as if he and the gryphon had been raised in the same nest in the same home but he wondered now if skan felt anything more than simple friendship it was hard to read the gryphon the raptorial features reflected emotion in far more subtle ways than say a kyrees mobile face and skan waswell skan he often kept his deepest feelings to himself covering them with jokes and pranksor complaints and feigned irritation if he felt affection for someone he was just as likely to mock him as praise him caring for the gryphon certainly had its drawbacks amberdrake made his way quietly and unobtrusively through the rows of smaller tents housing the recovering wounded there was a special section for gryphons an array of tents with reinforced frames built to be used for traction to keep any of the gryphons four limbs or two wings immobile he spotted gesten leaving one of the tents just as the hertasi saw him gesten looked uncommonly cheerful all things considered his eyes twinkled with good humor and he carried his tail high his royal highness has one demon of a headache and he says hes too nauseous to eat gesten reported cinnabar says thats because hes got a concussion and his highness irritated his throat with the thingummy he stuffed into his crop and since i couldnt get him to eat anything she wants you to try amberdrake nodded what was that thing he tried to swallow he asked it kept intruding on my dreams last night gesten ducked his head in a shrug some magical weapon urtho sent him after the hertasi said indifferently there was a big fuss over it after i got you to bedhalf the mages in the tower came looking for it when himself found out skan had been carried in one of em woke tamsin and tried to dress him down for not reporting it right away amberdrake noticed the careful use of the word tried i take it that tamsin gave him an earful gesten chuckled happily and bobbed his head it was a pleasure and a privilege to hear he said with satisfaction it was almost as good as you do when someone gets to you hmm amberdrake shook his head so it was some kind of mageweapon well i suppose well never know the whole truth of the matter it occurred to him that this weapon whatever it was may have been the reason that laisfaar had been taken or it might have been the single factor that made its loss possible which made it imperative for skan to have found one and gotten it back so that urthos mages could create a counteragent if skan knew that he wouldnt reveal it the less anyone knew the better really it was terribly easy for a spy to move through urthos campprecisely because urthos people as a whole were far less ruthless than their counterparts on maars side of the conflict and camp gossip as he had seen last night spread as quickly as flame in oilsoaked tinder amberdrake had long since resigned himself to the fact that he was going to overhear and accidentally see a million tantalizing details that would never make sense that too was in the nature of his profession anyway if you can get his grumpiness i heard that came a low growl from the patient behind the tent flap his contrariness to eat something i can get the place ready for your next client gesten concluded smoothly amberdrake chuckled i think i can manage for one thing now that i know his throat is irritated i can do something about that dont strain yourself gesten warned as he pulled back the tent flap to go inside he isnt your only charge and he isnt even paying that last had to have been added for skandranons benefit the gryphon only raised his chin off his bandaged forearms a moment and said with immense dignity and a touch of ill temper i ssshould think thisss sssort of thing came underrr the heading of jussst rewarrrd for a missssion sssatisssfactorilly completed i would agree with you amberdrake said absently noting that skandranon was pointedly rolling his sibilants for emphasssisss skandranons diction was as crisp as any humans when he wanted it to be amberdrake extended his finelyhoned senses and found nothing more amiss than healing bones healing wounds andyes a healing concussion hows the head he asked conversationally letting his awareness sink into the area of skans throat and crop soothing the irritation caused by the foreign object skan had inadvertently swallowed it was something of a truism that a gryphon could not store anything in the crop that was bigger than he could successfully swallow but that did not mean that the object in question would be a comfortable thing to store particularly if it was angular and unyielding as amberdrake thought he remembered the head isss missserable thank you the gryphon replied with irritation i ssshould think you could do ssssomething about it sorry skan amberdrake replied apologetically i wish i couldbut im not a specialist in that kind of injury i could do more harm than good by messing about with your head he exerted a touch of healing energybeing careful not to overextend himself he hadnt needed gestens warning on that score hed run himself into the ground once already if he did it again he was asking for trouble and it generally took two or more healers to fix what a stupid healer did to himself in a moment the heat that meant soreness and irritation to amberdrake faded and died from skans throat and the gryphon swallowed experimentally well i suppose you arent going to go away unless i eat something skan said without a sign of any kind of gratitude so id better do it and get you out of here so i can sleep amberdrake didnt make any comments he simply held out handsized pieces of fresh red meat for skan to swallow whole like all gryphons skan preferred his food to be fresh killed as fresh as possible although he could and would eat dried or prepared food and actually enjoyed breads and pastries gesten had left a large bowl of the meat chunks amberdrake didnt stop handing them to the gryphon until the bowl was empty even though skan looked as if he would have liked to take a piece of amberdrakes hand with his meal amberdrake tried not to let his feelings get hurt hed seen this kind of thing often enough in other cases of those who had been extremely active and had been forced by injuries to depend even a little on others skan had been completely immobilized by his injuries and couldnt even use his forelegs add to that the pounding of his concussionheadache and he really wasnt behaving too badly all things considered but on the other hand amberdrake was a friend and skan was treating him in ways that he wouldnt have inflicted on an indentured servant some of this must have shown in amberdrakes expression for just as the last strip of raw meat went down skans throat gesten returned took one look at the two of them and proceeded to give skan a lecture on gratitude youd think that the smartest gryphon in urthos army would have a mudcakes sense wouldnt you he railed youd think that same gryphon might recall amberdrake putting his wings together for him until drake fell over with exhaustion youd think that same gryphon might possibly remember that drake would be feeling phantom pain this afternoon from all that healing but no gesten snorted that takes common sense and common courtesy so when drake isnt sitting here right by the tent waiting for a certain gryphon to wake up that gryphon pouts and thinks nobody loves him and then acts like a spoiled brat when drake does show up even before hes had a shave skan couldnt possibly have looked worse but his eartufts which had been lying fairly close to his head now flattened against his skull and the gryphon looked distinctly chagrined and penitent silence followed gestens lecture as the hertasi gave skan his you messed up glare and skan sighed drake the gryphon said softly i am sssorry i have been verrry rrrude i amberdrake knew this mood skan was likely to keep apologizing for the next candlemarkand perversely getting more irritating and irritable with every word of apology skan its all right amberdrake said hastily you havent been any ruder than some of my clients after all im used to it he managed a weak chuckle im a pretty rotten patient myself when im sick just ask gesten the hertasi rolled his eyes but said nothing so dont worry were just glad youre back however many pieces you came back in amberdrake slid his hand in among the neckfeathers and scratched places where he knew skan had not been able to reachand would not for some time the gryphon sighed and put his head back down on his bandaged and splinted forelegs you arrre too patient drrrake actually if i dont get him moving hes going to be too late gesten interjected apparently mollified by the apology youve got a client kestrachern and youre going to have to make up for the fact that you had to cancel out all your morning appointments right amberdrake gave skans neck a final scratch and stood up brushing out the folds of his robe and id better shave and clean up first how much time have i got not much for the grooming you need gesten replied youd better put some speed on it a little later amberdrake wondered why hed bothered this was not one of his usual clients and he had not known what to expect but he could have been a wooden simulacrum for all the man looked at him he was a mercenary mage one of the hireons that urtho had taken as his own allies and apprentices proved inadequate to take on all the mages that maar controlled while he was probably a handsome man it was difficult to tell that at the moment his expression was as rigid and unreadable as a mask and his needs were to be blunt basic in fact if he wanted what he said he wanted he need not have come to amberdrake for it he could have gone to any of the first or secondrank kestrachern in the cadre and spent a great deal less money the illusion of grace and luxury relaxation pamperingand the inevitable a kestrachern was not a bedmateforhire although plenty of people had that impression this mage included if that was all he wanted there were plenty of sources for that including if the man were up to it actually winning the respect of someone amberdrake was tempted to send him away for just that reason this was in its way as insulting as ordering a master cook to make oatmeal but as he had told the general as every kestrachern must he had learned over the years that what a client asked for might not be what he wantedand what he wanted might not even be something he understood that was what made him the expert he was when a few quiet questions elicited nothing more than a growled order to just do your job amberdrake stood up and surveyed the man from a position of superior height i cant do my job to your satisfaction if youre a mass of tension he countered sternly and whats more i cant do it to my satisfaction now why dont we just start with a simple massage he nodded at the padded table on the brighter side of the chamber and the mage reluctantly rose and even more reluctantly took his place on it gesten appeared as if amberdrake had called him and deftly stripped the man down and put out the oils amberdrake chose one scented with chamomile and infused with herbs that induced relaxation then began with the mages shoulders with a healers hands he sought out and released knots of tensionand as always the release of tension released information about the source of the tension its winterhart the man said with irritation shes started pulling away from me and damned if i know why i just dont understand her anymore but i told her that if she wasnt willing to give me satisfaction i could and damned well would go elsewhere for it amberdrake surmised from the feelings associated with the womans name that winterhart was this fellows loveror at least he thought she was odd for that kind of name was usually worn by one of the kaledain and yet he seldom saw kaledain associating intimately with those of other races so why did you come here amberdrake asked prodding a little at the knot of tangled emotions as he prodded at the knotted muscles why not someoneless expensive the man grunted because the whole army knows your name he replied everyone in our section will know i came here this afternoon and there wont be any question why very tangled emotions he mused because although the top layer was a desire to hurt by going publicly to a notoriousor famed depending on your viewskestrachern underneath was a peculiar and twisted desire to flatter as if by going only to the best and most expensive he was trying to say to winterhart that nothing but the best would remotely be a substitute for her and another layerin doing so he equated her to a paid companion thereby once again insulting her by counting her outside his personal deeper emotional life still there was that backhanded flattery amberdrake was not a bedmate for hire he was a kestrachern a profession which was held in high regard by urtho and most of the commandcircle among the kaledain he was the next thing to a goddesstouched priest the word itself had connotations of divine insight and soul healing and of friendship so then there was wishful thinkingor again the desire to impress this winterhart whoever she was there were more mysteries than answers no matter where he turned these days you do know that what happens in this tent depends upon what i decide is best for you dont you he asked just to set the record straight if all the man wanted was exhausting exercise let him go elsewhere for it amberdrake was massaging the mans feet using pressure and heat to ease twinges all through the body without resorting to any actual healing powers amberdrake had detractors who thought he worked less because of his power to heal flesh and soothe nerves his predecessors had used purely physical learned skillslike this massagefor generations driven by sharp senses and a clear mind in his role as kestrachern he used his healing gifts only when more conventional skills were ineffective still one did complement the other and he would use the whole of his abilities if a client warranted it so far though this mere hadnt warranted it he hadnt even warranted the kind of services he would get from a perchi this was still at the level of banterandpose well urrgh id heard that he said it as if he hadnt quite believed it if you arent satisfied with that i can suggest the name of a perchi or two accustomed to those of rank amberdrake ventured there was no point in having the man angry he was paying for expensive treatment and if he felt he hadnt gotten his moneys worth he might attempt to make trouble what you do ah isnt important now is it the mage replied shrewdly its what winterhart thought you did you are required to keep this confidential that much i know so ill let her use her imagination itll probably be more colorful anyway amberdrake was tempted at that point to send the man away he was right what he was planning was also very cruel to his lover assuming she didnt deserve it she might he could have no way of knowing amberdrake sighed there was still his professional pride he decided to give the man his moneys worthand to make certain that as it progressed as little of it as possible was what the client had anticipated three i hope thats all for tonight gesten amberdrake said as the curtain dropped behind him he rubbed the side of his nose with his knuckle and sighed im exhausted that last client wanted a softhammermassage and an argument roster indicated a gentle counseling session thats all youve got for the night gesten replied a bit smugly the last two made up for all the clients you canceled this morning since they were straightpay and not rewardchits id have warned you if id known about the last he didnt say anything about the hammers id have had them warmed and ready for you if id known he was pretty closemouthed im not complaining youd probably have sent him elsewhere if he had said anything im certain he would have made it into an insult somehow amberdrake didnt elaborate the last two clients had been to be charitable annoying and since gesten always discreetly monitored the workroom he was probably well aware of that the hertasi simply laid out a clean sleeping robe simple and unadorned unlike the robes amberdrake wore for his clients and uncovered a plate of armybread and cheese few delicacies appeared in the hands of urthos folk these days even for those who could afford them the ones amberdrake got his hands on he reserved for his clients who often responded well to gustatory pampering rumor had it that urtho himself had given up his favorite treats one thing there was no shortage of at least was water there was a hot bath waiting in the corner steam rising invitingly from the frameandskin tub thank you gesten he said with genuine appreciation amberdrake stripped off his sweatdampened silks and slipped into the bath wincing a little at the heat he was going to look as if hed been boiled in a few minutes but it would be worth it to relax his muscles he recalled as from a distant past that before they had packed up their families and herds and moved here the kaledain had created hot springs where they settled if there were none there already but much had changed magecreated hot springs required an enormous expenditure of magical energy and that was now a luxury no one could afford the war tried to eat up everything in its path for amberdrake and those who supported the warriors it was the war they fought not the army spells and makaar this was the way many of the warriors saw it toosaw war as a natural enemy to be dealt with firmly and then put behind you but wars devouring power was why urtho had tried to avoid it for so longwhy he had successfully avoided it until it came to his very doorstep folk from northern climes referred to the people of the south as civilized it had little to do with their technologies and powers but far more with their philosophyand they were as pragmatic as they might be idealistic when maars army threatened at the border opposition was there to meet it that was why amberdrakes services which in peacetime would have been divided between the wealthiest of outsiders and the needs of his own people had been volunteered to be the reward for heroes and as the very expensive indulgence for those whose egos demanded the best that thought brought him uncomfortably right back to that mere mage a man whose cold soul he had been unable to warm most of the mages in urthos forces were there because they felt urthos cause was right or because they honored urtho as one of the greatest adepts ever born and hoped to be able to learn from him as they helped to defend his land or simply because they hated maar or their own lands or overlords had been destroyed by the rapacious conqueror few fought in this army simply for the money this man conn levas was one who seemed to care only about the money he had few friends and few interests outside his own skill and power he was in fact one of the most monofocused people amberdrake had ever seen a narcissist to a high degree everything for him was centered around how he could increase his personal wealth and prestige to him the war was a convenient way to do that urtho was the master to serve because urtho gave his mages much more autonomy and better rewards than maar still it was that kind of focus that made the hunting beasts of the world so successful so perhaps he shouldnt be faulted for it but how a kaledain woman had ever become his lover amberdrake could not guess levas had at least admitted that his own coldness was a part of why this winterhart was disenchanted with him amberdrake had the feeling that such an admission that anything was due to personal fault was a major concession disenchanted now there was a thought could this mage have worked a beglamorment on the woman he couldnt have used a stronger spell since other mages would have noticed but a beglamorment at the right time would have made him what she most wanted to see she could have found her way into his bed long before she realized he wasnt what she had thought to have a kaledain lover was considered a coup by some mercs in urthos forces to have a healer as a lover even more so she might represent just another symbol of success to be acquired and why was he worrying about her he didnt even know her only that her name sounded kaledain she might not be kaledain at all there were others who took on colorful names or were given them at birth for that matter why was he worrying about conn levas the man had gotten good and ample service for his money he was unlikely to return given his uneasiness with amberdrakes probing questions amberdrake knew the merc had been disturbed by how much he had revealed well the service hed rendered was easy enough even by kestrachern standards still ifyou worry about every man and woman in the army youll tie yourself up in knots for no good reason he told himself youre making things up out of nothing then worrying about them youve never even seen this healer winterhart why work yourself into a headache oh he knew why he was worrying about them it was to keep from worrying about skan as if he didnt have enough to worry about already skandranon was grateful to be alive even more grateful to have gotten his mission completed successfully and entirely grateful to have been put back together hed been assuredrepeatedlythat he would be able to fly again but he was in constant pain his head pounded horribly and on top of all of it having to be that grateful made him want to bite this was very bad of him and he knew it which made him want to bite even more he only liked to be bad on his own terms if only he could have someone show up to see him who deserved a good scathing dressingdownthe fool who had assured urtho that stelvi pass had been in no danger for instance or the idiot who had issued the orders that grounded the gryphons between specific missions even the imbecile cook who had first sent him raw fish for breakfast instead of good red meat then had made it worse by sending yesterdays stew instead of fresh still bleeding meat but the only people who came near him were those he was supposed to be grateful tohow annoyinggesten and drake tamsin and cinnabar the members of his wing and the scouts and mercs who had risked their lives to get him home after gestens lecture he made doubly sure to convey his proper gratitude to them but he still wanted to biteso he did the camp could find another pillow somewhere now if only his beak didnt hurt there was a persistent sting from small scratches around his nares and an itch across his cere and his sinuses felt like like you hit something hard after a prolonged plummet bird it didnt help that he was forced to lie in a completely unnatural position forelegs stretched in front of him hindlegs stretched straight under him and bound by splints unable to get comfortable he knew healers could fuse the bones of a magebred creature like himself in a single session of concentrated healing he also knew that there was plenty of pain on the front lines and people in real danger of dying if they didnt get to a healer and that such a session was fairly low on the list of priorities that didnt help but much to his surprise late in the afternoon tamsin and cinnabar made an appearance at his tentand from the implements their hertasi was carrying this was no social call tamsin was in his usual simple green breeches and shirt his shortcropped blond hair and beard in stark contrast to many of the other healers who usually let their hair grow long and went clean shaven and he could not have made a better foil for the graceful and tall lady cinnabar he was as stocky and muscled as a wrestler cinnabar of course was as elegant as if she had just come from holding court her scarlet gown cut to midcalf showing scarlet leather boots and slender ankles her sleeves cut tight displaying her graceful arms without an unseemly show of flesh skandranon had heard that by human standards she was not beautiful not even handsome but her strongnosed face so like a proud falcon seemed attractive enough to him she even had a crest her hair was cut short on the sides and top so that it stood up and flowed in a braided tail down her back lovely both of them looked relatively rested and full of energy skans hopes rose were they all right old bird tamsin said cheerfully as he held the tent flap open for the laden hertasi we need to do something about those legs so you can get a proper rest think youre up to it do you think i would sssay otherwisse skan countered i would do anything anything cinnabar replied archly then at tamsins eloquently raised eyebrow she added hastily no dont answer you are the most insatiable creature i have ever met skan wanted to leer but couldnt manage it pleasssse he nearwhimpered instead by near sunset after much effort on their part and pain and cooperative effort on his the fractured bones of his forelegs fused and the hindlegs healed enough that the splints could come off and he could carefully walk a few steps he could attend to his personal needswhich was just as well since so far as he knew no one had come up with the equivalent of a chamber pot for a gryphon he would be able to feed himself and since cinnabar had blessedly done something about the headache he was ravenous now he could lie back down in a much more comfortable position to listen to his bowels rumble cinnabar looked as serene and composed now as when they had started tamsin was clearly tired but just as cheerful that should do you old bird he said slapping skan on the flank dinner first or visitor both skan replied if it isss sssomeone who cannot bearrr to watch a gryphon eat let him come back laterrr and if it iss sssomeone i do not want to sssee he will be the dinner he would not be eating little chunks of meat tonight no cinnabar and tamsin knew gryphons and unless that idiot cook mistakenly countermanded their orders there would be a nice fat haunch of something freshkilled and bloody something skan could tear into and take out some of his frustrations on maybe even half a deer or oxhe was quite hungry enough to eat either a silverbrocaded hertasi signaled from beside the canvas doorway and the other hertasi disappeared as if they had evaporated a moment later the tent flap was pushed aside to reveal a beloved and unique personage i should think i can bear to watch a gryphon eat said urtho the mage of silence he swept into the room with a single step he said nothing more but projected a soothing presence into the damp warm room it was impossible to tell urthos real age he could be sixty or six hundred for as long as skan had known him urtho had looked the same an eternal image of genius tall and thin storklike with a waistlength fall of curly silvergray hair huge gray eyes a nose as prominent as lady cinnabars and a lantern jaw kept scrupulously cleanshaven he did not look like the finest of adeptclass mages he did not look like any kind of mage he looked more like a scribe or perhaps a silversmith or retired acrobat skan thought there might be kaledain blood in urthos veins that might well be true given his nose and the longstanding association he had with them but if that were true no one had ever confirmed it in skans hearing urtho held the flap open for two hertasi bringing in the forequarters of a deer both front legs shoulders and the chest hide and all no head though but perhaps that was a bit much to ask humans were so queasy when it came to delivering a gryphons dinner with head intact never mind that the head was delicious well humans were queasy about a great many silly things skan seized the prize in his foreclaws as soon as the hertasi had laid it in front of him and tore off a mouthful of meat and hide before acknowledging the commander of one of the two largest armies that velgarth had ever seen he tossed his head and swallowed the bite whole like the raptors the kaledain bred he needed the hair and stringy hide to clean his crop join me for dinner he offered urtho laughed is that like a falcon offering to meet a mouse for lunch tamsin and cinnabar both bowed respectfully and made a somewhat hasty exit urthos power tended to overawe people who didnt know him well he nodded to them both took one of the two seats the healers had left and settled himself down onto it skandranon tore off another mouthful of meat it tasted wonderful rich and saltsweet he swallowed feeling the striations of the bloodslick muscles slither against his throat down into his crop he flicked an ear and cocked his head at his leader their gazes met and tales sped between them in the flicker of their eyes well old man i sssurvived afterrr all i hope you have it urtho nodded casually so you did and you were right when you insisted you were the one to go you did very well skan and yes i have it even though you tried to swallow it whole i wasss the only one ssstupid enough to trrry you mean skan replied trying not to preen with pride he scissored another bite out of his meal i seem to recall that you not only volunteered you insisted urtho made it a statement and a bit of a challenge skan simply grunted perhapsss he suggested teasingly after a moment your memorrry isss faulty somewhat to his surprise urtho sighed it is he said wearily ive been forgetting a great deal lately kelethen has been most impatient with me you have much to rrrememberrr skan pointed out quickly kelethen isss as fusssy as any other herrrtasssi you ssshould tell him that if he isss upssset he can jussst keep an appointment calendar asss if you werrre a kessstracherrrn sometimes i feel like a kestrachern urtho told him ruefully expected to please everyone and generally pleasing almossst everrryone skan interrupted besssidesss sssomeone hasss to lead and i am too busy what arrre you doing down herrre anyway isssnt there a weapon to invessstigate a passss to retake i am only one sssstupid grrryphon afterrr all true urtho sighed again but you are a very special stupid gryphon i was concerned and i wanted to see that you were doing as well as the healers claimed the weapon has been dealt with and a counterattack on the pass is in the hands of the commanders there is little i can do from here now that it has been launched urthos face was a little thinner and skan guessed he had not been sleeping or eating much in the past few days he could sympathize with the mage for wishing to escape from his tower for a little still i hope that sssomeone knowsss where you are kelethen does i wish that this were over or better still had never begun skandranon wiped his beak against the fur and cast his eyes supportively to urtho urtho it isss begun and continuesss we fly thessse windsss together you did not cause the windsss to become a ssstorm i would say that i had done nothing to cause this but the simple fact of our existence was enough to trigger this assault from maar ive studied him even as a young man he wanted power far more than he wanted anything else and he enjoyed having power over people urtho shook his head as if he simply could not understand anyone with that kind of mind whatever he had it was never enough it was a kind of hunger with him but one that could not be sated there could only be one master of the world and that one must be maar insssane skan replied not exactly urtho said surprising the gryphon not insane as we know the meaning of the word but his sanity holds nothing but himself if that makes any sense no skan said shortly what he had seen of maar and maars creations did not convince him that the mage of black fire was anything but evil and insane i would help him if i could urtho said softly what skan squawked every feather on end with surprise he felt very nearly the same as he had when hed hit the ground breath knocked out of him and too stunned to even think i would urtho insisted if he would even stop to think about all the harm he has caused and come to me i would help him but he will not he cannot not and still be maar he shook his head his obsessions are like mine skandranon i understand him far better than he understands me he thinks i am soft enough that at some point i will surrender because so many have died and more will die he thinks i dont realize that the killing would not end just because we had surrendered i dont think he has the barest idea what we will do to stop him there was no mistaking the grim determination in urthos voice skan relaxed for a moment he had thought that the latest turn of the conflict might have unhinged the mage he isss a mad dog skan said brusquely you do not try to help a mad dog you ssslay it harsh words my child urtho frowned a little although by now he should have been well aware of the gryphons raptorial and somewhat bloodthirsty nature skan thought of the tortured gryphons at stelvi pass and hissed not harsssh enough i did not tell you what they did to the ssstelvi wing everrrything you have everrr hearrrd of all of them down to the nessstlingsss and worsse than you could imagine urtho turned pale and skan instantly regretted what he had blurted out urtho had never wedded and had no children he considered all of his intelligent creations to be his children but that was especially true of the gryphons an awkward silence loomed between them for a moment and skan cursed his habit of blurting out the first thing he thought stupid bird you might think before you say something once in a while it would be a distinct improvement during the silence the camp sounds seemed particularly loud and intrusive people shouting to one another and somewhere nearby the hammering of metal on metal skan continued eating his hunger overcoming his manners as he thought of a way to apologize i am sorry urtho he said finally i am hungry hurt and a very irritable and stupid bird think of me as being in molt youre right skan urtho said finally youre right despite what i just said i sometimes dont think of what maar is capable of it stretches my imagination and willpower to think like maar and it isnt something ienjoy skandranon had no reply for that perhaps there was no possible reply he simply swallowed another beakful of meat well thanks to you those new weapons of his will no longer threaten us the mage continued changing the subject and what i really came here for my friend was to discover what you want as your reward you more than deserve one offspring perhaps you certainly have a high potential and any female in the wings would be happy to oblige you i would like to see the rashkae line continued the offer of the reward did not surprise skan but what urtho had called himmy friendcertainly did and yet the simple words should not have been such a revelation urtho had spent many hours talking to him not as commander to subordinate nor as master to servant nor even as creator to creationbut as equal to equal skandranon alone of the gryphons was privileged to come and go at will from urthos tower and to interrupt the mage at any time of the day or night i will think about it skan replied at the moment i ssshould be verrry glad merrrely to be healed and flying again urtho nodded as you will im sure youll think of something just please be mindful of our limited resources and the impossibility of transporting massive libraries wherever you go skan gryphongrinned urtho had not forgotten his love of books i am sssure i ssshall think of something urtho showed no disposition to rise and go his way however so skan simply continued eating while the greatest single power in their entire army spoke of camp gossip and it was in the midst of this that commander loren found them no doors to knock on existed in a tent of course but the ostentatious clearing of a throat outside the closed flap told skan that there was a visitor and one whose voice he did not recognize skan instinctively bristled all his reactions trying to force his body into readiness to protect urtho even though he was in no shape to do so urtho did recognize the voice of course it was one of those traits of his that skan could only marvel at that he knew every leader in his huge army well enough to recognize their voices urthos memory was remarkable and reputedly utterly reliable so much so that forgetting even minor things upset him you might as well come in loren urtho said immediately if its all that important that you tracked me down when commander loren pushed aside the tent flap skandranon recognized the bricklike face and body although he could not have put the proper name to the man loren was neither outstandingly good in deploying the gryphons assigned to him nor outstandingly poor at it only one or the other would have made a gryphon take notice of him so lorens first words made skan raise his head from the remains of his meal in surprise i need you to reward a gryphon lord urtho loren said apologetically and i would never have troubled you when you had so obviously gone to the effort of losing your aides except that i didnt want this one to slip through the cracks obviously this gryphon has done something exceptional urtho paused significantly very lorens beefy face reddened with pride she was on patrol in what was supposed to have been a safe sector and discovered and eliminated three makaar three makaar skan was impressed who isss flying with herrr he asked i ssshould like to know who ssset them up for herrr setting someone up for a triple kill took almost as much skill and more courage than actually making the kills thats just it black gryphon loren said face practically glowing she did it by herself alone it was supposed to be a safe area as thin as my patrols are spread we thought it was reasonable to fly safe areas in singles instead of pairs to give the younger or smaller gryphons experience without risking them too much her name is zhaneel to destroy three makaar was remarkable to destroy three at once was uncommon even among experienced frontliners who is this zhaneel he thought beak agape with surprise and why have i never heard of her before this from the dumbfounded look on his face urthos surprise was just as great as skans and that was astonishing in itself the gryphons were his favorite creations and he knew and kept track of every promising youngster yet he did not appear to know of this one you mussst bring herrr herrre skan said imperiously before urtho could speak loren looked to urtho for permission first when the mage nodded he pushed back the tent flap and stalked out into the sunsetreddened dust and activity of the camp he returned much more quickly than skan would have expected though not too soon for the gryphons impatient nature he had bolted the last of his meal and called the hertasi to come take the remains away and light the lamps before they arrived partially to be able to devote all of his attention to the visitors and partially out of a wish to be seen at his best limited though that best might be at the moment he hardly presented a gallant sight swathed in bandages propped up by pillows and without having had a proper bath in days still gesten had groomed him as best he could manage and it did not do to be presented to a brave lady with the leavings of a greedy meal in front of him you just want to look good for the lady vain bird as if you want to be sure that you could add her to your harem if you wanted like a collector of figurines lusting after yet another little statue still he didnt want her to think that he was some kind of raggedtailed hooligan the gods only knew what shed heard about him drake and gesten wouldnt repeat half of the stories they said theyd heard about him but then again he had only their word for the fact that theyd heard these stories at all it was a good thing that this was a relatively large tent made for two gryphons as patients and only holding skan at the moment once commander loren brought his young gryphon in things became just a little crowded this is zhaneel my lords loren said formally lord urtho skandranon this is young zhaneel who today disposed of three makaar singlehandedly while urtho made the usual congratulatory speech skandranon kept very quiet and examined zhaneel she was small and lightly built with a deep keelbone but narrow chest her eartufts were compact and dainty her feathers very smooth and she had no neckruff at all in color she was a light brown with a dustygold edge to her primaries like most gryphons except the unassigned her primary feathers had been bleached then dipped in the colors of her wingin this case red and gold on her head and face she had malarstripes of a slightly darker brown and eyemarkings flowing down her cheeks like softedged tear tracks while loren and urtho spoke she kept her head down and turned to the side as if shy or embarrassedthe gryphon equivalent of blushing was she simply shy or was she truly uncomfortable in their presence most of the gryphons that skan knew might have been subdued in the presence of their overlord and creator but they wouldnt have acted like this when loren finally coaxed her to speak her voice was low and soft and she spoke in simple sentences with a great deal of hissing and trillingand yet it was not because she was stupid a stupid gryphon would not have been able to do what she had done it was as if she simply could not get the words past her shyness it wasss nothing she insisted i only fly high verrry high sssaferrrr it isss makaarrr cannot fly ssso high i ssssee them thrrree below me skan could readily picture it in his minds eye especially if she had been flying as high as he thought she was those tapering wingssurely with wings like those the aspect ratio would be remarkable and the narrow leading edge would complement the long primaries the makaar would have been halfway between her and the earth she would have been invisible to them too farrr to rrreturrrn to rrreport it wasss she continued they would be gone when warrrriorrrsss came they mussst have been looking for sssomething ssssent they would have found it and gone now skan nodded true he rumbled and zhaneel started at the sound of his voice quite true your duty was to try to stop them her hissing had made him conscious of his own speech normally he only hissed and trilled when he was under stress or very very relaxed among friends when he chose he could speak as well as any human and he chose to do so now perhaps it would comfort her but how did you kill them urtho persisted she ducked her head i wasss high they could not sssee me i sssstooped on them hit the leader like thissss she held up one foreclaw fisted i ssstruck hissss head he fell from the sssky and died no doubt coming from the height zhaneel had been at she must have broken the leaders neck on impact and the ground finished him i followed him down the othersss pursued but i climbed again too fassssst for them to follow she pantomimed with her foreclaw and skan saw then what he had not noticed beforea reason she may not have struck to slash or bind to her quarry as he would have her talons were actually very short her toes long and flexible very like stubby human fingers a slash would only have angered the makaar unless she had managed against all odds to slash the major artery in the neck i go high again verrry high the two follow but cannot go sssso high i turrrrrn dive hit the first asss he fliesss to meet me she sat back on her hindquarters and mimed that meeting with both of her odd foreclaws how the makaar struggled to gain height how she had come at him headon angling her dive at the last possible moment to strike the top of his head with her closed fists he wasss ssstunned he fell brrroke hisss neck when he hit i follow him down to be sssure then turrrn dive into climb again she would not look at any of the three of them keeping her eyes fixed on some invisible point on the ground the thirrrd one he isss afrraid now he trrries to rrrrun i go high again asss high asss i can and dive he isss fassst but my dive isss fassster i hit him he fallssss she ducked her head it isss overrr it isss nothing ssspecial nothing specialexcept that these were tactics few if any gryphons had tried before spectacularly successful tactics too if zhaneels experience was anything to go by most gryphons when they fought makaar closed for the kill binding to the preys back and bringing it down or slashing with talons in passing strikes hawk and eagle tactics not falcon zhaneel had fought as would a very hungryor very bravefalcon when taking a goose or very large duck prey that would outweigh her twofold or moreknocking the prey out of the sky and not using her talons zhaneel your act of courage has probably saved any number of our people and no few of your own kind urtho said as these thoughts passed through skans mind i am quite impressed and quite pleased that commander loren thought to bring you to my attention personally at the very least my dear child i am going to present you with the reward you richly deserve with that he reached into a pocket and pulled out one of the rewardtokens he used instead of medals or decorations urtho felt medals were fairly useless he rewarded bravery directly this particular token was the highest possible a square of gold with a sword stamped on one side and a manyrayed suninglory on the other he slipped this into the tiny pouch zhaneel wore around her neck an accessory that most gryphons not on duty wore she could trade that particular token for virtually anything in the camp from a fine tent to the exclusive services for a month of her very own hertasi or she could save it and add it to others to obtain other luxuries skan simply kept a running account with gesten whose services he shared with amberdrake before he had left on this last mission he had been quite a few months ahead and gesten would be a very wealthy hertasi when the war was over but child i am curious urtho continued his eyes fixed on her as loren beamed his approval and the young gryphon stammered her thanks who are your parents who trained you besides them my parentsss arrre no morrre she replied they died when i wasss jussst fledged and i have no ssssiblingsss urthos disappointment was clear even to skan there would be no more like zhaneel unless she mated but before he could persist in finding out how she had been trained since her parents had obviously been unable to give her that training one of his aides burst into the tent without so much as an excuse me lord urtho the counterattack at stelvi pass that was all the boy needed to say urtho was off following him at an undignified run that belied his silver hair out into the lamplight and from there into the darkness this was not the first time urtho had left skan holding the line and it probably would not be the last skandranon knew what to do summoning as much dignity and aplomb as his injuries permitted he proceeded to deal with the situation lord commander thank you for bringing zhaneel here he said raising his head and then bowing it slightly to loren once again you have gone beyond mere duty and if urtho had not been forced to leave he would have told you so himself he hoped that loren would take that as a hint and so he did thank you black gryphon he replied then continued with an honesty that was not necessarily common among the commanders it has taken me a while to learn the best way to employ fighters other than human but i hope that zhaneels success is a harbinger of more such victories to come now if you will excuse me news from stelvi pass is going to affect all of us and i must go at once he turned to zhaneel scout zhaneel you are officially on rewardleave for the next two days i will inform your wingleader and i hope you can enjoy your wellearned rest loren turned and pushed aside the tent flap following urtho into the night though at a more dignified fast walk skan had hoped that the departure of the humans would relax the youngster but she was clearly still terrified it was a bit disconcerting no one had ever been terrified of him before not among those on urthos side least of all one of his own kind and an attractive lady at that he would have expected flirtatiousness not fear he fluffed his feathers and let his eyelids droop a little hoping his posture of relaxation would make her relax in turn a good theory but unfortunately it didnt work since urtho has been called away i must ask the rest of the questions he wanted to ask you skan told her in a very low coaxing voice believe me it is not that we wish to make you uncomfortable but we need to know these things to improve the training of the next batch of fledglings she bobbed her head stiffly but gave no indication of relaxing it wasss no grrreat deed she insisted i did not clossse and fight prrroperly no one can learrrn prrroperrr fighting frrrom thisss skan had heard any number of modest protestations in his time and had made a few of them himself but this didnt seem to be the kind of modesty that covered the very opposite on the contrary zhaneel apparently believed what she was saying that she had done nothing of note not all gryphons are large and powerful enough to close with makaar he reminded her gently and for even those it is not always wise to try particularly when there are more than one of them who trained you to strike like a falcon nnno one she stammered i did thisss becaussse i cannot fight like a prrroperrr grrryphon becaussse i am too sssmall and weak to be a prrroperrr grrryphon small perhaps but she was certainly not weak and skan would far rather have brains on his side than brawn hed seen too many musclebound specimens close with makaar believing themselves invincible and had to go to their rescue when they found out otherwise whoever whatever her trainer was skan was just about ready to put the being on report this little female had emerged with a load of selfdoubt from training that should have given her confidence in her own abilities she would have been useless except for her own courage determination and sense of responsibility it was also fairly obvious that this selfdoubt carried right on down to how she felt about her physical appearance she held herself as if she was certain there was nothing attractive about herin fact as if she thought she was a horrid freak didnt he recall some of the fledglings in training baiting a smaller one a while ago about a year or two it could have been yes he remembered now as zhaneel continued to protest that what she had done was less than nothing unworthy of reward three or four all nestbrothers by the look of them surrounded the smaller one and had been namecalling and insulting the little one the object of their taunting could have been zhaneel he only remembered that he had broken it up when the trainer did not appear to intervene and that the youngster was a small awkward adolescent considering the way she was trying to disappear into the tent canvas now it would not be surprising thatif it had been herhe did not remember her but that had been some time ago and the only reason he remembered it was because the appropriate authority had not stepped in to handle the problem and the noise had gotten on his nerves there was a certain amount of competition among the youngsters gryphons were still not a finished race and urtho took those who could not succeed in training for the less demanding jobs of messenger and camphelper these were of course never permitted to breed but if that youngster had been zhaneel she had proved herself by completing her training now zhaneel was a working member of a wing and entitled to the same care and protection skan himself got there should be no reason why she should continue to suffer these feelings of inferiority there would be a trondiirn assigned to her wing whose job was to see to everything but serious injuries whose duty was to know every gryphon in the wings assigned to him by name and peculiarity so why hadnt the trondiirn noticed zhaneels problems well there was someone who would take notice of her mental state do something about it himself and then see to it that the trondiirn in question would get an earful afterward if you have no plans for your token you might take it to amberdrake he suggested casually hes the best there is drake will have her feeling better in no timeand by the time he and gesten get done massaging grooming and adorning her shell be so elegant that shell have half her wing at her feet that should make her feel better about herself that was one of the many things a truly talented kestrachern and his or her assistants did spending hours sometimes more taking an ordinary creature and transforming her or him into the most stunning example of her race possible within her physical limitations most gryphons went to a kestrachern before a matingflight though few could afford the services of one like amberdrake that is simply a suggestion of course he added you may already have something in mind nno she said she seemed a bit stunned though whether it was the suggestion itself or that skan had made it he couldnt tell if you think it isss a good thing to do i have neverrr had a token beforrre well this is likely to be only the first of many tokens for you you might as well spend this one on something you are going to enjoy skan told her you wont regret going to drake i promise you she seemed to take that as a dismissal although it had not been meant as one and stammered her thanks backing out of the tent before skan could ask her to stay he thought about calling her back but it was already dark and she probably had things she wanted to do he wondered about urthos interest in her it had been something more than the usual interest in a successful fighter it was as if something about either the gryphon herself or the way she had fought had brought back a memory that urtho had forgotten for more pressing concerns but now that the visitors had left and darkness had crept over the camp not even the lamps could keep skan awake his pain was bearable he could lie down in relative comfort and he had a full crop urtho had that mysterious weapon and in any case there was nothing for skan to do until he healed sleep seemed in order and there were no mysteries so pressing that they could not wait until tomorrow he shifted himself around on his cushions until he found the best possible position he put his head down on his forelegs and yawned onceand that was the last thing he remembered doing or thinking until the healers woke him at dawn four gesten had rearranged amberdrakes schedule to include skan as a regular patient for the next several days amberdrake discovered the change when he checked the roster the next morning he didnt bother to comment on it he knew that gestens reply would be sardonic dear gesten whom hed hired on so long ago liked to think he fostered a heartless image constantly spitting barbed comments and doubleentendres even though the little hertasi failed utterly at posing as a bossy ogre amberdrake was not going to tell him so directly or by implication so often the gruffness people showed the world was a defense meant to protect the ones they loved that was how it was with gesten it was also how it was with skandranon and when amberdrake wasnt indulging himself in selfpity he was well aware of that and skan was first on the days roster with a generous amount of time allotted to him amberdrake could visit him add his own touch to the healing meld and spend some time simply enjoying skans company before returning to work at the tent this was interesting his schedule was bracketed by gryphons today the first patient was skan and the last a gryphon named zhaneel a female according to the log with a goldsquare token hed have to make certain gesten had the bleaches and dyes ready she might want a feathertip job in addition to whatever other pampering and primping she desired amberdrakes other talents often obscured this one and few knew he had ended his apprenticeship at the ancient trade of kestrachern as a featherpainter and still enjoyed doing it skan of course wouldnt let him practice on his feathers no matter how amberdrake tried to assure him that it would be a subtle pattern sophisticated and elegant no the black gryphon was the black gryphon and black he would remain skan had made it clear time and time again that the only dye to touch his feathers was the stark black he himself had chosen but female gryphons to whom nature and urtho had given fairly drab coloration tended to be very fond of painted feathers in peacetime they had sometimes sported patterned feathers as gaudy as a kaledain weaving or a messengerbirds bright plumesnow they had to confine themselves to something that made them less of a target if shes got goshawk coloring perhaps i can persuade her into something in blue and gray he mused that way shed have the advantage of skycamouflage when she was flying but up close she would be dappled in fishbone patterns and ribbons that would be a pleasant way to end the day he washed and shaved tied his hair back then donned a plain linen tunic and breeches to stroll over to the mess tent for breakfast he could eat in his quarters and often did when he was pressed for time or tired but he preferred to share at least one meal with the other kestrachern experience and observation had taught him that if the topranked kestrachern acted no differently than the rest there would be less acrimony and jealousy both of which could lead to unpleasantness and outright sabotage he was careful to dress plainly when off duty shared his knowledge and experience freely and when forced to cancel appointments did his best to see that the canceled clients had been distributed fairly among the others thanks to this the rest of the kestrachern tended to regard him as their unofficial leader and spokesperson he had mixed feelings about that but it was probably better that he was in that position rather than someone else he was the only kaledain among them the other kaledain kestrachern chose to work among the healers and save their other skills for their own people no other working kestrachern in the camp had as much training as amberdrake and when the kaledain had moved to urthos tower and the question of what his job should be had come up he had felt no hesitation he made at best an ordinary healer and to operate under the constraints of a healer would have made him feel as if he worked with half his fingers gone it was best to do what he was truly good at breakfast was unusually quiet amberdrakes companions were tired and subdued like the rest of the army after all the kestrachern were by no means immune to what had happened at stelvi pass even if none of them had friends or acquaintances there the fighters themselves would inevitably bring their troubles to the anonymous comfort of those whose business was pleasure and support no one seemed in any mood for conversation on a personal level no one looked at amberdrake with the desperate eyes of someone who had taken on more pain than he or she could handle nor asked amberdrake for advice in affairs of their own hearts at first he simply ate his breakfast keeping the conversation light intending to leave with a quiet greeting for everyone one of the junior kestrachern inquired about corani and was met with a brief sharp glance from amberdrake this served as an impetus for several other kestrachern at the table to start talking about the news from stelvi pass laisfaar and the tower each adding their own slices of information they had likely as not gleaned it from their clients as much as from camp gossip as long as no one revealed the identities of the clients many of them thought putting the pieces of the puzzle together in the confidence of other kestrachern was something of a challenge to all concerned it was done all the time and amberdrake knew it and although it was a source of some of the kestracherns hidden power he didnt entirely approve of this free sharing of basically private knowledge still the war made its own rules and they fought the war itself and not the army of the enemy perhaps this technical transgression of kestrachern protocol could yield valuable insights so he told himself regardless of amberdrakes private mullings about the talk it went on unabated and he found himself offering up the occasional it may well be and from what i know unlikely comments which helped lay in more pieces of the puzzle when he felt it was time to go he directed the discussion back toward client care and techniques then slipped out unobtrusively when he reached the black gryphons tent skan was awake and evidently in a much better mood this morning as he looked amberdrake up and down in mock amazement tchah the kestrachern has lost his commission all your fine plumage is gone struttingbird heh dressing to match the job it seems likely you turned in here mistakenly on the way to the horsestalls then skandranon replied smoothly yes he was definitely feeling better yesterday he would have growled has anyone looked at your wings amberdrake asked not since you did skan told him his pronunciation was much improved from yesterday too he hissed his sibilants only a little hardly enough to notice all who have come have said it was best left to the expert theyre probably right but lacking an expert ill have to do amberdrake said absently running his hand just above the surface of the splinted and bandaged right wing he extended his awareness down into the wing itself into the muscle tendon and bone youre doing all right though bear with me for a minute here i need to probe some more he shifted from simple awareness into true healing with a deft twist of his mind carefully for if he sped the healing of the bones too much they would not heal properly but would remain weak as the bones of a very old person might be after setting he sent energy to the torn muscle to the tiny arteries and veins that had been savaged and then delicately to the bones finally he pulled his awareness away and came back to himself shaking his head a little to clear it of the shared pain id leave the bandages on for now he continued its going to take another couple of days of work to mend those wings and a couple of weeks to strengthen them enough that you can use them having them bandaged like that keeps them from being strained i hope you have feathers saved from your last molts were going to have to imp a lot of broken secondaries and primaries thats one thing we cant do for yougrow new feathers youre the healer skan replied philosophically then he looked sheepishly at amberdrake out of the corner of his eye i have to apologize to you drake again i mean the apology i gave you yesterday wasnt exactly sincere he took a deep breath and let it out slowly i treated you badly yesterday it wasnt fair and it wasnt right my only defense is that i was in pain and im not at my best when i hurt amberdrake snorted not at your best skan you could give a makaar lessons in surliness but he smiled and scratched skans eartufts while the gryphon feigned indignation thats all right im not a good patient either you know its just a good thing im not hurt or sick very often or id probably lose gesten not gesten he enjoys suffering he enjoys letting you know hes suffering even more skan replied wickedlyand accurately whats happening out there nobody tells me anything theyre afraid i might not want to heal up maars forces threw back our counterattack amberdrake told him knowing that if he didnt skan would find some other way of getting the information weve lost the pass for now at least unless urtho can come up with some way of dislodging them skan shook his massive head and sighed i cant see how drake stelvi was built well as impregnable as possible with water supplies in every part of the fortress that was part of the reason why no one took an attack there seriously he stared at the canvas wall of his tent as if by sheer force of will he could see beyond it to the pass so its to be another retreat then eventually abandoning the tower if this goes on amberdrake nodded im afraid so damn them skan glared at the tent wall until amberdrake was afraid he might burn a hole in it then he shook his head and when he turned back to amberdrake his eyes were clear although wrinkles betrayed a deep and abiding anger burning at the bottom of them has maar given us any new and unpleasant surprises it was amberdrakes turn to shake his head but this time it was with relief like that mageshot he pelted us with last month not that ive heard and i heard most of the rumors three times over between my tent and yours good skan had been tense now he relaxed a bit amberdrake would have given a months pay to know what had prompted that questionand knew very well that skan would never tell him he could surmise that there had been some kind of new weapon in use by maars armyand that skan had neutralized it somehow he could surmise it but skan would never reveal the truth of the matter so wicked one what have you been up to while i have been wallowing at my ease in a nest of pillows skan asked quickly changing the subject before amberdrake had a chance to ask him anyway any new and interesting clients one new one yesterday who i hope is never going to come back amberdrake told him a more unpleasant man i have never met and a mercenary mage on top of that he told skan all there was to tell about conn levas without revealing the mans name or divulging anything that might identify himnot even the fact that the mans lover might be kaledain he didnt often break client confidentiality and even then it would only be to a superior like artis camlodon the chief healer or to urtho himself should he ever find himself in that exalted beings presence few people overawed amberdrake he had seen too many of the great and powerful unclothed both physically and spiritually but urtho always left him feeling as if his mouth were hanging wide open the blazing intellect the aura of controlled and absolute power and the overwhelming competence of the man added up to the kind of charisma that left amberdrake weak in the knees what he looked like didnt matter amberdrake invariably saw the mage of silence with a kestracherns eyesthe eyes of one who saw past the surface always still amberdrake found himself telling skan more than he would have told anyone else and skan listened with every indication of interest it was marvelous simply having a friend to talk to this way and they both exulted in it behind their calm and rehearsed exteriors i feel sorry for that ones lover skan said finally very sorry actually she seems more important as a possession than as a person to him that was the conclusion i came to amberdrake admitted what was worse though was that i was supposed to be dealing with my clients problems and i found myself wishing there was a way i could have a good long talk with his lover instead that wasnt very professional of me i suppose but then again he wouldnt let me help him the more fool he skan said scornfully to pay good money and then refuse to take what it purchased trust skan to put the situation into the simplest possible terms amberdrake had to smile thank you skandranon rashkae youll make me a perchi yet should i simply become a baker and save myself some worry you would find another way to take on the armys burdens as a baker each little slice of bread would have a soldiers very life and spirits slathered upon it skan snorted amberdrake laughed in response it was after all a good return volley i suppose that in the grand context of an entire army one mages emotional problems arent too high on the list of things i need to worry about skan chuckled that is a reasonable statement more reasonable than the fretting youve spent more time with me than you should have your other clients will be unhappy if they find out then they wont find out amberdrake got up to leave this is going to be a very interesting day im going to begin and end with a gryphon its the first time something like that has ever happened i thought i was your only gryphon client skan mockchided i may become jealous dont bother old bird amberdrake told him this is just a onceonly a reward im not sure why this gryphon chose me when she could have had the same treatment from an apprentice at a fraction of the fee but it will be a nice change from emotionallydamaged fighters and deservedlytraumatized mages skan snorted approval at the small insult to conn levas he had long maintained that amberdrake was too gracious i may still be jealous amberdrake smoothed his unwrinkled tunic as a mocking gesture shes a young female i believe and if youre very good i might introduce you to her after gesten and i finish prettying her not that youll be in any shape to seduce her but you might be able to persuade her youll be worth keeping in mind when you heal skans face wore a very peculiar expression as if he tried to hold back something he seethed with amusement amberdrake couldnt for a moment imagine why though the female gryphon hadnt been listed as being from any wing skan had ever flown with and was several years his junior besides whatever his secret was however he managed to keep it behind his beak amberdrake waited for him to betray himself but he said only i should like very much to meet this young lady once youve been with her ill see what i can do amberdrake said and since skan didnt seem disposed to reveal anything he finally waved goodbye and went back to his scheduled work very much like to see her indeed vain bird hes probably planning his postmating dinner with her already amberdrake was wiping thick oil from his hands with a rag when gesten reminded him of his last client for the day it had been a day marked by trauma and pain from the emotional trauma of a young healer who had seen one too many die to the pain of a horseback skirmisher whod had three beasts shot out from under her at the attempt to retake stelvi pass she had had so many wrenched and displaced vertebrae from falls that amberdrake almost sent her to the healers instead regardless of what she said she wanted but she swore to him that she would rather have the best kestrachern in the world put her spine back in place than any healer and seemed thrilled to be with him as if she spoke to a great dancer or singer shed sworn that she could bear the pain he would have to put her through to do so the reason an admirable one shed felt that the healers were overburdened and that they would feel obliged to painblock her which would add to their burden yes shed known that the healers would treat her for nothing and that his services cost a highranking rewardchit no she hadnt cared ive got a pile of these things already so im saving them up for a better commission once the wars dead shed said gruffly urthos aides brought me a new horsekaledainbred at that ive got a new tent i dont crave pretties i look like a horse myself so fancy clothing on me would look like barding on a mule so what else am i going to spend a chit on besides this way i get an attractive man to put his hands all over me that i can use so he manipulated her vertebrae as she stifled her gasps of pain until her gasps turned to ones of sheer relief he was so impressed by her courage and sense that hed had gesten prepare a hot soaking tub for her with aromatic oils in it he had her soak until her muscles completely relaxed then he gave her the massage she had paid for rubbing her down gently until she was just dozing then he did for her what he would not do for conn levas they were good hours she left his tent smiling and exhausted he sat back while gesten cleaned up and prepared for the last client of the day smiling just as widely as she had once in a while he got a client who was worthy of his skills in every waythat skirmisher was just such a one and it had been a privilege to help her odd both she and conn levas were mercenaries and yet they were so unlike each other ah well experience had shown that the only thing similar about most soldiers was the uniform they wore that was a fine lady gesten observed as he expertly put away the oils and stowed the massage table i think i ought to go over and suggest she spend one of those useless chits of hers on a makeover with us i dont see any reason why she has to keep on looking like a wild mare shes lean enough to be elegant and if shed just let me do something with her hair thats a good idea if you want to amberdrake agreed id take the exotic approach with her you know she could carry off some of the kaledain costumes quite impressively maybe with a catstripe paint pattern across her shoulders thats what i like about you drake gesten interrupted cheerfully you always see the potential think you can exercise that one more time today that gryphon zhaneel will be here shortly gryphon amberdrake replied momentarily confused then he hit his head with the heel of his hand right i nearly forgot my mind is still muddled from this day im just tired did you ive got the oils and the satin cords and the beads and featherpaint gesten said snorting a little as if id forget listen id like to go over and put skan to bed if you dont mind do you think you can handle this youngster alone it was amberdrakes turn to snort as if i hadnt been taking care of gryphons all by myself long before you came looking for some fool to hire you of course i can all right then foolwhohiredme gesten replied giving him back as good an insult as hed gotten ill go make sure that featherhead up on the hill gets his sleep then ill see to it you dont drown yourself in the tub when i get back gesten indicated a bright but battered wheeled storage chest with a nod of his snout everything you need is in there and i replaced whatever had dried out or was too old to use if i do say so myself i dont think theres a kestrachern in the army with a better stock of gryphon pretties by the time you get done she should be stunning provided you can do your job he whisked through the curtain before amberdrake could make a rejoinder amberdrake just laughed and took his time getting out of his chair he changed into a utilitarian pair of loose linen breeches and baggy shirt tying a sash about the latter he would not need any fancy robes with this client instead he needed clothing he could work in clothing that could be splashed with dye and not take harm over that he wore his receiving robe with its intricate designs amberdrake stepped outside the tent to take in some of the camps relatively fresh air before the client arrived small feathersthe size of a handdrifted by in the breeze discards from some gryphons vigorous preening no doubt activity in the camp had stepped up a bit from earlier that day it seemed that the rumors had fed a packing frenzy the children that hed seen before were engaged in tying blankets and packs with the help of two kyree tugging with their teeth he saw adults mending wagon covers and doublechecking the wheels of carts farther beyond that a set of soldiers and an apprentice magewho looked to be vikteren one of amberdrakes social acquaintancesleveled and tested a hoveringsled the large sleds floated half a manheight above the groundalthough they could be raised higherand were mainly used for troops supplies a few of the kestrachern amberdrake included had bought one for use in moving their own gear rather than relying on the army to do so for them next to them the horseskirmisher hed cared for earlierwho was moving much more freely than before hed begunwas keeping a number of her fellow warriors enthralled with some great tale or if not great certainly one that called for a substantial amount of gesturing maybe shes talking about me that would be good if she was let them know i treat the lower ranks as well as i do their commanders hidden back behind the cluster of humans though was a mere wisp of a gryphona fledgling judging by her size or a subadult sheyes definitely a femalewas eavesdropping on whatever it was the horseskirmisher was saying how strange normally gryphons simply walked into conversations they wanted to be a part of invited or not then amberdrakes attention was taken by a flight of messengerbirds winging past darts of living paint flittering across the sky their bounding flight carried them and their messages toward the tower with luck they carried news that the wars hunger was sated for a while amberdrake turned back inside and set about finger weaving feathershaftadornments for his next client it would be so relaxing for a change zhaneel when she arrived turned out to be the little gryphon hed seen lurking behind the warriors earlier she was a very pretty thing in a quiet way lean and fit with long wings and feathers set very close to her body hed walked out from the back room of the tent with a handful of fingerwoven satin cords and found her in the receiving area hesitantly nosing around the cushions and boxes shes never been to a kestrachern before i can tell that right now nervous expectant unsure of herself he cleared his throat gently and she started welcome zhaneel he said in a soft but commanding voice my name is amberdrake i am honored to serve you he executed the sweeping graceful bow that customarily accompanied the greeting and ended it down on one knee so that he would not be looming over her his receiving robe gathered around him in glossy folds as he knelt a shimmering contrast to the work clothes underneath it her eyes darted across his entire body as he bent forward to touch one of her forelegs as was also customary it was in this first touch that an experienced kestrachern could tell the way the session was going to go involuntary reactions mixed with postures and poses hopeful or desperate projections all would be caught by a sensitive kestrachern in good form one did not have to be an empath to read body language that was a skill taught to every kestrachern during his or her apprenticeship in this case the signals were decidedly odd zhaneel slicked her feathers down and turned her head until her delicate beak touched the wrist joint of her folded wing a soft sibilant voice came from that beak in as near to a whisper as gryphons could manage the black grrryphon sssent me to you you are my kesssstrrracherrrn then her head dipped and her wings fluttered near her body spread ever so slightly yes i am the kestrachern that will serve you zhaneel as you requested and as your reward for bravery i will adorn comfort and help you and give you the attentions you may deserve and the insight you may need amberdrake raised his other hand and touched the remaining foreleg reading her physical reactions clearly while another part of his mind reasoned out what to do about it shes practically seething with sexual tension definitely worked herself up into a frenzy somehow over the past candlemark well i know what that usually means some featherwork and oils should increase this unique beauty of hers so her lover will be especially pleased by her after our session still still this sleek little creature wasnt coming across like the usual gryphon client to be prepared for a special tryst there was anticipation and an electric desire but there didnt seem to be any confidence in the outcome of the night nor the sense of certainty that gryphons were so well known for and no gryphon went for an expensive trystgrooming unless she was positive she had a partner waiting for her suddenly zhaneel looked directly at him and stepped forward causing amberdrake to rebalance himselfand then she kept moving forward amberdrake fell backward as zhaneel straddled him her long wings spread to either side of them with her tail up and neck feathers roused her beaked face was nearly touching his nose when she asked you will give me pleasssurrre amberrrdrrrake oh gods that explains what he stared at her beak remembered the size of gryphon talons and felt himself blanch zhaneel nowaityoull hurt me he begged please let me up skandranon marked his page with a discarded feather and stretched looking back to where gesten meticulously brushed and treated his back just above his tail urtho had sent down a book by an explorer who had been in his employ from before the war had started and the heavy tome was filled with small notes written in the margins observations and anecdotes by others that the book had been loaned to urtho had sent it by messengerkyree to make up for his hasty departure earlier yet another small gesture that told the black gryphon of his status in urthos eyes gesten had been there for at least two candlemarks quietly putting all of the details right for skandranon cutting sanding and rounding partially snapped feathers rubbing in soothing gels around strained feathershafts without saying a dozen words hed moved skandranonwho was twice the weight of most human meninto easier positions for tending tiny cuts the healers hadnt gotten he had sanded down the chips in skans beak filling in nearinvisible cracks with cement and coping his overgrowing talons he then moved on to a deep and thorough combing removing all the tiny snags and remaining bits of burr and twig from skans black coat skan was in good shapemuch better than even this morning he musedand in little pain thanks to one of lady cinnabars clever abilities a trick with shunting pain away she was a delight to know even peripherally and seemed to have the sort of personality hed like to find in a gryphon mate one day skan counted himself fortunate that hed lived this long ah but taking a mate seriously considering the possibility of fathering young had been reduced to a worn pastime over his years of service one that at some times felt like his only reason for persevering and at others like an impossible fantasy from a laughsingers tale the concern was not one of merely finding sex he had no lack of lovers there were few gryphons who wouldnt be ecstatic to raise their tails to him but still they were at best casual friends and none of them fertile mmm but there were those that had been so sweet so warm he shifted the way he was lying thinking about lovers was causing his belly to tighten with longing hed never been embarrassed about his virility before and felt no pangs about such now but his healing state kept poking reminders at him about how limited his movement really was gesten didnt miss a stroke while grooming skans flank and tail although he surely noticed the outward signs of skans line of thought there seemed to be very little the little hertasi missed but as with other topics that came up around him daily gestens best comment was not to comment at all tchah by now little zhaneel is settled in warm and comfortable with amberdrake amberdrake knows how to make everything right hes such a good kestrachern so clever so graceful so intelligent im proud to know him im glad i sent her to him im going to kill skandranon for this amberdrake fumed as he faced away from zhaneel surely that mindless oversexed bugbitten arrogant mass of black feathers had given zhaneel the impression that amberdrake was going to make love to her somehow this was an unforgivably cruel joke on skans part after this situation was handled amberdrake resolved to go over and give skan a verbal flayingasleep injured or in whatever condition he happened to be zhaneel had disentangled herself from him only a moment before and was now watching his every move for some cue to resume her head bobbing up and down and hindclaws clenching amberdrake wiped a palm across his face and turned back to speak to her pointedly zhaneel i cant be the kind of lover you want you and i arent physically compatible i just cant a moment passed an unmistakable inexplicable look of horror transformed zhaneels entire demeanor from one of desperate desire to one of emotional devastation she let out a gurgling cry and suddenly bolted through the opened tent flap and into the darker and more private inner room skandranon finished the annotated chapter on social organization among the southeastern tribes and luxuriated in the attention gesten was giving his recentlybattered crest by now she must feel like the most beautiful and capable gryphon in the entire world amberdrake always knows how to say exactly the right thing to make someone feel good hes given me so many compliments and hes hardly ever wrong maybe once im recovered he can give me a trystgrooming and we can talk about how much good my suggestion did zhaneel the black gryphon sighed and settled down for a nap smug in the knowledge that all was right with the world as far as zhaneel and amberdrake were concerned amberdrake found zhaneel curled into a ball in the farthest corner of the tent shivering her head tucked under her wings it was a saddening unnerving thing for drake to see this was the gryphon equivalent of racking sobs as bad as any hed seen in mourning or after nightmares surging palpable waves of shame pounded at him feelings of selfblame hissed in his mental ears the closer he got to her he braced himself to receive a backlash and reached out to touch her quivering body instead of the expected strike she didnt acknowledge his presence at all nothing yet with the touch a staggering rush of sickening emotions blinded amberdrake for the span of a heartbeat she hates herself she genuinely hates herself selfdoubt selfpity an overwhelming sense of worthlessness of loss from a gryphon this i could expect from a human but from a gryphon theyre all convinced that urtho created them as an improvement on all other races who or whatever made her this way was long in building if it can be stopped it has to stop now if i can change herit has to start now he spoke quietly soothingly zhaneel she whimpered the barest whisper of sound shh little one i am here for you please listen please listen ill make you feel better i promise it i am here for you he moved in closer and folded his robed body across hers to comfort her as he had other distressed gryphons with the sensation of protective caring wings wrapped over them he could feel her underneath him body temperature high breathing fast and there yes her eyes tightly shut her delicate eartufts folded back tight to her head drake stroked her neck feathers and spoke more reassuring words keeping his voice steady and deep speaking into her and held her as her shuddering subsided the sexual anticipation earlier can help some at least amberdrake swam through zhaneels nerves with his healing powers found her pleasurecenters and gently stimulated them while he soothed her with his words gryphons bodies held stores of specialized fluids elements in various glands and repositories and the delicate touch of an experienced healer could release them at the right time a careful nudge there and a featherlight stimulation so and the rewarding sensation following a mating coursed through her veins in a small amount by no means as great as the euphoria following a real mating but definitely there it had the desired effect she slowly went from quivering to a state of relaxationphysically at leastand uncurled from her ball after what felt like a harrowing eternity all the while amberdrake reassured her and spoke encouragements it didnt cure any of her problems no that could come later but her gradual relaxation at least opened a doorway toward a cure a candlemark must have passed since her arrival before she spoke again it was a time in which her kestrachern held her and scratched her eartufts all the while carefully touching her mind and soaking in the feelings she unknowingly projected into him he could not help thinking that it was a good thing she had chosen him rather than a kestrachern with no empathic or healing abilities anyone else would have had to send for her trondiirnand an apprentice would have been as terrified and traumatized as she zhaneel he said urgently you must tell me why i distressed you so i had no intention of hurting you she shivered all over you kessstracherrrn think i am mmmisssborrrn too no desssirrre neverrr she hunched her shoulders and hung her head deep in purest misery should have died she cried softly not worth raisssing ssshould have died trried amberdrake didnt hesitate a moment strange how after waiting in silence for so long a moments delay in a reply could cause damage no lovely child you misunderstood me entirely youre far from misborn zhaneel you were made by urtho as his proudest creation and you are lovely to me she uncoiled some more and nervously looked at him with one eye but you sssaidno lover physssically not even you want me he rubbed his cheek against hers as a gryphonsib would do and replied quickly zhaneel no little one i said i can not not that i would not if i could i am only a human thin skin and smaller than you we wouldnt fit you and i our sizes and bodies are too different and youd tear me up trying he allowed a small chuckle dearheart believe me if i were a gryphon you and i would be in the sky together the moment after i saw you she opened both eyes and blinked twice as if the dry observation that humans were perhaps a third the size of a gryphonin every salient wayhadnt even occurred to her some people think a kestrachern can do anything never learned how mating goes parents died left me left me alone zhaneel slumped down her beak touching the floor misborn wings too long and pointy too long for body head too big too round no eartufts at all she cried out shivering thats why they left me why they flew and died i was misborn and they were ashamed amberdrake scratched her head fingers disappearing into the deep soft downfeathers and projected more calm into her soothing her lest she ball herself up again and never uncurl i just cant believe that zhaneel you are lovely and strong your parents must surely have treasured you and looked forward to seeing you fly apparently a floodgate had been released when she had first started speaking she continued to pour out her feelings not enough talon to hurt even mites amberdrake surveyed the outstretched forefoot dubiously the talons looked plenty long to him freakish misborn should have died she whispered hoarsely no one wants zhaneel in wing no one no one wants zhaneel as mate worthless amberdrake lifted her head up a more difficult task than he tried to make it appear and caressed her briefly around the nares then held up the forgotten rewardsquare if youre so worthless then how did you earn this they dont give these away for digging latrines skylady only the bravest receive this kind of reward his left arm was complaining bitterly about supporting the weight of her head when she finally lifted it herself and blinked then she looked down not brave she insisted faintly amberdrake smiled gently why dont you tell me how you earned it and let me be the judge of that i would sincerely like to hear zhaneel join me ill make you a fine strong tea he stood up creakily and gestured for her to come with him she rose took three hesitant steps toward his bed and then sat beside it no one would accept me into their wing but i wanted to fly for urtho so ii just moved into a wing kelreesha trondaars wing ah interesting the same wing that merc mage conn levas is attached to amberdrake prodded the coals in the everburning brazier then set a copper kettle of water on it and then i flew patrols the back patrolsthe ones fledglings fly in relays her voice broke at that the duty she described was humiliating for an adult gryphon usually reserved for punishment because of its length and uneventfulness and for training fledglings in procedure it gave metime away from the camp time to fly can fly the circuit faster than anyone else amberdrake dropped herbpacked cloth pouches into the kettle and spoke gently faster than any other gryphon that is wonderful in itself how much faster zhaneel a third faster i fly the circuit alone amberdrake raised an eyebrow in surprise and appreciation i was at fifthcloud height she continued half again higher than other gryphons fly on patroleven more interesting and i found makaar there were three leaving our territory they had to be stopped somehow they must have been spying but i cant mindspeak welli couldnt call for help so i dove on them and fought them it didnt matter if i died stopping them amberdrakes thoughts ran quickly despite the practiced impassive expression on his face she means that she means that if she died trying that was better than living its plain why she said she wasnt brave she was suicidal and she wanted her death to mean something he took a deep breath and smoothed back his hair zhaneel ive known many warriors many shaman and priests and high mages so many of them have felt inadequate and ive spoken to them as i am doing to you dear skylady when warriors feel afraid they lack something it is only because they are forgetful they have forgotten how capable they truly are he settled down on the bed beside her and caressed her brow as she listened if you were anyone besides zhaneellovely powerful sleek zhaneelyou would have gone for help or flown away frightened or attacked the makaar and failed you succeeded wholly because of who and what you are and by the power of your mind as well as your body that is no small thing given that some gryphons i know have no more brains than an ox again he held up the token and gently touched it to her beak and now you have this given by urthos own hand do you know how rare that is she shook her head humanlike indicating she didnt its very rare zhaneel very unusual it shows that you are exceptionally good dear one and not a freak not misborn and far from worthless doesnt matter she croaked everyone thinks i am everyone didnt stop three makaar and everyone didnt get this token he shook his head certain that he had her attention now sometimes everyone can be wrong too didnt everyone say that stelvi pass was impregnable her eartufts rose just a little and she bobbed her beak once in cautious agreement he considered her her build her very look you are different zhaneel just as i am different from my own people and when i came here i felt a little like you dono a lot like you do i was scorned simply because of who i was and what i do the healers wouldnt accept me because i was kestrachern the kestrachern were wary of me because i could heal yet as i saw them dance away from me i studied the moves of their dance amberdrake smiled again as zhaneel relaxed some more and gazed at him an enraptured raptor listening to a storyteller they would look at me and i was a mirror they could see parts of themselves in me layers and shards of their own lives theyd tucked away in their sleeves when i spoke the healers knew i had that kestrachern insight and they felt threatened and the other kestrachern distrusted my station and healing abilities yet through it all there i was still myself zhaneel just as you are still you those who push you down fear you they are jealous of you and you are stronger than you know zhaneel fidgeted uneasy under his carefilled eyes not strong sir he shook his head and chuckled again nah skylady please dont call me sir i am only amberdrakea friend ah he moved gracefully to the tea kettle and poured two cups one large one small as he spoke if you were not strong i would never have met you zhaneel you would have been dead and forgotten not honored by the mage of silence himself and not noticed by the black gryphon zhaneel turned her head aside and her nares flushed in embarrassment ah so shes as impressed with skandranon as he is by himself im still going to skin him later but ill certainly use his image to zhaneels advantage let me tell you of skandranon zhaneel he began they make fun of skandranon too he is called a gloryhound reckless arrogant petulant and some say he has the manners of a hungry fledgling still he is there doing what he is best at they are jealous of him toomainly because he actually does what they only talk about doing actions define strength and you skylady fly faster and farther than they do and can strike down three makaar alone she blushed again and once more he wondered what went wrong in her childhood where were her teachers her parents the simple things he told her should have been the most basic concepts that a young gryphlet was raised on normally though was the key word amberdrake had seen a thousand souls laid bare and knew well that what most called normal was anything but reality he also felt the warmth in his chest and belly and the simmering heat in his mind that told him that the hunt was good this timethat this young zhaneel was going to survive always i hear how they have said this or that and yet i have never come facetoface with one of them who are they anyway he askedrhetorically since he did not truly expect her to answer what gives them a monopoly on truth why are they any more expert than you or i another few steps and he presented her with the larger cup he marveled at the deftness with which she grasped the cup with a single foreclawnowith a single hand and she followed his gaze no claws to speak of have to wear warclaws like silly kyree she murmured and looked down again tchah no thats no defect skylady see my arms and legs my muscles they match my body well as the parts of your body match well now see my hands and their proportion to my arms her sight fixed on his hands and her eyes widened as she realized what she was seeing your handsare like mine yes very similar all the powers made me this way he nodded his approval and urtho created you with exactly this shape to your foreclaws your body your wings do you believe that urtho would be so incompetent as to create an ugly mismatched creature that went against the most basic of gryphonic tenets even zhaneel would not believe that no he smiled now he had her of course we all know that urtho would not he has always been thorough and detailed with a vision unmatched by any adept in history no i believe zhaneel that you are something new sleek and small fastlike a falcon the others they all have the shapes of broadwinged birds of hawks and eaglesbut you are something very different not a gryphon at all but something newgryphon and falcon gryfalcon her eyes sparkled with wonder and she caught her breath still holding the cup of steaming tea she spoke the word that amberdrake had just made up testing it on her tongue as she would try a sweet apple or cold winter wine gryfalcon this was going so much better than a candlemark ago amberdrake took a sip of his cup of tea and luxuriated in the play of flavorsrich and bitter sweet and acidic each in turn complex blends that suited the mood of a complex problem outside the tent dusk had darkened to night as they talked further and zhaneel had told him in words that faltered of her parents fate they had both been killed on what should have been a lowrisk mission once again the war had hungered and had fed as all things must feed zhaneel had been left alone a fledgling cared for thereafter by a succession of foster parents and trondiirn who felt no particular affection for her one by one they changed or disappeared and the memories of her parents became a softedged memory of nurturing acceptance a memory so distant it came to seem like a dream or a tale having nothing to do with her reality it was the contrast between the fledglings memories of loving care and the subadults reality of indifference that had suffocated her in the cold box of selfhate conversely however the same thing had kept her from killing herself the knowledge only halfaware that when she was still in the downy coat of a fledgling she was loved had given her soul the broad feathers it needed there were no specific images now and no remembered words there was only the sensation that yes with certainty they had trilled their affection as she drowsed and taught her when she awoke brief as that time had been it had given her an underlying strength and a reason to endure by the time their cups were empty most of the night had passed by and they had wandered into mutual observations zhaneel asked about the life of a kestrachern hed wondered aloud once he knew the subject would not alarm her where she had gotten her idea that amberdrake would be her lover her nares flushed the horserider was telling the others about you and i listened i didnt understand some of it but i thought it was because she was a human she ducked her head a little as her nares flushed deeper i thought this must be what you do with all who come to you i thought this was why great skandranon had told me to come to you when i was given the reward he clenched his jaw for a moment i might have known skan was at the bottom of this no wonder he was acting soso smug but a confrontation with skan would have to wait now all unknowing she had given him another opening to bolster her selfesteem skan sent you here he blinked as if he were surprised but he continued quickly before she could burst into frantic protest that he really had as if he might doubt her truthfulness do you realize just how impressed he must have been with you zhaneel why it was only two days ago he was brought in injuredhe is still not healed and he has made it very clear to me his friend that he does not wish to be troubled with inconsequential things and yet he thought enough of your proper reward to send you to me how much time did he spend with you ido not knowhalf a candlemark perhaps she said doubtfully half a candlemark amberdrake chuckled i cannot think of any other he has spent so much time with other than his healers truly he must have found you fascinating oh she replied faintly and her nares flushed again perhaps he was bored she suggested just as faintly amberdrake laughed at that if he was bored he would have sent you elsewhere skans cures for boredom are reading sleeping and teasing his friends in that order no i think he must have found you very interesting by now from her bodylanguage and her voice it was fairly obvious to him that zhaneel hadat the very leasta substantial infatuation with the black gryphon he doesnt pay that kind of attention to just anyone he continued smoothly if he noticed you it is because you are noteworthy she perked up for a moment then her eartufts flattened again if he noticed me it wassss sssurely to sssee how freakish i am how different you arenot freakish he admonished skandranon is not one to be afraid of what is different am i she hesitated and he sensed that she was about to say something very daring for her am idifferent enough that he might recall me notice me again amberdrake pretended to think i take it that you want him to do more than simply take notice of you she ducked her head very shyly yessss she breathed oh yessss well zhaneel skan is not easily impressed you would have to be something very special to hold his interest you would have to do more than simply take out a couple of makaar once that was a daring thing to say to her but fortunately she did not take it badly she only looked at him eagerly as if hoping he could give her the answers she needed i know him very well if you want skan zhaneel you will have to impress him enough that he wants youenough to make him ask you to join his wing before she could lose courage he leaned forward and said with every bit of skill and empathy that he possessed you can do this zhaneel i know you can i believe in you her eyes grew bright and her eartufts perked completely up i couldi could entrrrap the makaar she paused as he shook his head slightly perhaps if i made of myself a target outflew them to ambush again he shook his head both her ideas were far too impulsiveand suicidal it will have to be something that only you can do zhaneel he suggested you dont have to make a hero of yourself every day you dont have to have an immediate result either but whatever you do must be something only you can dojust as the way you killed those three makaar was done in a way only you could have performed perhaps something that urtho or skan said to you could help you think of something she sat deep in thought while amberdrake got himself a second cup of tea finally she spoke urrtho asked me what training i had and he was disappointed that no one had given me any special attentions she looked up at him intently and he gave her an encouraging nod skandranon also seemed surprised that i had no special training and if i cannot fly and fight as the others doperhapsperhaps i should train myself again she looked to him and he nodded enthusiastically perhaps i should ask forfor courses such as they put the young humans across only for flying that is a good plan skylady he told her firmly it is one that will benefit not only you but others who are also small and light and as you become skilled you will definitely attract skans attention but now she had turned her attention to his hands and then to her own foreclaws amberdrrrake i have hands like humansi can do human things can i not she flexed her hands first one then the other as if testing their mobility perhaps i can use a weaponorperhaps i can fly to help wounded her beak parted in excitement and amberdrake had to work to suppress his own excitement the idea of a gryphonhealer even the kind of fieldhealer who could only splint bones and bandage woundsthat was enough to make him want to jump up and put the plan into motion immediately how many fighters had bled their lives out simply because no one could reach them the mobility of a gryphon would save so many of those otherwise lost lives this is going to take time zhaneel he cautioned repeating the words to himself as well as her all of it is going to take time to learn more time to practice but it is a wonderful idea i will help you all i can i swear it zhaneel listened to his cautions then bobbed her head gravely one weapon she declared i ssshall learn one weapon crosssbow it ssseems easy enough to massster and i shall learn the simple healing that the greenbands know by greenbands she meant the squires and sergeants who wore a green armband and acted as rough fieldhealers who knew the basics enough to patch someone up long enough for them to get to a real healer enough to save lives and i would be honored to teach you that healing my skylady amberdrake said softly and she dropped her voice to a shy whisper and skandranon will notice me amberdrake chuckled oh yes my lady he wont be able to help himself you will be one of the few things that he does notice i think she cocked her head to one side few things she asked curiously he shook his head and shrugged oh sometimes i think he is so obsessed with topping his last escapade that he does not notice much of anything including his friends she continued to stare at him quizzically and finally said he notices he loves you the whole camp knows this that was not what he had expected to hear and for once he was taken by surprise hewhat amberdrake replied he thought for a moment that he had misheard her but she repeated her statement he loves you as if you were a nestmate she insisted perhaps he does not say so but all the camp knows that amberdrake and skandranon might as well have come from a single mother as his mouth dropped open a little she gurgleda gryphongiggle and the first sound of happiness he had heard from her yet i heard thisi heard him tell some of the captains that you were a being of great integrrrity you what he said trying to picture skan doing anything of the sort i heard him she said firmly and with coaxing the story emerged she had once again been eavesdropping when she shouldnt have some of the mercenary captains had been bandying about the names and reputations of several of the perchi and kestrachern and amberdrakes name had come up just as skan passed by that would have been enough to attract his attention but one of the captains had called out to him tauntingly asking him to verify what they had heard since you know him so well and skan had indeed defended amberdrakes problematical honor at the cost of some ridicule which skan hated worse than cold water so zhaneel concluded you see amberdrake did seeand he was rather overwhelmed at this evidence of affection affection that he had hoped for but had not really believed in a kestrachern had so few friendsso few of those more than the merest of superficial acquaintances he blinked finding his eyes stinging a little amberdrake she said into the silence you are a healer he blinked his eyes clear and returned her grave stare expecting a return to the earlier topic of discussion of course skylady but she turned the tables on him and when you are hurt who heals the healer has she suddenly turned into gesten or tamsin to sense my feelings before i know them he thought startled again but he chuckled to cover his confusion and replied my lady i am not likely to be needing the services of a healer after all i do not ply my various trades on the battlefield she snorted in a way that sounded very like skan but she said nothing more and just at that moment the sentries called midnight and they both blinked in surprise half the night has gonebut why am i surprised it almost feels like half a year you should take some rest lady he said taking the halfforgotten token and putting it back in her pouch she started to protest he placed a hand on her beak to stop her it is at my discretion to determine my fee you keep this if you have some difficulty convincing your wingleader that you need special training and equipment you could use that to deal with him and when you find someone worthy of you then come to me with it and i shall turn you from simply lovely into the most breathtaking creature ever to fly her nares flushed again this time with pleasure she started to leave then paused on the threshold tugging a handsized covertfeather loose she gravely handed it to him and when you needanythingyou bring me this healer then she was gone leaving him with a slategray feather in his hand and a great deal to think about he let down the entrance flap closing his tent against the night and any observers and ran the feather between the fingers of his right hand who heals the healer five well great hero tamsin said dryly pushing his way through the tent flap i see you have a tentmate now did they discover you werent a general and you werent supposed to have private quarters skan chuckled it was amazing how much better a tiny improvement in his condition made him feel not great but less like snapping someones head off anyway no they decided that i must be lonely but instead of giving me a lithe young female they sent this disgusting heap of tattered feathers meet aubri be careful not to step in him the other gryphon in the tent swathed in bandages covering burns raised one lazy eyebrow and snorted i thought i was being punished i was put in here with you featherhead he raised his head from his foreclaws and regarded tamsin and cinnabar with a longsuffering gaze ill have you know he continued in mock aggravation he whistles in his sleep so do you skan countered i dreamed i was being attacked by a giant tonedeaf songbird and woke up to discover it was you maybe it was yourself you heard loud enough to wake yourself up i dont think so aubri countered then put his head back down on his foreclaws and pretended to sleep skan chuckled again i like him he confided to tamsin in an easilyoverheard feigned whisper but dont let him know hell get arrogant enough to be mistaken for me a single snort of derision was all that came from the sleeping aubri well you know why we are here cinnabar told him coming up behind her lover and giving him a greeting that was more than half a caress yesss skan said you are here to pretend to tend to my hurts while you put your hands all over each other tchah you lifebonded types always all over each other bad enough that as humans you are always in season and you are not aubri rumbled from the background what skan asked did i hear something no aubri replied i am asleep you heard nothing ah good skan returned his attention to the two humans who were doing their best not to break into laughter as i said bad enough that you are always in seasonbut you lifebonded types are always preening each other its enough to give an honest gryphon sugarsickness then skandranon is in no danger for he is hardly honest came the rumble skan shook his head sadly what did i tell you the lout not only whistles in his sleep he mumbles nonsense as well perhaps most of his injuries were to his rump since that is surely where his brain resides hes upset im not succumbing to his imagined charisma aubri grumbled raising his head and upset i beat him in his fledglingbaiting logic puzzles you have no logic to use lucky guesses all of them i beat urtho with them skandranon looked back to the healers chagrined cinnabar moved to the gryphons left hands moving expertly over his wing and flank gesten did a fine job with you i seeyou look very fit youll soon be in good enough shape to dazzle all the potential mates you like skan are you finally going to take a mate skandranon flicked his wings suddenly and stabbed a glare at her which was much harsher than hed really intended he felt his nares darkening how maddening to be constantly asked that as if they had placed bets on who and when and how cinnabar bit her lip and backed off pretendingpretense that was just a little too obviousto search for something in her belt packs tamsin broke the tension by clearing his throat and pulling skans head toward him here now skan let me look at your eyes hell just think youre in love with him aubri snickered before skan could make any retort tamsin clamped skandranons beak closed with one hand and stabbed a look at him this was serious business gryphons could judge relative distance and speed from each eye independently and could clearly compare minute details of objects directly ahead the paper texture of the book skandranon had been studying for instance had been in sharp relief to him even the furrows left by the pen like many other parts of a gryphons body though the eyes were used to judge the health of the rest of the body tamsin leaned in until his face was barely inches away from the lens of skandranons right eye becoming an encompassing blur which filled most of his wide field of vision youre dilating well not as scratchy as id expect no problems with focus good depth perception from each eye with aubri themes little depth to ssstudy skandranon said dryly but yes all seems to be well enough i want to be back in action immediately therell be plenty of action for you warrior and that surely means well see you back in surgery soon enough cinnabar joked by now maars troops have stopped wagering on you they know that sooner or later every one of them will get a chance to shoot at you skandranon stood feeling more lively than before and mantled in indignation in walked an opportunity for mischief they havent killed me yet have they jewel a laden and bewildered hertasi looked at skan wideeyed having just come in bearing rolls of blankets for aubri n no she said with a nervous glance at the healers this of course was a favorite trick of the black gryphonsgetting people involved in his arguments whether they liked it or not or whether they had any knowledge of the subject at hand always fun especially when the topic of discussion was him and it had turned unflattering there you see jewel knows this was just a temporary setback and ill be back to save urthos army in no time at all he puffed up his chest feathers and struck an heroic pose oh save me from him came aubris plaintive cry tamsin and cinnabar broke up in laughter while jewel scurried about positioning the rolls of blankets for aubris comfort still bewildered by the whole scene skan of course continued to play to his audience hes unaccustomed to being near greatness skan gave aubri a lofty and condescending sidelong glance im unaccustomed to drowning in such sketil i cant stand him asleep or awake aubri moaned healers could you please either still his tongue or eliminate my hearing something anything tchah blind fledgling skandranon retorted i am forced to take up company with the unappreciative its worse than physical wounds i tell you honestly jewel paused for a heartbeat took in the tableau of laughing and posturing and evidently decided that folding fresh bandages for aubri was the right thing to do she fell into doing so with religious fervor on the far side of the tent lady cinnabar recovered from her laughter and flashed her wide grin at skandranon as tamsin tweaked skans tail tamsin then wiped his hands as if hed just finished a days work and shot a satisfied look at his lover id say our labor is done here lady hes as good as hell ever be what a sad thought aubri muttered oh please skan countered i have capacities ive boasted about for years aubri inserted quickly and never fulfilled skan decided that a quick change of subject was in order are you two keeping an eye on our lord and master he asked when urtho visited me i thought he looked underfed it hasnt been easy but ive been making certain he gets at least a bite or two out of every meal brought him cinnabar replied with a sigh and his hertasi have been bringing him meals every two candlemarks or so stillno sooner does he settle down to eat than more bad news comes from the front lines and off he goes again food forgotten hes giving more than he can afford to skan told her sitting down and becoming serious for a moment he never wanted to be a warlord he isnt suited to it hes doing well enough were all still alive cinnabar offered the only reason hes in charge is because the king folded up and all the kings men the gutless lot aubris eyes twinkled she only says that because its true but skan stuck his tongue out in distaste shes being charitable aubri when maar first swept down the border lands burned up like kindling all the barons were terrified and the kings best efforts couldnt hold them together it all fell apart and we had only urtho to turn to no one else had any knowledge of what we faced cinnabars family and a few others stood against the kingdoms dissolution the rest fled like frightened hens and were just about as witless we remembered that we serve our subjects the ones who ran served themselves and left their people crying in their wake cinnabar added we dont know what happened to most of them some had their faces changed some went mad or died most are still in hiding urtho doesnt blame them even now he told the king that maar sent a spell of fear into them however she said while rebraiding a lock of hair it seems not all of us were affected a shadow fell across the threshold and was followed a second later by a severelooking impeccably uniformed woman her brown hair was shortcut but for three thin braids trailing down her back each as long as a humans forearm all placed in mathematical precision along her smooth neck as she stepped in her hazel eyes flicked from human to gryphon to hertasi in that order she then flowed like icy water toward aubri or rather she would have flowed had she not been trying to cover a limp skan stared at her to intrude uninvited into a tent was not only rude it was dangerous when the tent contained injured gryphons yet aubri did not look surprised or even affronted only resigned may we help you tamsin asked openly astonished that the woman had not offered so much as a common greeting the woman did not even look at him no thank you healer i am here to tend to this gryphon and you arrre skandranon rumbled his tone dangerous either she did not catch the nuance or she ignored it his trondiirn winterhart of sixth wing east she replied crisplynot to skan but to tamsin as if skan did not matter his name is aubri and he has suffered burns from an enemy attack she supplied oh how nice of her shes provided us with details of the obvious as if we had no minds of our own or eyes to see with how she honors us except that she was paying no attention to the nonhumans only the humans tamsin and cinnabar what does this arrogant wench think she is urthos chosen bride but the woman was not finished ive also come to reassign you hertasi jewel your services are required in food preparation with sixth wing east report there immediately jewel gulped and blinked then nodded winterhart drew a short but obviously sharp silver blade from her glossy belt and cut one of aubris bandages free looking over the blistered skin underneath i dont think tamsin began the woman cut him off as jewel scurried out of the tent aubri doesnt require her any longer she said curtly and the sixth is shorthanded skan ignored the rudeness this time for winterhart had caught his attention sssixth wingthat of zhaneel he asked the woman looked at him as if affronted that he had spoken to her but she answered anyway yes that is an extraordinary case though she surprised us all by somehow distinguishing herself winterharts shrug dismissed zhaneel and her accomplishments as trivial rather odd weve never had a cull in our ranks before skandranons eyes blazed and he found himself lunging toward the woman cull tamsin and cinnabar held onto both of skandranons wings he repeated his incredulous question cull winterhart ignored both his obvious anger and his question instead she rebandaged aubri and held her hands over his burns even skan knew better than to interrupt a healing trance but it took him several long moments to get his anger back under control cull indeed he snorted to tamsin indignantly young zhaneel is no more a cull than i am these idiots in sixth wing dont know how to train anyone who isnt a musclebound broadwing thats their problem cull tamsin made soothing noises which skan ignored instead he watched winterhart closely the fact that this coldhearted thing was zhaneels trondiirn explained a great deal about why no one had tended to the youngsters obvious emotional trauma and low level of selfesteem winterhart simply did not care about emotional trauma or selfesteem she treated her gryphoncharges like so many catapults seeing that they were warready and properly repaired and ignoring anything that was not purely physical zhaneel needed someone like cinnabar or like amberdrake not like thiswalking icicle but she was giving aubri the full measure of her healing powers at least she was not stingy in that respect and she was good very good provided that the patient didnt give a hungclaw about bedside manner or empathy aubri was clearly used to treatment like this he simply absorbed the healing quietly and made neither comment nor complaint when she had finished but for the rest of her dutiesthose she scanted on she did not see that aubri was comfortable she did not inquire as to any other injuries he might have other than the obvious she did not ask him if there was anything he needed she sinmply gave tamsin and cinnabar another curt nod ignored skan altogether and left no one said a word well cinnabar said into the silence if that is the quality of healers these days i should have urtho look into where thatwomangot her training tamsin nodded gravely but cinnabars expression suddenly turned thoughtful odd she muttered i could have sworn id seen her before but where but a moment later she shook her head and turned to aubri and said ill have one of my personal hertasi come see to your needs until we can get jewel back for you is there anything i can do for you now aubris eartufts pricked up in surprise ahno thank you my lady he replied struggling to hide his amazement im really quite comfortable actually well if there is make sure someone sends me word having disposed of the problem cinnabar turned back to skan do you think you can keep your temper in check when that one comes back she asked if you cant ill have aubri moved so you wont have to encounter her again i wont promissssse skan rumbled but i will trrrry it was a measure of his anger that he was hissing his sibilants and rolling his rs again i wont ask more of you than that cinnabar replied her eyes bright with anger as she glanced at the stillwaving tent flap it is all i could expect from myself tamsin mumbled something perhaps he had forgotten that a gryphons hearing was as acute as his eyesight it would have been inaudible to a human but skan heard him quite distinctly i must speak with amberdrake about that one tamsin chewed his lower lip for a moment his brow wrinkled a little with worry and then sighed well greatest of the skywarriors he said lightly with a teasing glance to the side i think you wont have any real need for us in the next few hours so well go tend to those with greater hurts and smaller egos skan pretended to be offended and aubri snorted his amusement cinnabar lost some of her anger as her lover took her hand and led her out aubri settled back down wincing a little as burns rubbed against bandages skan arranged himself in his own nest of cushions with a care to his healing bones and watched his tentmate with anticipation hoping for another battle of wits but the healing had tired aubri considerably and the easing of some of his pain had only left an opening for his exhaustion to move in assassinlike to strike him down before either of them had a chance to think of anything to say aubris eyes had closed and he was whistling skan snorted told you he whispered to the sleeping gryphon at least the poor thing was finally getting some sleep skan was only too well aware that aubris sleep had been scant last night and punctuated by long intervals of wakeful painfilled restlessness skan had wondered then why his tentmates trondiirn hadnt come to ensure that the gryphon at least got some sleep well now he knew why because this winterhart doesnt care for us were just weapons to her weapons that have the convenient feature of being able to find their own targets all she cares for is how quickly she can get us repaired and back on the front line again she might as well be fletching arrows winterhart wasnt the only person in urthos forces to think that way unfortunately two of urthos commanders general shaiknam of the sixth and his nextincommand commander garber had the same attitude urthos most marvelous creations meant the same as a horse or a hawk or a hound to them if a gryphon didnt do precisely as ordered no matter if the orders flew in the face of good sense there was hell to pay obviously shaiknam picked underlings who had that same humanocentric attitude skan put his chin down on his foreclaws and brooded it wasnt often he had his beak so thoroughly rubbed in the fact that he was incredibly lucky to have amberdrake as his trondiirn and tamsin and cinnabar as his assigned healersofchoice and if anything ever happened to amberdrake icould end up with another cold unfeeling rock like winterhart and i would have no say in the matter just as i have no say in when i may sire young which commander i must serve nor any way to change battleplans if the commander does not wish a gryphons viewpoint the gryphons found themselves treated as often as not as exactly what shaiknam and his ilk thought them to be stupid animals deployable decoys with no will intelligence or souls of their own the more he brooded the more bitter his thoughts became thanks to amberdrake he had led a relatively indulged life insofar as it was possible for any of urthos combatants to be sheltered but zhaneel was an example of how a perfectly good gryphon could be turned into a selfdeprecating mess simply by neglect because too many of urthos folkand sometimes even urthotreat us as if we arent intelligent beings were things we have no autonomy from where he lay he had no trouble reading the titles on the spines of the books urtho had loaned to him biographies and diaries mostlyall humans of courseand all great leaders or leaders skan considered to be great did urtho have any notion how skan studied those books those men and women and what they did to inspire those who followed them how he searched for the spark the secret the words that turned mere followers into devotees or did he think that skan read them as pure entertainment make your motivations secret to the enemy fool them into false planning use their force against them lead them onto harsh ground hold true to the beliefs of your followers and show them the ways they may become like you lead by example those werent fictions on a page they were a way of life for those who had become legends in the past urtho knew half of these writers a quarter of them worked for him when he created us one he served urtho had learned from all of them and now so did skandranon so why must things remain the same amberdrake came awake to the smell of simmering bitteralmandcream gesten bustled about with fluid efficiency as the kestrachern awoke whistling jaunty hertasi tunes while he folded towels and polished brass pausing only to check the bitteralm pot on the brazier between tasks amberdrake couldnt help thinking of morningwrens greeting the dawn like the hertasi tale of how the sun had to be coaxed from slumber each day with music amberdrake rolled over and slid sideways stretching his legs underneath the glossy red and silver satin cover that urtho had sent to him when he had joined urthos forces as a kestrachern he curled up around a bodypillow and hoped that gesten wouldnt realize he was awake but it was too late the hertasi pulled back a corner of the blanket and offered a cup morning and daylight kestrachern much to be done as always amberdrake blinked and mumbled something that could have been interpreted as rude if it had been intelligible gesten was as unimpressed by it as hed been the last hundred times and proceeded to prop up pillows behind the healers head theres hot bread and sliced kilsie waiting outside we have three clients today losita has pulled muscles and cant take her usual clients so i accepted one of hers for us should not take long and before you ask nothing has gone wrong with skandranon he is fine and sends his best regards amberdrake took a sip of the hot frothy bitteralmandcream and smiled at gesten what would any kestrachern do without hertasi and what would he do without gesten so things are back to normal as normal as ever in a war tchah the hertasi spat and flicked his tail new orders are down from shaiknam and his second garber all hertasi of convalescing personnel are to be reassigned to more important tasks according to the judgment of the ranking human officer he thumped his tail against the bedframe i dont think urtho knows its the most stupid thing ive heard in yearswe arent tools to be traded around hertasi know their charges it takes time to learn someone and to send off a hertasi when their charge is in painits unthinkable worseits rude amberdrake finished his cupful and thought for a moment gesten apparently expected him to do something about thisan assumption that was confirmed when gesten produced amberdrakes full wardrobe for the day laid out his sandals and stood with his arms crossed impatiently tapping his foot so just how did you manage to get yourself bunged up skandranon asked his erstwhile companion when they had both finished the hearty breakfast that gesten brought them at dawn somehowpossibly from cinnabar or one of cinnabars hertasithe little fellow had learned that aubri was without an attendant and had simply added one more gryphon to his roster of duties hence the double breakfast a lovely fat sheep shared out between them with the head which skan had courteously offered to aubri and which aubri had accepted and had gesten deftly split so that each of them could share the dainty aubri had been profuse with his thanks and skan had thoughtfully kept his requests to an absolute minimum so that gesten could concentrate on aubri by the time gesten left aubri was cradled in a soft nest of featherbeds that put no pressure on his burns and the telltale signs of a gryphon in pain were all but gone how was i hurt aubri asked huh partly stupidity we were flying scout for shaiknams grunts we had one report of firethrowers coming up from behind the enemy lines but only one and you know shaiknam skan snorted derision indeed one report is not enough for him especially when it comes from a nonhuman aubri growled needless to say one report was certainly enough for us but he ignored it he didnt even bother to send out a second scout for a followup on the report the broadwing grunted a little and flexed his talons as if hed like to set them into the hide of a certain commander skan didnt blame him anyway aubri continued after a moment i was just in from my last flight and officially offduty so he couldnt order me on one of his fools errands and i figured i was fresh enough to go have a looksee for myself and i found the firethrowers all right with your tail i see skan said dryly aubri snorted laughter as tamsin arrived with cinnabar and two of the ladys personal hertasi at least shaiknam believed the evidence of his eyes and nose when i came in smoking and practically crushed him aubri chuckled you should have seen his face i set fire to his tent when i landed and i only wish i could have seen how much of it burned not as much as you or i would like aubri tamsin said by the way flaming hero weve had you reassigned for the duration of this injury anyway youre our patient now and if her royalness winterhart comes giving you orders you tell her to report to me first skan blinked in surprise it wasnt often that tamsin made room in his overcrowded schedule for a patient from another wing and another commander winterhart must have truly angered him yesterday tchah shaiknam should be set down to scrub pots a while cinnabar added wrinkling her elegant nose in distaste my family has known his since our grandfathers were children and it is a pity that anyone ever gave the creamfaced goose any vestige of authority the only thing he truly has a talent for is losing interest in one project after another and spending someone elses money tamsin reminded her she shook her head and brushed her hair back over her shoulders that was for peacetime she corrected him now he simply trades upon his fathers reputation rather than spending his fathers gold on one incomplete project after another she began telling off some of them on graceful fingers as skan and aubri listened with prickedup ears there was the theater company he abandoned with the play into rehearsals the scenery halfbuilt and the costumes halfmade they struggled on to produce the play no thanks to him but since it was written by one of his friends with more hair than wit it did not fare well and the company disbanded quickly then he set himself up as a publisher but once again when the tasks proved to entail more than an hour or so of work at a time he lost interest and left half a dozen writers wondering what would ever become of their works then there was the pleasure garden he plannedoh amberdrake knows the tale of that better than ibut it was the same old story the garden languishes weedfilled and halffinished and a number of talented folk who had turned down other offers of employment to take up with him ended up scrabbling after work and taking second and third place to those with less talent but more perception when it came to dealing with shaiknam and his enthusiasms his father was urthos first and greatest general tamsin told the two fascinated gryphons and with my own ears i have heard the man say that he is certain he is heir to all of his fathers genius as if wisdom and experience could be inherited skan laughed aloud at that i would say that shaiknam is living proof that intelligence can skip entire generations cinnabars lips twitched and her eyes gleamed with amusement well as proof that the soobservant skandranon is right this is the latest of shaiknams ordersthat hertasi of convalescing personnel are to be immediately reassigned to tasks of more immediate importance that is why i brought calla and rio right little friends she looked down fondly on the two hertasi who gave her toothy grins let some fool from sixth wing east come in here and try ordering us about said rio who like his fellow was clearly clad in the personal colors of lady cinnabars retinue well send him out of here with boxed ears youll have to share us though added calla the lady is seeing how many injured there are from shaiknams command and were to tend them all if we can you dont mind mind aubri replied clearly surprised pleased and a little embarrassed how could i mind i didnt expect any help i can only thank you and know that thanks are inadequate but both lady cinnabar and rio waved away any thanks my friends have been itching to do something besides tend to my nonexistent needs she replied if my family had not insisted that i take a retinue due my rank they would not be here at all for which we are grateful rio butted in and grateful to be able to do something useful so we will return when we know how many patients there are and see what it is you will be needing from us eh aubri nodded speechless for once it isnt surprising that shaiknam would have someone like that winterhart woman as a trondiirn tamsin observed checking skans healing bones as cinnabar and her two helpers rebandaged aubris burns with soothing creams and paddings aubri let out his breath in a hiss of pain but replied its typical of him she wont stand up to him at all thats why he picked her honestly i dont think theres a trondiirn in the army that would put up with his sketi other than her but shes just like him thinks were nothing more than selfreproducing fieldpieces were like firethrowers only better because we repair ourselves if you leave us alone long enough very efficient is winterhart efficient enough to requisition jewel as soon as she knew you were down skan observed aubri snorted surprised she left jewel with me as long as she did maybe she just didnt notice i was gone shes been quite efficient about that new order who actually issued that particular chunk of offal tamsin demanded in disgust garber shaiknams second in case you dont know him hes bythebook and every inch an officer aubris tone made it very clear what he thought of officers like garber so in the meantime those who have been injured in the front linewhere presumably shaiknam and garber never goare supposed to do without those who might serve as their hands and make their recovery more comfortable lady cinnabars cold voice told skan that there was a great deal of heat within the angrier she became the chillier her voice well just see about that skan quickly bent his head to keep from betraying his glee lady cinnabar rarely used that rank of hersshe was one of urthos most trusted advisors when she chose to give that advicebut when she did mountains moved oceans parted and strong men trembled until she was safely satisfied if it had only been a case of oneonone combat urtho could have sent the lady in against maar and been secure in the knowledge that cinnabar would return from the combat with not a single hair disarranged and maar would be on all fours following at her heels begging for her mercy but she never ever forgot courtesy even when most angry she bade aubri and skan a polite farewell instructed calla and rio to stay with tamsin to review the rest of the patients from shaiknams command and only then stalked off tamsin chuckled skan joined him aubri stared at the two of them in wonder what has gotten into you two he asked finally eaten up with curiosity skan exchanged a knowing look with tamsin a look which sent him into further convulsions of laughter skan answered for the both of them lady cinnabar has urthos ear in a way that no one else does he explained i think shes a combination of younger sister and respected teacher and when shes angryaiee she can melt glass she wont be satisfied with simply talking with urtho and getting a change in those orders shell insist on seeing garber and shaiknam and delivering a choice lecture in person by the time she is done you wont be the only one nursing a scorched tail six since gesten was obviously not going to be satisfied until after he had done something about the situation with shaiknam amberdrake put off his own breakfast until after he had a chance to schedule a conference with urtho he had hoped to simply slip in and have a quiet chat with the wizard but that was not in the stars urtho was chindeep in advisors long before amberdrake arrived at his tower and it was evident that there were other matters far more pressingor disastrousthan the assignment of a handful of hertasi the situation would probably be taken care of at least in the shortterm as soon as senior healers lady cinnabar and tamsin got wind of it it could easily be dealt with permanently later when urtho had a moment of leisure to spare and amberdrake could have that quiet word with him provided of course that lady cinnabar herself did not save amberdrake the effort and broach the subject to her kinsman that was only reasonable but gesten was not noted for taking a reasonable view when it came to things he considered important so amberdrake avoided a confrontation by avoiding him instead of returning to his tent for a solitary breakfast he went to the mess tent shared by all the kestrachern the food would be exactly the same there as he always had when he was alone gesten generally fetched it directly from the mess cooks and even though he enjoyed the peace of a meal by himself it was part of his duty as the highestranking kestrachern to spend as much time in casual company with the others as possible while the kestrachern had nothing like a regular organization it fell upon amberdrake to see that no one was overburdened that those who needed help got it and to keep this corps of support troops functioning as smoothly as the rest of the army they were all healers after all and not just of a sort they had a real impact on the combat troops a delicate undertaking being leader of a group with no leadersand not a position he would have chosen if it had not been forced upon him whatever was going on that had urtho up to his eyebrows in work hadnt yet worked its way down to the underlings it seemed the tent hadnt more than half a dozen kestrachern seated at their makeshift tables of scrap wood sipping bitteralm and conversing over bread and porridge that wasnt unusual kestrachern were not early risers given that they generally worked late into the night no one seemed overly tense or upset they all greeted amberdrake with varying degrees of respect and warmth then went back to their conversations amberdrake got himself another cup of bitteralm and a slice of bread and a hard boiled egg and took a seat near enough to all of them that he could listen in without being obtrusive two of the women had been having a particularly intense conversation soon after amberdrake seated himself it grew increasingly heated he knew both of them and neither was kaledain one was a robust redhead called incongruously enough lily the other named jaseen was a thin ethereal fragilelooking blonde who could probably have taken any man in the infantry and broken him in half without working up a sweat it was jaseen who was the angrier it seemed and all over a client who had been reassigned to lily amberdrake bent his head over his cup and listened as her voice rose from a whisper to something a great deal more public i dont care where hes been assigned or who did it she hissed you dont have the background to handle him and i do you dont have the skill lily interrupted rudely and i do that was why he was reassigned to me oh really jaseen replied her voice dripping with sweet acidity i suppose the ability to drive a man into exhausted collapse is called a skill and counts more than experience lily sprang to her feet both hands clenched into fists and her face flushed superior skill in anything is nothing to be ashamed of she cried tell her lily urged one of the bystanders as another rose from his seat and moved to jaseens side theyre taking sides its time for me to stop this amberdrake got up quickly and just in time lily pulled her arm back to deliver a slap to jaseens cheek amberdrake moved as quickly as a striking snake and grabbed her wrist before she could complete the blow what are the two of you doing he notquiteshouted bringing the argument to a sudden halt all parties involved stared at him in shock they had clearly forgotten that he was there he let go of lilys wrist her cheeks were scarlet with shame and she hid both hands behind her back he looked from her to jaseen and back again making no secret of his disapproval i know that the tension has gotten to everyone but this is no way to handle it you two are acting precisely as our critics expect us to act he accused dont you think that youre both being utterly childish bad enough that the two of you started thisbut in public in a common mess tent the healers use this tent and what would one of them have thought if he had come in here to find you two brawling over a client like a pair ofof he shook his head unable to force himself to say the word now it wasnt only lily who was flushing jaseen and the two who had taken sides in the argument had turned scarlet with humiliation as well now that he had their attention he would need to engage in a verbal dance as intricate as anything woven by a priest or a seasoned diplomat somehow he must chide both of them without touching on the tragedies that had made them kestrachern in the first place wo one knows hurt and heartache like a kestrachern his teachers had said because no one feels more pain than their own not so with us there were tragic stories behind every pair of doesoft eyes and tears behind all the comely smiles in this camp and no one knew that better than amberdrake neither of you has ever lacked for clients he scolded it is not as if you are not wellsoughtafter and if you hear anyone rating you like athletes i want to hear about it you both have the same rank you differ only in your strongest characteristics this client you argued abouthe has specific needs jaseen what comes firstyour own pride or the clients wellbeing at all costs he must never say the word poison around jaseenshe had spent three years imprisoned for poisoning her lover only to be freed when his brother confessed that he had done it by then the tender ministrations of the guards had left her a changed woman she hid behind the curtain of her hair but her blushes were still clearly visible the client she replied her voice choked with shame exactly he said sternly that is what we are all here for and what is the second rule lily lily had trained as a fighter and had served in urthos army injured and left for dead the experience had shattered her nerves and the injuries themselves left her unfit to face combat again lily had been treated as a hopeless cripple destroyed in both nerve and body until she fought her way back to what she was now she looked him in the eyes but her face was so scarlet that it matched her hair the client receives what he needs not what he wants and you mayif in your sacred judgment and not merely your opiniondeliver what he wants after he gets what he needs amberdrake told them both jaseen sniffed a little and looked up at him to see if shed had any effect on him with that sniffle of selfpity amberdrakes expression must have told her that she wasnt winning any points for she slowly raised her head and brushed her hair back although her red face was a match for lilys jaseen just now it was my judgment as it was the judgment of your old clients healer that he needed a little less cosseting and a little more spine he leveled his gaze right into her eyes so that she could not look away you are quite good at sympathy but your chief failing is that you dont know when to stop giving it sympathy can be addictive and can kill strong men as surely as a diet of nothing but sugar she whispered something inaudible but he was good enough at lipreading to know she had said only yes amberdrake he turned to lily it was your job to challenge him i hope that you didi will only know after his healer talks to me and by challenging him i dont necessarily mean physically you could even have challenged him by making him earn what he got from you the fact that she avoided his gaze told him she hadnt exactly done that we arent even primarily bedmates he reminded both of them sternly thats what makes us something more thanwhat our critics claim we are both these women had mended from their past shatterings he knew that every kestrachern in this encampment knew that if they hadnt they simply wouldnt be here theyd been given guidance in reassembling themselves from the splintered pasts fate had left them and were obligated by that training to help others as much as they had helped themselves amberdrake would not permit incompetenceand although he was not officially a leader he had that much power among the kestrachern without needing the title in his experience true leaders seldom had or needed flamboyant titles jaseen and lily bowed their heads their blushes fading yes amberdrake lily murmured you are right of course but its easy to forget sometimes with the way were treated people treat you as what they wish you were and that is not always what you are he said gently reminding them both of their pasts you must always remember what you are always and always believe in each other jaseen nodded wordlessly he raised his voice slightly so the rest of the observers could hear better whatever the kestrachern have been in the past we are now something very important to these warriors the war may turn upon what we do we are the rest after the battle and the blanket to warm them when they shiver we are comfort in the darkness when death has become far too personal we are the listeners who hear without judgment we are priest and lover companion and stranger we are all the family many of them have and something so foreign they can say anything to us they need us as they need their rations their weapons their healers keep that always in mind no matter how you are treated both of them stood taller and straighter and looked him right in the eyes several of the others nodded in agreement with his words he noted with satisfaction now lets get back to the business of living he told them you are both too sensible to quarrel over this he summoned an infectious grin for the two recent quarrelers and the others and it caught all around we could be spending our time complaining about the seasons or the weather something productive something useful with that he turned back to his own neglected breakfast to leave the two of them to patch things up on their own or notbut they were both responsible adults and he was fairly certain they would behave sensibly they whispered tensely for a few moments then took themselves elsewhere well that was fine and even if they were foolish enough to continue the quarrel so long as they did so privately amberdrake didnt care im slipping he thought as he held out his cup for a hertasi to refill rewarding the little lizard with a weak smile i would have cared a while ago i would have stayed with those two until i was certain they had reconciled their argument now im too tired to make all the world happy too tired or perhaps just too practical he used to think that everyone could be friends with everyone else if only people took the time to talk about their differences now it was enough for him if they kept their differences out of the working relationships and got the job done im settling for less these days i suppose i just pray there isnt less out there to settle for right now he couldnt have said if this lack of energy was a good thing or a bad one it just was and he harbored his resources for those times when they were really needed for his clients for urtho for skanif he spent every last bit of energy he had hed wind up clumsy at the wrong time or weak when the next emergency arose that are you amberdrake the harsh query snapped him out of his reverie and he looked up a little startled a young man stood over him a healer by his green robes and a new one by the pristine condition of the fabric the scowl he wore did nothing to improve his facea most unlikely healer who stood awkwardly held himself in clumsy tension whose big bluntfingered hands would have been more at home wrapped around the handle of an ax or guiding a plow his carrotcolored hair was cut to a short fuzz and his blocky face wellsprinkled with freckles was cleanshaven but sunburned not the sort one thought of as a healer well then but neither was i are you amberdrake the youngster demanded again those heavy hands clenched into fists they said you were amberdrake didnt bother to ask who they were he saw no reason to deny his own identity i am sir he said instead with careful courtesy what may i do for you i must warn you my client list is fairly long and if you had hoped to make an appointment make an appointment the boy exploded not a chance i want you to take my patient off that socalled client list of yours what in the name of all thats holy did you think you were doing taking a man thats just out of his bed and the young healer continued on in the same vein for some time amberdrake simply waited for him to run out of breath as his own anger smoldered dangerously the fool was obviously harboring the usual misconceptions of what a kestrachern was and compounding that error by thinking it was amberdrake who had solicited his patient for some exotic amorous activity all without ever asking anyone about amberdrake his clients or how he got them one word in the healers compound would have gotten him all the right answers amberdrake thought clenching his jaw so hard his teeth hurt one word and hed have known clients come to me not the other way around and that his patient has been sent to me for therapeutic massage by a senior healer but nono hed much rather nurse his own homegrown prejudices than go looking for the truth when the boy finally stopped shouting amberdrake stood his eyes were on a level with the healers but the outrage in them made the boy take an involuntary step backward amberdrake only smileda smile that gesten and tamsin would have recognized then they would have gleefully begun taking bets on how few words it would take amberdrake to verbally flay the poor fool youre new to urthos camp arent you he asked softly a sentence that had come to represent a subtle insult among urthos troops it implied every pejorative ever invented to describe someone who was hopelessly ignorant impossibly inexperienceddryseed greenie wetbehindtheears clodhopper milkfed dunce countrycousinand was generally used to begin a dressingdown of one kind or another the boy had been with the troops long enough to recognize the phrase when he heard it he flushed and opened his mouth but amberdrake cut him off before he could begin ill make allowances for a new recruit he said acidly but i suggest that you never address another kestrachern in the tones you just used with menot if you want to avoid getting yourself a lecture from your senior healer and possibly find yourself beaten well enough your own skills wouldnt help you did you even bother to ask why your patient was sent to me for your information your patient was assigned to me by senior healer mlaud for therapeutic massage and i had to seriously juggle my overcrowded schedule to fit him in i am doing you a favor the man needs treatments that you have not been trained to give if you had tried you probably would have injured him if you had bothered to ask your senior healer why he had scheduled this patient for other treatments instead of barging in here to insult and embarrass me you would have been told exactly that the boys mouth hung open and his ears reddened his eyes were flat and expressionless he had been taken so much by surprise furthermore amberdrake continued warming to his subject if you had taken the time to ask your senior healer why anyone would send a patient down the hill here to the kestrachern for treatment you would have learned that we are considered by all the senior healers to be healers with skills on a par with their ownand that there are some things that you with all your training will never be able to supply that a kestrachern can our preliminary training is identical to yourswith the exception that most kestrachern dont have the luxury of healing gifts to rely on we have to do our job with patience words and physical effort healing means more than mending the body young manit means mending the heart the mind and the spirit as well or the body is useless that doesnt make us better or worse than you just different just as there are times when you heal what we cannot so there are times when we can mend what you cannot you would do well to learn that and quickly inexperience can be overcome ignorance be enlightened but prejudice will destroy you he allowed his anger to show now a little this war is not forgiving of fools the healer took another involuntary step back his eyes wide and blind with confusion amberdrake nodded stiffly i will see your former patient at the arranged time and if you wish to overrule it i will speak with urtho personally about the matter the word of healer mlaud should take precedence over your objections and with that he turned and left the tent too angry to wait and see if the boy managed to stammer out an apology and in no mood to accept it if he did he returned to his tent knowing that it would be empty while gesten made his own rounds up on healers hill that was good he didnt really want anyone around at the moment he needed to cool down to temper his own reaction with reason he shoved the tent flap aside and tied it closed clear warning to anyone looking for him that he did not want to be disturbed once inside he took several deep breaths and considered his next action for a moment letting the faintlyperfumed twilight within the tent walls soothe him there were things he could do while he thought plenty of things he normally left to gesten mending for one gesten would be only too pleased to discover that chore no longer waiting his attention fine he passed into the inner chamber of the tent where no client ever came to his own bed and the minor chaos that gesten had not been able to clean up yet clothing needing mending is in the sage hamper he gathered up a number of articles with popped seams and trim that had parted company with the main body of the garment fetched the supply of needles and thread out from its hiding place he settled himself on a pile of cushions where the light was good and began replacing a sleeve with fine precise stitches the chirurgeons that had been his teachers had admired those stitches once upon a time no one knows hurt and heartache like a kestrachern because no one has felt it like a kestrachern if he had told the boy that would the young idiot have believed it what if i had told him a storyonce on a time there was a kaledain family living far from the camps of their kin his family who with several others had accepted the burden of living far from the clans in the land once named tantara and a city called therium they had accepted the burden of living so far away so that the kaledain would have agents there his family had become accustomed to the ways of cities after living there for several generations and had adopted many of the habits and thoughts of those dwelling within them they became a kaledain family who had taken on so many of those characteristics that it would have been difficult to tell them from the natives except for their coloringunmistakably kaledain with black hair deep amber skin and blue blue eyes once upon a time this was a family who had seen the potential for great empathic and healing power in one of their youngest sons and rather than sending him back to the clans to learn the oldfashioned ways of the kaledain healers had instead sent him farther away to the capital of the neighboring country of predain to learn modern medicine he took a sudden sharp breath at the renewed pain of that longago separation it never went away it simply became duller a bit easier to endure with passing time they thought they were doing the right thing everyone told me how important it was to learn the most modern methods everyone told me how important it was to use the gifts that i had been bom with i was only thirteen i had to believe them the only problem was that the college of chirurgeons was so modern it didnt believe in empathy healing or any other gift the chirurgeons only believed in what they could see weigh and measure in what anyone with training could do and not just those with some socalled mystical gifts the predain college of chirurgeons did provide a good solid grounding in the kinds of healing that were performed without any arcane gifts at all amberdrake was taught surgical techniques the compounding of medicines from herbs and minerals bonesetting diagnoses and more and if he had been living at home he might even have come to enjoy it but he was not at home surrounded by the sick and injured sent far away from anyone who understood himin his first year he was the butt of unkind jokes and tricks from his fellow classmates who called him barbarian and he was constantly falling ill the gift of empathy was no gift at all when there were too many sick and dying people to shut out and the chirurgeons that were his teachers only made him sicker misdiagnosing him and dosing him for illnesses he didnt even have and on top of it all he was lonely with no more than a handful of people his own age willing even to be decent to him sick at heart and sick in spirit little wonder he was sick in body as well he had been so sick that he didnt even realize how things had changed outside the collegehad no inkling of how a mage named maar had raised an army of followers and supporters in his quest for mundane rather than arcane power he heard of maar only in the context of maar says when one of his lessfriendly classmates found some way to persecute him and felt the need to justify that persecution from those chancefallen quotes he knew only that maar was a wouldbe warrior and philosopher who had united dozens of warring tribes under his fist making them part of his superior breed proponents of superiorbreed theories had come and gone before attracted a few fanatics then faded away after breaking a few windows all the teachers said so when he asked them isaw no reason to disbelieve them amberdrake took his tiny careful stitches concentrating his will on them as if by mending up his sleeve he could mend up his past he had paid no real attention to things happening outside the college he didnt realize that maar had been made prime minister to the king of predain he was too sunk in depression to pay much attention when the king died without an heir leaving maar the titular ruler of predain king maar the warriorking but he certainly noticed the changes that followed kaledain and other foreigners throughout predain were suddenly subject to more and more restrictions where they could go what they could do even what they were permitted to wear inside the college or out of it wherever he went he was the subject of taunts and once or twice even physical attacks by then the teachers at the college were apologetic even fearful of what was going on in the greater world they protected him in their own way but the best they could do was to confine him to the college and its grounds and they were bewildered they had paid no attention to maar and his ruffians and now it was too late to do anything about them intellectual problems they understood but a problem requiring direct action left them baffled and helpless and in that how unlike urtho they were the restrictions from outside continued turning him into a prisoner within the walls of the college he stopped getting letters from his family he was no longer allowed to send letters to them iwas only fifteen how could i know what to do then he heard the rumors from the town overheard from other students frightened for themselves maars men were deporting the foreigners and taking them away and no one knew where ill terrified and in a panic he had done the only thing he could think of when the rumors said maars men were coming to the college to sift through the ranks of students and teachers alike for more decadent foreigners he ran away that very night with only the clothes on his back the little money he had with him and the food he could steal from the college kitchen in the dead of winter he fled across country hiding by day traveling by night stealing to eat all the way back to therium he spent almost a week in a fevered delirium acting more like a crazed animal than the moody but bright young healerstudent he was he was captured by town police twice and escaped from them the first time by violence the second time by trickery before he was halfway home his shoes made for town streets had split apart leaving his feet frozen and numb while he slogged across the barren countryside he had stolen new shoes from farmhouse steps hearing more of the rumors himself as he eavesdropped on conversations in taverns and kitchens then from many of his hiding places he saw the reality maar was eliminating anyone who opposed his ruleand anyone who might oppose war with the neighboring lands he had mastered the army and augmented it with officers chosen from the ranks of his followers maar intended to strike before his neighbors had any warning of his intentions maar was making himself an emperor and at home indeed as the students had saidall the foreigners were being rounded up and taken away sick with fear and guilt amberdrake hid in the daylight hours in an abandoned house with a brokendown door maars troopers had been there first and when night came he took whatever food he found there and continued his flight looting the bones of the lost may they forgive me it would have been a difficult journey for an adult with money and some resources with experience it was a nightmare for amberdrake the bulk of his journey lay across farmlands forests grazing lands most of the time he went hungry and slept in ditches and under piles of brush small wonder that when he stumbled at last into therium he burned with fever again and was weak and nauseous with starvation icame home and i found an empty house in a city that was in a panic maars troops were a day behind me no one knew what had become of his family no one cared what became of him he found the neighbors preparing to evacuate piling their wagon high with their possessions they had no time for him these folk who had called themselves friends and who had known him all his life ibegged them to tell me where my family was i went to my knees and begged with tears pouring down my face i knelt there in the mud and horse dung and falling snow and pleaded with them they called me vile namesand when i got to my feet old sorrow bitter sorrow choked him again blinded his eyes until he had to stop taking his tiny stitches and wait for the tears to clear inever knew till then what alone truly meant father mother firemare starsinger little zephyrgone all goneuncle silverhorn star gem windsteed brightbird he had flung himself at the false neighbors and they had shoved him away and then raised the horse whip to him one blow was all it took and the world and sky disappeared for amberdrake he awoke bleeding at least a candlemark later with a welt across his chest as thick as his hand halfmad with terror and grief he staggered on into the snow he fell against the side of another wagon full of escapees the wagon belonging to the kestrachern silver veil and her household and apprentices he forced his hands to remain steady this is the past i cannot change it i did what i could i tried my best and how was i to know what maar would do when older and wiser folk than i did not silver veil did not send her servants to drive him away although by now he hardly knew what was happening to him in pain freezing and burning by turns he barely recalled being taken up into the moving wagon falling into soft darkness in that darkness he had remained for a very long time his hands shook and he put the mending down closed his eyes and performed a breathing exercise to calm himselfone that silver veil herself had taught him in fact he had heard of her in rude whispers before he had been sent away as little boys on the verge of puberty always did his gang of friends spoke about her and boasted how they would seek her out when they were older and had money she was as beautiful as a statue carved by a master sculptor slim as a boy graceful as a gazelle she took her name from her hair a platinum fall of silk that she had never cut that trailed on the ground behind her when she let it fall loose he had always thought she was simply a courtesan more exotic and expensive than most but only that it took living within her household to learn differently she tended him through his illness she and her household he posed as one of her apprentices as they made their way to some place saferand then after a time it was no longer a pose silver veil did her best to shelter her own from the horrors of that flight but there was no way to shelter them from all of it she had no gifts but she had an uncanny sense for finding safe routes unfortunately many of those lay through places maars troops had lately passed maars forces were not kind to the defeated they were even less kind to those who had resisted them amberdrake still woke in the night sometimes shaking and drenched with sweat from terrible dreams of seeing whole families impaled on stakes to die nearly as terrible was the one time they had been forced to hide while maars picked menand his makaarforce marched a seemingly endless column of captives past them amberdrake had watched in shock from fear and dread searching each haggard face for signs of his own kin was it a blessing he had not seen anyone he knew or a curse silver veil plied her trade as they fledsometimes for a fee but just as often for nothing for the sake of those who needed her and sometimes as a bribe to get her household through one of maars checkpoints the apprentices amberdrake among them tried to spare her that as much as possible offering themselves in her place often as not the offer was accepted for there was something about silver veil that intimidated many of maars officers she was too serene too intelligent too sophisticated for them it was by no means unusual to find that the man they needed to bribe preferred something lessrefinedthan anything silver veil offered and finally as spring crept cautiously out of hiding they came out into lands that were in friendly hands but when silver veil reviewed her options she learned that they were fewer than she had hoped soon she knew that she must seek a road that would take her away from the likeliest direction his family had takenback to kavenusho the land of the kaledain and once again she provided for young amberdrake she found another kestrachern to take him as an apprentice and be his protector one who would be willing to go with him to kavenusho this time the kestrachern was old mostly retiredand unlike silver veil lorshallen shared with amberdrake the gifts of healing and empathy silver veil took a tearfilled leave of him and his new mentor and she and her household fled on into the south one of the apprentices claimed that she had a place waiting for her in the train of one of the shamankings there in a land where winter never came amberdrake hoped so he had never heard anything more of her the war encroached as silver veil had known it would and amberdrake and his new mentor lorshallen fled before it lorshallen taught him everything he knew about his ancient art amberdrake learned it all with a fierce desire to master each and every discipline all the things that the chirurgeons had not believed in he mastered under lorshallens hands and he in his turn taught lorshallen the things that they had known silver veil had completed his erotic education and had done her best to heal his body lorshallen completed his education as a healer and had done his best to heal amberdrakes mind and heart eventually they came to the clans and amberdrake briefly took his place among his own people an honored place for the kaledain knew the value of a kestrachern particularly one as highly trained as amberdrake and they respected the pain he had gone through the kaledain had a deep belief that no pain was meaningless something always came of it he knew that tales of what he had gone through were whispered around cookfires although such a thing was never even hinted at to him those in pain could look for strength to someone who had suffered more than they always he searched for word of his family his people understood for to a kaledain the clan is all the clan he settled among kleshya did their best sending out messages to all the rest looking into every rumor of refugees searching always for word of kestrachern amberdrakes lost family and they never found it in a nation of closeknit families i remain alone always alone there will be no brother to share mantalk with no sister to comfort for her first broken heart no father to nod with pride at my accomplishment no mother to come to for advice no cousins to ask me to stand as kinnext at a naming ceremony for a child and when i die it will be to go alone into that last great darkness ihave lost so much that sometimes i think i am nothing inside but one hollow husk an emptiness that nothing will ever fill still i try to bail in more and more hope in hope that the sorrow will seep out when the call came for volunteers from the mage of silence amberdrake answered at once at least he would no longer be surrounded by clans and families to which he would never belong but by others torn from their homes and roots and he would fight maar in his own way with his own skills eventually all of the clans came to settle at the base of urthos tower but by then he had already carved his place among the kestrachern he shook his head and bit his lip gesten might think he was blind to the workings of his own mind but he knew why he felt the way he did about skan the black gryphon and gesten had become the closest thing he had to a family now and the closest thing i am ever likely to have whenbest say ifa kestrachern ever found a mate it was nearly always someone from within the ranks of the kestrachern no one else would understand no one else would ever be able to tolerate sharing a mate with others but for such a pairing to work it had to be between equals the altercation between jaseen and lily had only shown how easily quarrels could spring up over a client and if one kestrachern in a pairing was of a higher rank than another such quarrels and even deadlier jealousy were more than likely they were inevitable beneath the surface of every kestrachern amberdrake had ever met was a lurking fear of inadequacy so unless both in a pairing were equal the lesser would eventually come to envy and fear the greater and fear that his or her own skills would not be enough to hold the partner amberdrake was the equal of no kestrachern here that was an established fact and it meant even temporary liaisons must be approached with great caution which left him even more alone even more aloneno this is ridiculous if i were a client id be told to stop feeling sorry for myself and concentrate on something that would make me feel good or at least stop me from being engulfed by the past the sleeve was done he picked up a second garment and began sewing a fringe of tiny beads back in place thousands of tiny beads had been strung into a heavy glittering fall of color in luxurious imitation of a kaledain dancing costume where the fringe would be made of dyed leather it was a task exacting enough to require quite a bit of concentration and with gratitude he lost himself in it until someone scratched at the tied flap of the tent door and he looked up in startlement the silhouetted shadow on the beige of the canvas was human not that of a hertasi now what he wondered but put his mending down and rose to answer it he was a little disconcerted to find yet another young healeranother stranger and another newcomerwaiting uneasily for him to answer the summons are youahamberdrake the youngster asked blushing furiously theahkeskeskes yes i am kestrachern amberdrake he replied with a sigh how may i help you the youngsterbarely out of a scrawny gawky adolescence and not yet grown into the slender and graceful adult amberdrake saw signs he would becomestared down at his shoes iahhave a patient and my senior healer said my patient needs to see you and if i wanted to know whyi ah should ask you myself and who is your senior healer amberdrake asked a little more sharply than he had intended mlaud came the barely audible reply at that amberdrake came very near to destroying the poor lad with a bray of laughter after having sent one of mlauds juniors up the hill with his tail on fire the senior healer had evidently decided to teach his juniors about kestrachern directly but he kept control of himself and when the lad looked up it was to see a very serene countenance a mask that would have done silver veil herself proud come in please amberdrake said calmly i think you are probably laboring under a great many misconceptions and i would be most happy to dispel those for you when he held the tent flap wide and gestured the boy had no choice but to come inside amberdrake noted with amusement how the youngster stared around him while trying not to look as if he was doing so what does he expect to see never mind i think i can guess take a seat please he said gesturing to a hassock at a comfortable distance from the cushion he took for himself i take it that you are afraid that i am going to hurt your patient is that true at the boys stiff nod he smiled i take it also that you have never had the services of a kestrachern yourself of course not the young healer blurted with indignation then realized how rude that was and winced but amberdrake only chuckled young manwhat is your name anyway lanz came the gurgled reply well lanzby now i should think that mlaud has made you aware that the preliminary training for healers and kestrachern is practically identical and i know i began my training as a healer amberdrake raised his eyebrow at the boy who gaped at him but why didnt youi meanwhy a kestrachern lanz blurted again you sound as if you were saying why a chunk of dung do you realize that amberdrake countered when you consider that the kaledain rank the kestrachern with shaman thats not only rude thats likely to get you attacked at least by anyone in the clans lanz hung his head and said something too smothered to hear but his ears and neck turned as scarlet as amberdrakes favorite robe iseem to be making a great many people blush today another gift lanz most of the reasons i became a kestrachern are too complicated to go into for the most part but i can tell you the only simple one i am also empathic too strong an empath to be of any use as a conventional healer amberdrake nodded as lanz looked up cautiously from beneath a fringe of dark hair that doesnt mean i became this because i am afflicted by some horrible mental cursebut as a kestrachernwell i never see those who are so badly injured that their physical pain overwhelms everything else but i can use my gifts and my training to heal the deeper and more subtle pains injuries of mind body and heart they may not even be aware they have but not all kestrachern are healers lanz said doubtfully or empaths amberdrake smiled that is true most of them are not and those who have no gifts must work the harder to learn how to read the languages of body and tone to see the subtle signals of things that the gifted can read directly as lanzs blushes faded he allowed himself a chuckle my friend there is one thing that the kestrachern have learned over the centuries people who believe they are coming to someone only for an hour or two of pleasure are far more likely to unburden themselves than people who are confronted with a healer or other figure of authority if we honeycoat the healing with a bit of enjoyment of physical pleasure wheres the harm nowis your patient the last one on my roster tonight i think so lanz sat up a little straighter now and he had lost some of the tension in his body that had told amberdrake that the boy was afraid of him mlaud sent me a briefing on her the reason she is coming to me is that she is under some kind of great inner tension that mlaud has been unable to release as well as some severe battlefield trauma and that is making it impossible for her damaged body to heal lanzs face lit up and amberdrake decided that he must have thought her failure to heal was his fault mlaud suspects that she suffered some kind of abuse in her childhood which is the real root of her problems essentially she is unconsciously punishing herself for being such a bad person that she deserved abuse he sighed and shook his head i know that this makes no sense but this is something that kestrachern in particular see and hear all the time and it is not something you have any chance of dealing with for i greatly doubt you would ever get her to trust you enough not because you are not trustworthy but simply because of her own problems you have other responsibilities to take your time and you are less experienced with this kind of problem than i i am a stranger and it is often easier to say terrible things to a stranger than it is to someone who has known you for the stranger will not prejudge i will not be anywhere near the front lines ever and thus she will know that i have no chance of being cut down by the enemy i become safe to think of as a friend because she knows she will not lose me lanz shifted a little in his seat looking rather doubtful and amberdrake decided to overwhelm him just a little hereill prove it to you he said in an authoritative voice and he recited the litany of all the formal training hed had first with the chirurgeons then silver veil and finally lorshallen it took rather a long time and before he was finished lanzs eyes had glazed over and it looked to amberdrake as if the poor boys head was in quite a spin you see he finished if youve had half that training id call you a good healer i never knew the youngster said in a daze and when karly came up the hill from talking to you karly the redhead amberdrake threw back his head and laughed shyly lanz joined in the laughter i heard that one of the other senior healers said i hope he has a regular bedmate because after talking to amberdrake the way he did there isnt a kestrachern in all of the camp wholl take him for any price i suppose he was awfully rude to you rude amberdrake replied that doesnt begin to describe him still karly neednt worry were obligated to take those in need and i cant imagine anyone more in need ofour servicesthan he is lanz smiled shyly and karlys rather thick he offered after talking to youyou being so kind and allwell if you take any of my patients i think im going to be awfully grateful and kind of flattered this time amberdrakes smile was as much full of surprise as pleasure thank you lanz i will take that as a very high compliment can i offer you anything the boy blinked shyly i dont suppose a cup of bitteralm would delay me muchand could you tell me a little more about some of the others down here amberdrake rose and lanz rose with him why not come with me to the mess tent and see for yourself he asked i thinki will lanz replied as if he was surprised by his own response by such little victories are wars and hearts won amberdrake thought with a wry pleasure as he led the way seven zhaneel flexed her talons digging them into the wood of her enormous blockperch she checked over her harness againwirescissors bolts spikes ropeknife preknotted ties all sized for her large stubby handsand stared out over the obstacle course she herself had set up the course covered several acres by now built mainly in erosion trenches and brookcut hollows that were of little value to anyone in urthos camp dotted with fallen trees and sandstone boulders to get from here to the end of it she would have to fly dodge crawl and even swim there were water hazards fire hazards missiles lobbed by catapult and now magic she had already gotten the help of amberdrakes hertasi gesten in this endeavor hed been there from the very beginning somehow he had known perhaps through amberdrake what she was going to attempt he had never asked her why he simply showed up unasked acted as her hands then found three others to aid him in setting up the course and in triggering the hazards at first no one had paid any attention to what she was doing but gradually her runs attracted a small audience at first this had bothered her until the day when after several unsuccessful tries at passing a hazard of simulated crossbow bolts she made it through untouched and the tiny group applauded wildly that was when she realized that they were not there to make fun of her but to cheer her on she had honestly not known what to make of that it bewildered her why should anyone take an interest in her then again she had never been able to effectively figure out why hertasi and humans did most things but today she had a larger audience than ever before and she knew precisely why this time word had spread that her obstacle course included magic she hadnt planned on including magical traps those took effort and much energy and she had never for a moment believed that there was any mage in the entire camp willing to devote so much as a candlemark of practice time to helping her or so she had thought until a few days ago a young mage a journeyman named vikteren approached her for help he needed spellcomponents stillliving spellcomponents which were not at all interested in becoming components of anything zhaneels speed and agility were what caught his attention speed and agility were precisely what he lacked in going after starlings rabbits and other small swift creatures so they struck a bargain she would hunt for him and he would provide her with magical obstacles he had been doing so for several days now and he had told her yesterday grinning that he was very impressed actually what he had said was youre good gryphon very damned good so much to her shock and amazement had the gryphons trainer taran shire the day after vikteren began helping her taran showed up on the sidelines now along with the young journeyman the seasoned trainer joined her every day working with her on his own time she tried to put her audience out of her mind although that was far from easy her own kind were out there other gryphons those from other wings as well as her own and what was more some of those same gryphons had taken to training on the course and leaving her tokens of appreciation every time she made a pass on the course people cheered her efforts from hertasi to humans from gryphons to a lone kyree who seemed to find her fascinating now they waited for her to start yet again a white and red striped flag midway down the course went up and waved twice and she launched from the block this was a rescue mission to free a captured gryphon the details had been kept secret at her request so she had only a general idea what to expect one thing she knew for certainvikteren and the hertasi planned to make her work harder than ever before the first danger came only twelve wingstrokes after startinga sudden gust of wind from her right it hit her hard and pushed her toward a downed trees spidery limbs an easy place to lose feathers and find lacerations she reacted by rolling in midair and grounding folding her wings in tightly while she clutched at stones and brush the wind gusts ceased and zhaneel leapt over a ravine to the cheers of the audience she crept into the next erosion channel popping her head up every few seconds to look for danger a quick bolt of fire shot toward the ravine from behind a boulder and was followed by a huge fireball that roared like a sustained lightning strike it burned slowly through the ravine catching the underbrush afire she heard the audience gasp even over the roar as zhaneel scrambled out of their line of sight disappearing from their view she knew what was in their minds had the game gone too far but she couldnt worry about them theyd see her soon enough she popped up again at the far end of the adjoining erosion cut she leapt to the sandstone boulder with a growl and drew her ropeknife on the surprised mage hiding behind it hah hello vikteren you die she sang out and vikteren grinned and fell backward im dead here he reminded her as he stood up and brushed off his robes see you further on maybe you might not see me at all dead body she laughed then sheathed the knife there was a mission to accomplish a gryphon to rescue and the adventure had barely begun amberdrake felt like a proud and anxious father as he watched the young gryphon waiting on her blockperch every line and quivering muscle betrayed her tension and her concentration he had arrived after she took her position but still managed to commandeer a place in the front beside skan the black gryphon had recovered nicely from his injuries although on the orders of lady cinnabar he was still officially convalescing he was keeping an uncharacteristically low profile howeveras if he were afraid his presence would distract the young female at some crucial moment well it might the youngster had been patently overawed by the black gryphon if she knew he was watching she might well lose her concentration skans tail twitched impatiently but as amberdrake put a comradely hand on his shoulder he gave amberdrake a sideways gryphgrin before riveting his attention on the distant gray and buff figure of zhaneel at the end of the course a flag dropped zhaneel left the block with a leap followed by an audible snap of wings opening amberdrake had never seen a gryphon run an obstacle course before though hed heard from gesten that skan had been out here to watch for the past three days in a row he hadnt been able to imagine what kinds of obstacles could be put in front of a gryphon whose aerial nature made ordinary obstacles ridiculous he was impressed both with zhaneels ability to create the course and her ability to run it more to the point so was skan he gasped with the others when it appeared briefly that a rolling fireball had accidentally engulfed her he hadnt realized that there would be some hazards on this course that were real and not just illusions he sighed with relief when she reappeared and cheered when she killed someone a journeyman mage by his clothing skan remained absolutely motionless except for the very end of his tail which flopped and twitched like a fish on land like a cat the end of his tail betrayed his mental state well every other gryphon in the audience was watching her closely too gryphons were by nature impressed with any kind of fancy flying it was part of courtship and mating after all but none of the others had quite the same rapt intensity in their gaze as skan did in point of fact he looked as much stunned as enraptured rather as if hed been hit in the back of the head with a club amberdrake smothered a chuckle when he realized that skans eyes had glazed over poor black gryphon he was used to impressing not being impressed zhaneel neatly dodged a set of ambushes crossbow bolts dropping nets and an illusion of fighters shes good isnt she he said feeling incredibly proud of her she wasnt just good she was smooth she integrated her movements flowing from flight to ground and back again seamlessly shes beautiful skan rumbled absently justbeautiful his beak gaped a little and amberdrake had to choke back another laugh so the great black gryphon was a little bit more than simply impressed was he well fancy flying was the gryphon equivalent of erotic dance skan he muttered under his breath youre going to embarrass both of us that tongue looks really stupid sticking out of the corner of your beak skandranon hadnt realized that he was making his interest in zhaneel quite so obvious pull it in skan amberdrake muttered insistently and annoyingly but that was the privilege of an old friend better him than anyone else though there were plenty of other folk who enjoyed a chance to get a jab in why give them more fuel for their fires more to the point such teasing might be turned against zhaneel and he already knew that her fragile selfesteem would not survive it he wasnt even certain shed recognize teasing if she encountered it one of the second wing west gryphons a female named lyosha sidled up beside him and preened his neckruff briefly it was a common enough sort of greeting between gryphons one which could lead to further intimacies or simply be accepted as a greeting and nothing more he and lyosha had flown spirals together before and she was obviously hoping the greeting would lead to the former but he was not interested this time not with zhaneel dancing her pattern with danger before his eyes lyosha he said simply acknowledging her presence in a friendly manner but offering nothing more this is fascinating lyosha gave his feathers one last nibble then subsided with a sigh true enough she replied with resignation im tempted to start running this course myself its enough to set a gryphons tail afire he ignored the hint and coughed politely well he said his eyes never leaving zhaneel if shes not careful the tail thats afire may be hers and let lyosha make of that what she will zhaneel slunk over a decaying tree trunk toward four upright sacks of hay the sacks had been clustered around a burning campfire and wore discarded uniforms a sign next to them read off duty talking eating next to them was a midsized tent and pickets for four horses but no horses were there tent is big enough to hold ten four here four horses gone may mean eight four still out or on mission maars squads are eight and one officer but officers get separate tents where is the officer then and the others zhaneel drew her handcrossbow a tug with her beak and it was cocked for a bolt to be laid in the track she pulled one from her harness and laid it in ready to fire use the cover you have available steady with solid object she lowered herself behind the trunk braced the handcrossbow on the crumbling barkand fired the shaft hit the sack on the far left and she hastily drew a second bolt while reading the weapon with her beak the second shot hit the next sack dead center and pitched it forward into the fire she then snapped the handcrossbow onto its tensionbuckle and leapt over the tree trunk to maul the remaining two sacks of hay that was when the barrage began the treeline to her left erupted with slung stones as the hidden miniature siege engines on the right shredded their foliage zhaneel powerstroked high into the air and avoided major damage although some of the stones stung her on the feet and flank that put her in the open for the fan of firebolts from the hillside where she saw her objectivea gryphon a real gryphon under a wire net staked out in a very unflattering position oh no i hadnt asked for that so vikterens promised surprise was that she wouldnt be rescuing a bundle of cloth called a gryphonshe would have to deal with an actual one but if vikteren had gotten the cooperation of a gryphon as a prisoner then what else could he have a whistling flash from the sky was her only warning two broadwingsfrom fourth wing west by their wingtip markingsstooped down on her they trailed white ribbons from their hind legssparring markers simulated makaar so be it amberdrakes hand tightened on skans shoulder and he felt skans muscles tense up underneath his fingers the two makaar swooped down on zhaneel from above and he could not see any way that she could escape them he couldnt but she most clearly did she duckedand rolled so that the makaar missed her by a scant talonlength as they shot past her she leapt up into the air behind them by luck or incredible timing she snagged the trailing white streamer of one and ripped it off the dead makaar spat out a goodnatured curse and a laugh then obligingly kited out of the way of combat it was a good thing he did so because zhaneel had shot skyward gaining altitude and speed and was just about to turn to make a second attack run the second broadwing had tried to pursue her but his heavy body was just not capable of keeping up with her if her objective had simply been to survive this course she would already have won but it wasnt of course she still had to free the trapped gryphon and get both of them off the course alive the trapped one was skans old tentmate aubri whose injuries still had him on the recovering list and who would not be able to move very quickly again that was a reflection of reality any gryphon held captive would be injured perhaps seriously and his speed and movement would be severely limited aubri had volunteered for the ignominious position he was currently in partly out of boredom partly out of a wish to help zhaneel and partly because it pleased him to irk their commander in every way possible and zhaneels success in these special training bouts must be irking the very devil out of their commander who could hardly encompass the notion that a gryphon might have a mind of her own and must be in knots over one who had ideas of her own zhaneel wheeled and started her dive the makaar who had been trying vainly to pursue her suddenly realized that although he would be more than a match for her in a straighton combat he was never going to be able to take her on in strikeandrun tactics and she was not going to let him close he turned heading for a place that amberdrake suspected held that young magewould zhaneel see it too or would she be so involved in the immediate enemy that she would forget there were others on this course like a falcon stooping on her prey her wings folded tightly along her back and she held her talons up against her bodybut unlike the broadwings who held their talons ready to strike and bind hers were fisted she had learned how to knock her foes out of the sky once and now it was second nature to herwas she so caught up in the euphoria of combat that the kill was all she saw skan held his breath as zhaneel dropped down out of the sky he was certain she had forgotten the journeyman mage but he certainly had not forgotten herand the best place for him was somewhere near the stakedout prisoner she might get her immediate foe but vikteren would certainly get her but as the broadwing pumped frantically to evade her she shot past him completely ignoring him instead she stooped on an insignificantlooking mound of shrubbery leveled out into a shallow curve and buffeted it with fists and wings until the illusion of brush dissolved and vikteren tumbled out of the way laughing all right he called scrubbing dust out of his eyes with his fists holy kreeshta youve got me already give me a moment will you you die twice mage she cried as she leapt skyward again she looked around for the second makaar but the broadwing had followed the example of most makaar left to face a gryphon alone and had fled the scene his ribbon and his life intact of course unlike a real makaar he would remain unpunished for such desertion skan rumbled approval deep in his chest as she landed as close to the stakedout and netted prisoner as possiblewhich in her case was practically on top of him there were probably traps all around her but she avoided setting any of them off simply by dint of remaining within the narrow margins that humans would have used while restraining the prisoner a broadwing couldnt have pulled this off nor could a broadwing have used foreclaws as cleverly as she did snipping the wire net free with special scissors then cutting the ropes holding aubri down with a heavy knife she had already used once to good effect oh clever clever little gryphon he applauded mentally now how do you guard the back of the injured one that will be the real test zhaneels gaze darted all over aubri can you fly she asked impatiently no cant move any faster than a brokenlegged horse either and my wounds are real hey zhaneel spat a curse away from aubri and looked around for anything she could use within a few winglengths there were tree limbs and she had the lengths of rope shed just cut as well as the remains of the wire net she grasped the lengths of rope readily available coiled them up and held them to her keel two questions she said how far can you jump and can you hold a pole steady aubri narrowed his eyes obviously trying to secondguess what this odd rescuer had in mind he also just as obviously gave up could leap maybe twice my length if i had to but i wouldnt enjoy it and i can hold a pole steady i still feel strong enough to chew makaar good stay here she parted her beak in what was meant to be a reassuring smile then bunched her legs up and concentrated she leapt high into the air with her burden of cord at the zenith of her jump she powerstroked out of aubris immediate area toward the tree limbs nearby conventional gryphontraps were usually built to fire sideways across a broad area the kind she had been stung by at the fakesoldiers camp magical ones were often designed to detect a low flyer approaching shoot high up blossom and spread while falling they could kill or maim at any point after they deployed since vikterena magewas involved she had every reason to assume she would be facing both types so the best way to sweep for traps is to not be near them at all within a few minutes she had what she needed a long branch snapped off with her beak and trimmed of snags for aubri to hold at its narrowest end it forked for two clawlengths and she had carved indentations for the two branches that were now tied across it they were firmly in place now to deliver my little nestinggift a few minutes more work and the long pieces of rope were one very long length of ropeinelegant but effective zhaneel used four of her preknotted ties to bind up the foliage and small branches she had trimmed scant minutes earlier to one end of the rope she bobbed her head measuring the range to aubri and the safe ceiling she had flown at already without triggering traps then took wing the loose end of the rope clutched tightly in her hind claws magical gryphontraps are triggered by something living flying over their kill range but not always can sometimes be triggered by anythinghave to go high zhaneel circled up straining only for altitudeand it was work hard work because the higher she went the heavier the burden of the rope became finally there was a shudder as the bundles of foliage lifted she angled away from the stillperplexed aubri carrying the rope higher and higher until the bundles below were above what she had determined to be safe then she turned her struggle for altitude into an exhausting dive from the far side of the clearing toward the tied branches she judged hopedand let go the bunches of foliage sailed down heading directly for the hapless aubri behind them the rope coiled and twisted wildly gaining on the clusters of branches that had more wind resistance than the rope while zhaneel surged back up into the sky the green leaves and twigs struck aubris wings and back it was surely uncomfortable but easily less painful than anything a makaar would have done to a captive gryphon amid indignant curses from the captive the rope fell in a snaky line across the clearing as hoped no traps triggered immediately from the ropes impact next trick she landed and collected her thoughts taking deep breaths aubri glared at her indignantly but voiced no ill thoughts toward his rescuer for the moment she waved a reassurance to him looped the rope around the fork of the branchaffair shed made earlier and tied it off several heartbeats later she was in the air again with two stripped branches clipped to the back of her harness she followed the air path she knew was safe and dropped straight down to land next to aubri i assume you have a good reason for pelting me with salad he rumbled im sorry but i have a plan to get you out safely hold this she muttered while unclipping the branches from her back they scratch there now lie sideways and curl up hold these sticks up one in hindclaws one in foreclaws so both are that way she indicated the direction the rope lay be patient aubri sighed where would i go my life is yours zhaneel pulled the wire mesh until it faced as aubri did and used two more ties to anchor it to the two sticks then understanding dawned in aubris eyes as she fastened the foliage bundles to the net a shield yes not a big one but could help us she smiled and nibbled his crest reassuringly now let me down there in the hollow of your belly where the rope goes under the net aubri complied fascinated after settling herself in zhaneel reeled the rope in clawoverclaw until the heavy branches tied to the other end ground their way toward the two gryphons searching for ground traps zhaneel muttered if one goes hold tight to the sticks let me protect your belly only makes sensehe cant fly so i am as good as groundbound if i can shield him from a fatal injury by taking an injury myself we will still both be alive to return home a deep thudding sounded like a massive crossbow cord releasing and a hail of stones showered much of the clearing both gryphons squinted their eyes while pebbles struck the greenery protecting them then resumed pulling two ground panels lurched open and drove stakes into the ground nearby a few minutes later zhaneel could reach out and grasp the quarry herself last trick she patiently explained to aubri what she was doing as she worked and allowed herself a moment of satisfaction when she was done the crowd watching had approved of the way shed triggered the ground traps they waited enraptured wondering what she would do next zhaneel knew they saw her raise the canopy she had just finished made of wire net foliage and branches above aubri you must hold this steady understand must aubri nodded ygot me this far skydancer zhaneels nares blushed red and she leapt straight up gaining altitude madly when she had reached twice the height she counted as safe she rolled over on her back straightened and folded her wings in tight hurtling faster than any crossbow bolt her shadow streaked across the ground below as she flattened the dive she felt the wind cut across her body and saw the landscape become a blur as she shot across the clearing scant winglengths above the ground following the same path in the air that her sweep earlier had done on the surface behind her she could hear fireballs erupting and saw flashes of yellow light moments later she traded speed for altitude and pulled up to see sparks raining down on the entire clearingand aubris shield the improvised shield held and protected him from harm with the first victory cry she had ever uttered she closed on him to lead him from his captivity winterhart grimaced as the audience began cheering someone jostled her jarring her back and sending a jab of pain down her right leg further souring her mood garber had ordered her to come here orders she hadnt much liked and wasnt sure she agreed with right now though she wasnt very fond of gryphons it was a gryphon that had injured her back be fair it wasnt her fault shed been having backaches and ignoring themafter all who didnt have a headache or a backache by days end around here she had been restraining an hysterical and delirious broadwing with severe lacerations who had lashed out with both hind feet and sent winterhart twisting and tumbling sideways she hadnt broken anything but her back spasmed as soon as she got up and it had been getting worse not better with time she was a healer she knew she should be seeing another healer or should at least stay in bed flat for a while she was even fairly certain that she knew what was wrong but there were no healers and no time to spare so she simply hadnt mentioned it to anyone she moved as little as possible said she had sprained her back and used that as an excuse not to do things that made it hurt worse but she was in constant pain there were only two positions she could take that allowed the pain to stop and neither of them were appropriate for getting any work done it was embarrassing a healer should be able to keep herself in one piece this was altogether too much like a display of incompetence the pain wasnt doing much for her temper and getting jostled and making it worse didnt help damn garber hes right but for all the wrong reasons shed been watching zhaneel herself for several days since shed gotten wind of this obstacle course business and long before dimwitted garber had any notion tnat it was going on even before today shed found herself torn between two violently conflicting opinions on the one hand she had to admire the little gryphon obviously unsuited for combat she had found ways to make herself suited to it she had been pushing herself finding her absolute limits turning handicaps into benefits the number of things shed had to work out for herself to overcome her own deficiencies was incredible and the ingenious ways she had done so were amazing it was difficult to believe that this was the little runt garber saw no use at all for but on the other hand zhaneel was exhausting herself completely with these socalled training sessions no one had ever authorized her to do what she was doing which made them quasilegal at best but that could be ignored what could not be ignored was the fact that she had led other gryphons into trying her unorthodox tactics with very mixed results zhaneel herself had come out of these sessions with pulled muscles she hadnt come to winterhart for any help but that made no difference the gryphon had been hurt and she was the one who had invented the course and the training winterhart was afraid that one of the others was very likely to be seriously injured trying some of her nonsense even if the other gryphons didnt manage to hurt themselves on this course the fact still remained that they burned off energy and resources they might need later where it counted out on the front lines the war escalated resources diminished although it was not common knowledge urthos forces had lost ground a little more every day there was a new breed of makaar in the air now and they took a toll on the gryphons if the gryphons wasted their energy or strained themselves on this obstacle course of zhaneels they might not have that little extra they needed to survive an encounter with these new makaar garber of course only knew that the gryphon cull was doing things he hadnt ordered not so much flouting his authority as ignoring it no gryphon in sixth wing was allowed to think for itself the very idea was preposterous he was already aching with humiliation at the lecture the lady cinnabar had deliveredon urthos behalfconcerning the reassignment of injured gryphons hertasi winterhart had not been present but several who had overheard the lady had indicated she had been less than flattering concerning garbers intelligence and ability to make a sound decision then came news of zhaneel creating some unorthodox training program encouraging others to join her in it completely bypassing garbers authority this could not be permitted so he had sent the gryphons trondiirnthe lowest ranking officer in the wing she acidly reminded herselfto dress her down for it never mind that it was a successful program so far that was hardly the point winterhart threaded through the crowd more uneasy with every passing moment she did not like confrontations she particularly disliked them when there was a possible audience involved but she had direct orders she also had an exact speech delivered to her by garbers aidedecamp and duly memorized presumably the commander did not trust her to deliver a proper dressingdown or perhaps he was as contemptuous of her intelligence as he was of the gryphons abruptly she found herself in a clear space and practically nosetobeak with the runt zhaneel blinked in surprise and backed up a pace or so winterrrharrt she said blankly what do you herrrre that was all the opening that winterhart required it is more to the point to ask you what you are doing here gryphon she said coldly you are here without orders you have commandeered equipment and personnel that you have no right to and you have subverted other gryphons inside and outside of your wing into not only aiding you but following in your illconceived plans your commander is highly displeased what have you to say for yourself she expected zhaneel to behave as she always had to cower a little stammer an apology and creep off to her aerie forgetting and abandoning her ridiculous training program she had readied a magnanimous acceptance of that apology before she was halfway through her speech something that would make her look a little less like garbers mouthpiece i the cull replied and every hair and feather on her body bristled she drew herself up to her full if substandard height and looked down her beak at the trondiirn with eyes full of rage i she repeated raising her voice how isss it that i am to blame becaussse the commanderrr of sssixth wing hasss no morrre imagination than a mudturrrtle how isss it that it isss my fault that therrre isss only one trrraining progrrram for all no matter the cirrrcumssstancesss norrr if they change what isss it that i am doing wrrrong what isss it that i am doing that i ssshould be accusssed of doing wrrrong her voice rose to full volume and the audience which had begun to disperse regrouped in anticipation of another sort of spectacle it was clear in an instant that they would not be siding with winterhart i do nothing wrrrong zhaneel shouted i do what ssshould have been done that no one carrred to do and you my trrrondiirrrn you ssshould have ssseen that it needed doing by now the audience had surrounded the two of them leaving winterhart no route of escape she couldnt help herself she flushed with profound embarrassment you had no orders and no permission she began orrrderrrsss the gryphon interrupted with shrill incredulity i am on leave time thessse who help me arrre offduty what need have we of orrderrrsss of perrrmissssionsss arrre we to requessst leave to pisssss now growls from behind her a little laughter on all sides and nods and angry looks on the faces she could see winterharts face burned painfully we arrre offduty the gryphon repeated when hasss garrrberrr the might to decrrree what we do offduty he doesnt winterhart admitted reluctantly but he gave me the orders before she could say anything more a huge blackdyed gryphon with no regimental marks pushed through the crowd and faced her with challenge in every line of him then why rumbled the infamous skandranon the black gryphon dont you tell that overbearing halffledged idiot that his orders are a pile of steaming mutes youre a trondiim you have that right and duty for your gryphons she stared at him she had never heard the black gryphon speak beforeat least not more than a word or two when he had shared a tent on healers hill with her gryphon aubri he had not spoken more than a word or two in her presence at most he was either asleep or ignoring her she had no idea he was so articulate with so little gryphonic accent hearing that clear clipped voice coming from that beakit was such a shock she addressed him as she would have another human i couldnt do that she exclaimed automatically hes my superior but the black gryphon only shrugged in what way i dont see why you shouldnt tell him hes being hopelessly thick he replied i tell my superiors when theyre idiots often enough i generally tell them they couldnt tell their crest from their tailfeathers on a daily basis and that includes urtho urtho thisthis creation this construct talked back to urtho she was aghast appalled and tried to put some of that into words but all that came out was bbut thats nnot the way things are done shed stammered which made it sound all the stupider skandranon only snorted his contempt as equally contemptuous laughter erupted around the circle thats not the way you do things maybe the black gryphon replied it seems to me that the main problem we have is that there are too many officers thinking that books and noble birth give you all the answers you needand too many ordertakers who believe them without question he took a step or two closer to her looming over her and staring down his beak at her amuse me bring me up on charges you didnt even think for yourself when garber handed you that scoop of manure to deliver here didnt it ever occur to you that the real reason you were told to lecture this young lady was not that she was doing anything wrong but because she was doing something garber and shaiknam didnt think ofor stealfirst it must gall them both that what they would call a mere beast has been more clever than they were without asking for permission without being told trondiirn winterhart opened her mouth to say somethingand could not think of anything to say certainly she could not refute what the gryphon had just said hadnt she been thinking it herself and she could not bring herself to defend garber not when his aide had been condescending to the point of insulting when he had delivered those orders all she could do was to stand there with her mouth hanging open looking stupid and shamed it was zhaneel who salvaged what little was left of the situation trrrondiirrn she said crisply i will have worrrdsss with you in prrivate now winterhart took the escape narrow as it was and nodded after all there was nothing else she could do but follow but then wasnt she used to that by now eight amberdrake managed to get skan out of earshot of most of the camp before the black gryphon exploded pulling him deeply into the heart of the obstacle course and into a little sheltered area with a tree or two for shade and a rock to sit on he counted himself lucky at that this obstacle course of zhaneels was large enough for privacy even at the level of shouting skan was capable of large gryphons had large lungs the course should be safe enough with all the traps sprung and now that the show was over anyone who might happen to overhear skans outburst was likely to be sympathetic anyway up until today there hadnt been anyone unfriendly among the spectators zhaneels first show had been utterly eclipsed by her second standing up for her rights to that officious trondiirn winterhart it was nothing anyone had expected given zhaneels diffident manner up until this moment she must just have been pushed too far not surprising that woman would have pushed me over the edge even the sixth wing trainer had been disgusted with the woman and even more disgusted with garber if everyone who said they would actually did lodge a protest with urthobypassing shaiknam altogethergarber would go down on record as the commander most disliked ever even the humans had been appalled by the precedent that would be set if this action was not met with immediate protest a precedent that permitted a commanding officer to decree what could and could not be done during offduty hours well the woman had at least enough conscience left that she was embarrassed by those orders she was supposed to deliver thats about all i can say in her behalf if first impressions are important i cant say shes made a very good one on me a trondiirn should have enough fortitude to stand up for her charges not roll over and show her belly every time the commander issues some stupid order and wasnt she the one gesten told me about that ordered the hertasi to be reassigned cant she do anything but parrot whatever garber wants amberdrake took a seat on the sunwarmed rock and let skan wear himself out venting his anger he was annoyed with the woman and very put out with her commander but skandranon was enraged enough to have chewed up swords and then spit out tacks it was better for him to show that anger to amberdrake than sweep into camp and get himself in trouble it wouldnt have been the first time that his beak had dug him a hole big enough to fall into this is what i mean skan fumed striding back and forth wings flipping impatiently his talons tore up the ground with every step he took leaving long furrows in the crumbling earth this is exactly what ive been trying to tell you now you see it for yourselfthis whole sorry business we gryphons are constantly being ordered about by humans who know and care nothing about us we get chewed up trying to keep them alive and they wont let us figure out ways to keep ourselves alive damned idiots cant tell their helms from the privy and theyre trying to tell us what to do and now theyre ordering us around when were offduty and the dungheads think its their right and privilege there was more much more in the same vein amberdrake simply remained where he was on his rock nodded looked somber and made appropriately soothing noises from time to time he wished there was something else he could do but right now all he could provide skan with was a sympathetic ear he was himself too angry to do skan any good if he tried to calm the gryphon through logic games hed only let his own anger out besides skan didnt want to be calmed he wanted a target the trouble was skan was right on all counts amberdrake had seen it time and time again and it wasnt as if the gryphons had any choice they couldnt simply pack up and leave their creator no matter now onerous conditions got they were in a sense enslaved to their creator for only urtho held the secret of their fertility without that they could not reproduce without that if they left they would be the last of their kind skan knew that better than anyone else since every time he returned from a mission intact or otherwise someone asked him when he was going to pick a mate and father a brood it was a constant irritant to him he never forgot it no matter how cavalier he might seem about it and yet he had never once brought it up to urtho directly why i dont know maybe hes afraid to for all his boasting that he speaks to urtho as an equal maybe he keeps thinking that urtho will realize on his own what an injustice has been done amberdrake wished there was some legitimate way that he could calm his friend down by now skan had worked himself up into a full gryphonic ragedisplaycrest up hackles up wings mantling tearing the thin sod to shreds with his talons he agreed with the black gryphon more with every moment how could he calm skan down when he himself wanted to carefully and clinically take garber and shaiknam apart on skan and zhaneels behalf not just their behalf either how long before they try that sketi on the other troops or before they try to command the exclusive services of one or more healers or even kestrachern if theyre willing to break the rules once how many more times will they break them and then when they make the rules who can oppose them hed thought that skans display had cleared the area no one really wanted to get too near a gryphon in that state especially not when the gryphon was skandranon hed never actually hurt anyone but when he was this angry he got malicious enjoyment out of coming within a feathers width of doing so but after listening to skan for a quarter candlemark amberdrake spotted someone else storming up over the rough ground toward them short journeymans robes marking him as a mage and carrotcolored hair identifying him as vikteren hes heading straight for us good gods what now another disaster gods the young mage shouted as skan paused for breath i would have the hide off that fatuous fatbrained idiot if only i knew how to make it hurt enough garber amberdrake asked mildly gods and shaiknam vikteren said bitterly dropping his voice below a shout the young mage snatched up a fallen branch as he reached them and began methodically breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces anthills and honey spring to mindand harpstrings delicate organs and rocks i thought this bigoted business with poor zhaneel was bad enoughbut now he struggled with the press of his emotions clearly his rage was hot enough to choke him and even skan lowered his hackles and cocked his head to one side distracted from his own state of rage by seeing vikterens the youngster was one of the coolest heads in the magecorps he prided himself on his control under all circumstances whatever had happened to break that control must have been dreadful indeed what happened amberdrake asked anxiously projecting calm now as he had not with skan not much but enough to keep the young mage from exploding with temper vikteren took several long calculated breaths closing his eyes as his flush faded to something less apoplectic i heard skan just now and i have to tell you both that it isnt just his nonhuman troops that shaiknams been using up hes been decimating everyone with the same abandon i just talked to the mages from sixth command we almost lost all of sixth crimson this morning the mage included because shaiknam led them into an ambush that hed been told was an ambush by his scouts ividian covered their retreat he died covering that retreat and it was all that saved them ividian died and shaiknam reprimanded the entire company for unauthorized maneuvers and im not just livid because ividian was my friend shaiknam killed three more mages todayand he has the brass to claim it was by accident amberdrake let out his breath in a hiss his gut clenched and his skin suddenly became cold the loss of any portion of sixth crimson was terribleand the loss of their mage dreadful and all through prideful stupidity like all of shaiknams losses but what vikteren had just implied was more than stupidity he had very nearly said that shaiknam had murdered the other three mages how he asked carefully do you kill a mage by accident vikterens face flushed crimson again he forced themordered themto exhaust themselves to unconsciousness then he left them there where they fell ignored them got them no aid at all not even a blanket to cover them they died of powerdrain shock where they lay he said that there was so much going on at the time that he just forgot they were there but i heard someone say that he ordered them to be left alone said if they were such powerful and mighty mages they could fix themselves called them weaklings said they needed to be taught a lesson amberdrake and skan both growled that was more like murderbyneglect a mage worked to unconsciousness needed to be treated immediately or he would die every commander knew that even shaiknam there was no excuse none shaiknams a petty man a stupid manthe trouble is he gives petty orders that do a lot of damage vikteren finished his scarlet flush of anger slowly fading he has no compassion no sense of anything outside of his own importance no perspective at all he used those three up just so he could recoup the losses he took on the retreatjust so that he wouldnt look bad that was the only reason he ordered them to attack they fought there against ordinary troops there was no need for mageweaponry vikteren took another deep breath and dropped the splinters still clenched in his hands i came to tell you two that theres going to be a meeting of all the mages tonight were going to tell urtho that none of us are going to serve under shaiknam or any other abusive commander ever again were tired of being treated like arbalests and catapults im going to have a few things to say at that meeting and before im done youd better believe theyre going to follow my vote but you wont have a vote amberdrake protested youre just an apprenticewell a journeyman but but vikteren snorted hah im not a journeyman im a full master mage at the least but my master never passed me up he saw who was in charge and snarled the status on purpose so id work back here and not get sent out on the lines to get killed by a fool he saved my life today thats how i feel i could be a master if i wanted to get slaughtered and every mage in the army knows it amberdrake glanced over at skan who nodded slightly one master mage could always pick out another well that was certainly interesting but not particularly relevant to their situation but vikteren wasnt finished dammit skandranon were not makaar were not slaves and were not replaced with a snap of the fingers were going to demand autonomy and a say in how were deployed and i came to tell you that all the mages ive talked to think you gryphons ought to do the same maybe if both parties gang up on urtho at once hell be more inclined to take us seriously skans hackles went up again and his claws contracted in the turf with a tearing noise we are not going to gang up on urtho he is my friend stillwe might as well be stinking makaar he rumbled while urtho is the only one who can make our matings fertile he holds all of us bound to him then in a hiss much as i care for him i could hate him for that vikteren started what are you talking about he asked obviously taken aback ive never heard of anything of the sort let me amberdrake said hastily before skan could rouse back to his full rage vikteren its because theyre constructs urtho alone knows the controls what triggers fertility and what doesnt gryphons that survive a certain number of missions are the only ones permitted to raise a brood therere some things only urtho knows that trigger fertility and they are different for male and female gryphons both have to have something secret and specific done to them before their mating results in offspringplus they have to make an aerial courtship display only if all three of those things happen do you have a fertile coupling we can go through the motions of breeding as much as we like skan said tonelessly but without that knowledge or that component that urtho keeps to himself its strictly recreational he shook his massive head not only is it slavery or worse than slavery its dangerous there are never more than a tenth of us fertile at any one time all it would take is one spell from maaror for urtho to dieand our race would die you cant have a viable breeding population with only a tenth of the adults fertile even the breeders of hounds know that but why vikteren said bewildered why does he hold that over you skan sighed gustily i have no idea none we dont need to be controlled do you know how much we revere him wed continue to serve him the way the kyree do wed do it because he is right and because we respect and care for him not because he controls our destiny wed probably serve him better if he didnt control us like that damn if he doesnt give it to us maybe we ought to steal it sosteal it the spell or whatever it is vikteren said slowly thats not a bad idea amberdrake stared at him not believing the mage had said anything so audacious even though the words had come out of his mouth what good would that do amberdrake asked if you need a mage to make it work skan closed his eyes for a moment as if vikterens words had caused a series of thoughts to cascade about half of the gryphons are apprenticelevel mages or better he rumbled we are magical by nature we wouldnt need a mage to cooperate with us im a full master for instance even if you lacked for mages among yourselves youd find plenty of volunteers with the human mages vikteren insisted do it skan youre right if he wont give it to you steal the damn spell and if youre a master then make the change permanent dont put up with being manipulated like this much to his own surprise amberdrake found himself agreeing think of the families sundered by maar they who did not deserve such horrors and now these gryphons you know and love cannot have families at all unless their lord wills it take your freedom skan amberdrake whispered steal the spell and teach it to everyone you trust skandranon backwinged in place then pulled himself up to his full magnificent height the brisk wind from the black gryphons wings sent vikterens hair into his face and kicked up a bit of dust that made amberdrake squint for a moment stealing a spell from urtho though vikterens eyes lit up with a manic glee you know thatd be nearly impossible not working the spell itself that would be pretty simple fertility spells nearly always are no its the stealing part that would be hard getting into urthos tower getting past all the protections from the look on vikterens face he relished that very challenge and impossibility it would not be impossible for me skan replied his crestfeathers rising arrogantly but amberdrake shook his head be realistic skan youve always flown directly to urthos balcony when you went to see him you have no idea what safeguards are in that tower many of them built only for human hands it would be impossible for you but not for us us skan asked eyeing them both vikteren nodded gleefully seconding amberdrake exactly the kestrachern said with immense satisfaction feeling as if the weight of a hundred gryphons was lifted off him us in the end the us also included tamsin and cinnabar after a brief discussion the means of bypassing all those special protections turned out i to be absurdly easy cinnabar crafted a message to be sent to urtho just before urtho was to meet with the leader of the mages delegation she claimed that there were some problems she and tamsin were encountering with gryphon anatomynot even a lieand that she and he needed to consult the records on the gryphons development so that they could tell what urtho used for a model she did not specify who she would have with her only that she needed some help urtho keeps records on everything hes ever done she said as they waited in her tent for the reply she sat as calmly and quietly as if they were all her guests for an evening of quiet social chat and not gathered to perform what could by some standards be considered a major theft her hands were folded in her lap and she leaned into tarnsins shoulder wearing an enigmatic little smile her pale green robes were as smooth and cool as tinted porcelain beside her lover she looked like an expensive doll propped next to a peasantchilds ragtoy i know he has extensive records on how he put your race together and what he modeled you on i specified internal problems which could be anything in the gut and thats difficult stuff to muck about with when you dont know what youre doing it isnt enough to be a healer familiar with raptors in order to be successful with gryphons even though that is how i became a default healer to your people skan you arent all or even mostly raptoral im counting on his being preoccupied with this mages meeting he should simply give us access to the tower rather than taking the time to explain things to us in person a pity about the timing on that skan observed dispassionately vikteren did want to be here and he has someahunusual talents for a mage he could have been very useful still he will surely keep urthos attention at the meeting the black gryphon lay along one side of the tent on cinnabars expensive carpet of crimson and gold where the furniture had been cleared away for him until he moved or spoke he looked like an expensive piece of sculpture brought in to match the carpet or perhaps like a very expensive and odd couch amberdrake chuckled well hell be here in spirit anyway he said patting his pocket where the bespelled lockbreaker vikteren had loaned him resided its just as well given that weve been huddled together like conspirators for the whole afternoon this way if anyone has seen us all together they can assume we wont do anything without him and wont be watching us tamsin laughed and reached across cinnabar for a cup of hot tea youve heard too many adventure tales kestrachern he mocked who would be watching us and why even if urtho catches us the worst hell do is dress us down its not as if we were trying to take over his power stone or something we are not even particularly important personages in this camp skan raised his hackles at that speak for yourself tamsin he responded sharply tamsin only laughed and cinnabar smiled a little wider before a verbal sparring match could begin one of cinnabars hertasi scratched at the tent flap then let herself in handing the lady a sealed envelope cinnabar opened it read the contents and nodded with satisfaction as i thought she said to no one in particular urtho is so caught up with the mages that he didnt even ask me what the complaint is hes leaving orders to pass us into the tower we have relatively free access to the gryphon records he warned me that some things have some magical protections on them and that if i want to see them ill have to ask him which of course we will not amberdrake said since we have other means of getting at them so you see we didnt need all that skulking and going in through windows that you three wanted to do cinnabar replied with just a hint of reproach in her voice lady dont include me in that amberdrake protested it was tamsin skan and vikteren that wanted to go breaking into the tower i knew better of course you did tamsin muttered under his breath as they all rose to go and you never collected ropes and equipment for securing prisoners i dont even want to know why you conveniently had all that stuff on hand amberdrake raised an eyebrow and pretended not to hear him and simply rose with all of the dignity that years of practice could grant they all walked very calmly into the tower a massive and yet curiously graceful structure of smooth sculpted stone they gave a friendly nod to the guard on duty and received one in return very clearly he was expecting them they didnt even need to make up some excuse for amberdrake and skan being with them the guard didnt bother to ask why they were there there were no fences the tower didnt need them it probably didnt need a human guard either but such things made mere mortals feel a little more comfortable around a mage like urtho the entrance was recessed into the tower wall and the door opened for them at the guards touch they passed out of the darkness and into a lighted antechamber bare of all furnishings with a mosaic of stone inlaid on the floor three doors led out of it cinnabar had been here before and she led the way ah bless the mages amberdrake thought yet again iiit hadnt been for them then again perhaps lady cinnabar would have found another excuse she was a woman of remarkable resources the lady was the area where urtho kept his records on the gryphons was several floors up but all of them were fit enough that they didnt much mind the climb the circular staircase was wide enough for skan and other than the fact that it was lit by magelights seemed completely ordinary it was constructed entirely of the native stone of the area planed smooth and fitted together so closely that the joins looked hardly wider than the blade of a knife however as they reached the floor they wanted a gentlycurved door opened itself as they approached all the other doors they had passed remained securely closed with no visible means of opening them they passed through that open door into an area of halls and cubicles all lined floortoceiling with books it certainly looked as if theyd found the right place amberdrake wondered how urtho kept the air moving and fresh in a place like this there was no more than a hint of dust in the air no mold and no moisture if he stood very still there was a gentle steady current of air running past him but where it came from and where it went he simply couldnt tell this place too glowed with magelights a wise precaution with so many flammable books around interesting that cinnabar herself said we ought to simply take the secret without confronting urtho she knows him better than any of us i wish i knew why shed come to that conclusion but she must have some reason to think he would have refused to give away his hold over the gryphons as a kestrachern amberdrakes curiosity had been aroused by that he could think of many possible motivations but he would have liked to know which of them was the most likely so while tamsin and cinnabar perused the index to the record room to find the books on the gryphons reproductive system he browsed through the notations written on the spines of the books in search of clues unfortunately he didnt find any the notations were all strictly impersonal mostly dates or specific keywords to the contents eggs raptor failure rate said one breeding records kaledain bondbirds so he had a hand in that as well or did he just study what my people did next to it breeding records kaledain horses amberdrake had to chuckle at that just one book then urtho had no real idea of what the kaledain were up to with their horse herds unless of course this was a very limited study of what they did with the warhorse breed that might be his only interest but even so amberdrake doubted that the kaledain horsemasters had parted with their inmost secrets even for the mighty urtho mage of silence and their titular liege lord kaledain healers and mages together worked on both the warhorses and the bondbirdsand while the results with the raptors might be more obvious the ones with the horses were far more spectacular though never to the naked eye the raptors had been given increased intelligence and curiosity the ability to speak mindtomind with humans and the ability to flockbond to each other and to the humans who raised them to compensate for the increased mass of brain tissue and to make them more effective as fighting partners they were larger than their wild counterparts but the horses had been changed in far more subtle ways bone density had been increased hoof strength increased in some cases extra muscles had been created that simply didnt exist in a normal horse the digestion had been changed the warhorses could forage where few other horses could feed taking nourishment from such unlikely sources as thistle and dead or dried plants like a goat or a wild sheep as with the raptors the intelligence had been increased but one thing had been utterly changed the warhorses were no longer herd beasts they were pack animals their behavior was no longer that of a horse but like a dog properly trained there was nothing they would not do for their ridersand unlike a horse the rider could count on his mount to continue a command after the rider was out of sight guard for instance or go home very few people knew this or the amount of work it took to change a behavior set rather than a simple physical characteristic did urtho he was reaching for the book when cinnabar called him regretfully he pulled his hand back another mystery that would remain unsolved at least for now weve found the book we want tamsin said as he followed cinnabars voice into yet another booklined cubicle very nicely annotated in the index with the fact that it contains the fertility formula he refers to it as that by the way rather than an actual spell so cinnabar and i are assuming that only a small part of it actually requires magic thats good news for the gryphons then skan said with interest padding in from the opposite direction to amberdrake if it only requires a little magic most should be able to do it for themselves as we expected however the book is magelocked cinnabar interrupted gesturing to a large leatherbound volume securely fastened with leather and metal straps there were no visible locks but then there wouldnt be not with a volume that was magelocked but thanks to vikteren that was not going to be a problem the lock picks didnt look like anything of the sort rather they looked like a set of inscribed beads of various sorts urtho only uses about a dozen different spells to hold his ordinary magic books vikteren had said there arent more than a hundred common spells of that sort in existence of course theres always a chance he used something entirely new but why most people dont know more than two or three magelock spells even at the master level the chances that hed use something esoteric for a relatively common book that hes going to want to consult easily are pretty remote amberdrake had looked over the string of beads curiously so how many counterspells are there here hed asked seventysix vikteren had replied with a grin my master is a lockmaster among his other talents i paid attention you never know when you may need to get into something or out of it amberdrake had remarked sardonically but hed taken the picks now it was just a matter of trying the beads against the place where all the straps met one at a time vikteren had strung them in orderfrom the most common to the least and that was how amberdrake would use them all it would take would be patience he didnt need to try more than a dozen however as he took the bead away and fingered up the next the straps suddenly parted company unfolding neatly down onto the stand and leaving the book ready for perusal cinnabar exclaimed with satisfaction and flipped the cover open ah urtho she said with a chuckle just as methodical as always indexed as neatly as a scribes copy and heres what we want on page five hundred and two she and tamsin leafed rapidly through the pages and soon located the relevant formula they planned to make two copies just in case they were discovered they would turn over one but not the second unless urtho somehow knew that theyd made it suddenly skans head snapped up alarm in his eyes his crestfeathers erect and quivering what is it amberdrake whispered afraid to make a sound was there a guard coming theresanother gryphon up here skan muttered his head weaving back and forth a little his eyes slightly glazed with concentration its in the next room but theres something wrong something odd before amberdrake could stop him the black gryphon had snatched the lockpick beads out of his hand he turned and trotted down the hall to a doorway barely visible at the end of it tamsin and cinnabar became so engrossed in their copying that they didnt even notice skans abrupt departure it was left to amberdrake to chase after him and snatch the beads out of his talons as he shoved them in a bundle against the door lock what are you trying to do he hissed as the gryphon turned to look at him with reproach do you want us to be discovered i skan shook his head i just felt as if there wassomething i should do about that other gryphon it felt important it felt as if i needed to get in there quickly amberdrake did not make the scathing retort he wanted to and what if that was the point he asked instead what if there is some kind of trap in there and this feeling of yours is the bait we both know how tricky urtho is thats exactly the kind of thing hed do he wouldnt be mad at least not for long skan replied weakly i could talk him down until he figured out that we had taken his precious fertility formula amberdrake retorted now will you be sensible did you actually unlock that door i thought i heard a click the black gryphon told him with uncharacteristic meekness but i dont know i could have heard the beads clicking together these were meant to unlock books not doorsmaybe nothing happened look skan whatever it is behind that door it can wait until you have a chance to ask urtho yourself if he wants you to know hell tell you you were supposed to be here after all and you can say you sensed another gryphonthen you can ask him what was going on hell probably tell you just like hes told me the fertility formula the gryphon replied scornfully sounding much more like his usual serf he walked beside amberdrake with his usual unnerving lack of sound oh please were done tamsin grinned we copied legitimate information to cover the notes on the fertility formula if we meet urtho on the way out and he asks lets get out of here id rather not try and bluff him right amberdrake said come on skan you can solve mysteries later he stuffed the picks into a deep pocket one full of other miscellaneous junk of the kind a kestrachern often collected bits of trim loose beads a heavy neck chain the odd token or two he hoped that among all that junk the beads would appear insignificant and hopefully urtho if they met him would not check him over for magic he hurried down the hall to join the others assuming skan followed the magelights extinguished in his wake leaving darkness and silence behind him nine skan pushed the unlocked door open the tiniest bit stupid gryphon stupid stupid gryphon going to get yourself into trouble again this time with your own side skan shoved the door open a little more carefully listening watching for moving shadows as he opened the portal taking a huge breath of air and testing it for scents other than dust his bump of curiosity was eating him alive his weaker bump of caution was screaming at him to turn around and join the others on the staircase as always his bump of curiosity won metal doors and i wonder why never mind urthos not going to like this stupid gryphon he puts locks on things for a reason yes but what could that reason be why would paternal kindly urtho hide something that called to him like a gryphononly not quite what if it was something important something out of keeping with urthos kindhearted image what if urtho was as bad as maar beneath that absentminded and gentle exterior after all hadnt the mage of silence been withholding the fertility secret all this time what if he was hiding something sinister stupid and paranoid gryphon maybe you addled your brains when you struck the toohard earth its been known to happen still just because you were paranoid that did not mean your fears had no foundation what if urtho had no intention of giving the gryphons their fertility and their autonomy because he already had their replacement waiting in the wings so to speak some kind of supergryphon but one that wouldnt do such an inconvenient thing as begin to think for itself and hold its own opinions a prettier sort of makaar stupid stupid gryphon and if you find out thats really the case what then take the chance that urtho wont know and stay to tell the others or fly away before he can catch you if so to where the door moved slowly a talonwidth at a time then suddenly it swung open very quickly indeed all at once as if he had triggered something for a moment he looked into darkness overwhelmed by a wash of gryphon presence so strong that surely surely it must be from many gryphons then the lights came up albeit dim ones that left the far walls in shadowshrouded obscurity and he found himself staring at gryphonghosts that was his first thought they hung in midair floated and he could see right through them they were the source of most of the light in the room wasnt that the way ghosts were supposed to look surely they must be the source of the presence that had hit him so strongly but then he saw that they didnt move at all they didnt even breathe they stared into nothingness with a peculiar lack of expression not dead but lifeless he thought as if they never lived in the first place and as he continued to stare it occurred to him that it wasnt only their surface that he saw it was their insides too every detail of their anatomy in fact if he concentrated on stomach when he stared at one there would be the stomach eerily seethrough suspended inside the transparent gryphon fascinated now if a trifle revolted he stepped inside and the door closed softly behind him they hung at about kneeheight to a human above the floor so that one could if he chose crawl under them to view the detail from below each one differed from the one next to it some in trivial ways some very drastically here was a rufous broadwing like aubri there a dark gray gostype with the goshawks mad red eyes blazingly lifelike even in the lifeless face there was the compactbodied suntail that was best at flying cover theyre all types im looking at types of gryphons all of them every kind ive ever seen we arent just one race were many races why did i never see that before is that why urtho keeps the fertility secret to himself is he trying to keep the types pure dazed with the revelation he wandered past another three of the transparent models to find himself beaktobeak with zhaneel only it wasnt zhaneel at all it was a creature with no personality but there was her general build her coloration and configuration he looked back along the line of gryphons following them up to where he stood and the zhaneeltype back and forth he looked a thought slowly forming in his mind there was something about this line of gryphons something that had struck an unconscious chord what was it of course the types that were closest to the door represented more numerous populations than the ones nearest him and as far as he knew of the zhaneeltype there was only zhaneel because she is the first that was it this was a visual record of urthos entire breeding program zhaneel wasnt a freak she wasnt malformed she was the very first of an entirely new gryphon type nowall those questions urtho asked her about her parents her siblings her training they begin to make sense surely her parents knew that she was a new typeand if they had lived they would have seen to it that she got special training for her special skills but with them gone she was left to flounder and urtho cannot remember everything as urtho himself had reminded skan he could not remember everything and evidently he had forgotten that one solitary gryphon of a new falcon type amberdrake called her a gryfalcon who survived was alone and needed an eye kept on her skan had been angry with urtho and now he was furious how could he have done that to her surely he knew what lay ahead of her when she didnt look anything like the others surely he knew how the gryphons felt about runts sports the misborn but there was the war how could he remember he could only trust to his trainers to be clever and see that she was not some misborn freak but something entirely new it is as much their fault as his if not more his anger faded he sighed and rounded the image of the gryfalcon and he looked upon his own feet his own chest his face his own beak eyes and crest lifeless mutely staring through the living skandranon the shock was a little less this time he was quicker to see that it was no more him than the other was zhaneel still the shock was of an entirely different sort he was perfectly well able to think of the other gryphons as the end result of a breeding program and even think of zhaneel that waybut it was profoundly harder to think of himself in those terms it was in fact uncomfortable enough that he had to remind himself to resume breathing but as he studied the model he took some comfort in noting that his proportions were rather better than its were especially in some specific areas and im definitely handsomer betterfeathered smoothermuscled longer fearalarmanger the emotion hit him like a boulder shot from a catapult and before he could even get his mental feet underneath him something physical hit him from behind it hurtled from a place he had subconsciously noted was a doorframe but had dismissed because there were no lights on the other side the strike sent his feet slipping out from under him causing him to fall sideways through the image of himself he tumbled into a wall and his dancers grace was not helping him in the least at the moment whatever wanted his hide was only about half his size and it smelled like gryphononly not quite like gryphon it was muskier earthier but this was no time to start contemplating scents whatever this was it jumped him again and kicked his beak sideways into the wall only reflexes kept him from being blinded by the next slashand then the assault began again this thing is like a wildcat too small to take me and too crazy to know better it just might hurt me bad i dont like being hurt bad and if this is something of urthosoh damn and blast i have to stop it without hurting it a scratch across his cere carried up over his eyes and sent blood down into them he was momentarily blinded but he blinked the haze away and rolled he gathered his hindlegs under him ignored the pain of the bites and clawmarks for a moment then tucked both of his feet under its belly and heaved it tumbled into the other wall without any sign of control as if parts of it got tangled up with the rest of it but it was game that much was for certain as soon as it stopped rolling it sprang to its feet again and faced him claws up and hissing it was a gryphon it was what zhaneel had misnamed herself something that the gryphons referred to as a misborn it was actually about a quarter of skans size not half its head was small in proportion to its size and very narrow more like a true raptors head than a gryphon or gryfalcons broader cranium the wings were far too long for its body and they dragged the floor so badly that the ends of the primaries had been rubbed off by the constant friction in coloration it was a dusty gray and buff it was that which made skan realize why it looked slightly familiar it was a misbornof zhaneels type it was at that moment that it finally penetrated that the creature wasnt hissing it was trying and failing to produce a true gryphonic scream of challenge he blinked again clearing the blood from his eyes with the flight membranes the powerful telepathic presence of gryphon a presence so strong he had thought that it must come from several of his kind was all emanating from this single small creature that valiantly tried to howl defiance at him the mental hammering of alarmfearrage had come and was still coming from it skan had reared instinctively into a fighting stance while his mind was putting all this together the misborn looked up at himfour times larger than it was its eyes widened for a moment and it cringed but in the next second it had gone back into a defensive posture the intensity of its mental radiations increased and skan dropped back a little it wasnt consciously attacking him with those thoughts but they were strong very strong the moment he dropped back it glanced to the side and scrambled away into the next room lights came on in there as it entered leaping up onto a table with incredible speed considering how clumsy it was it scattered books and instruments in all directions with its toolong wings and reared up again from the advantage of this greater height bad bad the thing hissed go away skan forced himself to relax and got down out of his fighting posture the bites and clawmarks stung but his injuries werent that bad no worse than he got when playing with a rowdy bunch of fledglings this poor little thing was obviously scared witless whatahwho are you he asked carefully it did have enough language to tell him to go away surely it would understand him go away it hissed again feinting with a claw go away where is he did you hurt him it reared up again into a ridiculous parody of full battle display and it was clear that its anger was overwhelming its fear but why was it so frightened and angry and who was he i hurt you it tried to shriek i hurt you i will skan was completely bewildered and he could only hope that there was some kind of sense behind all this if the creature was completely mad he would have to render it unconscious or trap it before he could make his own escape and he really didnt want to hurt it urtho be damned it would be like hurting a cat defending its litter this creature doesnt know what i am and that i dont intend any harmand unless i can get that through to it i dont think its going to stop attacking me hurt who he asked i havent hurt anyone i havent even seen anyone here hurt who urtho who are you he put his eartufts and hackles flat and gryphgrinned trying to look as friendly as possible evidently it worked for the little creature stared at him for a moment then suddenly sat down on the shredded desk blotter it came out of its battle posture instantly deflating and wiped its foreclaws free of skandranons blood not bad it asked plaintively its anger gone completely not hurt father where is father father what on earth can this creature mean surely no other gryphons have ever been up here no one could keep a secret like this for long no of course there havent been any gryphons here otherwise this little thing would recognize me for one he looked around at the room for clues who father was but there werent any just the table with odd bits of equipment and a few books and papers an old cabinet that looked mostly empty and a sink in fact it looked more like a healers examination room than anything no he said persuasively im not bad i havent hurt anyone i just opened up a door and came inside he edged a little closer to the creature as it relaxed who is father who are you father is father the creature replied as if stating the obvious for a very slow child father calls me kechara skan moved right over to the table and sat beside it which put him just about beaktobeak with the little one tell me about father kechara he said softly everything you can all right there are a lot of people where i come from and i need you to tell me what father looks like so i know which person he is kechara which meant beloved or darling in kaledain was a female as near as he could tell it might have been more appropriate to say that kechara was a neuter for she had none of the outward sexual characteristics of a female gryphon that peculiar muskiness of hers was not a sexual musk just an odd and very primitive scent father comes here father goes kechara told him father bring me treats father brings toys plays with me he not here for a while and i play what does father look like kechara skan asked the little creature wrinkled up its brow with intense thought two legs not four it said hesitantly no wings no feathers no beak haslong stuff not grown not feathers over legs and body skin smooth skin here it pawed its face long cresthair here it ran its paws down where the scalp would be on a human and father makes pretty cries when he comes so i know he here cries like songbirds and he dances with me that clinched it the only person that would come into this area that whistled was urtho oddly enough skan had noticed that most mages couldnt whistle vikteren and urtho were the only exceptions in this camp how long have you been here he asked trying to get some sense of how long urtho had concealed the creature here but it just stared at him blankly and when he rephrased the question several times kechara could only say that there was nothing else but here for her only father went somewhere else which meant that urtho had confined this poor thing to this section of his tower for her entire life there were places urtho had taken her where she could look out through windows which was how she had seen and heard songbirds but that was the closest she had come to the outdoors for a scant heartbeat skan was outraged but after attempting a few more questions with kechara he understood why urtho had thought it better to keep her here she couldnt possibly function in normal gryphon society without protectors she couldnt do anything productive zhaneel had been made fun of as she grew up and she was marvelous this poor thing would be tormented if there wasnt always someone watching out for her zhaneel was highly intelligent resilient and capable of remarkable things this little one wouldnt even know how to defend herself without risking injuring herself she seemed to be very much on the same level of intelligence as some of urthos enhanced animals and the biggest difference between her and one of those animals was that she had a rudimentary ability to speak she didnt seem to have much of a concept of time either she never actually lost track of the conversation but sometimes there was a long wait between when he asked a question and she answered it a wait usually punctuated by a short game of chasehershadow then again that might not be a lack of intelligence that might be because she hasnt had anyone to model her behavior on but urtho the winds only know hes done the same thing he coaxed her down off the table and into taking a short walk with him since she seemed restless and kept fidgeting when he talked with her after that the conversation seemed to flow a little better she bounded ahead or lagged back with him as he strolled through the gallery of models she paid them no attention whatsoever which didnt much surprise him she must be as used to them by now as he was to the messengerbirds or amberdrakes eyeblinding clothing but suddenly as they drew opposite the skandranon type of model she looked from it to him and back again as if she could not believe her eyes she blinked shook her head and looked again that you she said as if shed had a major revelation oh it does look something like me he replied casually just a bit he left it at that and she promptly seemed to forget about it a moment later she made a dash into another room and once again the lights came up as she entered she headed straight for a bowl sitting beside what must have been her bed a nicely made nest of bound straw lined with soft silky material there was a box with a pile of brightlycolored objects in it toys probably the top ones looked like the normal sorts of balls and blocks that young gryphlets were given to play with as nestlings before they fledged she grabbed for a clawful of something brown and moistthen like a child suddenly remembering its manners she shyly offered him some of ither food presumably it did not look like much and skan declined although kechara wolfed it down with every evidence of enjoyment icant tell how old she is he thought watching her eat she did manage that fairly well gryphons were not the daintiest of eaters at the best of times she has no idea of the passage of time she cant see the rising and setting of the sun from in here she eats when shes hungry sleeps when shes tired and urtho comes and goes at unpredictable intervals but if i were to guessmisborns dont tend to live very long and id guess shes near the end of her normal lifespan the notion revolted him as much as the food had all her life had been spent in close confinement never feeling the free wind only seldom seeing the sky the sun the moon and the stars when she was bred for the skies and only accident and bad fortune made her the way she is and not like zhaneel or likeme he ground his beak a little in frustration then there was the other side of the rock how could she live outside maybe that was precisely why she was in here because she couldnt live outside the tower misborn were also notoriously delicate prone to disease weaknesses of the lungs and other organs maybe only living here in complete shelter made it possible for her to live at all this may be kindness but it has a bitter taste he noticed that all of his earlier bleeding had stopped and that reminded him of his own internal time sense he was surprised at how long he had been in here with her i must go kechara he said at the first break in conversation such as it was she blinked at him for a moment then she asked him something completely unexpected you come back she asked hopefully you come play again and she looked up at him with wide and pleading eyes oh high winds and rock slides she may not know the emotion for what it is but shes lonely what can i tell her he ground his beak for a moment then told her the truth i dont know kechara i have to talk to father first he makes the rules you know she nodded as if she could accept that i ask father too she said decisively i tell him i need you to play with me then as he paused at the door she reared up on her haunches and spread her forelegs wide it was such a weird posture that at first skan could not even begin to imagine what she was up to but then he understood she was waiting for a hug a human hug the kind she always got from father when he left her that simple gesture told skan all he needed to know whatever urthos motives were in keeping this little thing here they were meant to be kindly and he gave her all the affection he could it was awkward but somehow skan managed then he gave her a real gryphonic gesture of parting a little preening of her neck hackles it would have been much worse if she had put up some kind of a fuss about his leaving but she didnt she simply waved a talon in farewell and turned and trotted back to her nest room presumably to play by herself shes learned that fussing doesnt change anything he decided as he walked stunned through the book rooms and touched the door to the staircase to open it shes learned that people come and go in her life without her having any control over where and when they do it poor thing poor little thing the lights dimmed behind him as he made his way down the stairs slowly for staircases were difficult for gryphons to descend although climbing them was no real problem when he got to the bottom he was very tempted to try one of the other doors in the antechamber stupid gryphon dont tempt your luck youll be in enough trouble with urtho as soon as you bring up kechara oh dear that made another problem how do you bring up kechara without revealing you got into a locked room and if you got into a locked room how much else would he guess you got into the guard nodded to him and grinned as he left damned hard for you critters to manage staircases eh he said as skan realized that some of his injuries from the spat with kechara must surely be visible and he hadnt come in with fresh scratches on him but the guard had just offered him a fabulous excuse for his appearance and he seized it with gratitude more than damned hard he grumbled i mustve slipped and fallen once for every dozen steps and would the others wait hell no they were in such a hurry to scuttle off with their healerstuff that they didnt even notice i was lagging the guard laughed sympathetically and patted skan on the shoulder know how you feel he replied with this gimpy leg i cant even climb one staircase good anymore never much thought about how you critters managed until i got that crossbow bolt through the calf some chat might not be a bad cover at the moment and i dont really have anywhere to go tamsin and cinnabar will be deciphering the text they copied and putting it into terms we gryphons can use theyll be so busy with that they wouldnt know if i was there or not kyree and hertasi can manage all right he replied but us the dyheli the tervardistaircases are hell and other things are worse youd think with all the veterans hurt that cant walk that theyd put in some ramps but no the guard sighed well thats the way of the world everybody sees it according to what he needs if a man dont need a special way up the stairs why he dont think nobody else needs it neither skan snorted you figured that right brother and my bloody aching head agrees with you too best run along and catch up with those healer friends of yours an make em patch you up the guard advised maybe then theyll think twice before they rush off an leave you alone skan laughed and promised he would do that the guard limped on his rounds with a friendly wave as skan headed back toward camp and healers hill all right id better get this all in order well get the fertility spell straight ill pass it on to the rest then once i know everyone has itillcome to urtho and tell him what i did thats when i bring up kechara that would take a few days at the best and his conscience bothered him about leaving her alone in there for so long but shes been alone in there for all of her life a few days more or less will make no difference there was an additional complication however what if urtho made a visit to hiswellpet if kechara happened to mention skan illhave to hope that she doesnt or if she does urtho just thinks shes talking about the models complications complications stupid gryphon youre trying to do too much too fast but doesnt it need to be done if not you then who the walk down to the camp was a long one there werent many people out at this time of night most of the ones still awake were entertaining themselves the rest had duties or were preparing their gear for combat tomorrow it was a peculiar thing this war between wizards the front lines were immensely far away and yet the combat troops bivouacked here below urthos stronghold in the heart of his lands it was the gates that made such things possible the gates and the gryphons the first meant that urtho could move large numbers of troops anywhere at a moments notice there were even permanent gates with set destinations that did not require anything more than a simple activation spell something even an apprentice could manage because of this urthos troops were highly mobile and the problem of supply lines was virtually negated of course that was true for maars men as well the defender had the advantage in a situation like this a mage setting up a gate had to know the place where he intended it to go and urtho or his mages knew every inch of the territory he was defending maars mage could only set up gates where they had been places that they knew so maars gates would always be behind his lines there had even been one or two successful forays early on in the campaign where urtho had infiltrated troops behind maars that however would only work once or twice before your enemy started setting watches for gateenergies in order to blast the gate as it was forming this tended to cost your mage his life as the energies lashed him at a time when he was wide open and vulnerable that was why urthos forces didnt do that any more and there wasnt a mage in the entire army who would obey an order to do so not that shaiknam hasnt tried but only once the gryphons were the other factor that made this waratadistance possible aloft they could cover immense stretches of territory and their incredibly keen vision allowed them to scout from distances so high that not even the makaar would challenge them unless they were in the very rare situation where they were at a greater altitude than the incoming gryphon makaar were not built for the winds and the chill of high altitude there were gryphons who were though they were not the best fighters and there were gryphons built for longdistance scouting who had ways of overcoming their physical shortcomings that made them poor choices for combat the one who could do it best was zhaneel one gryphon anyway maybe one day more as skan took to the air for the brief flight to healers hill his sharp eyes picked out the glow of the tent snared by tamsin and cinnabar hard at work already they may even have it by the time i get there good the black gryphon used a thermal to kite in that direction appreciative that the night was so clear and calm he noted that amberdrakes tent was also aglow hard at work too he chuckled well the night usually is when most of his work is done he bears the hearts of many mine included he is there when he is needed even this late at night i shall not tease him about it this time ten amberdrake did not notice that skan wasnt behind them on the stairs until they reached the outside of the tower beyond the antechamber that was when he turned to say something to the black gryphon and the black gryphon wasnt there they were already beyond the immediate perimeter of the tower amberdrake swore under his breath it was too late to go back and get him the doors probably wouldnt admit them a second time and the guard would wonder what was going on when they returned looking for skan a light breeze blew at amberdrakes back and camp sounds carried up from the tents below it would be better to go back to his tent and go on with the plan as if nothing was out of the ordinary gryphons had a hard time with staircases with luck the guard knew that maybe he would figure that skan was still inching his way down step by painful step not that skan had any trouble with staircases spiral or otherwise he was as graceful as a cat under any circumstances it was the dancing that did it amberdrake had seen him climbing trees eeling through brush and scaling the outside of tower walls with equal ease and panache but amberdrake was one of the few people who knew that amberdrake lingered in the shadows as tamsin and cinnabar hurried on ahead he waited on the off chance that his friend might simply be sauntering along as if time had no meaning hes been known to do that its image he says skan still did not appear whatever he was doing it was not just a case of lagging behind where the hell is that idiot featherhead he thought with irritation caught up in his own reflection somewhere far more likely that he had found some book that had caught his eye and was leafing through it oblivious to the time amberdrake could only hope that it was something as innocent as a book that had detained him but time was running out for amberdrake at least wherever he was whatever he was doing the black gryphon would have to make his own excuses and bail himself out of any trouble he got into amberdrake could not wait any longer he had an appointment a lastminute appointment set up by urtho himself this was not a client to keep waiting especially not tonight if he broke that appointment or was even a tiny bit late for it someone might put that together with tamsin and cinnabars request ask the guard who had been with them and put two and two together and figure they had all been up to something and that someone would probably be urtho skandranon was a big gryphon he could take care of himself if he had been asked that is exactly what he would have said the way back to camp was as clear as the night sky with no one in sight anywhere close that meant there was no one to take note if he broke into a sprint and wonder why he was runningor at least not close enough to recognize a distant runner as kestrachern amberdrake he took off at a lope and didnt pause until he was just within sight of his own tent im in better shape than i thought he thought with pardonable pride as he composed himself before making his entrance right on time im not even out of breath fortunately his hertasi assistant gesten would have everything he needed for this client prepared for him ahead of time it had been a very long time since amberdrake had performed the simple chores that surrounded his professiongetting out the massage table warming the oils putting towels in the steamer preparing incense simple chores but timeconsuming things it would be impossible to take care of before a client came if the kestrachern in question happened to be doing something he didnt want anyone to know about for instance in case a kestrachern absolutely had to snoop around in the great mages tower thank goodness for hertasi the client was not waiting which could mean a number of things she could simply be late she might be a little reluctant to go to a kestrachern new clients often were until they realized how little of a kestracherns work had to do with amorous dealings that was fine it meant he had time to change into his work clothes in peace he could have done a massage in his current outfit but he didnt want to he had a reputation to uphold and much of that reputation involved his appearance clients should see him at his very best for that was what he always gave them so he pushed the draperies aside and slipped into his private quarters quickly shed the clothing he had on and donned one of the three appropriate massagecostumes that gesten had laid ready for him tunic and breeches again but of very soft thick absorbent material in a deep crimson with vivid blue trim the cut was more than loose enough to permit him to take whatever contortion was required to give his client relief from stressed or sore muscles and in the soft lighting of the tent it looked opulent rich special that would make the client feel special as well he braided his long hair up out of the way but fastened the ends of the braids with small chiming bells which would whisper musically when he moved he had found that the rhythmic chiming that followed the motions of the massage soothed his clients the new client still had not appeared when he moved back to the business side of the tent so he doublechecked on gestens preparations not that he had any doubt of gestens thoroughness but it never hurt to check the laws of the universe dictated that the one time he did not check something would be missing the bottles of scented oil already nicely up to temperature waited in their pan of warm water the hot stones had been set in the bottom of the towelwarming chest and the steam that rose from the cracks in the upper portion carrying with it the scent of warm clean cloth told him that all was in readiness there as well the massage table had been unfolded and covered with a soft pad of course and a crimson chair was beside it in case the client was too stiff or sore to be able to get on it without assistance the wooden rollers were ready so were the warming ointments for after the massage in case the muscles needed herbal therapy there was a pot of verograss tea steeping in case he needed to get her to relax beforehand and most importantly for a new and possibly shy client all the other tools of his many trades had been packed away out of sight most of them in fact currently cluttered up his private quarters the only hint that he might not be a simple healer was the incense in the air the opulent hangings and the scattering of pillows around the floor he prowled the room anyway rearranging the pillows making certain that nothing had been left out by accident checking the oils to be certain they hadnt gone the least tiny bit rancid it was all energywasting and he knew it but the energy he was wasting was all from nerves and it was his to waste if he chose he wouldnt have been here now if hed had any other choice hed be waiting outside the tower for skan or lurking outside the mages meeting iwish i knew what was going on at the meeting he thought fretfully i wonder if the hertasi have anyone there if they do gesten will know the results as soon as they let out maybe before i hope sobut of course vikteren will tell me whatever happened gods i hope skan got out of the tower without tripping some alarm or other i hope the guard doesnt figure he was up to something i hope he wasnt up to something he simply spotted a book he could not resist im sure i hope tamsin and cinnabar really can find a way to give the gryphons their fertility mental nattering really fretting over things he could not control and could not change was a habit of his if he could change something he did so if he couldnt he fretted it to pieces in hopes of finding a way he could affect the situation fortunately he didnt have time to work himself up over either the mages meeting or skan gesten finally poked his nose through the door flap and motioned someone inside a female but amberdrake knew that already but now he knew why urtho had not specified who was coming in making this appointment stiff severe posture mathematically precise hair with three thin braids down the back of her neck pinched expression perfectly pressed and creased utilitarian clothingwinterhart oh gods his shoulder muscles tensed and his head started aching he stopped his lip from curling with distaste just in time and dropped his mask of impassiveness into place iam a professional urtho sent her to me and the fee he included should quite cover the fact that she is a pain in the tail i can take care of her without becoming the least involved she is only here for physical therapy i dont have to know her inmost secrets i dont even have to speak more than a dozen words to her all that flashed through his mind as he altered his expression into a carefully indifferent and businesslike smile she was moving very stiffly more so than he remembered and it wasnt all because she was not happy to be here what had the note urtho sent said back injury interesting she was far stiffer than even a back injury would account for idont have to open up to her to know that she is as tense as a cocked catapult its written in every muscle i cant work on her like that and she is not going to relax interesting i dont think she recognizes me as having been with skan maybe the dim light is working for me there was certainly no sign of recognition in her eyesand then there was recognition but no sudden pulling back that would indicate she realized he had watched while skan and zhaneel made her look the fool well that tenseness was the reason there was verograss tea steeping she wouldnt be the first client who had come to a kestrachern too tense to get any benefit from the visit you look thirsty he said quickly as she looked around suspiciously please do drink this tea before we begin it will help you and as a trondiirn should know verograss was thick with minerals someone with a back injury was in need of minerals she accepted the cup of tea dubiously waved aside his offer of honey to sweeten it and took a sip her eyes widened as she recognized what it was but she said nothing she simply gulped it down grimly he thought as if she dared him to do his worst well he wouldnt do his worst he would do his best and to hell with her and her opinions id like you to disrobe please he said taking the cup away from her and placing it out of the way and lie on the table winterhart had not known until she stepped into this tent that urtho had ordered her to the hands of a kestrachern but she knew amberdrake by sightit seemed that he was always messing about with the healers and the gryphons in one way or anotherand she knew what his profession was she had thought she was being sent to a minor ungifted healer for her back problemson urthos direct orders of course and after that rather painful interview following the altercation with zhaneel how the mage had wormed the fact of her injury out of her she had no idea then again she had told him any number of things that she hadnt intended to and that was only one of them at least the fact of the injury and the pain she was in had apparently saved her from a reprimand urtho evidently counted it as a reason for her irritation with the world in general and gryphons specifically when he had told her thatand that he was ordering her to get treatment that he himself would schedule she had been resentful but just a little relieved now she was resentful not at all relieved angryand truth to tell more than a little frightened angry that urtho had set her up like this without telling her resentful that he had interfered in her private life arbitrarily assuming that there was something wrong with her sexual relations and setting her up with a kestrachern and frightened of what could happen at the hands of this particular kestrachern she had heard very embarrassing things about kestrachern in general and this amberdrake in particular stories that would curl the hair of any wellborn young woman with a sense of decency amberdrake had a reputation for things that were ratherexotic conn levas had used the fact that he had gone to this particular kestrachern to taunt her with her inadequacies and the things he had said had gone on here were considerably more than exotic and worst of all she had no clue what urtho had ordered for her treatment if anyone back in her wing found out she was here she would never hear the end of it and her back still hurt that was reason enough to wish herself elsewhere the gods only know whats going to happen to my back ifif she found herself flushing and resenting her own embarrassment a lot of arching would be very bad for my spine right now and i doubt he has any notion of that her suspicions hardened into certainty when she recognized the taste of the verograss tea it was a calmative yes but it also had a reputation for enhacing other things than calm but it was a muscle relaxant as well and right now right now my back needs it badly enough that ill drink the damned stuff she thought grimly maybe he thinks that if he drugs me enough ill be too limp to stop him huh not with this back one cup of tea isnt going to do worse than take the edge off the pain then he looked at her as if he was sizing her up for purchase and said disrobe and get on the table please she stared at him utterly taken aback as much by his clinical coldness as by the words wasnt there supposed to be somewellfinesse involved here she looked from amberdrake to the table and back again you want me to what she asked still stunned amberdrake sighed with exasperation what was wrong with the stupid woman couldnt she understand that in order to massage her he would have to have her unclothed and on the table surely she didnt think he could do anything with her standing in the middle of the room like a statue you are who urtho sent me arent you he asked with just a touch of irony she swallowed but with difficulty yes she replied and you do have a back injury do you not he persisted what was going on in her mind she answered with more reluctance than before yes he sighed with open exasperation which seemed to annoy her well good up until this moment hed been the one who was annoyed let her enjoy the sensation for a change then please lady let me help you as i was assigned to do i cannot help you if you will not disrobe and get on the table help me how she replied sharply her eyes darting this way and that i thought i was being sent to a healer he gritted his teeth so hard it hurt you have been sent to a healer he replied allowing his tone to tell her that there was no doubt that he was exasperated apparently you are not aware that a human cannot be effectively massaged through her clothing if you would rather this were done by someone other than myself you are quite free to leave but you can explain to urtho why you walked out on this rather expensive session i perform my services in a professional manner even with reluctant clientsand the services i intended to perform on you are entirely different from the ones i think you have imagined beneath his calm cool exterior he was seething and his back teeth jammed so tightly together that it was a wonder they didnt split another godsbedamned pureasrain healer i should have known shed react this way tamsin and cinnabar were only too accurate in the way they described her bright keros how much more am i going to have to put up with this kind of nonsense im besieged truly i am and as for winterhart the purewell from the pinched look on her face id say shes certainly living down to her reputation as the princess of prim and proper she hadnt budged a thumblength since hed begun talking and if his muscle readings were correct she was so tense that he was rather mildly surprised that her eyes werent bulging out and it was all too obvious that she not only didnt believe he was a healer she was certain it was just some kind of a ploy to take advantage of her as if id want to i like my partners willing thank you his headache worsened wonderful it wasnt just his headache it was coming from her as well no wonder she had a pinched and sour look to her now how do i convince her that i am a healer chop off gestens hand and fuse it back on i wonder if her majesty the icemaiden here would even react to that she and that steelnecked lover of hers deserve each other if urtho hadnt sent her to me id invite her to take herself and her token back to her tent but outwardly years of practice kept so much as a stray expression from crossing his face i am no threat to yourvirtueand i do assure you that you can relax this is a massage table i am to work on your back injury and perhaps see if it is something that i can heal it is that simple he patted the table and smiled a cool and professional smile she shifted her weight uneasily and moved ever so slightly away from the tent flap and toward the table ifthats the best she can do were going to be here all night before she gets on the damned table massage he repeated as if to a very simple child i am very good at it lady cinnabar will not have anyone else work on her but me that earned him another couple of steps toward the table he closed his eyes for just a moment and counted to ten she was turning what should have been a simple session into an ordeal for both of them if you are bodyshy with a stranger i will turn my back while you disrobe you may drape yourself with the sheet that is folded beside the table he said he pointed out the sheet to her and turned away the sound of clothing rustling told him that he had finally convinced her of his sincerity if not his expertise his head was absolutely pounding with shared pain he shielded himself against her and it finally ebbed a bit that was a shame he generally didnt need to shield himself against a fellowhealer and allowing his empathy to remain wideopen generally got him some useful information remaining that way also improved his sensitivity to what was going on with injuries and pain and helped him block it before a client even realized that something hurt he would be able to correct the problem and move on correct the problem well unfortunately he could very well imagine why urtho had sent the woman here the few notes he had on her indicated some trauma in her life that she simply had not facedsomething that she had done or that had been done to her trondiirn were generally not so busy they disregarded their own health there was the possibility she was punishing herself by leaving her conditions unattended or worsening them in her mind oh he had no doubt that there was a real physical injury there as well but the way she acted told him that this was not a healthy welladjusted woman urtho must have seen that too here was the implied message in his sending her here youre supposed to heal minds so heal this one what had urtho said about her that she had abusive parents but the signs are all wrong for them to have been physically abusive urtho was known for having a very enlightened idea of what constituted abuse no this woman hadnt been mistreated or neglected physically but emotionallyah there was the theory that fit the pattern i would bet a bolt of silk on cold demanding parents who expected perfectionand got it very little real affection in her life and most of it delivered when she managed somehow to achieve the impossible goals her parents set yes that fits the picture and now she was as demanding of everyone else as her parents had been to her more than that she was as demanding of herself as they used to be well that was why she would have gotten involved with an arrogant manipulator like that mage in the first place she doesnt see herself as deserving anyone who cares so she picks someone who reminds her of what she grew up with and then treats him the same since she never learned to do otherwise he ran his fingers across his forehead as the creaking of the table behind him told him he had managed to convince her to trust him that far icant undo decades of harm in a few candlemarks start with the easy stuff and release the pain then take it from there amberdrake turned back to find her on her stomach draped from neck to knee with the sheet as modest as a village maiden he selected one of the oils one with a lavender base that would be clean and fresh enough to help convince her that he was not going to seduce her then before she could react he turned the sheet down with brisk efficiency worthy of gesten poured some of the oil in his hands to warm it then rubbed his palms together a moment later he was kneading the muscles of her back and shoulders he had not been boasting he was particularly good at massage lady cinnabar did prefer his services to anyone else in or out of the camp slowly as he worked the knots of tension out of her back and shoulders he sensed other tension ebbing his expertise at massage was convincing her that he was at least in part what he claimed to be some of the barriers she was holding against him came down but he did not take immediate advantage of the altered situation no my dear icicle i intend to show you that i am everything i said i was and a lot more besides you are a challenge and i never could resist a challenge and urtho damn his hide knows that when winterhart realized that the man really did know what he was doingat least insofar as massage was concernedshe let the fear ebb from her body the more she relaxed the more his hands seemed to be actually soothing away the pain in her poor back odd i always thought massage was supposed to be painful in fact it was so soothing that she felt herself drifting away not quite asleep but certainly not quite awake several moments passed before she realized that the tingling sensation in her back really was something very familiar after all the difference was that she had never experienced it before as the recipient her eyes opened wide although she did not move she didnt dare the man was healing her and you didnt interrupt a healing trance well came the conversational voice from behind her you certainly have broken up your back in a most spectacular fashion he was talking how could you trance and talk at the same time your main problem is with one of the pads between the vertebrae the voice continued its squashed rather messily im putting back what i can if i can get the inflammation down that will clear the way to stop most of the pain youve been enduring oh she replied weakly id thought perhaps that i had cracked a vertebra nothing nearly so exciting the voice replied but this could have been worse it is good that urtho sent you to me when he did do you feel any tension here winterhart felt a spot of cold amid the sea of warmth in her back this man was amazing the healers she knew could activate the nerves in a specific point of the body but never a specific sensation by the time her training had been terminated she could not activate a circle of nerves smaller than her thumbs width without causing the patient to feel heat cold pressure and pain there all at once and here thisthis kestrachernwas pinpointing the nerves in a tenth of that area and making her feel only a chill not pain she could only grunt an affirmative and let her defenses slip a little more he knew what he was doing and he felt so competent so good amberdrake let the fluids around the damage balance slower than absolutely necessary partly out of caution but mostly to buy some more time this was not going to be as easy as he had thought winterhart was like an onion you peeled away one layer thinking you had found the core only to find just another layer she had so many defenses that he was forced to wonder just what it was she thought she was defending herself against how did you manage to do this he asked quietly letting the soothing qualities he put into his voice lull her a little more this kind of injury doesnt usually happen all at once didnt you notice anything wrong earlier well my back had been bothering me for a while she replied with obvious reluctance but i never really thought about it my famiive always had a little problem with my back you know how it is tensions always strike at your weakest point right true he replied wondering why she had changed my family to i how would revealing a family history of back trouble reveal anything about her and your back is your weakest point i take it he thought carefully before asking his next question he didnt want to put her more on the defensive than she already was i suppose you must have seen how busy all the healers were and you decided just to ignore the pain not necessarily wise but certainly considerate of you she grunted and the skin on the back of her neck reddened a little i dont like to whine about things she said especially not things i cant change so i kept my mouth shut and drank a lot of willow anyway after the defensive at polda one of the sixth wing gryphons was brought in with some extensive lacerations to its underbelly delirious and when i tried to restrain it it nearly went berserk interesting resentment there as if she somehow thought that the gryphon in question had been acting unreasonably who was it amberdrake asked what are you talking about she replied suspiciously who was the gryphon amberdrake repeated mildly i knew about aubris burns but i didnt know anything about a sixth wing gryphon with lacerations i was wondering if it was sheran if it was im not surprised she reacted badly to being restrained she was one of the gryphons that third wing rescued just before stelvi pass maar had them all in chains and was going to pinion them we dont know what else he did tp them but we do know they had been tortured in some fairly sophisticated and sadistic ways there make her think of the gryphon in question as a personality and not an it see what that unlocks it could have been winterhart said slowly as if the notion startled her there was a lot of scar tissue i couldnt account for and it was a female amberdrake probed the injury again before he spoke maar saves some of his worst tortures for the gryphons urtho thinks its because maar knows he thinks of them as his children not as simply his creations i didnt know that silence for a while as the flames of the lanterns overhead burned with faint hissing and crackling sounds i like animals i was always good with horses and dogs that was why i became a trondiirn gryphons he started to say gryphons arent animals then stopped himself just in time i thought gryphons were just animals like the kaledain warhorses i thought they only spoke like the messengerbirds just mimicking without really understanding more than simple orders she sighed the muscles of her back heaved and trembled a little beneath his hands and he exerted his powers to keep them from going into a full and painful spasm i kept telling myself that but it isnt true they arent just animals i hate to see anything in pain and its worse to see something that can think in a state like that gryphon was well amberdrake replied choosinghis words with care ive always thought it was worse to see an animal in pain than a creature like the hertasi the gryphons the kyree or the tervardi injured you cant explain to an animal that you are going to hurt it a little more now to make it feel better later you can explain those things to a thinking creature and chances are it will believe you and cooperate and it has always been worse for me to see an animal dieespecially one that is attached to you theyve come to think of you as a kind of god and expect you to make everything betterand when you cant its shattering to have to betray that trust even though you cant avoid it you sound as if youve thought this sort of thing over quite a bit she said her voice sounding rather odd very very controlled overcontrolled in fact it is my job he reminded her with irony you would be amazed at the number of people who come to me after a dreadful battle with nightmares of seeing their favorite puppy dying on the battlefield part of what i do is to explain to them why they see the puppy and not the friends they just lost only i dont explain it quite that clinically there wasnt much she could say to that so after a few breaths she returned to the safer topic anyway i was trying to treat the gryphon and id gotten bent over in quite an odd position to stitch her up without tying her down when she lashed out at me with both hindlegs she sent me flying and i landed badly i got up felt a little more pain but not much and thought i was all right good the gryphon has gone from it to she thats progress anyway but the pain kept getting worse instead of better right he probed thats the sign youve done something to one of those spinal pads i think thats one lesson im not likely to forget very soon she countered with irony as heavy as his had been but as you said the healers were all busy with injuries worse than mine and i dont believe in whining about things as trivial as a backache i would never call telling of extreme pain whining was all he said she relaxed a little more minutely but visible to him this is going to need more than one treatment he continued if you can bring yourself to resort to a mere kestrachern that is the skin of her neck flushed again iyou are a better healer than i am she replied with painful humility she hadnt liked admitting that if you would be so kindi know what your fees are for other thingsbut if you can spare the time to make certain the healer of my friends is in the best of health i would forgo the fee a king would offer for my services amberdrake replied with dignity when you are in pain you cant do your best work you know that as well as i do skan is not the only gryphon friend i have and i want my friends to have nothing less than the finest and most competent of care ah she said weakly ah thank you he examined the injury again ive done all i can about this spinal pad right now he told her truthfully i need to finish that massage and then you can go i think youll feel some difference i already do she admitted he rubbed some fresh scented oil into the palms of his hands to warm it and started soothing the muscles of her back he had not reached earlier they had gone into spasms so often they had become as tense and tight as harpwires and as knotted as a childs first spun thread she gasped as the first of them released quivered all over in fact amberdrake was quite familiar with that reaction but evidently she wasnt oh she exclaimed and tensed again i its quite all right dont move he ordered its the natural reaction to releasing tensed muscles ignore it if you can and try to enjoy it if you cant ignore it she didnt reply to that interesting the last commoner hed made that particular remark to had said with dangerous irony what like rape it was a natural thought for the ordinary soldier who all too often found him or herself in the position of victim but there was no tightening of winterharts neck muscles no tensing at all to indicate that thought had occurred to her interesting very interesting so whatever she is afraid of it isnt that and she is not the ordinary soul she says that she is if i hurt you tell me he said a good massage should not hurtand in your case if i start to hurt you youll tense up again and undo everything ive done so far other than the real healing i will she promised but it doesnt hurt it just feels very odd my mthe massages ive had in the past were never for injuries what other kinds of massages are there she cant mean sexual sofor beauty treatments that would account for the superb state of her body there were no blemishes no signs of scarring anywhere when the posturing and stiffness were gone from winterharts body she was a magnificent sculpture of human beauty she cared for her skin and hair scrupulously filed her toenails and had no calluses anywhere that he had seen not even the calluses associated with riding or fighting unusual and definitely the marks of someone highborn and he thought he knew all the humans of noble lineage who had ever lived near urthos tower perhaps she was from before i came here but that would date back to the very beginning of the war do you get along with your commanders he asked adding i need to know because if you dont it is going to affect how your muscles will react and i may need to ask you to resort to herbal muscle relaxants when you are around them she was silent for a very long time they think i am the proper subordinate i suppose i used to be that may be why my back went badly wrong all at once i dont ever contradict them even now i suppose youll think im a coward but even though i dont agree with the way they treat the gryphons i dont want to be stripped of my rank and sent away you wouldnt be if you took your case to urtho he pointed out as trondiirn it is your job to countermand even the generals if you believe your charges are being mistreated i cant do that her skin was cold she was afraid of what of confrontation of going directly to urtho besides she continued hurriedly my i lover is one of shaiknams mages his name is conn levas if i went to urtho id still be reassigned and i dont want to be reassigned to some other wing than his untrue her muscles proclaimed it and amberdrakes intuition agreed the way she had stumbled over the word lover not as if she were ashamed to say it but because she could hardly bear to give the man that title amberdrake remembered conn levas the mage who had come to him in order to shame his lover that lover it seems was winterhart she and the mage might trade animal passions but there was no love in that relationship she didnt care that she might be reassigned someplace where he wasnt precisely there is something deeper going on here in some way the man protects her he must not know he is doing so because if he did hed use it against her this was getting more and more complicated all the time well i would say you arent going to have to worry about that much longer he said without thinking what do you mean her alarm was real and very deep she actually started he put a hand in the middle of her back and soothed the jerking muscles only that thanks to zhaneel urtho is already aware of the situation in sixth wing you wont have to confront anyone now i suspect hell take care of things he always does oh she relaxed again now what on earth set her off like that it has to be something to do with whatever it is that she is afraid of what that could be he had no clue perhaps he ought to try probing farther back in her pastso far back that it would not seem like a threat i learned all of my skills at healing when i was a child he said casually my parents sent me to a very odd school one that did not admit the existence of a healing gift nor of empathy i did learn quite a bit about healing without the use of eithereverything from massage to anatomy to herbal and mineral medicines but i was also more or less trapped among very sick people with empathy too strong to shut them out i was miserable and my parents didnt understand why when i wrote them letters begging to come home they thought they were doing their best for me and couldnt understand why i wasnt grateful my parents were like that she said sounding sleepy they knew their children were exceptional and they wouldnt accept anything legs than perfection they never understood why i wasnt fawningly grateful for all the opportunities they gave me ithought as much well this is something i can start on right this moment like my parents yours surely thought they had your best interests at heart he replied quickly perhaps they were too young for children perhaps they simply didnt understand that a child is not a small copy of ones own self many people think that they feel the child must have the same needs and interests they do simply because it sprang from them they have no notion that a child can be drastically different from its parents so she replied probably more harshly than she intended does that excuse them he let her think about that for a long time before he answered there are no excuses he said at last but there are reasons reasons why we are what we are reasons why we do not have to stay that way even maar has reasons for what he does that turned the discussion into one of philosophy and by the time he sent her away he had come grudgingly not only to feel sorry for her but even to like her a little but she was going to have to change and she would have a hard time doing so all alone he was going to have to help her as she was she was a danger not only to herself but possibly to everyone she came in contact with no matter how she tried to hide it she was unbalanced and afraid and fear was maars best weapon eleven skandranon cautiously pushed his way into tarnsins work tent with a careful talon and the tail of a playful breeze followed him inside teasing his crest feathers as he had expected tamsin and cinnabar mumbled to each other over their notes oblivious to anything else going on they made quite a pretty picture with their heads so close they just touched lamplight shining down on them the table and the precious stack of paper dark hair and bright shone beneath the lantern they were a vision of peace but pretty pictures were not precisely what he was after at the moment and all peace was illusory as long as maar kept moving and he knew that despite his motivations stealing this secret was a dangerous game to play but this secret would at least ensure the survival of his people no matter what befell urtho took you long enough to get here tamsin said without looking up though cinnabar gave him a wink and wry grin he wrote another word or two then set aside the paper he had been scrawling on and raised his eyes to meet skans what did you do stop to seduce half a dozen gryphons on the way here skans nares flushed but he managed to keep his voice from betraying him half a dozen gryphons wellone female and there certainly wasnt a seduction involved and until he had a chance to think out a plan hed rather not discuss kechara with anyone not at all i just stopped to look at something very interesting in the tower so what have you discovered by the gleam in tamsins eyes it was good news very good news that your socalled spell isnt precisely that tamsin replied enabling fertility in male and female gryphons takes a combination of things and all of them are the sort of preparation that any gryphon could do without magical help though a little magic makes it easier urtho just shrouds the whole procedure in mysticism so that you think its something powerfully magical his notes detail what to do to make the most impressive effects for the least expenditure of energy hes been bluffing you all skan skans head jerked up so quickly that he hit the top of the doorframe with it and blinked hed hoped for simple spells he had not expected anything like this what he exclaimed tamsin chuckled and leaned back in his chair lacing his fingers behind his head when he designed you he wanted to have some automatic controls on your fertility so he borrowed some things from a number of different beasties take the great white owlthe females dont lay fertile eggs unless their mate has stuffed them first with tundra mice the sudden increase in meat triggers their bodies to permit fertilization of the eggs and the more meat the more eggs they lay well urtho borrowed that for your females the ritual for the female gryphon is to fast for two days then gorge on fresh meat just before the mating flight that gorging tells her instincts that theres food enough to support afamily just like with the tundra owls and she becomes fertile but skan protested weakly we dont lay eggs how can that tamsin ignored him he borrowed from the snow tigers as well they would have litters four times a year in a colder climate but they only have one because the males body temperature is so high that his seed is sterile except in the winter so urtho designed you males so that your body temperature is normally so high that your seed is dormant just like theirs so your half of the ritual is that business of sleeping and meditating in the cave for two days while the female fasts that drops your body temperature enough that your seed becomes active that or a very simple spell ensures that the males temperature stays lower than normal until after the mating flight is over and that is the only bit of magic that urtho performs that actually accomplishes anything its such a minor spell that even an untrained healer could do itor there are drugs and infusions we could give you that have that effect temporarily or you could sit on a chunk of ice cinnabar added gleefully tossing her hair over her shoulder another breath of breeze entered the open tent flap and made the flame of the lantern flicker for a moment thank you skan said with as much dignity as he could muster but i doubt i shall seriously though that means that in the total absence of healers or herbs a male gryphon could keep his seed active simply by mating in the winter like a snow tiger or by sleeping for two days in a cave and then flying very high during the mating flight where the air is cold even in the summer tamsin said then he laughed it had been a long time since skan had heard the healer laughing with such ease it was a good sound but as hotblooded as the black gryphon is he may need to go to the northernmost edge of the world cinnabar joined her lover in laughter and even skandranon wheezed a slight chuckle it had been a long time since tamsin had researched anything that concerned creation rather than destruction for this brief time perhaps he had been able to forget the war and all it meant oh and theres the mating flight itself the better the flight the easier it is foraheverything to get together gets the blood and other things moving and with a strenuous flight there he said preferring a sheet of notes the better the flight the more likely that there will be more than one gryphlet conceived but thats basically it skan sat down heavily right in the doorway hard to believe after all the mystery all the bitterness that it could be so simple but thats all he asked too surprised to feel elation yet thats it cinnabar shrugged and idly braided a strand of hair the rest is simply urthos own indulgence in theatricswhich is considerable he is quite an artist most of his notes were involved with that and only that i promise you though that unless those guidelines are strictly adhered to you gryphons will be as sterile as always she tilted her head to one side and regarded him with dark thoughtful eyes he designed you very well and i think you ought to know that his notes said precisely why he made you sterile unless elaborate preparations were made skan waited for her to elaborate but she was obviously enjoying herself in a peculiar way and intended to make him ask why well why did he the gryphon growled some of the anger he had felt at urtho was back not that i cant think of a number of reasons we are supposed to be warriors after all and its difficult to wreak destruction away from home while there are gryphlets in the nest to tend to you have a flair for the dramatic yourself wreak destruction cinnabar teased skandranon tried to ignore her he might not have wanted to discover himself neckdeep in fledglings that would mean a strain on food supplies and hungry gryphons could decimate wild game over a wide area also were his creations he might have wanted more control over which pairings produced offspring that breeding program he might have wanted nothing but pure types he wouldnt have wanted hybrids i would imagine breeders usually dont he might only have wanted the control over us that holding this secret had the bitterness he felt in discovering kecharas plight and the records of the breeding program showed more than he liked so was i close cinnabars expression was understanding and her tone softened she leaned forward earnestly skan it was for none of those reasons here it is in his own words let me read it for you and i think you might feel a little better about all of this she bent over the notes and read them quietly aloud too often have i seen human parents who were too young too unstable or otherwise unfit or unready for children produce child after doomed mistreated child i will have none of this for these my gryphons by watching them and then training others what to watch for i can discover which pairings are loving and stable which wouldbe parents have the patience and understanding to be parents and in this way perhaps my creations will have a happier start in life than most of the humans around them while i may not be an expert in such things i have at least learned how to observe the actions of others and experience may give me an edge in judging which couples are ready for little ones those who desire children must not bring them into our dangerous world out of a wish for a replica of themselves a creature to mold and control a way to achieve what they could not or the need for something that will offer unconditional love for that they must look elsewhere and most likely into themselves cinnabar paused giving him a moment to absorb it all then continued the reasons for bearing young should simply be love and respect for the incipient child and for the world they will be born into if it took more effort to produce a child than the exercise of a moments lust perhaps there might be less misery in this world perhaps my gryphons will be happier creatures than their creator cinnabar looked back up at him expectantly skan simply sat where he was blinking surrounded by silence the sounds of the camp seemed very distant and somewhat removed from reality or perhaps eclipsed by a more important reality skandranons internal image of urtho had undergone multiple drastic changes over the course of the evening but this elationand a crazy joy began to grow in him again simple uncomplicated joy the same joy that hed had in his friendship with urtho and had thought he had lost this is more than i ever hoped to hear a reason a good one a sound one one even i can agree with he wrote that in his own hand to himself and no other the whole secret makes sense and look how even with all those precautions in place a mistake can happen one happened with zhaneel her parents died and she was neglected by others who thought her to be misborn i had no idea he had put such thought into this urtho is wiser than i thought he said at last his voice thick with emotion that he simply could not express he was right to guide us so oh i dare say you all can do well enough on your own tamsin told him with a twinkle in his eye if nothing else all this takes considerable effort on the gryphons part and a pair will probably think carefully before going to all that effort skandranon squinted his eyes shut tightly and took a deep breath then shook his body and flared his breast and back feathers theres no probably about it he told tamsin with some of his humor returning we can be as lazy as any other race there will be more young but not that many more not at first for one thingwith the war there is rarely the leisure to make such extensive preparations cinnabar smiled and nodded her understanding tamsin sighed by the way he said its obvious from the notes that a male or female cant be overweight if they want to produce a youngster and a mating flight has to be damned impressive in order to get everything moving well enough that fertility is assured if you cant put everything youve got into that flight well you wont get anything out of it except a bit of exercise he raised his eyebrow suggestively sometimes exercise can be very beneficial skan replied with dignity well lady cinnabar replied with a face so innocent that skan knew she was intending to prod him you should know ive heard youre probably the biggest expert in that type of gryphon exercise that has ever lived i skan contrived to look just as innocent as she he would never miss a chance to boast a little in good company anyone as wellknown as he had detractors to belittle any and all of his traits so it was up to him to say otherwise wasnt it i suppose since i am an expert dancer attractive and skilled in aerobatics you might be correct about that tamsins shoulders shook with silent laughter cinnabar simply smiled serenely and released the bit of hair she had been braiding id have been worried about you if youd said otherwise skan she said gravely a heartbeat later in all of this it would be easy to lose yourself i wont say that i am not feeling like a feather in a gale my lady but i have to maintain who and what i am and since i am irresistible it is only responsible for me to say so to reassure you all that i have not been overwhelmed i owe you most profound thanks my friends he quickly continued changing the subject before cinnabar could ask him who he was supposedly irresistible to i could not have done this alone and that is perhaps the first and last time you will have heard the black gryphon admit he could not do something indeed tamsins brows rose quite a concession your highness we were going to ask for all your possessions as payment but that concession is rarer than cinnabar elbowed her lover sharply hes serious dolt she scolded about the thanks that is so much so that i cannot think how to properly repay you skan told her softly it will not only be me that owes you a tremendous debt but all of us but cinnabar only shook her head dont think of it as owing anyone she replied the expression in her face was affectionate think of it simply as a gift between friends perhaps the greatest gift that we could ever give youand it was a privilege to do so not a burden he regarded her with surprise he had not known that she felt that wayoh he had known that they were his friends but he had never realized just how much that word could mean why he asked making no secret of his surprise cinnabar looked thoughtful for a moment tamsin amberdrake and i are greater admirers of your folk than you know i think it is the same with nearly all the trondiirn as well one cannot deal with gryphons without feeling that admiration there is so much about you that is good skan ground his beak torn between pleasure and embarrassment it was one thing for him to boast about gryphons in general and himself hi particularit was quite another thing to hear such effusive praise coming from the sweet lips of lady cinnabar who had traveled the world been entertained in the highest courts and seldom praised anything or anyone still you are an aggravating lot she continued her expression lightening with mischief and an abundance of equally aggravating nestlings is exactly what you all deserve to teach you proper humility skan snorted and drew himself up to his full height until his crest flattened against the canvas roof of the tent indeed he replied we shall be put in our place if you would be so kind as to teach me that simple healing spell of yours then tell me what herbs are needed i will start circulating the information among the others all ready my friend tamsin flourished a neatlylettered paper at him memorize this follow it through to the letter and the joys of parenthood will be yours and any other gryphon that you want to condemn to years of nestlingfeeding babychasing and endless rounds of whyyyyyyyjust give them this skan took it from him and quickly committed the contents to memory as soon as he had finished reading it he tucked the paper away in his neckpouch for safekeeping have either of you heard anything from the mages yet he asked both shook their heads i know i wont be able to sleep until i do tamsin said in all seriousness what happens with the mages is very likely to affect what happens to you and the other nonhumans i know skan tongued the point of his beak for a moment well i have a reasonable idea shall we lie in wait for vikteren he will want to know what happened to us as much as we want to know what happened to him tamsin rose and offered his hand to cinnabar lets go ambush the man they found vikteren coming to look for them on the path halfway between the tower and healers hill weary and not terribly coherent and in the end it turned out that the resolution wasnt much of a resolution at all vikteren was exhausted by the time the meeting broke up and all he would say to them when he met them was well we have a solution of sorts nobodys entirely happy so i guess it must have been a good compromise that was enough for tamsin and cinnabar particularly since cinnabar knew she would hear urthos version soon enough but not soon enough for skan the young mage promised skan an explanation after he had gotten some rest and skan made certain to assail him again the next day when they headed for zhaneels obstacle course vikteren was able to elaborate a little more on what had evidently turned out to be one of the most anarchic meetings ever perpetrated in urthos ranks there was a lot of complaining a lot of yelling a lot of talking but i can pretty much boil it down in a couple of sentences we bitched and moaned named names and pointed fingers that took up most of the night urtho said the mages dont know strategy so theyre in no position to dictate it but he agreed that we had some points that there were certain leaders who acted as if troops were expendable and that he would take care of it and in the meantime the mages were to retain their assignments but now to report directly to that kaledain adept snowstar who would report directly to him thats where we left it vikteren shrugged snowstar wasnt really pleased about being appointed like that but hes the most organized adept next to urtho that i know so i figure hes the logical choice he has a huge staff of attendants to keep records and a dozen messengerbirds anyway the mages bitched about so little actually being done but the generals bitched too about giving up any of their power so i guess we came out ahead i would say you did they settled down on a little rise in the shade skan had come here to watch zhaneel again but vikteren was not participating in this run she was supervising other gryphons on the obstacle course vikteren was not up to helping her and all these others in what was still unofficial training of course according to rumor that would change trainer shire was pushing for it and he had the backing of some of the mages who saw this as an excellent place to train apprentices in combative magics but until this training became official anything vikteren did here was going to be with strictly limited resources neither of them knew what had gone on in zhaneels little talk with winterhart other than the fact that zhaneel appeared much more confidentand that she had told aubri that the trondiirn winterhart actually had a point worth considering the point it seemed was that gryphons who were unsuited to her style of attackandevasion tried to emulate it and that she and the trainer needed to supervise them before they hurt themselves so now zhaneel actually found herself in a position of authority which had to be a unique experience for her it seemed to be doing her a great deal of good at least from what skan could see he observed that there were a number of positive changes in her she walked stood and even flew with more confidence more energy she looked others straight in the eyes even humans to whom she had formerly deferred with abject humility her feathers were crisp and neatly preened her coat shone with health in short she was the most desirable creature he had ever laid eyes on in his life however he wasnt the only gryphon to make that particular observation it did not escape his notice that the other male gryphons exerted themselves andposedwhenever she happened to look their way it was also apparent that she was perfectly well aware of their interest it was enough to make him grind his beak in frustration she treated them all impartially which was some relief but she wasnt paying the least bit of attention to him which was no relief at all he was sitting quite prominently in the open after all he was always conspicuous to gryphons especially in the daylight surely she saw him had she forgotten already how he had defended her to winterhart so how are you coming with spreading your little secret around vikteren asked idly braiding grass stems into a string it spreads itself skan replied watching as zhaneel demonstrated a tuckandroll maneuver and wondering if his poor flesh arid bones had healed enough to permit him to join her pupils his dancing skills would surely help him in becoming a star pupil what had become of that shy little gryfalcon who had so aroused his protective instincts the instinct she aroused now was anything but protective i told the eight wingleaders and their mates they in turn told four more gryphons each and so forth as tamsin said it is an absurdly simple thing once you know how much was simple misdirection i expect that in three days every gryphon here will know and that includes zhaneel but the information i want to give herimust find a way to get her alone i need to tell her what she really is has anyone asked how you came by this the young mage glanced at him sideways or are you playing stupid skan laughed and raised his eartufts i seldom need to play stupid if anyone asks i have half a dozen different tales to explain how i learned this information none of them are true and all of them are plausible the greater truth is that this is so important to us all that no one is likely to question the origin so long as tamsin and cinnabar can verify that it is accurate and it is so important that i do not believe there is a single gryphon who will even tell his hertasi that he is privy to the secret at least not soon no one wishes urtho to learn that we have this knowledge until i am ready to tell him vikteren raised both eyebrows so youre the victimsorrythe volunteer wholl take him the bad news and get nailed to his workroom wall skandranons nares flushed deep red he could have done without hearing that urtho is my friend and right or wrong it was my idea to steal the secret i should be the one to face urtho and not a messenger the gryphons are all agreed that i will be the one to tell him that he no longer controls us through our wish for progeny they believe i am the one who can best express this without causing him to react badly you mean they think hes less likely to remove portions of your hide than that of any other gryphon vikteren observed theyre probably right i can only hope skan muttered i can only hope will zhaneel know where the knowledge came from when it is passed to her he sighed iwish i dared tell her myself amberdrake had taken to finding zhaneel for a few moments every day just to talk if he could this evening was no exception and this evening for a change he had quite a bit of free time that was just as well all the recent improvement in her spirits and morale had triggered a partial molt and she had a number of new bloodfeathers with feathersheaths that needed to be flaked and preened away he hadnt done that for any gryphon except skan since his days as an apprentice and a featherpainter the simple task was oddly soothing feeling the hardness of the feathershaft against the softness of the insulating down the pulse of her heartbeat just under the deep red skin and the incredible heat a gryphons body generated was always exhilarating he was there again today zhaneel told amberdrake as he helped her groom her itching feathers i saw him he looked thin amberdrake did not need to ask who he was and the kestrachern smiled to think of the mighty skandranon watching zhaneel from afar like a lovesick brancher in a juvenile infatuation he is thin amberdrake replied thats partially because hes recovering from his injuries we havent been letting him exercise as much as hed like he always overstresses himself too soon after hes been hurt but i think he might benefit from one of your classes should i see if hes interested interested hell probably claw his way through anyone who stands in his way to get in oh zhaneels nares paled i he dont let him overawe you my dear amberdrake said sharply he is just a gryphon like any other yes he is beautiful but he has as many faults as he has virtues you are an expert on these new tactics of yours he is not amberdrake tapped her gently and playfully on the beak furthermore if you are interested in him dont show it he has females flinging themselves at him all the time you need to establish yourself as different from them pretend you think of him with simple admiration for what hes done but no more i do not know she looked at him over her shoulder doubtfully i do not know that i can do that he is skandranon how can i not show her nares flushed with embarrassment why not he countered zhaneel you are every bit as good as he is you know that trainer shire and i have told you that daily havent we yees she said slowly so just be yourself it isnt as hard as you might think havent you always been yourself with me let your respect show and let him guess at the rest amberdrake carefully crumbled a bit of feathersheath from around a newlyemerging wing feather try to think of him the way you think of all those admiring gryphons who are showing off for you on your obstacle course you dont treat any of them specially she blinked at him in perplexity amberdrake sighed lessons in the gamesplaying of love never went easily it was a concept totally foreign to zhaneel but eventually she grasped it the quail that escapes is always fatter than the one you catch she observed i will try if you think that will work since no one has ever succeeded in playing that particular game with skan before i suspect that it will amberdrake replied with amusement and whats more i think it will serve him right it will do him good to think that he suddenly cant have any lovely lady he wants should surprise him that theres one who is immune to all his charms he brushed zhaneels feathers down with a slightly oiled cloth both to pick up the feathersheath dust and to shine the feathers themselves there he said stepping back you look wonderful sleek tough competent ready for anything zhaneel bobbed her head with modest embarrassment or anyone he put his hand beneath her beak and raised it i tell you again you are a match for any gryphon that ever existed he nodded approval as she lifted her head again never forget that and remember who told you i am a kestrachern i know i shall try she promised solemnly good amberdrake tossed the cloth into a pile of things for gesten to clean up and sort pulled the tent flap aside and gestured to her to walk beside him care to take a stroll with me i have time if you do but she shook her head i would like this but truly i must go i have a mission to fly in the morning she glowed with pride a real mission and not make work for a misborn his heart plummeted it had been so easy to think of those exercises of hers as mere games and to forget that they were intended to make her fit for combat it had been possible to pretend that she would never go where so many others had been lost a long one he asked trying not to show his apprehension there was no more reason to be apprehensive about her than about any other gryphon less so in fact for the makaar could not anticipate her moves as they could those of a gryphon with conventional training wasnt that what made skan so successful that the makaar couldnt anticipate what he would do next nevertheless a chill he knew only too well settled over him that is what makes skan so much of a target as well eliminate him and you strike a terrible blow at the gryphons as a whole for it makes them more predictable once again someone he knew and cared for would be going away making herself into a thing the enemy could strike at and and this was a war however he might like to forget the fact it was zhaneels responsibility to obey her orders wherever they took her a responsibility for which she had been bred and trained and she was so pleased so happy about this assignment so very proud that she had been entrusted with it how could he spoil it with his own fears and nerves he couldnt of course so as always he tried to ignore the way his insides knotted up around a ball of ice in the pit of his stomach and smiled and praised her as he had smiled and praised every fighter he had sent out to this war and despite the anxiety he felt he did mean every word that was his duty his responsibility give them confidence relax them make them forget the past if they must and remind them of what their reasons for fighting are show them that they have a life beyond the fighting a life worth saving it is a highflight mission zhaneel continued blissfully unaware of the way his heart ached and the pain in his soul the place where skandranon found those stickthings i am to carry the thing that urtho made which undoes them and fly a pattern while i make it work the rest of sixth wing east is to rain them with smokeboxes then the fighters come under cover of the smoke so she would be above the general level of the fighting presumably out of reach of any ground weapons but makaar theyll have to fight their way through sixth wing to get to her he reminded himself shes carrying one of urthos magic boxes which makes her nonexpendable theyll protect her if they can if the makaar dont get through if the magic really does work on those lightningsticks if if if who commanded this mission anyway if it was general shaiknamthen even carrying a precious magical artifact zhaneel was considered expendable by virtue of the fact that she was a gryphon urtho planned this zhaneel continued thereby easing some of his unspoken fears he commands the mission and general sulma farle is the field commander and i am to carry the magic thing because i have true hands to make it work if it is triggered too far away it will not work urtho says then fly high and well warrior amberdrake told her patting her shoulder with expertly simulated confidence i shall have fresh fish waiting for your return and a victory feast zhaneels tiny eartufts rose at that fresh fish she said clicking her beak in anticipation truly she adored fresh fishby which she meant still aliveand liked it better when they wiggled as she swallowed them where she had acquired this particular taste amberdrake could not imagine most gryphons preferred raw red meat and none but she liked their fish still living maybe theres some osprey in her somewhere or there are some eagles that have a liking for fish or maybe it is only because it is zhaneel truly he promised a victory feast between friends though i shall have my fish nicely cooked zhaneel made a little hiss of distaste to tease him but readily agreed to the celebration what amberdrake had not told her was that it was not going to be a victory dinner for two but for four zhaneel himself gestenand skandranon though he would not tell skan either this should be very amusing at the very least and with luck it would come off well now let her only survive this he thought as he saw her off to her roost for the night let her only survive this zhaneel held the precious box between her foreclaws although it was quite securely fastened to her elaborate harness by clips and straps so that it did not interfere with her flying in any way her orders from urtho had been quite detailed and just as specific she must come in very high far above the rest of the sixth wing she must then dive as steeply as she could then level off at about treetop height making a fast pass above the heads of maars troopers and press the catch that opened the bottom of the box as she did so a spy had confirmed that lightningsticks had been distributed to the fighters urtho had told her before she lefturtho himselfthat the thing in the box was something like a lantern and its light would make the lightningsticks useless as its rays fell on them she would have to make several passes in order to be certain of getting most of the lightningsticks and each time he wanted her to come in from high above at great speedhopefully so great that no one could train his weapons on her in time and no makaar would be swift enough to follow like a peregrine falcon on a flock of ducksor a merlin harassing pigeons it would take several passes to be certain of most of the lightningsticks for the box was useless past a certain range and even urtho was not sure how many passes it would take to neutralize the bulk of them it depended on how closely the troops had been packed together and whether maars mages had put shielding on the sticks themselves or those who carried them it would likely be on the stick maar would not care if the man survived so long as the stick did the box would work through a shield urtho was confident of that hed warned her not to use any spells if she had them saying the box was simply a thing that negated the controlling force on magic it would negate the shield as well as the sticks power pent within the trick was he couldnt anticipate the effect of two spells being negated at the same time he had used the only example of the stick that they had in making certain the box worked at a reasonable distance zhaneel had seen the effect of thatnot much a little light and that was all but there were easily twenty types of shields urtho had said and the troops could possibly be protected by a barriershield a force deflector a painbringer or a concussion fieldthe complex interaction of three spells could not be anticipated without knowing what kind of shield maar would use whatever it is i do not think it will affect us unless it unleashes winds that could happen i must anticipate that or great light that might blind us i must think of that as well they neared the target zhaneel signaled her flight and took herself high up above the clouds so high that the other gryphons of her wing were scarcely more than ranks of dots below her even to her keen eyes wisps of clouds passed between her and them the sun overhead scorched her outstretched wings and back but the wind bit bitterly against her nares her underbelly and her foreclaws the precious box protected her chest from the wind but the icy currents chilled her throat and her breath only warmed when it reached her lungs was she high enough the air was very thin up here and her lungs and wings burned with the effort of staying aloft soon enough though she would be a spear from the heavens they neared their objective laisfaar at the pass of stelvi zhaneel had never seen the town when it had been in urthos hands but she had been told that the invaders had wrought terrible changes there they bring terrible change wherever they go why should here be any different there had been gryphons here well she knew well enough what maars forces did to gryphons they had assuredly done such terrible things to her own parents reason enough to hate the creatures below reason enough to wish that what she carried might do terrible things to them it was time she swept her wings back slowly there there was the pass and below it maars troops a moving blotch upon the land below her fellows of the wing black makaar labored up from their perches on the heights a swarm of evil they rose like biting flies to attack the oncoming forces to pull the gryphons to the ground where the men there could capture them in cruel wire nets and stab them with terrible biting spears the men below who have the lightningsticks she folded her wings and dropped like a stone from heaven foreclaws clutched around the precious weapon the mage of silence had entrusted to her faster faster the wind of her dive pressed against her as the earth rose up in her eyes and it seemed as if the earth was trying to pull her down and swallow her she narrowed her eyes and kept her wings pulled in tightly against her body guiding herself with a tiny flick of a primary a movement of the tail even a single claw outstretched for a fraction of a heartbeat the other gryphons could not spare an eye for her she must watch out for them she must avoid them as she lanced through the center of their formation this would take timing of the most delicate kind and the control of the best but not for nothing had she danced her dance of speed and skill against the imaginary enemies of her obstacle course even as the makaar closed with the leaders she shot arrowswift straight past makaar and gryphon alike unstoppable the ground rushed at her now zhaneel arched her neck and fanned her wings open feeling them vibrate as if the mountains themselves pushed her toward the ground as she strained by treetop height she had changed her angle just enough to pull out of the dive but she was still streaking almost as rapidly as her initial stooping dive and her foreclaws tightened opening the shutter on urthos magic box as she skimmed over the heads of the fighterswho were nothing but so many uptilted heads and round open mouths to her passing below in a blur her course took her straight for the cliff and she headed for it unswervingly these fighters did not seem to have the magic sticks but the ones between this lot and the cliff could an explosion ofnot light but actual fireflashed up at her from below startling her causing her to veer and slow a trifle what was that did maar have some new weapon to use against her taking no chances she aborted the run closing the shutter and shooting skyward again opening her wings as she pumped furiously laboring back up above the clouds to her position of superiority only then did she look down to focus on the place where the fire had come from the ground there was littered with blackened bodies most of them still afire and they did not movewhile the troops around that area tried to flee slowly the answer came to her maar shielded these new weapons of his just as we thought he might and urtho said he could not tell what canceling two such spells would do perhaps the shield holds just enough that it contains the force of the lightningstick and turns it into a fireball savage joy filled her heart as she realized the havoc she could wreak among her enemies and she folded her wings again this time they saw her coming pointing running they tried to evade her she knew what was in their minds they thought that it was the box she carried that was the source of the attack on them and not the properties of one of the weapons they themselves carried zhaneel quickly learned the range of the light as she purposefully pursued the fleeing men rising into the sky only to descend again leaving fire death and terror in her wake her heart pounded with lust and excitement the blood sang in her veins makaar tried to stop her but she was too swift for them either they fell by the wayside or they got too close to her and she sent them tumbling injured out of the sky slashed by one of her wicked hindfeet to be finished off by one of the other gryphons when they tried to set an ambush for her the others broke it up when makaar tried to get above her the cold and thin air drove them back down gasping for breath again and again she made her runs as flashes of orange and blossoming flames traced her path on the ground and her fellow gryphons pursued the makaar pursuing her but finally there were no more of those explosions and the makaar turned tail and ran their numbers depleted to less than half of those that had risen to fight off the gryphons zhaneels instincts screamed at her to pursue the makaar but she remembered her orders and fought the impulse taking herself and her burden up into the clouds again where the makaar could not go now was her moment of retreat and the sixth wings moment of glory it was time for the other gryphons to detach the canisters on the harnesses around their shoulders and drop them creating a pall of choking smoke to confuse the enemy the few mages below would be trying to negate the magical attack of urthos box not knowing it would simply negate any spell they threw at her they would assume that the smoke was magical in nature as well and waste precious time trying to destroy an illusion or cancel out a smokespell by the time they realized that it was real smoke and called up winds to disperse it it would be too late she would not be there to see the result urthos orders were specific when there are no more fighters carrying lightningsticks return home perhaps skandranon might have ignored those orders to fight makaar but as zhaneel reached her altitude again the elation and battlelust drained away leaving her only weary and ready to drop and perch at the first possible moment her wings ached holding them tight and steady against her dives over and over again had taken a toll of her muscles that not even preparation and strengthening on the obstacle course had prepared her for her neck and back felt strained and she longed for a high peak where she could rest for just a moment no rest not now no telling who is watching and one gryphon with a magic box is no match for maar or another great mage and he will want you little gryphon for spoiling his lovely lightningsticks and hurting his fighters fly fast zhaneel if you are lucky he will not track you now fear which battleheat had kept away for so long set hard cold claws into her and gave her wings new strength how far could maar scry would he know to look for one particular gryphon would he look high or among the others would he look for one lone gryphon retreating no way to tell zhaneel the only escape is to fly fly fly away back to urtho and his shields his mages her wings pumped her lungs labored and she cast a look behind her smoke rose above the battlefield thick and white obscuring everything to the rear under the cover of that smoke urthos groundfighters gated in to retake stelvi pass and behind her below her just above the level of the smoke were little dots of brown and gold bluegray and white moving in her direction the gryphons of sixth wing properly deployed turning to follow her home their job done as well maar had more things to think about than one little gray gryphon swiftly winging her way back to his enemys home urtho had sent enough troops to take stelvi pass without the devastating effect of the explosions zhaneel had inadvertently set off now the fighters of the sixth would be encountering a demoralized and frightened enemy as well as one confused by the smoke her fear ebbed and she slowed to let her fellows catch up with her yes maar had more than enough on his hands at the moment he would not waste scrying on her her task was over but the reclaiming of laisfaar had only begun she and the others would learn the end of it with everyone else and not until it was long over but their chances were good and the odds were with them to win this one and at the moment that is enough twelve winterhart paused at the threshold of amberdrakes tent squinting out into the sunlight amberdrake dropped his hand down onto her shoulder in a gesture meant to convey comfort and support remember he said right now nothing that you or i will do can change the outcome of whats happening with the sixth if you did everything in your power to get each and every gryphon ready for this then you have contributed enough and if you have prepared for the worst case you can imagine then you are ready for their return no one could expect any more than that only the gods have the ability to do more i know i mean my head knows but winterhart began then listen to your head and stop thinking you have to be superhuman he patted her shoulder once and then gave her a little nudge in the direction of the path to the gryphons landing field theyll be coming back soon i think right andthank you amberdrake for the advice as well as the massage winterhart smiled wanly but it was a real smile and one of the few he had seen on her face it was a start at any rate she took herself off and amberdrake dropped the tent flap as soon as winterhart was out of sight sighed and retreated to the comforting surroundings of his private quarters once there he flung himself down on his bed and performed the little mental exercises that allowed him to relax each and every muscle in his back and neck without benefit of a massage not that i wouldnt love one but i dont have time to call in any favors right now not and still get my little victory feast together he still had his share to do though the bulk of that preparation had fallen as always on the capable shoulders of gesten they had raided amberdrakes hoard of tokens to prepare for this but it had been gesten who had done the truly impossible when it came to the feast itself he had found a party of convalescing fighters willing and able to go hunting and fishing in exchange for those tokens and now there was a prime raebuck waiting for skan a tub full of moontrout for zhaneel and most precious of all a covey of fat young quail as appetizers before the main course amberdrake could not recall the last time he had seen a quail in the camp and he had purloined one of them for his meal without a blush and for gesten the hunters had picked a basket full of the succulent spongemushrooms that the hertasi prized so much it would indeed be a feast and a welcome change for all of them from camprations skan had assured him any number of times that different creatures tasted differently even to a carnivore that did not cook or season its meals and that he and every other gryphon grew as tired of the taste of herd beasts as any soldier grew of field rations but before he could do anything winterhart had had a therapy session scheduled the last one of the day before the feast she was making progress both physically and mentally but with all of the sixth wing gone winterhart had nothing to do and that meant that she started thinking she needs to think less and act more that was just one of her many many problems she thought too much and there were times when she became paralyzed with indecision as one possibility after another occurred to her those were the times when she was most vulnerable to anyone who would come along and give her ordersfor if she followed someone elses orders she could not be blamed if something went wrong or so her insidious little circle of reasoning went so seldom did winterhart do anything on impulse that she literally could not recall the last time she had followed such a course or so she says then again given what i surmise of her upbringing it probably is true part of that was due in no small part to that lover of hersbetter say bedmate since love had very little to do with that relationshipthe sixth wing mage conn levas amberdrake still had no more idea of how she had come to be involved with that selfish bastard than he did of how she had come by a kaledain name when she was no more kaledain than lady cinnabar was information about her past came in tiny bits pieces that she let loose with extreme reluctance he had guesses that was all everything about winterhart that showed on the surface was an illusion a mask intended to keep the observer from asking questions she was not kaledain but she knew enough about them to choose an appropriate kaledain namesince most of the trondiirn were kaledain having such a name would tend to keep a casual acquaintance which was all she allowed from asking why she had chosen such a service that made him think she must have had exposure to the kaledain in the past she had parents who had expected the infinite of her and would reward nothing less hence the selfexpectation that she must be superhuman she had impeccable manners that in and of itself was interesting for she tried to pretend that she was nothing more than an ordinary trondiirn whatever their virtues the kaledain did not cultivate the kind of manners that the elite of urthos land learned as a matter of course she tried to act as much like conn levas and his ilk as she could but it was an act and it slipped when she was under stress she had to think in order to act thoughtlessly insults did not fall easily from her lips and she could not bring herself to curse under any circumstance whatsoever in short whenever she did not think she was observed or when she was under stress she acted like a lady in a camp where it was often difficult to find the time to bathe thoroughly and regularly she was immaculate at all times in an army where no one cared if your uniform was a little shabby hers looked as if it had been newly issued neatly pressed pristine and far more to the point she had the manner born she carried herself as if she never doubted her own authority nor that she had the right to that authority to amberdrakes mind that spelled out only one thing far from being the commoner she pretended to be she was of noble birth perhaps as high as cinnabars that might be why she avoided cinnabars presence as much as possiwe if the lady ever got a good look at her long enough for unconscious mannerisms to show through the trondiirns carefully cultivated facade winterharts ruse might well be over one could change ones face gain weight or lose it alter clothing and hair with the exchange of a little coin but habits and mannerisms often proved impossible to break then again cinnabar is the soul of discretion she might already have recognized winterhart and shes keeping quiet about it if there were no compelling reasons to unmask winterhart cinnabar would probably let things stand now that he came to think about it ever since he had begun winterharts treatments lady cinnabar had been very silent on the subject of that particular trondiirn this despite cinnabars intervention at the time of the hertasi incident the healer had been as angry as anyone else over winterharts parroted orders but since then she had not said a word about winterhart even when others discussed something she had said or done perhaps cinnabar recognized her or perhaps not in any event the lady was a powerful enough empath as well as a healer to realize once she had been around the trondiirn for any length of time how much of winterharts coldness was due to emotional damage and fear little by little she reveals herself to me as she begins to trust me but i think this may be the most difficult case i have ever dealt with zhaneel was simple in comparison she only needed to learn how outstanding she was and to be given a way to succeed on her own terms once she had those she blossomed winterhart has so pent herself up that i do not even know who she truly is only what the facade and the cracks in it tell me winterhart is afraid every moment of her life and she has yet to show me what she is afraid of maybe that was why she had taken conn levas into her bed the man was appallingly simple to understand simply give him everything he wants and he is happy to let you have an identity as his woman he is protection of a sort because he is so possessive about everything he thinks is his he doesnt even know she isnt a kaledain he thinks she is just because of the name thats how unobservant he is then again that was simply a reflection of what amberdrake already knew a mercenary mage in this war only for the pay would have to be unobservant anyone who could even consider being in the pay of maar would have to be completely amoral but conn levas was incidental to the puzzle amberdrake laid his forearm across his eyes for a moment and tried to put the pieces he had so far into some kind of an arrangement when she joined the army it had to be for a reason i dont know what that reason is yet but she joined it under a cloud of fear terrified that her identity would be revealed even though since she is very intelligent she must have chosen the profession of trondiirn because it was utterly unlike anything else she had been known for in her previous identity she may also have taken that position because of another fear the trondiirn do not normally go anywhere near the front lines i know that fighting terrifies her i know that she is horribly afraid of what maar and his mages can do he had seen her in the grip of that fear himself more than once when the two of them had been together at a moment when news came in from the front lines she controlled herself well but there was always an instant when absolute terror painted her features with a different kind of mask than the facade of coldness she habitually wore so when conn levas propositioned her it must have seemed sent from the gods perhaps he even wooed charmed her i am certain that he has the ability to do just that when he chooses he had a position with sixth wing so would she he had an identity that no one questioned so would she as his woman no one would ask her anything personal and she could do her job among the gryphons impersonallyafter all they were obviously nothing more than sophisticated animals she could deal with them on terms that cost her nothing other than a bit of energy that was where zhaneel had inadvertently shaken up her world as much as amberdrake had the gryfalcon had forced winterhart to accept the fact that the gryphons in her charge were not sophisticated animals with limited ability to ape human speechfor she had tried to convince herself that they were only something a little larger than a messengerbird but along the same lines but zhaneel changed all that zhaneel showed her in no uncertain terms that these charges of hers were people and she had an obligation to them to see that they received treatment as such with consideration politeness and decency she had an obligation to act as their advocate to the commander of sixth wing she was in every way as responsible for them as their commander was she had not wanted to know that it was putting stresses on her that showed up when she came to get her treatments for her back from amberdrake so long as the gryphons had not been people to her she had been able to cope now they were real to her as they had not been before now she had to look at them and know there were personalities there behind the beaks and alien eyes personalities like those of every human in the ranks she was sending people off into the war to be swallowed up and she could no longer ignore that fact she had begun to feel again and ironically it was that very fact that was sending tremors through her relationship with her lover as long as she had not been able to feel she did not care what he did to her said to her or how he treated her now she did care and she was no longer giving him the absolute deference he required that much came through in the edited things that she told amberdrake circumstances have been keeping them separated quite a bit but once this operation is over hell be back wanting his rights shes not going put up with his arrogance and indifference to her feelings anymore she is bound to break off with him i dont think shes been sleeping with him much even when hes in camp maybe shes been finding reasons to avoid their tent i wonder if i should see if hes been going to any of the perchi or should i stay out of it it was hard to tell this was not the usual clientkestrachern relationship and had not been since the beginning and of the two people in the relationship only one was currently his client how much interference was too much when did need to know end and snooping begin and she was so profoundly damaged so terribly brittle a confrontation with conn levas would shatter her for he would not hesitate to use the most hurtful things he could think of against her yet under her fragility there was a core of strength that he would like to have the privilege of calling on from time to time he needed a confidant as much as she did and he had the feeling that once she sorted herself out she would be able to fill that need better than anyone he knew he sensed that he could trust her and there were not many people that a kestrachern could trust all too often the profession became a bone of contention or a cause for derision but somehow he knew that winterhart would never do that to him no matter what she would keep the things she knew would hurt the most under the tightest control he knew that even though he couldnt have told why he was so certain about it this end of camp was very quiet unusually so for the middle of the day off in the distance he heard a sergeant bellowing orders but here there was scarcely more than the chattering of messengerbirds and the occasional rattle of equipment he guessed that most of the other kestrachern had opted for a nap in anticipation of being needed when the sixth returned well all this thinking is not getting the dinner taken care of and i do have my share of it to do he was as relaxed as he was going to get and the tensionheadache that had threatened to bloom while he was counseling winterhart had gone away he took his arm away from his eyes and rolled off the bed time to get to work first thing find out what was happening with the sixth and the attempt to retake stelvi pass if all went well the first gryphons from sixth wing zhaneel leading should be coming back about now but there would be more than enough folk crowding the landing field at the moment and this was not supposed to be a mission whose purpose was widely known no point in making a spectacle when someone might make some inferences sofind a messengerbird or appropriate one the birds were easy enough to come by most times they swarmed the camp and all you had to do to attract one was to scatter some of their favorite seed on the ground and wait amberdrake didnt need the services of a bird often but he did have a small store of the succulent sunseeds handy since people liked the savory seeds as well as the little birds did and amberdrake was no exception to that liking he had a bag in his quarters next to the bed he dug out a handful and took the fat striped seeds to the cleared area in front of the tent where he scattered them in a patch of sunlight a few moments later he had his choice of a dozen birds all patterned in every color imaginable they pounced on the seeds with chortles and chirps making a racket all out of proportion to their small size he watched them for a moment trying to pick out a smart one then chose a clever little fellow whose colors of red and black with vivid blue streaks in his hackles made him easy to see at a distance he whistled to it and leaned down to extend his hand sending it a little tendril of comforting thought to attract it the bird hopped onto his outstretched hand with no sign of fear and waited for his orders cocking its head sideways to look at him while these were not the altered birds of prey favored by the kaledain they were able to respond fairly well to limited mental commands amberdrake held the bird so that he could look directly into one bright bronze eye and made his orders as simple as he could go to gryphonfield wait for gryphons look for this one he mentally sent an image of zhaneel listen return and repeat what you heard that last was a fairly common order when someone wanted to know what was going on in another part of the camp the birds could recall and repeat several sentences and the odds were good that at least one of those sentences would give some idea of what was happening at a distant location and if it didntwell you could send the bird back to eavesdrop some more the bird flew off lumbering away rather like a beetle they werent strong flyers and they were fairly noisy about it their wings whirred with the effort of keeping their plump little bodies aloft and they usually chirped or screeched as they flew so if you didnt want anyone to know what you were about you had plenty of warning before you actually saw a messengerbird arrive to snoop but many people made pets of specific birds as much for their engaging personalities and clownish antics as for their usefulness so you had to really go to an extraordinary amount of effort to avoid them there would without a doubt be hundreds of birds waiting at the gryphons landing field although it was supposed to be something of a secret that the sixth wing was going to try to retake stelvi pass enough people knew that the area would look as if the birds had learned of a major sunseed spill there that was the discreet way of learning about something the outcome of which was supposed to be a secret send a bird to watch rather than looking around yourself and i am nothing if not discreet well now that he had a winged informant aloft it was time to get on with the dinner itself the preparations on his part were fairly simple since a dinner with gryphons was by necessity informal he cleared the front of the tent of everything except the piles of pillows he saved one each for himself and gesten and arranged the rest in two gryphonsized couches on the rugs in front of these he placed waterproof tarpaulins gryphons were not neat eaters the buck the quail and the tub of trout were behind the tent and gesten was seeing to the cooking of his mushrooms and amberdrakes quail he had hinted that he would see to a few more small culinary surprises so that much was taken care of amberdrake changed into his kaledain festival clothing the real thing this time and not the fancy kestrachern fakery a silk shirt leather tunic and tight breeches both beaded and fringed and kneehigh fringed boots it was amazing how comfortable the leathers and silks felt and how simply shedding his identity of amberdrake the kestrachern made him relax a little further i wonder if winterhart has ever actually seen kaledain festival clothingor if she is only familiar with what we would wear to blend in with folk from outclan he was tying up his hair when the chattering of the messengerbird brought him to the front of his tent he held up his hand his eyes straining to spot the red dot of the bird against the bright sky the little redandblack creature whirred in and backwinged to a landing on his finger still chattering at a high rate of speed he placed one hand on its back to calm it and it fell silent for a moment as he took his hand away it muttered to itself a little then began repeating what it had heard although its voice was very much that of a bird the cadences and accents were readily identifiable as individual people sometimes the clever little things could imitate a favorite person so well that you would swear the person it was imitating was there before you but the first thing that the bird produced was a series of crowd noises among which a few phrases were discernible shes exhausted get water it isss all rrright this last obviously being zhaneel then the voice of trainer shire zhaneel i have a link to urtho here can you give him a quick report the bird spoke again in zhaneels voice her sibilants hissed and rs rolled much as skan spoke when he was agitated or weary the box hasss worrrrked it made explossssionssss and killed many ssso the sssticksss mussst have been sssshielded therrrre arrre injurrrred gryphonssss but no dead the ssssmoke wasss ssssprrreading when we rrrreturrrned and the fighterrrsss moving in the rrressst follow me the bird imitated the sound of a cheering crowd with uncanny accuracy zhaneel saying that she was fine and would take care of herself and the voice of winterhart countermanding that and ordering hertasi to be in readiness for injured gryphons coming in amberdrake very nearly cheered himself he gave the little bird his reward of fruit and sent him off to rejoin his flock with such elation that he came close to giving the bird more fruit than it could carry away he did kiss it an endearment which the little clown accepted with a chortle returning the caress with its mobile tongue zhaneel would be along after she made her longer report to urtho in person rested and cleaned herself up a bit skan was due before she arrived amberdrake had decided to get the black gryphon settled first skan did not know that zhaneel was the guest of honor at this feast he thought it was simply a whim of amberdrakes in a short time the camp was alive with rumors a steady hum of conversation coming from everywhere amberdrake knew that skan if he had not been at the landing field would surely be in the thick of things and have all the news by the time he arrived gesten arrived even before skan pulling a laden cart amberdrake raised an eyebrow at that he was not particularly concerned with the cost in tokens but where in a war camp had the hertasi found so much in the way of treats never mind better not to ask there were always those who had hoards of rarities and were willing to part with them for a price and tokens for the kestrachern were prized possessions eventually in an irony that amberdrake certainly appreciated there was no doubt that a fair number of those tokens would find their way back to his coffers anyway skans on the way gesten said as amberdrake hurried to give him a hand ive got some real goodies in here hope he appreciates em save the best for zhaneel she deserves it amberdrake told him with amusement huh got a couple things for you too drake and dont tell me you dont need a treat youve been wearing yourself out between that winterhart zhaneel and the black boy gesten pushed the cart to the back wall of the public room and opened it up look herefresh nutbread good cheese an not that tasteless army stuff a nice mess of vegetables pastry eels for zhaneel an heart for skan couldnt ask for better i have to agree to that amberdrake replied a little dazed i dont think i want to know where you got most of that legally the hertasi said turning up his snout saucily so none of your lip what about lip skan said pushing aside the tent flap is drake trying to give you excuses about why he cant have a proper meal for a change oh you know drake the hertasi replied before amberdrake could even say a word in his own defense if no one else has something he doesnt think he should have it either martyr martyr martyr that is not true amberdrake replied going straight over to the cart and popping a bit of pastry into his mouth to prove gesten wrong it is only that i do not think that i should take advantage of my position to indulge myself alone oh skan chuckled and what do you call this indulging a client amberdrake told him promptly you are one of my clients arent you well yes and you have been undergoing a prolonged and painful convalescence havent you well yes and you do deserve a bit of indulgence dont you skan coughed well i happen to there you see amberdrake turned to gesten in triumph moral indulgence my eye the hertasi replied chuckling and began taking things out of the cart skan eyed the heart appreciatively and moved a little nearer away from that you gesten slapped his beak thats your dessert and stop drooling i wasnt drooling skan replied with indignation i never drool it was on the tip of amberdrakes tongue to say not even over zhaneel but that would spoil the surprise so he winked at gesten and gave the hertasi a hand in unloading the gloriously laden cart while skan stood by and made helpful comments i hope you werent planning on eating right away amberdrake said as skan settled down on his pile of pillows this is a little early for me and id rather appreciate good food with a good appetite oh i can wait the black gryphon replied lazily besides by now everyone knows about the operation at stelvi and i expect you want to hear how the sixth did im sure youd tell us even if we didnt care gesten sniped but since we do care you might as well give us the benefit of your superior oration skandranon pretended to be offended for just a moment then tossed a pillow at him which gesten ducked expertly you cannot spoil my mood i am feeling far too pleased the sixth has retaken the pass the messages are in from the mages and the town is back in our hands he continued at length with as much detail as amberdrake could have wished for then concluded but i have saved the best for last his eyes gleamed with malicious enjoyment general shaiknam and commander garber have been placed on detached duty for medical reasons and general farle has been given the sixth wing as a reward for successfully commanding them in this operationand for i quote appropriate and strategic use of the air forces end quote meaning the gryphons amberdrake said with pleasure including zhaneel it was not his imagination skans nostrils flared at the sound of her name and his nares flushed a deep scarlet he was going to probe a little further but a shadow fell upon the closed flap of the tent ah here is our fourth guest he said instead and rose and went to the door of the tent himself lovely lady he said bowing and gesturing for zhaneel to come in you brighten our company with your presence zhaneel was looking very lovely if rather tired winterhart must have helped her with her grooming but then since zhaneel had been ordered to report directly to urtho before she came here the trondiirn would have taken pains to make her look especially good at least to human eyes from the stunned expression on skans face she looked especially good to gryphon eyes as well she stepped inside and only then did she see who was waiting there she froze in place and amberdrake put one hand on her shoulder to keep her from fleeing you know gesten of course he said quickly and this as you know is skandranoni do not believe you have actually been introduced but as i recall he gave you some good advice on the disposition of a valortoken amberdrake had no difficulty in reading skans eyes illget you for this one drake well this was fair return for the false impression that skan had given poor little zhaneelhowever well the whole affair had turned out he owed skan for that one i took the liberty of adding him to your victory dinner zhaneel he added i didnt think you would mind no she replied faintly of course not but to her credit she did not bolt she did not become tonguetiedin fact she recovered her poise in a much shorter time than he would have thought she blinked once or twice then moved forward into the room and took her place on the pile of pillows that amberdrake pointed out to her skan recovered some but by no means all of his aplomb as the dinner progressed he was much quieter than usual leaving most of the conversation to amberdrake and gesten zhaneel managed to seem friendly toward skan and full of admiration but not particularly overwhelmed by him an attitude that clearly took him rather aback as darkness fell and gesten got up to light the lamps she seemed to relax quite a bit of course these were familiar surroundings to her by now and perhaps that helped put her at ease before the dinner was over skan did manage to ask if she would accept him into one of her training classes subject of course to amberdrakes approval hes my healer you know skan added hastily best gryphonhealer there is he fell silent then as amberdrake grinned why thank you skan the kestrachern replied i personally think youre more than overdue for some retraining if zhaneel is willing to accept someone whos as likely to give her arguments as not i should be pleased she said with dignity as her eyes caught the light of the lamps skandranon is wise enough to know that one does not argue with the trainer on the field i think her nares were flushed but in the dim light of the tent only amberdrake was near enough to notice did you know that general farle is being given command of the sixth he asked changing the subject skan brought us the news no she exclaimed with delight and pleasure but that is excellent most excellent indeed he is a good commander most went according to plan there were no missed commands and when things happened outside of the plan general farle had an answer for them that leaves shaiknam and garber at loose ends though gesten put in his voice full of concern i dont know i just dont like thinking of those two with nothing to do but think about how theyve been wronged but they havent been skandranon protested they retain their rank they retain all their privileges they simply do not have a command anymore which means they have no power gesten countered they have no prestige they messed up and everyone knows it theyve been shamed theyve lost face thats a dangerous mood for a man like shaiknam to be in amberdrake only shrugged dangerous if he still had any power or any kind of followingbut he doesnt and thinking of him is spoiling my appetite general shaiknam will descend to his deserved obscurity with or without us so lets forget him i second that motion skan rumbled and applied himself to his coveted heart as zhaneel ate her eels and yet somehow despite his own words amberdrake could not forget the general or his welldeserved reputation for vindictiveness skandranon ached in every muscle and he needed more than a bath he needed a soak to get the mud and muck out of his feathers but that was not why he came looking for amberdrake hoping that his friend was between appointments drake wasnt in the public portion of his tent but the disheveled state of the place told skan that the kestrachern had been there so short a time ago that gesten hadnt had time to tidy up as it happened luck was with him drake was lying on a heap of pillows in his own quarters looking about the same way that skan felt when the gryphon poked his nose through the slit in the partition thunderheads skan exclaimed whove you been wrestling with or should i ask what rather than who you look like youve been fighting the war by yourself dont ask amberdrake sighed levering himself up off the bed it isnt what you think you dont look much better the kestrachern pulled sweaty hair out of his eyes and regarded skan with a certain weary amusement zhaneel i trust skan flung himself down on the rug right where he stood yes he replied but it isnt what you think unfortunately it was a lesson he groaned as his weary muscles complained about just how weary they were i thought i might impress her it was a bad idea she decided that if i was that much better than the rest of the class i could run her course along with her amberdrake passed a hand over his mouth skan glowered youd better not be laughing he said accusingly amberdrake gave him a look full of limpid innocence now why would i be laughing he asked guilelessly you look all in youve obviously been pushing yourself just as hard as you could why would i laugh at that skan only glowered more he couldnt put it into words but he had the distinct feeling that drake was behind all of this somehow zhaneel the lessons the private lessonall of it i have been pushing and pushed and i am exhausted i need to borrow gesten drake or im never going to get the mud out of my coat and feathers and i wish youd let me steal your magic fingers for a bit and he sighed finally admitting his downfall and i need to talk to you amberdrake nodded as if he had expected as much which if he really is behind all this shouldnt surprise me in private i take it the kestrachern asked as if he didnt know very private skan confirmed and flattened his eartufts to his skull in real misery drake its zhaneel shes the onethe one and im nothing more to her than one of her students and just how do you figure that amberdrake asked casually because shei just dont impress her no matter what i do skan exclaimed in desperation its driving me insane i dont know what to do let me see if i understand what youre saying correctly amberdrake replied leaning back on one elbow you have decided that zhaneel is your ideal mate and you are upset because she isnt following you and draping herself all over you like every other gryphon youve wanted then when you strut and puff and act in general like a peacock she still isnt impressed is that it skan felt his nares flushing hotly i wouldnt put it that way he protested i would gesten said from behind him the hertasi pushed his way in through the curtains past skan feh he added you look like a used mop if i were a female i wouldnt have you either drake skan cried gesten thats enough amberdrake admonished skan has it ever once occurred to you to go and talk with the lady just talk not to try to impress her but to find out what shes like what she thinks is important what kind of a person she is find out about her instead of talking about yourself ah the gryphon stammered try it some time amberdrake said leaning back into his pillows you might be surprised by the results gesten this used mop would like to know if youre willing to help him look more like a gryphon i can go get a bath in the shower tent for once i look worse than i feel if you want gesten said dubiously i think you sprained something then i can get cinnabar to unsprain it for me amberdrake said to the roof of the tent go on skan needs your help more than i do at the moment and we are supposed to be sharing your very excellent services all right the hertasi said with resignation come on black boy but youll have to put up with my massaging drake is definitely not going to be up to it skan climbed to his feet with more groans right now id accept a massage from a makaar he replied and id court the damned thing if it would get the muck off me gesten looked back over his shoulder and batted his eyes at skan in a clever imitation of a flirtatious human why skan i never guessed harboring an unfulfilled passion for little me skan only snorted and followed the hertasi into the sunlight behind the tent gesten opened up a box built into the side of the wagon that carried amberdrake and all his gear when the entire army was on the move and got out the brushes and special combs needed for grooming gryphons you really ought to go find a vacant tub and have a bath the hertasi said looking him over youre mage enough to heat the water so your muscles dont stiffen up in the cold once you brush me out please skan pleaded if i go in like this itll be a mud bath you have a point the hertasi picked up one of the brushes and set to work with a will bits of dried caked mud flew everywhere with the force of gestens vigorous strokes so besides you being infatuated with zhaneel and her having the good sense to see through you what else is new out there skan ignored the first part of the question to answer the second whats new is that we may have the pass but maar isnt budging another toelength he shook his head and leaned into gestens brush i dont know gesten i cant tell if things look good for us or bad neither can anyone else gesten put the brush down and picked up one with finer bristles urtho doesnt know what to do i hear maar wont leave us be and urtho wont spend troops like maar does to get rid of him thats the problem with an ethical commander the leader who doesnt care how many of his men he kills has an edge skan shook his head too much for me at least right now the hertasi snickered yah i know whats on your mindwhat there is of it dont know how drake thinks youre going to impress zhaneel with it since i havent seen much evidence of a mind in you since i met you skan did not rise to his teasing this time gesten he said hesitantly do you really think shed ever pay any attention to me if i did what drake said nothing ive done has worked so try it who knows gesten slapped him on the shoulder raising a cloud of dust the mans job is the heart you know i figure he probably knows what hes talking about skan considered that gesten was right and besides i have to tell her what she is what i learned in the tower might as well kill two birds with the same stone as they say but first skan gesten cautioned theres something thats really important you need to do skan craned his neck around to look at him the hertasi sounded so serious what is it he asked anxiously gesten fixed him with a sobering gaze for a long moment then said with deadpan seriousness skanget a bath the hertasi made it all the way to the tent flap before the flung brush caught up with him thirteen zhaneel preened a talon thoughtfully then looked down at her hand hand and not a misshapen collection of foreclaws she was not some kind of an accident as amberdrake had surmised she was the living result of something that had been planned so she looked from the talon to skandranon and even though she managed to keep her expression calm and serene her heart raced to have him here beside her on her favorite rock overlooking the obstacle course i am the first of a breed you say and you saw evidence of that in urthos tower skan nodded his great golden eyes fixed upon her as steadily as if he were the needle of a compass and she were the northern cross the sun shone down on his black feathers bringing up the patterns in them that were normally concealed by the dye he used there seem to be about fifty different types altogether mostly broadwings eagletypes you are based on the only kind that looks really falconbased i dont know what urtho had in mind to call your type but id call you a gryfalcon gryfalcon she rolled the word around on her tongue it sounded even better when skan had said it than when amberdrake had come up with it and none of this she spread her foreclaws wide is accidental i am simply the only one of my kind not that i saw but zhaneel he hesitated a long moment and she looked at him curiously from the tension in his body he was trying to make up his mind about saying something more zhaneel you arent precisely the only one of your type only the first successful gryfalcon he ground his beak for a moment then clearly made up his mind to continue thereswell what wed call a real misborn in the tower too it looks as if she started out to be a gryfalcon but something went wrong shes distorted like a child in her head i think shes a neuter and there are probably other things wrong with her as well zhaneels tiny eartufts rose in the tower but whywhy would urtho keep her there i but then all of the slights and insults the teasing and the bullying of her own childhood returned to her and she knew why no i see gryphons did not cry but sadness made their throats tighten and triggered a need to utter a keening sound she bowed her head and stifled the urge to keen the poor poor thing perhaps it is as well that it is like a child for it cannot understand how cruel the world can be and it will not mourn what it has never seen does it have a name this poor little one skan nodded urtho calls her kechara and she says that he visits and plays with her often i dont think she is in any kind of pain or want kecharabeloved she took a deep breath and her throat opened again yes that would be like urtho to care for the poor thing that was not quite what he wanted to make it as happy as he could she had come to understand their leader very well during the past several weeks she wondered if skandranon knew how often urtho had taken the time to talk to her amberdrake knew and several times things that amberdrake had told her made her think that urtho had been talking with him about her but what does this mean for us i think that if we can we should find a way to free kechara with two of us to protect her she will not suffer taunts as i did do you not think with two of us acting as her family we should not have younglings just yet i think but kechara will serve as practice of a kind now that you have made it possible for us to do so whether or not urtho approves shyly she cocked her head to one side skan gaped at her looking extremely silly as the sense of what she had just suggested penetrated to him he looked even sillier a moment later but it was because he was giddy with elation but then so was she she knew how exhausted he must be after the workout of this afternoon yet from somewhere he found the strength to follow as she leapt into the air giving him a playful comehither look over her shoulder and as the moon rose she led him on a true courtship chase a chase that ended when they caught each other landing in the warm grass of a hillside far above urthos tower as was the only way to end a courtship chase after all this was the face of defeat chaos on the landing field shouting and the screaming of gryphons hurt too badly to keep still healers and trondiirn from the hill and every wing swarmed the site somehow never getting in each others way winterhart ignored it all as she held the bleeding gryphon in life by the barest of margins holding the mangled body together with gift and hands both until a more gifted healer could reach her she swore at and coaxed the poor creature by turns stopping only to breathe and to scrub tears from her eyes by rubbing her cheek against her bloodstained shoulder dont you die on me feliss she scolded not after all the work zhaneels put in on you if you die i swear im going to have urtho catch your spirit and put it in the body of a celibate priestess of kylan the chaste thatd teach you tears rose up again to blind and choke her she wiped them away again and ignored the way her own energy was running out of her the way feliss blood ran between her fingers gods gods it had been easier a few short weeks agobefore she had been forced to see these gryphons the way amberdrake saw them before she had found herself caring for them and about what happened to them before she learned to think of them as something more than a simple responsibility before amberdrake made her like them and zhaneel made her respect them tears rose again but there was no time now to wipe them away she held on griefblinded unable to see until a gift so much greater than hers that it dazzled her touched her and used her as the conduit to bring the healing to feliss that she had not been able to give emeraldgreen healing energy poured through her and beneath her hands the gaping wounds closed the flesh knit up the bleeding stopped winterhart closed her eyes and concentrated only on being that conduit on keeping feliss heartbeat strong until the energy faded blood no longer flowed through her fingers and the heartbeat strengthened of itself only then did she open her eyes again lady cinnabar removed her long aristocratic hands from where they rested atop winterharts and looked deeply into the trondiirns eyes winterhart was paralyzed frozen in place like a terrified rabbit she had been trying for weeks to avoid the ladys presence ever since the moment shed thought shed seen a flicker of recognition in cinnabars face who would ever have thought that a song would give me away shed been humming on her way back from a session with amberdrake her back felt normal for the first time in ages conn was still in the field and not in her bed and shed actually been cheerful enough to hum under her breath but she hadnt thought about what she was humming until she passed lady cinnabar hurriedly and with her face a little averted and the lady turned to give her a penetrating stare only then did she realize that she had been humming a song that had been all the rage at high king leodhans courtfor the single week just before maar had challenged the king to defend his land like the nobles who had fled the challenge in terror or simply melted away in abject fear the song had vanished into obscurity only someone like lady cinnabar who had been at the high kings court at that time would recognize it only someone else who had been part of the court for that brief period of time would have known it well enough to hum it winterhart had seen cinnabars eyes narrow in speculation just before she hurried away hoping against hope that cinnabar would decide that she was mistaken in what she thought she had heard but the lady was more persistent than that more than once winterhart had caught cinnabar studying her at a distance and she knew because this was the one thing she had dreaded that cinnabar was the kind of person who knew enough about the woman she had once been that the lady would uncover her secret simply by catching her in habitual things no amount of control could change or eliminate and nowhere the lady was staring into winterharts eyes with the look on her face of one who has finally solved a perplexing little puzzle you are a good channel and you worked today to better effect than i have ever seen you work before cinnabar said mildly and your ability and encouragement kept this feathered one clinging to life you are a better trondiirn and healer than you were a few weeks ago thank you winterhart said faintly trying to look away from cinnabars strange reddishbrown eyes and failing altogether you are much improved get rid of that conn levas creature and stand upon your own worth and you will be outstanding cinnabars crisp words came to winterhart as from a great distance he is not worthy of you and you do not need him reanna and with that she turned and moved on to the next patient leaving winterhart standing there stunned not just by the blunt advice but by cinnabars last word reanna winterhart went on to her next patient in a daze fortunately her hands knew what to do without needing any direction from her mind her mind ran in circles like a mouse in a barrel lady cinnabar knew winterhart had been unmasked how long before the lady told her kinsman urtho that reanna laurymissing and presumed fledwas working in the ranks as a simple trondiirn how long before everyone knew how long before her shame was revealed to the entire army but before winterhart could free herself from her paralysis cinnabar was back you and the rest can handle everything else from here on the healer said quietly im needed back up on the hill the gryphons are not the only injured and reanna winterhart started at the sound of her old name cinnabar laid one cool hand on winterharts arm no one will know what i have just spoken if you do not tell the healer said quietly if you choose to be only winterhart then winterhart is all anyone will know but i believe you should tell amberdrake he has some information that you should hear the lady smiled her famous dazzling smile sometimes being in the middle of a situation gives one a very skewed notion of what is actually going on if i were a minnow in the middle of a school i would not know why the school moved this way and that i would only see that the rest of the school was in flight and not what they fled i would never know when they ran from a pike or a shadow and with that rather obscure bit of observation the lady turned and was gone winterhart sat in her own austere tent braiding and rebraiding a bit of leather her nerves had completely eroded in another few moments she was scheduled for a treatment for her backtreatments she had come to look forward to the kestrachern amberdrake was the easiest person to talk to that she had ever known although the changes he had caused in her were not so easy to deal with but nowcinnabar knew and although she had said that she would not reveal winterharts secret she had also said something else i believe you should tell amberdrake cinnabars words haunted her who and what was this man that she should tell him what she had not told anyone the secret of her past that she would rather remained buried why would cinnabar say anything so outrageous and most of all why did she want to follow the ladys advice oh godswhat am i going to do what am i going to say she could say nothing of course but amberdrake was skilled at reading all the nuances of the body and he would know she was upset about something he had a way of getting whatever he wanted to know out of a person as easily as she could extract a thorn from the claw of one of her charges icould stop going to him i could find someone else to handle the rest of the treatments but she was not just seeing him for her back and she knew it not anymore amberdrake was the closest thing she had to a real friend in this place and what was more he was the only person she would ever consider telling her secrets to so why not do it because she didnt want to lose that friendship if he heard what she was how could he have any respect for her ever again then there was the rest of what lady cinnabar had said get rid of that conn lev as creature and stand on your own oh cinnabar was right about that she and conn were no more suited for each other than a bird and a fish and dealing with conn took more out of her than anyone ever guessed she had always known whether or not conn was aware of it that her liaison with the mage was temporary she had thought when she first accepted his invitation to be his woman that it would only last until maar overran them all and killed them a matter of weeks months at the most but urtho was a better leader than anyone had thought and she found herself living long past the time when she had thought she would be dead then she had decided that sooner or later conn would grow tired of her and get rid of her but it seemed that either most women around the sixth knew the mage for the kind of man he wasan overgrown child in many ways with a childs tantrums and possessivenessor else he perversely prized her he made no move to be rid of her for all his complaints of her coldness then again he was a master of manipulation and one of the people he manipulated as easily as breathing was her she didnt like unpleasantness she hated a scene she was easily embarrassed he knew how to threaten what to threaten her with and when to turn from threats to charming cajolery on her part the relationship originally had been as cool and prearranged as any marriage of state he supplied her with an identity and she gave him what he wanted they maintained their own separate gear and sleeping quarters they shared nothing except company but you dont allow someone into your bed without getting some emotional baggage out of it she was wise enough to admit that and even though she would have been glad enough to be rid of him as long as he claimed he had some feelings for her and he needed her she knew she would stay not until he walked away would she feel free of him amberdrake had skillfully pried that out of her alreadyand in so doing had made her face squarely what she had not been willing to admit until that moment she didnt want conn anymore she heartily wished him out of her life and the most he would ever be able to evoke in her was a mild pity there was no passion there anymore not even physical passion amberdrake gave her more pleasure than he did without ever once venturing into the amorous or erotic and now cinnabar saying she should be rid of him cinnabar must think hes a drain on me on my resources i suppose he is every time he comes back from the front lines theres a scene i spend half the night trying to make him feel better and i end up feeling worse i find myself wishing that he would die out there and then im torn up with guilt for illwishing him oh it was all too tangled amberdrake could help her sort it all outbut if she kept her appointment amberdrake would learn her secrets her stomach hurt her stomach always hurt when she was like this amberdrake knew everything that there was to know about herbal remedies maybe he would have something for her stomach as well as her back and if she just kept the subject on that she could avoid telling him anything important she put the bit of leather aside and got up off her bedroll pushing aside the tent flaps to emerge into the bluegray of twilight time to go there was no place to run from it now and no point in running amberdrake knew the moment that winterhart slipped through the tent door that there was something wrong even if he hadnt been an empath even if he were still an apprentice in the various arts of the kestrachern hed have known it she moved stiffly her muscles taut with tension and the little frownline between her brows was much deeper than usual her eyes looked red and irritated and she held her shoulders as if she expected a blow to come down out of the sky at any moment is conn levas back yet he asked casually assuming that the mage was the reason for her tension but the startled look of surprise as if that was the very last thing she had expected him to say told him that the shot had gone far wide of the mark whatever was troubling her it was not her erstwhile lover no she replied and turned her back to him modest as always to disrobe so that he could work on her back no the foottroops are still out they arent doing well though i suppose you know that maar is pushing them out of the pass again the sixth got hit badly and the fourth and third sent in gryphons with carrynets to evacuate the wounded it was bad on the landing field so id heard skan was out there now as the only gryphon who could keep up with zhaneel urtho had assigned him to fly protective cover on her no standard scouting raids for them they only flew at urthos express orders usually bearing one or more of his magic weapons or protections the black gryphon had already given amberdrake a terse account of the damage before going out on a second sortie after a day like today im not surprised that youre tense and my stomachs in a knot she said wrapping herself in a loose robe before she turned back to face him her expression mingled wry hope with resignation as if she hated to admit that her body had failed her i dont suppose you have anything for that do you assuming you trust my intentions he countered trying to make a joke of it id prescribe an infusion of verograss alemlily root and mallow all of which i do have on hand you arent the only person whos come to me today with your muscles and stomach all in knots her eyes widened a little for all three herbs were very powerful and had a deserved reputation for loosening the tongue and giving it free reinand for loosening inhibitions as well i dont know she replied hesitantly then again between the state of my back and my stomach maybe id better he had made the same concoction often enough for himself that he could nod sympathetically as he went to his chest of herbs he put measured amounts of each into a cup poured in hot water and left the medicine to steep believe me i know how you feel as i said ive had to resort to my own herbs more than once since this war started ive been with urthos forces sincelet me thinkright after the high king collapsed and urtho moreorless took over as leader she accepted the cup of bitter tea carefully made a face as she tasted it and drank it down all at once thats longer than i have she remarked if youve been with urtho that long i suppose you must have seen quite a bit of the court then me hardly he laughed and could have sworn that she relaxed a little no i was just one kestrachern with the kaledain all the clans came as fast as they could when urtho called us in and he didnt sort us out for several months after that he just gave the clan chiefs his orders and let them decide how to carry them out while he tried to organize what was left of the defenses at that point no one knew what ranking i was qualified for kestrachern arent given a rank among the clans the way they are in the outside world my rank and all that came later as things got organized she arranged herself on the massage table facedown the way that the clans stood by him thoughyou must have been disgusted by the way the nobles just panicked and deserted him he paused a bottle of warm oil in his hand at the odd tone in her voice she surely knew that he knew she was no kaledain but there was something about the way she had phrased that last that was sending little halfunderstood signals to him and the direction the conversation had been going in go slowly go carefully with this he thought there is more going on here than there appears to be i think if i am very careful all my questions about her are about to be answered we stood by him because we were protected and never felt the fear he replied pouring a little oil in the palm of his hand and spreading it on her back we have our own mages you know granted we dont go about making much of the fact and they only serve kaledain but between the mages and the shaman maar couldnt touch usand there was no way that he could insinuate agents into our midst to bring us down not the way he did the high king and his court the muscles under his hand jumped what do you mean by that she demanded her voice sharp and anxious he soothed her back with his hands and deliberately injected a soothing tone into his voice well maar has always been a master of opportunity and hes never used a direct attack when an indirect one would work as well treachery betrayal manipulationthose are his favorite weapons that was how he got control in his own land in the first place and that is how he prefers to weaken other lands before he moves in to take them with his troops he may be ruthless and heartless but he never spends more than he has to in order to get what he wants but what does that have to do with us she demanded harshly what does that have to do with the way those cowards simply deserted the high king fled and left the court and their own holdings in complete chaos why everything he told her in mild surprise maar had a dozen agents in the court didnt you know that their job was to spread rumors create dissension make things as difficult as possible for the high king to get anything accomplished i dont know their names but cinnabar does she was instrumental in winkling them out and dealing with them after the king collapsed but the major thing was that once maar believed that his agents had done everything they could to get the court just below the boiling point he sent one of them into the palace with a little present for the king and his supporters his mouth twisted in distaste treachery of the worst sort have you ever heard of something called a dyrstaf no she said blankly skan could tell you more about it he was there at the time in urthos tower and he found out about everything pretty much as it happened for that matter so was lady cinnabar but shes not a mage and skan is he tried to recall everything that cinnabar and skan had told him its a rather nasty little thing its an object usually a rod or a staff of some kind that holds a very insidious version of a fearspell it looks perfectly ordinary until its been triggered and even then it doesnt show to anything but magesight it starts out just creating lowlevel anxiety and works up to a full panic over the course of a day and a night and since it isnt precisely attacking anyone or anything most protective spells wont shield from it and of course since it wasnt active when the agent brought it into the palace no one knew it was there and it didnt trip any of the protections laid around the king a fear spell she asked softly but why didnt the palace shieldsoh never mind it was inside the shields when it started to work so of course the shields wouldnt keep anything out and by the time anyone realized what was going on it was too late to do anything about it amberdrake replied in fact it did most of its worst work after dark at a time when people are most subject to their fears anyway the mages always slept under all kinds of personal shielding so of course they werent affected anyone with healer training would also sleep under shields remember most healers have some degree of empathy and this was an emotion they would also have been protected against it but anyone else she shuddered and what most people did was simply to run away amberdrake sighed by morning the palace was deserted and it wasnt only the nobles who ran no matter what you might have heard to the contrary it was everyone cinnabar said that the only ones left were the mages and healers there wasnt a horse donkey or mule fit to ride left in the stables the servants and the palace guards had deserted their posts and the king was in a virtual state of collapse she and the others called urtho from his tower by the time that urtho found the dyrstaf it was too late the worst damage had been done but they didnt come back no mistake about it winterharts tone was incredibly bitter and full of selfaccusation they could have returned but they didnt they were cowards all of them no he made his voice firm his answer unequivocal no they didnt come back not because they were cowards but because they were hurt the dyrstaf inflicts a wound on the heart and soul as deep as any weapon of steel can inflict on the body an invisible wound of terror that is all the worse because it cant be seen and doesnt bleed they werent cowards they were so badly wounded that most of them had gone beyond thinking of anything but their fear and their shame some of them like the king died of that wound hedied she faltered i didnt know that amberdrake sighed his heart was never that strong and he was an old man being found by urtho hiding in his own wardrobe shamed him past telling it broke his spirit and he simply faded away over the course of the next month since he was childless and everyone else in direct line had fled past recalling urtho thought it better just to let people think hed gone into exile what about cinnabar she demanded sharply why didnt she run doesnt that just prove that everyone who did really is a coward cinnabar was already a trained healer dearheart he said not like you little one you might have had the gift but your family didnt indulge you enough to let you get it trained youve worked with her you know how powerful she is and her empathy is only a little weaker than her healing powers she was shielded against outside emotions and didnt even know what was going on then in the morning she was able to tell that the fear was coming from outside and she was one of the ones who got urtho and helped him in a search for the dyrstaf they all came in by way of urthos private gate into the throne roomall but skan he was too big to fit unfortunately by the time urtho and the mages found it it was too late to do any good they always said her family was eccentric winterhart said as if to herself letting the children get training as if they were ever going to have to actually be healers and mages and all i envied her a gasp told him she had realized too late that she had let that clue to her past slip if your parents had allowed you to have healer training instead of forcing you to learn what you could on your own you probably wouldnt be here right now he told her quietly dont you realize that if youd been properly trained youd have been standing beside cinnabar helping her on that day there is nothing more vulnerable than an untrained empath you were perhaps the single most vulnerable person in the entire palace when the dyrstaf started working didnt you ever realize that if maars spell of fear wounded others i am truly surprised that it didnt strike you dead her shoulders shook with sobs i wish it had she wept into the pillow oh gods i wish it had carefully very carefully he sat down on the edge of the massage table and took her shoulders in his strong hands helping her to sit up and turn so that she was weeping into his shoulder instead of into a comfortless pillow for some time he simply held her letting her longpent grief wear itself out rocking her a little and stroking her hair and the back of her neck she shivered and her skin chilled gesten slipped in silent as a shadow and laid a thick warmed robe beside him he thanked the hertasi with his eyes and picked it up wrapping it around her shoulders she relaxed as the heat seeped into her and gradually her sobs lost their strength so that was why you chose the name winterhart he said into the silence id wondered it wasnt because it was kaledain at allit was because a hart is a hunted creature and because you hoped that the cold of winter would close around you and keep you from ever feeling anything again i never even saw a kaledain until i came here came the whisper from his shoulder ah he massaged the back of her neck with one hand while the other remained holding her to his chest so you know you dont have to answer me but who are you if you have any relatives still alive they would probably like to know that you are living too how would you know the reply sounded harsh but he did not react to it he simply answered it i knowpartly because one of my tasks as a kestrachera is to pass that information on to urtho in case any of your relations have been looking for others of their blood and i know because i lost my family when they fled without me and i have never found them again and there is a void there an emptiness and a pain that comes with not knowing not being able to at least write finished to the question oh imsorry she said awkwardly thank you he replied accepting the spirit of the apology he sensed that she was not finished and waited finally she spoke again once my name was lady reanna laury winterhart spoke and amberdrake listened long into the night she was his last client he had instinctively scheduled her as the last client of any night she had an appointment knowing that if her barriers ever broke he would need many candlemarks to deal with the consequences so she had all the time she needed he talked to her soothed herand did not lay a finger on her that was not strictly platonic he knew that she half expected him to seduce her he also knew that given any encouragement whatsoever she would seduce him but the situation was too complicated to allow for one more complication and he would have been not only unprofessional but less than a friend if he permitted that complication to take place much as he wanted to she was very sweet very pliant in his arms he sensed a passionate nature in her that he doubted conn levas even guessed at she was quite ready to show that nature to him but the essence of a kestracherns talent was a finelyhoned sense of timing and he knew that this was not the time so he sent her back to her tent exhausted but only emotionally and mentallycomforted but not physically and he flung himself into his bed in a fever to stare at the tent roof and fantasize all the things that he wished he had done he had never really expected that he would find anyone he wanted to share his life with he had always thought that he would be lucky to find a casual lover or two outside of his profession he had certainly never expected to find anyone so well suited to himlittle though she knew the extent of it right now she only knew that he could comfort her that he had answers for the things that had eaten away at her heart until it bled he did not want her until she had recovered from all thisuntil she knew what and who she was and wanted him as an equal and not as a comforter and protector she got enough of that with conn for winterhart whatever she had been was now a strong vital and competent woman she had a deep capacity for compassion that she had been denying fearing to be hurt if she gave way to it she had overcome her fears to find some kind of training that would make her useful to urthos forces and then had returned to take her place there when hundreds of others who had not been affected as profoundly as she had remained deserters granted she had not come back as herself but at this point any attempt to reveal her name and nature would only disrupt some of what urtho had accomplished the house and forces of laury answered now to urtho and not to those who had once commanded them and their loyalty by right of birth why disturb an established arrangement he thought he had persuaded her of thatand what was more he thought she had figured that out for herself but had been afraid that saying anything of the sort would only be taken for further cowardice it wasnt of course it was only good sense which in itself was in alltooshort supply it would be different hed told her if we had a situation like lord corys he was back on his estate in retirement and was left the only member of his line to command his levy so he did even though he is far too old for the task hes a fine commander though so urtho isnt going to ask him to step downbut if one of his sons or daughters ever showed up willing to take the old mans orders thered be a new field commander before you could blink but the laury people are commanded by general micherone winterhart had observed and sighed bet micherone is a better commander than i could ever be and urtho has the utmost confidence in her i dont see any reason to come back to life nor do i amberdrake had told her you might ask lady cinnabar since she knows the political situation better than i but if she says not to bother then there is no reason why you cant remain winterhart for the rest of your life he chuckled a little then and added and if anyone asks why you have a kaledain name tell them its because you have been adopted into my sept and clan ill even arrange it if you like shed looked up at him thoughtfully i would like that please she had replied very much he wondered if she knew or guessed the significance of that kaledain did not take in those from outside the clans lightly or oftenand it was usually someone who was about to marry into the clans someone who had sworn bloodbrotherhood with a kaledain or someone who had done the clan a great service still he did not regret making the offer and he would gladly see that the matter was taken care of because if things fell out the way he hoped not now he told himself take one day at a time first she will have to deal with conn levas only then should you make overtures otherwise she will be certain that she betrayed him somehow and she has had more than enough of thinking she was a traitor all it would take was patience every kaledain was familiar with patience it took patience to train a hawk or a horsepatience to perform the delicate manipulations that would bring the lines of bondbirds and warsteeds to their fulfillment it took patience to learn everything needed to become a shaman or a healer or a kestrachern but oh i have had enough of patience to last me the rest of my life i should like some immediate return for my efforts for a change he would like it but he knew better than to expect or even hope for it it was enough that in the midst of all this pain and death there was a little life and warmth and that he was sharing in it and it was with that thought uppermost in his mind that he finally fell asleep fourteen a birdscream woke amberdrake out of a sound and dreamless sleep he knew those screams highpitched and sounding exactly as if a child were shrieking he sat straight up in bed blinking fog out of his eyes whata messenger at this hour it was morning what could but if someone had sent a messengerbird to screech at the entrance to his tent there was grave trouble anything less and there would have been time to send a hertasi rather than a bird before gesten could get to the door flap he had rolled out of bed and flung open the flap to let the bird in it whirred up from the ground and hit his shoulder muttered in agitation for a moment then spoke in tamsins voice drake we need you on the hillnow that was all there was to the message and normally the last person that tamsin would ask for help on the hill was amberdrake despite his early training amberdrake knew that tamsin was only too well aware of his limitationshow his empathic gift tended to get right out of control even now he was much better suited to the profession he had chosen and they both knew it but if tamsin had sent a bird for him then the situation up on the hill was out of hand and the healers were dragging in every horse doctor and herb collector within running distanceand every other kestrachern who knew anything of healing or could hold a wound for stitching or soothe pain he flung on some clothing and headed for the healers tents at a dead run there were plenty of other people boiling out of their tents wearing hastilydonned clothing as he had surmised he was not the only kestrachern on the way up there whatever had happened it was bad as bad as could possibly be he found out just how bad it was when he arrived at the healers tents and stopped dead in his tracks panting with effort struck dumb by the sheer numbers of neardead the victims overflowed the tents and had been laid out in rows wherever there was space there was blood everywhere soaking into the ground making spreading scarlet stains on clothing and hastilywrapped bandages the pain hammered at him making him reel back for a moment with the force of it pounding against his disciplined shields amberdrake he turned at the sound of his name vikteren grabbed his arm and steered him into a tent tarnsin said to watch for you they need you here with the nonhumans he said speaking so quickly that he ran everything together i know some farrierwork im supposed to assist you if you want me yes i want you amberdrake answered quickly squinting into the semidarkness of the tent after the bright sunlight outside it took a moment for his eyes to adjust when they did he could have wished they hadnt there were half a dozen kyree lying nearest the entrance and they seemed to be the worst off next to them lying on pallets were some tervardi and hertasihe couldnt tell how manyand at the back of the tent three dyheli there was only one division of the forces that had that many nonhumans in combat positions and his heart sank oh godsthe second all but gone vikteren confirmed maar came in behind them and no one knows how but there was no time for discussion he and his selfappointed assistant took over their first patient a kyree that had been slashed from throat to tail and then there was no time for anything but the work at hand amberdrake worked with hands and gift stitching wounds and healing them blocking pain setting bones knitting up flesh he worked until the world narrowed to his hands and the flesh beneath them he worked until he lost all track of time or even who he was working on trusting to training and instinct to see him through and at last he worked until he couldnt even see his hands until he was so exhausted and battered by the pain and fear of others that the world went gray and then black then went away altogether and he found himself being supported by vikteren his head under the spout of a pump the young mage frantically pumping water over him he spluttered and waved at vikteren to stop pushed himself up to a kneeling position and shook the cold water out of his eyes he was barely able to do that he had never in all of his life felt so weak you passed out the mage said simply i figured that what worked for drunks would probably work for you probably the best thing you could have done amberdrake admitted and coughed how many more wounded were there his job wasnt done yet id better get back he started to get up but vikteren restrained him with a hand on his shoulder he didnt do much but let it rest there yet that was enough to keep amberdrake from moving theres nothing left to go back to you didnt pass out till you got the last tervardi and a couple of the humans that the others hadnt gotten to yet the rest no one could have helped vikteren told him amberdrake blinked at that and then blinked again the mage was a messhis clothing stiff with blood his hands bloodstained he had blood in his hair his eyes were reddened and swollen and his skin was pale were done he asked trying not to sound too hopeful vikteren nodded near as i can tell they brought the last of the wounded in through the jerlag gate evacuated the rearguard and shut it down about a candlemark ago evacuated shut the gate down amberdrake blinked and realized then that the light shining down on both of them was entirely artificial one of the very brilliant magelights used by the healers beyond the light the sky was completely black with a sprinkling of stars weve been working all day sunset was about the same time they shut the gate down vikteren told him answering his unspoken question urthos up at the terminus now and a ripple in the mageenergies and an unsettled and unsettling sensation as if the world had just dropped suddenly out from underneath them made them both look instinctively to the north the jerlag gate was in the north beyond those mountains in the far distance far far off on the horizon behind the mountains there was a brilliant flash of light it covered the entire northern horizon so bright that vikteren cursed and amberdrake blinked away tears of pain and had falselights dancing before his eyes for several moments it took much longer than that before either of them could speak vikteren said carefully so much for the jerlag gate did he amberdrake could hardly believe it but vikteren was a mage and he would recognize what urtho had done better than any kestrachern vikteren nodded fed it back on itself maar may have taken jerlag but its cost him a hell of a lot more than he thought it would thats the first time urthos ever imploded one of his permanent gates the thought hung between them ominous and unspoken and it probably wont be the last amberdrake swallowed he could not begin to imagine the forces let loose in the implosion of a fixed gate vikteren could though and the young mage squinted off at the horizon probably a hole about as big as this camp and as deep as the tower there now he said absently and then it was amberdrakes turn to grab for his arm and steady him as he trembled lost his balance and started to fall he was heavier than amberdrake could support in his own weakened condition he lowered the mage down to the muddy ground in a kind of controlled fall and leaned against him vikteren blinked at him with glazed eyes you collapsed amberdrake told him gently you arent in much better shape than i am you can say that again drake gesten padded up into the circle of light cast by the magelight overhead with aubri and two of lady cinnabars hertasi with him the lady told me where you were she and tamsin and skan are worried sick im supposed to have dierne and lysle help vikteren back to his tent and get some food in him while aubri helps me get you back to yours the hertasi patted the young mage on the shoulder good work boy tamsin says you two basically took care of every badly injured nonhuman that came in real good work if i had a steak id cook it up for you myself right now a couple of boiled eggs and some cheese sounds fine vikteren croaked his face gone ashen id rather not look at meat just nowcould look like someone i knew gesten gestured to the other two hertasi who levered vikteren back up to a standing position and supported him on his feet get some food get some rest and drink what these two give you itll keep you from having dreams nightmares you mean amberdrake murmured as the hertasi helped the mage down the hill step by wavering step i remember my first warwounded as do we all aubri rumbled gesten if you can get him standingamberdrake you lean on my back as he got to his feet he began to black out again and gesten tsked at him as he sat abruptly back down i thought as much the hertasi said youve drained yourself youre going to be a right mess in the morning im a right mess now amberdrake put his head down between his knees until the world stopped spinning around him i hope you have a solution for this id hate to spend the rest of the night sleeping in the mud thats why i brought aubri just give us a moment the hertasi hustled into one of the supply tents and came back out again with a number of restraining straps and a twoman litter while aubri muttered instructions gesten rigged a harness over aubris hindquarters and stuck one set of the litter handles through loops in the harness get yourself on that drake the hertasi ordered ive got this inclined so aubri takes most of your weight amberdrake did manage to crawl onto the litter but he was so dizzy that it took much longer than he thought it would and his head pounded in time with his pulse until he wanted nothing more than to have someone knock him out he knew what it was hed overextended himself drained himself down to nothing he was paying the price of overextending and he wouldnt be the only healer whod done that today he closed his eyes for the journey back to his tent when he opened his eyes again he was being lifted into his bed but the moment he tried to move his head exploded with pain so he closed his eyes again and passively let them do whatever gesten told them to he wound up in a halfsitting position propped in place by pillows when he opened his eyes again the tent was silent lit only by a single heavilyshaded lantern and gesten was still there although aubri and the rest of the hertasis recruits were long gone gesten turned with a cup in his foreclaw and pushed it at him here he said brusquely drink this you know what it is indeed he did a compound of herbs for his head and to make him sleep so thick with honey he was surprised the spoon didnt stand in it at this point he was too spent to protest and too dizzy to care obediently he let the toosweet sticky liquid ooze down his throat then he closed his eyes waiting for the moment when the herbs would take effect and when they did he slid into the dark waters of sleep without a single ripplefor a while winterhart had never wanted quite so much to crawl away into a hole and sleep for a hundred years instead she dragged herself back to her tent and collapsed on her bedroll she curled into a fetal position and waited for her muscles to stop twitching with fatigue too tired even to undress urtho was losing that was the general consensus the only question was if their side would continue to lose ground or if urtho would come up with something that would hold maar off for a little longer were being eroded by bits and pieces instead of being overrun the way i thought wed go even that stark certainty failed to bring her a shiver of fear she was just too tired it wasnt just tending her own charges now it was being called up the hill at a moments notice whenever too many wounded came in and it wasnt just herit was everyone anyone who even knew how to wrap a bandage shed seen amberdrake working so long and so hard today that hed become a casualty himself and he wasnt the only one either the rest of the kestrachern worked just as hard and even the perchi came in to mix herbal potions and change bandages for now all the little feuds and personality conflicts were set aside unfortunately shaiknam and garber have their commands again although general shaiknam no longer had nonhumans or mages under his command he was still managing to account for far too many casualties when he succeeded he did so in grand style but it was always at a high cost in terms of fighters i wish that urtho would just put him in charge of siege engines and catapults they dont die well she no longer had to parrot garbers stupid orders or try to make excuses for him and the sixth was holding its own at the moment perhaps they would continue to hold and maar would give up for a while let things stand at stalemate and give them all time to breathe footsteps outside the tent warned her in time to roll over to face the back of the tent and feign sleep it was conn of course and wanting the usual she could not imagine where he got any energy to spare when everyone else was exhausted he shoved the tent flap open roughly and stood beside her bedroll waiting for her to wake up except that she wasnt going to wake up im tired of you conn im tired of your socalled temperament im tired of acting like your mother as well as your lover im very tired of being your lover you have no couth and no consideration it occurred to her then that he had so little consideration for her that he might well try to shake her awake then she would have no choice but to give up the ruse but im damned if ill perform for you conn youll get me the way i feeltoo tired to move a muscle with nothing left over for anything or anyone not even myself he stood there a moment longer and experimentally prodded her with his toe once or twice very romantic conn but she had seen people fallen so deeply asleep that nothing short of an earthquake would wake them she knew how to simulate the same thing she remained absolutely limp neither resisting the push from his toe nor reacting to it finally he muttered something uncomplimentary and left the tent she stayed in the same position in a kind of wary stupor there was no telling how conn would react to having his wishes flaunted he might just linger outside the tent waiting to see if she moved or even came out he might even come back with a bucket of cold water no he wont do that he wouldnt want to use the bedroll if it had been soaked but he might find some other way of waking her up and return with it its a good thing he wont be able to find a messengerbird now that its past sunset hed probably bring one back here and have it shriek in my ear the little beggars love dramatics he wouldnt have any trouble getting one to cooperate but nothing happened and when her arm fell asleep she finally turned over keeping her eyes cracked to mere slits there was a light right outside her tent and if there had been anyone lurking out there hed have shown up as a silhouette against the canvas there wasnt a sign of conn and as her arm came back to life and she sat up swearing softly he didnt come bursting into the tent she sighed and massaged her left hand with her right cursing as it tingled and burned her eyes felt dry and gritty as if shed been caught in a sandstorm she left off massaging her hand and rubbed them it didnt stop the itching but at least they didnt feel quite so dry anymore this end of camp was silentfrighteningly silent anyone not on duty was sleeping wasting not a single moment in any other pursuits as she listened she heard the deliberate pacing of a sentry up and down the rows of tents and the rustle of flags in the breeze the creaking of guy ropes and the flapping of loose canvas and something muttered just overhead she peered up where the tent supports met in a cross there was a tiny creature up there perched on the poles she got to her feet somehow and reached up to it without thinking only as her hand touched it and she felt feathers did it occur to her that it could have been anythinga rat a bat some nasty little mageaccident but it wasnt it was only a messengerbird she slipped her fingers under its breastfeathers as it woke and muttered sleepily and it transferred its hold on the pole to a perch on her hand she brought it down carefully while they were very tame they were also known to nip when they were startled she scratched it with one finger around its neckruff while it slowly woke grumbled to itself and then finally pulled away and fluffed itself up it tilted its head and looked up at her obligingly she got into the light from outside so that it could see her face and identify her it snapped its beak meditatively once or twice then roused all its feathers again and spoke canceling your appointment tonight it said in amberdrakes voice and it was uncanny the way the tiny bird was able to imitate sheer exhaustion overlaying the words and making him slur his sentences too tired tomorrow if we can im sorry she sat back down again obscurely disappointed not that she was up to so much as a walk to the mess tent much less halfway across camp and he certainly wasnt up to giving her any kind of a massage not after the way shed seen him slaving today but we could have talked she thought wistfully we could have cried on each others shoulders comforted each other suddenly she realized that she no longer thought of him as the kestrachern amberdrakenot even as her healer she wanted to tell him every grisly detailthe men that had died under her hands the fighters who were never going to see or walk or use a weapon again she wanted to weep on his shoulder and then offer him that same comfort back again she needed it and she guessed that he did too his friends were as mindsick and exhausted as he was and would be in no position to console him or else they have others they would rather turn to if only he hadnt canceled the appointment if only she could go to him well why not came the unbidden thought friends dont need appointments to see each other that was true enough but dear gods it was a long walk she held the little bird in her cupped hand petting its back and head absently as it chuckled in content just the bare thought of that walk was enough to make her weep he might have exhausted his healing powers but she had been lifting and reaching pulling and hauling all day small wonder her muscles burned with fatigue and felt about as strong as a glass of water footsteps crunched on the gravel of the path between the rows of tents drawing nearer but they were too light to be conns so she dismissed them as she tried to muster the strength just to stand iii can get to my feet maybe i can get as far as the mess tent if i can get as far as the mess tent maybe i can get to the bath house if i can get that far the footsteps paused just outside her door flap and the silhouette against the canvas was not at all familiar until the man turned sideways as if to go back the way he came amberdrake she said aloud incredulously the man outside paused in midstep and turned back to the doorflap winterhart amberdrake said cautiously i thought you were probably asleep iim too tired to sleep if that makes any sense she replied so grateful that he was here that she couldnt think of anything else oh please come in i was just trying to get up the energy to come visit you he pushed open the tent flap and looked down at her sitting on her bedroll little messengerbird in her hands you got my message he said hesitantly since when do friends need an appointment to talk she retorted and was rewarded with his slow grateful smile i had the feeling we both needed someone to talk to tonight youll never know how much he sighed collapsing on the bedroll beside her as she looked at him sitting there in the shadows of the tent and wanting nothing more than to talk a warmth started somewhere inside her and began to spread as if a cold place within had thawed at long last and the warmth was reaching every part of her would you like to start first or may i he asked courteous as always he needed her he needed her and not the other way around she sensed the pain inside him an ache that was so seldom eased that he no longer expected to find relief for it how long had he been carrying this burden of grief certainly longer than just today you first she said acting on generous impulse i think you must need to talk more than i do after all you were the one who made the long walk here it was too dark to see his face but she sensed that he was startled perhaps i do he said slowly she put the bird on the dressing stand and reached out and took one of his hands it was cold she cupped it in both of hers to warm it sharing the warmth sometimes thats all thats needed i think skan wheeled sideways and left an opening for zhaneel to stoop on the pursuing makaar the one behind him intent upon making the black gryphon into shredded flesh was a nasty mottled deep blue with freshlybroken horns still bleeding from colliding with another of his misshapen brethren skandranon acted as the lure for zhaneels stoops flying against the thin clouds to show up better from the ground the gryfalcon high above saw through the wispy clouds easily and it was simplicity to time when she would fall upon the pursuing makaar on time a cracking sound followed by a descending scream marked zhaneels arrival behind him and she shot past and under him at well over three times his speed skandranons eyes blazed with approval as they did every time zhaneel fought beside him he went into his followup while she arced upward to retake her position of superior altitude higher than any makaar could fly beautiful and its working shes unstoppable when she is in her element and the new makaar are more fragile than the last breed two breeds since kili wonder if hes still alive tchah next group while the battle raged behind and below them they managed to keep most of the makaar occupied so they wouldnt harry the retreat retreat another one and i warned urtho to fortify and trap the valley to at least slow maars advance but we ran too thin on time and resources now our troops are beating their way back from the latest rout and the best the gryphons can do is keep the makaar busy dying granted its fun but all in all id rather be fat and happy in a warm tent feeding zhaneel tidbits of rabbit in broad daylight the black gryphon wasnt the most effective at stealthiness so he and zhaneel had worked out this particular style of combat on the way it had turned into a predictable pattern by now and the new makaar had apparently figured out that it took zhaneel a certain amount of time to regain her aerial advantage it was no longer quite so easy to kill makaar but at least the makaar at this battle were down to manageable numbers there couldnt be more than thirty another flight of makaarfour this time in a heightstaggered diamondclosed on skandranon sooner than the previous flights had they were going to clash with him behind zhaneels upward flight path too soon for her to strike at them but too close for skan to make an effective stoop of his own the resultthey could chase skan and exhaust him at their leisure unless he slowed and fell to strike at them either result reduces my chances of survival significantly and i am not interested in that at all isnt there something better you could be doing stupid gryphon maybe eating or dancing dancing ah now that is something the makaar wouldnt expect theyre counting on me speeding past them or slowingbut if i pull up and stop that might just break up their formation makaar without a formation are also known as scattered bodies this may be fun again after all so that hertasi backspinpointe that poidon had shown him before the harvest festival could finally come to some use if his back could stand up to the deceleration amberdrakes healing coupled with tamsin and cinnabars periodic care should have his tendons and muscles in good enough shape to handle it since he was a broadwing cupping enough air to stop should not be a problem but the speed was going to be a critical factor zhaneel was about to clear the cloud layer on her upswing but couldnt know what was going on behind her shed be expecting skandranon to be in the next quarterspan and he wouldnt be there on time shed stay on station until she located him if he slowed his flight too much right now the makaar could guess his intention and swarm him and even if youll talk yourself out of doing anything at all while those four uglies are debating what sauce to put on your bones honestly gryphon you should know better urthos given you more than wings you know you have a brain to think with that brains learned spells you silly side of beef and the makaar wont be expecting that makaar only act on what they expect remember theyre expecting you to be dead dead dead not the proud father of little gryphlets basic dazzling should do the job but that took a moment of time and reposerepose who told you that it takes a moment of concentration nothing more you worrying lump you cant do it while youre flying but you can do it while youre falling falling should be in your immediate future if you can do the backspinpointe you only need one calm moment the makaar gained and shrieked at him skan recognized kili in the lead and that immediate future became now skandranon pointed his beak toward the clouds and arched his body backward the air rushing against his throat was nearly enough to stop the blood flow to his head despite the cushioning effects of his feathers slowly and deliberately in what seemed like years of constant effort he changed the angle of attack of his broad wings until he kited upward his forward speed was decreasing rapidly and in this deadly game speed and endurance were all that kept a flier alive to the makaar it must have appeared at first that he was surrendering the old maxim of trading speed for altitude held true as long as skandranon kept his wings at a good angle of attack he would be higher but eventually hed come to a stall and stop completely then as his old enemy kili surely knew he would fall and four makaar were sure to slice him open as he hurtled toward the unforgiving ground zhaneel if this doesnt work dont tell anyone i did something this stupid please the makaar screamed their glee as he slowed in midair his arms and wings spread kili started to shriek a victory cry he straightened his body in midair with one leg pulled close the other at pointe the black gryphon hung at the apogee of his climb for a moment a calm moment just one calm moment zhaneel pumped her wings furiously still game for the hunt but growing physically weary the air was thin above the filmy layer of clouds that she and the black gryphon were using for cover and her lungs had trouble supplying her body for long up here her claws hurt from hammering makaar too but she was making a difference fighting beside the black gryphon was everything she had dreamed it could be and more they worked so well together it seemed like nothing could go wrongbut she knew better than to believe such things maar and his commanders were cunning and each strike the gryphon pair made could be their last that made the elation at every success all the sweeter theyd been devastating on the makaar so far today but the knowledge that it was to cover a withdrawal weighed on her mind it was one thing to be greeted as heroes for making a glorious advance it was quite another to dodge the enemy as you ran for home things looked bad enough already by the time the army came boiling out of maars groundgate rank after rank of identically uniformed humans with pole arms and bows urthos mage apparently hadnt arrived in time to stop maars mage from opening the gate so the two gryphons took it upon themselves to disable maars man skandranon was unable to hit him until after the majority of maars ground troops had come through and then the makaar had clouded like gnats that had resulted in one of zhaneels proudest moments the mighty black gryphon had gotten his foot caught in the camouflage net the mage had been hiding behind he was tangled and could not free himself anchored to the ground by the body of the mage which was also trapped in the downed net and the mages men were advancing on skandranon from the escarpment below zhaneel streaked in and cut the net away with her shears then pushed the broken body of the mage net and all down the rocky slope to slow down the troops while skan beat his way skyward just the kind of rescue shed dreamed of and now her beloved black gryphon was down below the clouds waiting for her to strike again at the makaar that would inevitably be pursuing him she lined up on where he should be readied for her stoop and peered through the thin cloudsand skandranon wasnt there her voice caught and she felt her throat going tight this high up her instinct to keen could strangle her she realized with growing horror the air was thinner she couldnt let herself keenbut where was he she couldnt help but cry out in worry but sure enough there was no broadwinged black shape moving relentlessly under the haze of cloud that she could see he should be right therel thats where his momentum would have him and he wasnt therel she folded her wings and looped in a frantic search for him and then there was a flash of light below her her eyes darted to the location of the dazzling burst and at the center of a diamond of four stunned makaar was a falling black mass skandranon zhaneel fell upon the helpless makaar as unstoppable as lightning no damned makaar were going to harm her beloved skandranon opened his eyes to find a planet spiraling closer and closer to him at high speed given the other things he could have been seeing at the momenthis internal organs dotting the sky for instance or makaar claws in his faceseeing that he was only falling was quite a welcome sight there were no makaar below him or to the sides so he followed another bit of personal philosophynever look behind you there may be an arrow gainingand forced himself to stay stonestill so that gravity could work its magic on him another few seconds and he should be moving quickly enough that his wings would do him some good then he would see what shape the makaar behind him were in and hed try to find zhaneel somewhere she must be on station by now and looking for him and he wouldnt be where he was supposed to be youve lasted this long sky dancer but will you survive what shell do to you after the worry youll cause her before he could formulate a rebuttal to his own question the air around him shook from a massive displacementand a makaar wing entered his vision only a handsbreadth from his face kilis wing skan desperately twisted sideways to bring his claws to bear on the enemy that was only a heartbeat away from disemboweling him he lashed out with both foreclaws to latch onto the wing intent upon taking the monster down with him and found zhaneel screaming past him in triumph her shears clutched tightly in her hands she was followed a second later by a mist of dark cold blood another wing and the dying body of the nowwingless makaar flight leader zhaneel arced back up to come beside skandranon and laugh along with him as he dropped the lifeless makaar wing and resumed controlled flight oh gods above i am in love the other three makaar still bedazzled by skandranons spell scattered and took their remaining brethren along with them no more makaar harried the retreat and maars troops had already halted to assess their own losses safe again and there she was flying beside him every bit as confident and beautiful as skandranons wildest dreams yes zhaneel i am definitely in love you are worth living for no matter what comes you are worth anything fifteen peace at last amberdrake dropped the tent flap behind his last client for the evening he turned with a whisper of silk to look back into the brightlylit public chamber and sighed with relief gesten raised his blunt snout from the towel chest where he had been working and looked straight at him and then away as if the hertasi were going to say something then thought better of it not a comment or a complaint or he wouldnt have hesitated so it must be a request spit it out gesten amberdrake said patiently you want something whatever it is youve more than earned it a dozen times over what is it im tired and id like to quit early and get some sleep gesten admitted but i dont want to leave you with all this mess to take care of alone if youre tired too i thought you felt pretty good until i heard you sigh just now amberdrake shook his head and pulled his hair back behind his neck that sigh was because it is damned nice to be doing the job im trained for and not playing secondrate healer he told the hertasi it was a sigh of contentment amberdrake turned aside and went over to the portable folding table beside the couch a table that currently held a selection of lotions and unguents scented and not he picked up the first a halfempty bottle of camillotion and put them in their proper order he made very sure that the lid of each was properly tightened down before he put it away right now there was no way of telling when hed ever find replacements and each drop was too precious to waste in evaporation or spillage cosmetics and lotions no longer appeared on the list of any herbalists priorities he knew how to make his own of course but when would he ever have the time or the materials of course he might not ever need to find replacements maar might very well make the question of where or how he would find them moot at any point better not to think of that better just to enjoy the respite and try not to think of how brief it might be no gesten im not tired oddly enough i think that exhausting myself on a regular basis up on the hill only made me learn how to make better use of my resources he continued either that or im fitter now than i was before its just such a pleasure to get back to being nothing more than a simple kestrachern a pregnant silence alerted him and he turned to see that gesten was grinning a toothy hertasi grin he made a face and you can wipe that smug smile off your snout my little friend no puns and no clever sallies just go get some rest i had to clean up after myself long before you came along and i think i can remember how if anything gestens smile widened a bit more but there was no doubt that the hertasi was as tired as he claimed probably more so the past few days had not been easy ones for him either if anything he had gotten less rest than amberdrake his scales had dulled and he carried his tail as if the weight of it was a burden to him that didnt stop him from exercising his tongue however he bowed spreading his foreclaws wide yes o greatest of the kestrachern o master of massage o summit of the sensuous o acme of the erogenous o prelate of thatll do amberdrake interrupted one of these days gesten youre going to get me annoyed and when that happens the moon will turn purple and therell be fish flying and birds under the sea gesten jeered you almost never get angry drake not even with people who deserve it demonsblood the last time i saw you get angry was with that uppity healer the one that came all the way down from the hill to tell you off and then you cooled off by the time you got back to the tent you ought to get angry a lot more often youre too polite youve got too much control for your own good dams break you know but amberdrake shook his head and continued to put the jars and bottles back into their special places each one in order the sendelwood lined case had cushioned slots for each so that no matter how roughly the case was handled the contents would never break or spill and after all the times of trouble in the recent past doing a simple task was relaxing so was simply talking to his dear hertasi rather than trading snap opinions of how to deflect this emergency or that crisis its not that im polite its that i know too much about human natureand i know how it can be twisted and deformed until people turn into monsters that makes it difficult to stay angry with anyone for very long since i generally know what their feelings and motivations are now that ive talked with urtho about our enemy i even know why maar is the way he is i can manage to stay angry with maar i just wish that knowing the reasons for his behavior would make some difference in stopping him but you never stay angry with anyone else gesten argued and people think youre weak because of that they think that they can walk all over you and they think that because you dont fight back you must really think that they are in the right he had to raise a surprised eyebrow at that do they really he replied interesting well gesten thats all to the good dont you think if they believe that im a weakling theyll underestimate me if they think im harboring some kind of secret guilt or shame theyll believe that im handicapped in dealing with them ill be able to defeat their purposes or get around them with a minimum of effort and theyll have spent their strategytime gloating that theyve already won gesten snorted scornfully maybe you think sobut what about all the folk like that damned healer the ones who look down their noses at you think theyre bettern you and say rotten things behind your back howre you going to stop a whispering campaign against you howre you going to deal with people who slander you amberdrake shrugged ill do what i always do find out who they are and what theyre saying once i know who the dagger is likely to come from i have options i can duck i can find something to use as a shield or i can tell the right people to deal with my detractors from a position of authority without my getting personally involved gesten growled and it was clear that he was annoyed at amberdrakes calm reasoning mostly you duck and they go on thinking youre weak worse they figure youve just proved that theyre right because you wont come after them he thought about that carefully for a moment then lifted the nowfilled chest and returned it to its proper place against the tent wall thats true he said at last but as long as what they say and do does me no real harm why should i care as long as i know who they are so that i can guard against real harm in the future theres no point in dealing with them on any level and it makes them happy gestens mouth dropped open and his eyes widened i dont believe i just heard that he said aghast that poison they spreadits like stinky sticky mud it sticks to everything it touches and makes it filthy contaminates everyone who hears it worse it makes other people want to spread the same poison why would you want to make them happy amberdrake turned back to his little friend and sat with a sad smile on his face because they are bitter unhappy people and very little else makes them happy they say what they do out of envy for any number of reasons it may be because i lead a more luxurious life than they or at least they believe i do it may be because there are many people who do call me friend and those are all folk of great personal worth a few of them are people that occupy high position and deservedly so perhaps it is because they cannot do what i can and for some reason this galls them but they have so little else that gives them pleasure i see no reason to deprive them of the few drops of enjoyment they can extract from heaping scorn and derision on me gesten shook his head drake youre crazy but i already knew that im getting some sleep this is all too much for me good night good night gesten amberdrake said softly rising again and beginning to pick up scattered pieces of clothing iwonder if i should have told him the whole truth he thought as he stacked pillows neatly in the corner maybe he was right maybe i should get angry but i dont have the energy to waste on anger anymore there are more important things to use that energy for than to squander it on petty fools if there hadnt been a war would he still feel the same way no way of knowing maybe he thought for a moment about the enemies he had among urthos ranksmost of them on the hill healers who felt that he was debasing their noble calling some few among the officers people he had refused to serve for any amount of money the motives of the latter were easy to guess those that amberdrake sent away were not likely to advertise the fact but the rejection infuriated them for most of them it was one of the few times anyone had ever dared to tell them no but the motives of the healers were nearly as transparent the fact that he used much the same training and identical gifts to bring something as trivial as mere pleasure to others sent them into a rage the fact that he was well paid for doing so made them even angrier he could see their point they had spent many years honing their craft and they felt that it should never be used for trivial purposes but how was giving pleasure trivial why must everything in life be deadly and deathly serious yes they were in the middle of a war camp but he had discovered this gave most folk an even greater need for a moment of pleasure a moment of forgetfulness look at skan even in the midst of war and death he found reasons for laughter and love maybe that was why those enemies often included the black gryphon on the list of those to be scorned oh these are people who would never coat a bitter pill for fear that the patient would not know that it was good for him never mind that honeycoating something makes it easierand more likelyto be swallowed and if this had been a time of peace they would probably be agitating at urthos gates to have amberdrake thrown out of the city without a rag to his name and they would be angry and unhappy because if this were a time of peaceiwould be a very rich kestrachern that is not boasting i do not think and in that time of peace urtho would listen to their poison and nod and send for amberdrake and amberdrake would come and the two would have a pleasant meal and all would remain precisely as it had been beforeexcept that amberdrake would then know exactly who was saying what which is exactly what happens now except that its tamsin and skan gesten and cinnabar who tell me these things rather than urtho we kestrachern are officially serving even as they and it is obvious that we have a place here as far as urtho is concerned besides if they tried to rid the camp of us and of the perchi there would be a riot among the line fighters but would he hate his enemies if he had the time and the energy to do so idont think so he decided but i would be very hurt by what they said i am now though i try not to dwell on it i may not hate people but i do hate the things that they do whispering campaigns hiding behind anonymitythose i hate as gesten said they are poison a poison that works by touch it makes everyone it touches sick and it takes effort and energy to become well again for all of his brave words to gesten he felt that way now hurt and unhappy and it took effort to shrug off the feelings he immersed himself in the simpler tasks of his work things he had not done since gesten had come to serve him to help push the hurt into the background putting towels away draining and emptying the steamcabinet rearranging the furniture these things all became a meditative exercise expending the energy of anger and hurt into something useful as he brought order into his tent he could bring order into his mind although skan claims that a neat and orderly living space is the sign of a dangerously sick mind he thought with amusement as he folded coverings and stacked them on one end of the couch its a good thing that gryphons dont have much in the way of personal possessions because ive seen his lair amberdrake it was a thin whisper behind him female and it was followed by what sounded like a strangled sob he dropped the last blanket and turned quickly wondering if his mind was playing tricks on him butno he had not imagined it winterhart stood in the doorway tent flap drawn aside in one hand clearly in tears he quickly reached out grasped her hand in both of his and drew her inside the tent flap fell from her nerveless fingers and he took a moment to tie it shut ensuring their privacy what happened he asked as she took a few stumbling steps then crumpled onto the couch clutching a pillow to her chest with fresh tears pouring down her face whats the matter dont worry about being interrupted my last client just left and i have all night for you if you need it i may she said rubbing the back of her hand fiercely across her eyes im sorry i didnt mean to fall apart on you like thisits justi saw you standing there and you looked so confident so strongand i feel sosohorrible he sat down beside her and took her into his arms handing her a clean towel to dry her tears and blow her nose with it might not be a handkerchief but it was at hand tell me from the beginning he said as she took several deep breaths each of which ended in a strangled sob what happened itits conn she said muffled in the towel you knew we havent beenfor a couple of weeks now mostly it was because i was exhausted but sometimesamberdrake i just didnt want to theres nothing there for him anymore even if there ever was i just wished hed go away so tonight when his group came back in and he started on mewell thats when i told him that i wanted him to leaveand not just for right then but permanently and amberdrake prompted gently he said she burst into tears again he started yelling at me telling me how worthless i am he said i was a cold heartless bitch that i didnt have the capacity to love anyone but myself he said i was selfish and spoiled and all i cared about was myself he said i was the worst lover hed ever had that it was like making love to a board and that id never find another man as tolerant as he was he said i was probably a trondiirn because no human would have me as a healer and if it werent for the fact that theres no one checking on the trondiirns competence i wouldnt even have that job he said i was clumsy incompetent and if there werent a war on id be a total failure she was weeping uncontrollably now and if amberdrake hadnt been listening carefully he wouldnt have been able to understand more than half of what she said and youre afraid that its all true right he said gently as soon as she gave him the chance she nodded quite unable to speak her eyes swollen and bloodshot her nose a brilliant pink she looked horrible he wanted to hold her in his arms and protect her from the rest of the world and then he wanted to take the nearest crossbow and go hunting for conn levas and i told gesten i couldnt be angry with anyone anymore but none of that would solve anything she did not need to be coddled or protected she needed to regain confidence in herself so that she could stand on her own feet without having to hide behind anyone else you think that what he said is true only because you are very selfcritical and there is just enough truth in what he said to make you believe all of it he said firmly we both know what kind of a manipulator he is he plays people the way a musician plays his instrumentsand he can do that because he simply doesnt care what happens to them so long as he gets the tune he wants he pulled away a little and looked her straight in the eyes think about him for a moment right now the one thing he is afraid of is that someone will think you left him because he isnt man enough to keep you he said what he did to make you feel too afraid to leave him lets take the things he said one at a time what is the first thing that you can think of ththat im a ccold bitch she said in a small voice by which he means that you are both uncaring and an unsatisfactory lover he replied well so far as he is concerned thats correct you told me yourself that you didnt care in the least for him emotionally when you made your arrangement with him you used him to protect your real identity reanna would never have had anything to do with someone like him which made him perfect as part of your disguise right reanna would never have taken any lover much less a lowborn one she replied her cheeks flaming ii he shook his head gently you made an unemotional bargain and you expected it to remain that way it didnt in part because he was good enough at winkling out your real feelings and using them against you which by definition means that you are not without emotion yes she nodded still blushing her eyes averted he also claimed that you are incompetent and clumsy and you are professional enough to fear that he is correct in that assessment as well he thought for a moment the worst that i ever heard about youand trust me kechara a kestrachern hears a great dealwas that you parroted rotten orders without questioning them and treated your charges as if they were so many animals no one ever questioned your competence only yourahmanner and now that you treat your gryphons as the people they are you have the highest marks from everyone cinnabar included i do she looked at him again shocked i dont know conn levas very well on a personal level nor do i wish to amberdrake continued i had him as a client once and i managed to avoid a second session i have seen far too many people with his attitudes and i dont feel i need to see any more furthermore every other kestrachern that he has gone to feels the same about him as i do the center of conns world is conn he is interested only in someone else insofar as they can do something for him in his world there are users and the used once you took yourself out of the ranks of the latter you must have become one of the former and thus you went from being his possession to his rival so that is why he flung the other insults at you about being selfish and spoiled to his eyes the universe is a mirrorhe sees himself reflected everywhere both his good and bad traits people who are good to him must be like himand people who are bad to him must also be like him she nodded and rubbed her eyes with the corner of the towel as for the rest of his accusations he paused a moment and assessed his own feelings should i what happens if i do and what would happen if i dont would you care to have a professional assessment she pulled away eyes wide with surprise but not with fear or revulsion the two things he had been worried that he would see in her expression you canti mean do you mean she stammered he smiled and nodded the assessment would be professional he told her very quietly but the motives are purely selfish i find you exceedingly attractive winterhart i do not want to complicate our friendship nor do i want to jeopardize it but i wish that we were more than just friends she blinked for several moments as her cheeks flushed and paled and flushed again for a moment he thought that she was going to refuse and he wished that he had never said a word then to his own delight and surprise she suddenly flung herself at him but not like a drowning woman grasping after safety but like an eagle coming home to her aerie after a long and weary flight and there was no doubt left at all of her feelingsor of his the afternoon respite was rare enough for skanand that amberdrake had time to spare was a gift from the hand of the gods time for the two of them to sit in the warm sun togetherand as an excuse to keep others away amberdrake tasked himself with repairing feathers skan had broken in the last engagement with the enemy the word on the lines isstalemate said skan as amberdrake imped in one of his old feathers on the shaft of a broken primary again not a quiet stalemate though at least not for us the warm sun felt so good on his back and neck he stretched his head out and halfclosed his eyes flattening his eartufts and crestfeathers with pleasure that seems to be the case up and down the lines amberdrake replied his brows furrowed with concentration as he carefully inserted the pin that would hold the new shaft to the old skan turned his head a little and watched him with interest and not a little envy he would have loved to have the hands to do things like this for himself even zhaneel couldnt imp in her own feathers for all that she had those wonderful clever hands she could do plenty of other things he relied on a human for though she no longer had the disadvantage of shortened foreclaws that had handicapped her in aerial combat a human in the sixth who had once been a trainer of fighting cocks had made her a set of removable razorsharp fighting claws that fit over the backs of her hands she could still manipulate objects while wearing them for they worked best when she held her own foreclaws fisted now she was as formidable as the strongest of the broadwings and wouldnt need to rely on her shears to take down makaar these new claws were made of steel sharp as file and stone could make them and much longer than natural claws she had been so effective in clawtoclaw combat with the makaar while wearing these contraptions that the man had been pulled out of the ranks and set to making modified claws and spurs that other gryphons could wear the makaar dropped with gratifying frequency and gryphons wearing the new contraptions found themselves able to take out two and even three makaar more per sortie the trouble was of course that as soon as someone in the enemy ranks figured out what the gryphons new advantage was it would be copied for the makaar it was only a matter of time as long as every makaar that gets close enough to see the new claws winds up dead we can keep our secret weapon secret a little longer skan told himself and every makaar dead is one more that wont rise to fight us and will have to be replaced i understand that the word in the camp is much more interesting than that skan continued casually looking back at his friend through slitted eyes amberdrake fitted the trimmed feather onto the spike of the pin and slowly eased it into place skan had expected him to hem and haw but the kestrachern surprised him by glancing up and smiling if you mean whats going on between winterhart and me youre right he said with a nod the situation between us is not a stalemate anymore he looked back down and finished the work of gluing the feather to the steel pin and the place where both shafts met hold still dont move if you can sit there patiently until this sets its going to be perfect not a stalemate skan asked suppressing the urge to flip his wings which would ruin amberdrakes careful work is that all you can say amberdrake peeled the last of the glue from his fingers and tossed aside the rag he had used to clean up before he answered what else do you want me to say he asked shes the sixth wing east trondiirn im theoretically the chief kestrachern she cant and wont abandon her duties and neither will i mine take up a great deal of the evening and night and hers take up a great deal of the daytime aside from thatwe are managing conn levas is back out in the field he has made no moves to cause her trouble other than gossip and backbiting which we can both ignore he chooses to believe that she is proving what a fool she truly is by taking up with a manipulating kestrachern and if that makes him happy and causes him to leave her alone then he can spread all the gossip he wants so far as we are concerned we have an ear among the mages in the person of vikteren so we know everything he says huh skan cast amberdrake a look of dissatisfaction but the kestrachern ignored it tamsin and cinnabar had a lot more to say about it than that tamsin is a romantic and cinnabar was raised on ballads amberdrake retorted his neck and ears flushing a little winterhart and i are satisfied with the arrangement we have we are fulfilling our duties exactly as we did before that is all anyone needs to know skan raised his head carefully and flattened his eartufts heyla excuse me he said in surprise at amberdrakes controlled vehemence didnt mean to pry when youre in love you know you like to hear that the whole worlds in love too amberdrake finally looked into his eyes and patted his shoulder sorry old bird he said apologetically thereve been too many people who want to make up some kind of romantic nonsense about the two of us being lifebonded and just as many who want to turn me into the evil perchi who seduced the virtuous winterhart away from the equally virtuous conn levas im a little tired of both stories skan nodded but for all of amberdrakes denials there was very little doubt in his mind that amberdrake and winterhart were a lifebonded pair tamsin and cinnabar said so and they also said that those who were lifebonded tended to be able to recognize the state in others it wont be easy for either of them tamsin had added pensively lifebonding is hardly as romantic as the ballads make it out to be both of you have got to be strong in order to keep one from devouring the other alive and youd better hope that both of you are ready for the kind of closeness that lifebonding brings especially between two people who are empaths you cant fight or argueyou feel your partners pain as much as your own you become not two people precisely but a kind of twoheaded twopersonalitied entity tamsinandcinnabar and youd better hope that one of you doesnt suddenly come to like something that the other detests because you wind up sharing just about everything but when it finally works cinnabar had added with an affectionate caress for tamsin it is a good thing a partnership where strengths are shared and weaknesses minimized i think that the good points all outweigh the bad but i have reason to neither of them had bothered to point out the obviousthat tamsin was as lowborn as cinnabar was high and if there had not been a war on there would have been considerable opposition to their pairing even from cinnabars conspicuously liberal and broadminded family in fact there had been terrible tragedies over such pairings in the past which was why there were as many tragic ballads about lifebondings as there were romantic ones even skan knew that much well if amberdrake chose not to admit to such a tie with winterhart that was his business and not skans and if he preferred to make the relationship seem as casual as possible well that was only good sense cant help what people say and you know that conn is the origin of most of the spiteful talk skan observed and as for the people who are spreading it well you know who they are too if it wasnt winterhart theyd make something up about you and thats a fact i just want to know one thing are you happy both of you amberdrake nodded soberly i think that we are as happy as any two people can be in this whole situation we arent unhappy if that makes any difference he sighed and smoothed down the vanes of the feather blending the old one into the new this is a war she deals with the physical hurts i try to deal with the emotional ones every day brings more grief i help her through hers and she helps me through mine maybe he didnt finish the sentence but skan knew the rest of it it was the litany of everyone in urthos forces from the lowest to the highest maybe someday when the war is over the war had gone on so long that there was an entire generation of gryphons now fighting who had never known anything but the war that probably went for humans too the war had turned the society that older folks sometimes talked about completely upside down and even skan could not remember most of what his elders talked about with such longing the repercussions of that were still going on is it set skan asked finally when the silence between them had lingered for some time amberdrake seemed to jar himself awake from some pensive dream and checked the joint with a careful finger i think so he replied give yourself a good shake if it holds through that its set skan did so gratefully there was nothing like being told to hold still that made a gryphon wild for a good shake amberdrake laughed and backed out of the way as the gryphon roused all of his feathers and then shook himself so vigorously that bits of down and dust went everywhere the newlyimped feather held feeling and acting entirely as strong as any of the undamaged ones he grinned in satisfaction and saluted amberdrake with a jaunty wave excellent as always my friend he said cheerfully you should give up your wicked ways and become a fulltime featherartist very few gryphons are as enthusiastic in the performance of their duties as you are amberdrake countered i dont think ive had to imp in more than a dozen feathers in the last two years and most of those were yours id starve for lack of work you could always tend hawks as well as gryphons skan suggested you could always pull a travelwagon amberdrake replied thank you no i enjoy my duties i would not enjoy tending psychotic goshawks neurotic peregrines murderous hawkeagles and demented gyrfalcons have you ever heard the story about how you tell what a falconer flies no skan replied with eartufts up hawks and falcons fascinated him because they were so outwardly like and inwardly unlike a gryphon how do you the man who flies a falcon has puncture wounds all over his fist from nervous talons the man who flies a goshawk has an arm that is white to the elbow because he never dares go without his gauntlet and the man who flies a hawkeagle is the one with the eye patch amberdrakes mouth quirked slightly and skan chuckled i presume that must be a very old kaledain proverb skan told him with the sigh that was supposed to tell amberdrake he had quoted far too many kaledain proverbs butnervous talons what does that mean tense birds have tense toes and peregrines are notoriously nervous amberdrake said his mouth quirking a little more this time with a distinctly wicked glint in his eye remember that the next time your little gryfalcon is startled when shes got some portion of you in her hands skan laid her eartufts back with dismay you arent serious surely amberdrake laughed and slapped the gryphons shoulder you wouldnt do anything to make zhaneel nervous would you of course not he said firmly and wondered in the next moment if there was any chance amberdrake only chuckled ive spent enough time with you featherhead there are some things i need to take care of and im certain that you have plenty to do yourself so if you dont mind ill get on with my cleaning and you get back to your mate skans crest rose with pleasure at that last word mate he had a mate and that mate was zhaneel swift strong and altogether lovely he tugged affectionately on a mouthful of amberdrakes hair and then shoved the kestrachern back in the direction of his own tent back to your housekeeping then if you prefer it to my company you really ought to know that a clean and neat dwelling place is the sign of a disturbed mind yes i know amberdrake combed the hair skan had mouthed back with his ringers grinned and took himself back into his tent before skan could retort with anything else such respites were doomed to be short in wartime the flight back to the gryphons lairs was a short one and normally completely uneventful but as skan took to the air and got above the tops of the tents he saw evidence of a great deal of disturbance in that direction gryphons flew in to the lairs from all over the camp their irregular wingbeats betraying agitation even at a distance he saw ruffled feathers and flattened eartufts crests raised in alarm and clenched foreclaws yet there was no other sign of agitation in the camp so either the gryphons were privy to something the rest of urthos forces hadnt found out yet or the information was pertinent only to gryphons it wouldnt be the first time we found out about something no one else knew he thought with a sinking heart immediately he lengthened and strengthened his wingstrokes to gain more speed whatever had occurred it was imperative that he learn what was going on the lairs had been built into an artificial hill terraced in three rings so that each lair had clear space in front of it there was a small field full of sunning rocks between the lairs and the rest of the camp that was where everyone had gathered he landed next to a cluster of half a dozen gryphons from the sixth that included aubri all of them listened intently to what the broadwing had to say necks stretched out and heads cocked a little to one side their sides heaved as they panted heavily one of them hissed to himself their neckfeathers stood straight out from their necks like a fightingcocks ruff and two of them rocked back and forth as their feet flexed all of this was quite unconscious and a sign of great agitation aubri stopped in midsentence as skan backwinged down on the top of a rock beside them and waved skan over with an outstretched foreclaw ive got bad news skan he called out as skan leapt down off the rock and hurried over to join the group its not all over camp yet but it will be soon general farles dead what skan could not have been more surprised if aubri had told him that the tower had just burned down farle dead how did you kill a general without wiping out the entire command chief officers were never anywhere near the front lines granted farle had a reputation for wanting to be near the action but the general wasnt stupid and he was certainly the bestprotected man in the sixth how had anyone gotten to him was it accident could it have been treachery i was telling the otherswe think that some kind of suicide group got through and took him out him and most of the other chief officers of the sixth aubri said we dont even know how or who did it there was just an explosion in the command tent and when the smoke and dust cleared there wasnt much there but a smoking hole the mages are trying to figure out just what happened but the main thing for us is that weve lost him skan swore there was only one man of farles rank that was not already in a command position shaiknam the general that farle had replaced the official story was that shaiknam was on leave while farle got more command experience although the real reason shaiknam had been taken out of the post was his incompetence but urtho could not help being his optimistic self nor could he stop giving unworthy people so many second chances that they might as well not even have gotten reprimanded urtho would remember all the great things that shaiknams father had done probably assume that shaiknam had learned his lesson and would give him back the command he had taken away rather than promoting someone else after all it would look very bad for general shaiknam if urtho did promote someone of a lower rank to command the sixth when shaiknam was sitting there on his thumbs doing nothing until now urtho had been able to maintain that polite fiction that he was seasoning farle and that general shaiknam was taking a wellearned leave of absence to rest he would not be able to maintain it for more than a moment after the rest of the forces learned of farles death it was either shame shaiknam with all the attendant problems that would cause or give the sixth back to the man whod never completed a task in his life there was no doubt in skans mind which it would be shaiknam was too wellborn too wellconnected the sixth would go back to him that seemed to be the conclusion everyone else had come to as well with shaiknam in charge the gryphons of the sixth just became deployable decoys again right now the big question seemed to be what if anything they could do about it skan moved from group to group just listening saying nothing he heard much the same from each group this is dreadful and were all going to get killed by this madman but we cant do anything about it there was a great deal of anxietypanic in factbut no one was emerging with any ideas or even as a leader willing and able to represent them all which leavesme well this was the moment if ever to act on the theories of leadership he had been researching all this time can you be a leader featherhead he looked around once more at the gathering of his kind gryphons had started to pick at their feathers like hysterical messengerbirds they were so upset iguess there isnt a choice its me or no one he jumped up onto the highest sunbathing rock and let loose with a battlescreech that stunned everyone else to silence excuse me he said into the quiet as startled eyes met his and upturned beaks gaped at him but this seems to be a problem that we already have the solution to urtho doesnt control us anymore remember we are just as autonomous as the mages if we want to be we can all fly off into the wilderness and leave the whole war behind any time we want a moment more of silence and then the assembled gryphons met his words with a roar of objections he nodded and listened without trying to stem the noise or counter their initial words most of the objections boiled down to the simple fact of the gryphons loyalty to their creator no one wanted to abandon urtho or his cause they just wanted to be rid of shaiknam when the last objection had been cried out onto the air and the assemblage quieted down again he spoke i agree with you he said marveling that not a single gryphon in the lot had made any objection to his assumption of leadership we owe loyaltyeverythingto urtho we shouldnt even consider abandoning him but we do not have to tell him that the mages all felt exactly the same way but they were perfectly willing to use the fact that they could all pack up and leave as a bargainingchit we should do the same thing if the situation was less dangerous for us than it is i would never suggest this course of action but i think we all know what life for the sixth was like under shaiknam and we cant allow a fool to throw our lives away heads nodded vigorously all around him as crestfeathers slowly smoothed down eartufts rising with interest youve got to be the one black boy aubri called out from somewhere in the rear youve got to be the one to speak for us youre the best choice for the job another chorus this time of assent greeted aubris statement skans nares flushed with mingled embarrassment and pride ill tell you what then he told them all wondering if what he was doing was suicidally stupid or would be their salvation i was trying to come up with a plan to get the confrontation over with quickly before shaiknam has a chance to entrench himself now we all know that where shaiknam goes garber follows and im pretty certain he is going to be the one to try to bring us to heel initially this is the tactic that just might work best two messages came by bird from garber both of which he ignored one of the gryphons who had a particularly good relationship with the birds smugly took the second one off for a moment when it arrived when the gryphon was finished the bird flew off shortly thereafter messengerbirds rose in a cloud from the area around shaiknams tent and scattered to the far corners of the camp that left shaiknam and garber with no choice but to use a human messenger the gryphons of the sixth took to their lairs to hide while the rest made themselves scarce and skan was the only gryphon in sight he reclined at his ease up on the sunbathing rock as an aidedecamp in the colors of the sixth came trudging up the path to the lairs looking for the gryphons garber had summoned so imperiously the gryphons in question hid in the shadows just out of sight although they had a clear view of skan and the aide they were not going to show so much as a feather until skan gave them the word the young man glanced curiously around the areawhich looked for all intents and purposes to be completely deserted skan wondered what was going on in his mind the gryphons were not with their trondiirn who obviously had not been told of this impromptu conspiracy they were not on the practice grounds nor on zhaneels nowsanctioned obstacle course they were not with the command they could only be at their lairs unless they had all taken leave out of the area and leave had not been approved yet the lawn in front of the lairs was completely deserted no sign of gryphons nor where they had gone to there was no one in the dustbathing pits nor at the waterbaths no one lounged in the shady porch of his or her lair no one reclined on a sunbathing rock except skan the black gryphon watched the mans expression as he tried to reconcile his orders with what hed found skan was not precisely assigned to the sixth but he had been flying cover for zhaneel skan would have to do the aidedecamp took another look around then squared his shoulder and marched straight up to the black gryphon skan raised his head to watch him approach but said and did nothing else general shaiknam has sent two messengerbirds here to rally the gryphons of the sixth the young man said crisply why was there no answer skan simply looked at himexactly the same way that he would have regarded a nice plump deer but the youngster was made of sterner stuff than most and obviously was not going to be rattled simply by the stare of an unfriendly carnivore with a beak large and sharp enough to make short work of his torso he continued bravely general shaiknam orders that the gryphons of the sixth report immediately to the landing field for deployment why skan rumbled the young man blinked as if he had not expected skan to say anything much less demand information he was so startled that he actually gave it youll be making runs against the troops below panjir he said flying in at treetop level dropping rocks and and making ourselves targets for the seven batteries of ballistas and other skypointing missilethrowers skan replied caustically scarcelymoving targets at that there isnt room between those cliffwalls for more than one gryphon to fly at a time much less a decent formation well look like beads on a string if the missiles dont get us the makaar will coming down on us from the heights you can tell the general that well be declining his little invitation tell him the message is from the black gryphon and with that skan put his head back down on his foreclaws closed his eyes to mere slits and pretended to go to sleep the aides mouth dropped completely open for a moment then closed quickly but to his credit he did not try to bluster or argue he simply turned on his heel and left trudging back down the hill leaving behind a trail of little puffs of dust skan watched him until he was well out of sight then jumped to his feet now what one of the others called from the shelter of his lair now i go to urtho before shaiknam does skan replied and leapt skyward wings laboring to gain altitude heading straight for the tower where would urtho be at this hour probably the strategy room that wasnt exactly convenient he couldnt go to something deep inside the tower without passing a door and at least one guard skan was going to have to go through channels rather than landing directly on urthos balcony the way he would have preferred he backwinged down onto the pavement in front of the tower paced regally up to the guard just outside the door and bowed his head in salute skandranon to see urtho on a matter of extreme urgency he said politely and with strictest formality i would appreciate it if you would send him a message to that effect he was rather proud of the fact that despite his own agitation his sibilants had no hissing and he pronounced his rs without a trill the guard nodded tapped on the door and whispered to someone just inside for a moment and turned back to skan taken care of skandranon he said if youd care to wait i dont think itll take long skan nodded thank you he replied he longed to pace his feet itched with the need to tear something up out of sheer nerves but he kept as still and as serene as a statue of black graniteexcept for his tail which twitched and lashed no matter how hard he concentrated on keeping it quiet with every moment that passed he expected to hear a messenger from shaiknam running up behind himmessengerbirds still probably avoided the general and his underlings so shaiknam would have to use a much slower method of requesting his own audience with the mage of silence as time continued to crawl past skan wanted to grind his beak he felt like a very large target in the middle of all the pale stone finally after far too long a wait a faint tap on the door behind him caused the guard to open it and listen for a moment he flung it wide and gestured for skan to enter urtho will see you he said the mage is in the strategy room no point in the guard telling him the way as they both knew skan was perfectly at home in the tower he simply nodded and walked in the open door a second guard stationed inside gave him a brief nod of recognition as skan passed urtho had planned most of his tower with creatures like his gryphons in mind the floors were of natural roughtextured stone so that claws and talons did not slip on them the doors and hallways were all made tall and wide enough for things larger than a human to pass there wasnt a great deal to see otherwisejust the hallway itself plain and unadorned with closed doors on either side of it the room that skan wanted was behind the third door on the right and he hurried right to it the door opened for him but by human agency and not magical urtho stood behind the tablesized contour map used for all major planning sessions areas held by maar had been magically tinted red everything else was blue there was an alarming amount of red on that map urtho skan began as soon as he was in the door i you and the sixth wing gryphons are staging a revolt urtho replied with dangerous gentleness skans eartufts flattened how did you know he blurted backing up a pace or two behind him a hertasi shut the door and took himself out of the room by a side passage leaving the two of them alone i am a mage urtho reminded him while i dont squander my energies i do use them on occasion to keep an eye on something i knew you lot wouldnt care for having shaiknam set over you but i didnt think youd start a revolution he crossed his arms over his chest and gazed levelly at skan thats not a particularly clever thing to do you cant survive without me you know ah hells well might as well drop it all at once yes we can skan replied raising his head so that he looked down on urtho rather than dropping his eyes below the level of urthos as all his training screamed at him to do im sorry urtho but we dont need you anymore we know how to make ourselves fertile now zhaneel is the proof of that if you doubt my unadorned word on it he had never in all of his life seen urtho taken aback before surprised yes shocked certainly but completely dumbfoundednever the expression of complete blankness on urthos face was so funny that skan couldnt help himself he started laughing urthos face flushed and the blank expression he wore turned to one of annoyance and a little anger what are you laughing at you overgrown chicken the mage spluttered what is so damned funny skan could only shake his head still laughing your face was all he was able to manage before he ran out of breath urtho reddened a little more but then grudgingly he smiled so you think you have the upper hand do you he said challenge in his tone skan got himself back under control and quickly even though laughter threatened to bubble up through his chest at any moment yes and no he replied we can leave now you no longer control us by means of our future urtho that doesnt mean we will leave though it just means that we wont have to put up with idiots like shaiknam and garber who think were to be thrown away by the handful wait he held up a foreclaw as urtho started to say something listen to me first this is what shaiknam planned to do with the gryphons as soon as he got the sixth out into the field again he told urtho what the aide had told him then traced out the planned maneuvers on the map you see he said as urthos brow furrowed you see what that would do maybe we would provide a distraction for maars troops but there are better ways of supplying distraction than sacrificing half the wings i do see urtho replied nodding thoughtfully i do see we dont want to make trouble urtho skan continued earnestly taking a cautious step nearer but we dont want to be blackmailed into suicidal missions maybe thats not how it seemed to you but that was how it felt to us he raised his head a little higher you built our urges to reproduce as strongly as our will to eat and breathe and used that to control us wed rather serve you out of loyalty than coercion i would rather have you out of loyalty urtho murmured blinking rapidly once or twice he coughed hiding his face for just a moment then looked up again and just how did you obtain this knowledge he asked im sure it was youi cant think of another gryphon who would have tried let alone succeeded skan gaped his beak wide in an insolent grin hoping to charm urtho into good humor that urtho would be telling sixteen for one brief moment when skandranon defied him urtho had been in a whitehot rage how dared this creature a thing that he had created presume to dictate the terms of this war how dared this same creature usurp the knowledge it had no right to and was not intelligent enough to use properly but that rage burned itself out as quickly as it came for urtho had lived too long to let his rage control his intellect intellect came to his rescue with all of the answers to the questions of how dared skan dared because he was not a creature he was a living thinking rightfully independent being as were all the rest of the gryphons they were precisely what he had hoped and planned for and had never thought they would become in his lifetime they had the right to control their own destinies perhaps he was responsible for their form but their spirits were their own he was now the one who had no right to dictate anything to themand in a blinding instant of insight he realized that he was incredibly lucky that they didnt harbor resentment against him for what hed withheld from them instead they were still loyal to him they would have been perfectly within their rights to fly off as they threatened he thought as skan laughed at the expression on his face its nothing short of a miracle that they didnt dear gods we have been lucky he didnt realize how lucky until skan told him just what shaiknam had been planning a quick survey of the topography of the area told him what it did not tell skan that shaiknam had intended to launch an allornothing glorystrike against the heavilyfortified valley such things succeeded brilliantly when they succeeded at all but this particular battleplan didnt have the chances of a snowflake in a frying pan of working it was just another one of shaiknams insane attempts to pull off some maneuver that would have him hailed as a military genius and a hero the only trouble was that military geniuses and heroes had sound reasoning behind their plans shaiknam unfortunately had only wild ideas urtho cursed the man silently as skan pointed out all the ways that the gryphons would be cut down without being able to defend themselves shaiknams father was such a brilliant strategist and commander how had the man avoided learning even the simplest of strategies from him well there was no hope for it the only way to get rid of the man now would be to strip the sixth of all nonhuman troops and mages on the excuse that all the other commands were undermanned and reassign the personnel elsewhere shaiknam could still be commander of the sixth but he would only command foottroops all of them human with no aerial support and no mages he would be forced into caution that should keep him out of trouble and his inept assistant garber too he growled a little when skan refused to tell him who his coconspirators had been but it was a good bet that lady cinnabar was involved in this right up to her aristocratic chin and where you found cinnabar you found tamsin and probably amberdrake no doubt they got in when cinnabar asked to look at my records on the gryphons i thought she was looking for a cure for belly ache the kestrachern must have gotten a client to make him a set of keys for magelocks that would account for how theyd gotten into the book the wonder of it was that they had managed to penetrate past all the fireworks and folderol in order to find the real triggers for fertility how many of you know the spell he asked as reluctant admiration set in all skan said without so much as blinking an eye and its not exactly a flashy spell urtho it was simply good design there was no point in holding the information back every gryphon outside this tower knows the secret he couldnt help it he had to shake his head with pure admiration and youve kept this whole thing from me all this time unbelievable we had reason to keep it among ourselves skan replied good reason we didnt know how you would feel or act and we didnt want you finding out before the time was right for me to tell you so you were the sacrificial goat hmm urtho eyed skan dubiously i dont know a sacrifice is supposed to be savory not scrawny skan drew himself up in an exaggerated pose a sacrifice is supposed to be the best of the best i believe i fill that description his eyes twinkled as he watched urtho from beneath his heavy lids and his beak gaped in a broad grin when urtho laughed aloud i submit to the inevitable my friend urtho said still laughing as he slapped skan on the shoulder i suppose i must consider this as your test of adulthood as the kaledain give their youngsters you gryphons are certainly not my children any longernot anyones children then he sobered i am glad that this has happened now skan and i am glad that you are here i need to pass along some grave news of my own and this will probably be the best opportunity to do so he called in the hertasi who waited discreetly just on the other side of the door and gave him swift instructions i wish you to summon general shaiknam and take him to the marble office once you have left him there summon the commanders of the other forces to the strategy room he turned back to skan i am splitting the nonhuman manpower of the sixth among all the other commandersi have reason enough since all of them have been complaining that they are shorthanded that will leave shaiknam in command of nothing but humans is there any commander that you think the gryphons of the sixth would prefer to serve for once he had caught the black gryphon by surprise skans gringape turned into a jawdropped gape of surprise and his eyes went blank for a moment ahahjudeth of the fifth i think urtho nodded pleased with his choice excellent and she has had no real gryphon wings assigned to her forces until now only those on loan from the sixth or the fourth consider it done urtho regarded skan measuringly still the gryphons should have their own collective voice even as the mages do there are things that you know about yourselves that no human could there should be one gryphon assigned to speak for all gryphons so that things will not come to the pass they have with shaiknam before i come to hear about it he stabbed out a finger you you skan i hereby assign you to be the overall commander of all the gryphon wings and to speak for them directly to me skans surprise turned to stupefaction his head came up as if someone had poked him in the rear me he squeakedyes squeaked he sounded like a mouse he cleared his throat and tried again me why me i am honored urtho but urtho waved his objections aside youve obviously thought about becoming the leader of the gryphons or why else would you have read all my history books about the great leaders of the past the others clearly think that you should have that position or why else would they have sent you here to confront me over shaiknam is it unusually warm in here skan felt his nares flushing and he hung his head they didnt exactly pick me he admitted they couldnt seem to do much besides panic and complain so i i took over nobody seemed to mind all the more reason to place you in charge if you were the only one to take charge urtho said implacably how do you think i wound up in charge of this socalled army skan ducked his head between his shoulder blades his nares positively burning im not sure thats a fit comparison now i have a few things to tell you urtho continued i dont know if youve been aware of it but ive been sending groups of families and noncombatants into the west ever since we first thought wed have to abandon the tower he turned back to the map and stood over it brooding i didnt like having such a great concentration of folk here in the first place and when i realized what chaos an evacuation would be i liked it even less skan nodded with admiration he hadnt realized that urtho was moving people out in a systematic way that in itself spoke for how cleverly the mage had arranged it all ive been posting the groups at the farthest edges of the territory we still hold near enough to the permanent gates there that they can still keep in touch with everyone here as if nothing had changed but far enough so that if anything happens urtho did not complete the sentence if anything happens we have advance groups already in place skan said quickly an evacuation will be much easier that way faster too and if the fighters know their families are already safe their minds will be on defense and retreat rather than on worrying i dont want another laisfaar urtho said his head bent over the table so that his face was hidden i dont want another stelvi pass skan had his own reasons to second that the lost gryphons there sometimes visited him in dreams haunting him fly again as urtho wills who will you pick for your second skan urtho asked after a long silence briskly changing the subject i assume its going to be one of the experienced fighters and he cast a quick glance out of the corner of his eye at skan who caught a sly twinkle there i count zhaneel as an experienced fighter skan coughed well it will be zhaneel of course but because she has the respect of the others even gryphons who havent trained on her course know how hard it is and they admire her for all shes accomplished but theres something else id like to ask you for as well urtho turned away from the table oh he said imbuing the single syllable with a multitude of flavorings once again skans stomach and crop churned with anxiety and his nares flushed iahdid a little exploring on that level of your tower and urthos face and voice were carefully neutral i found thethe models how did you urtho exclaimed flushing for a moment with anger but he quickly calmed never mind what skan interrupted i met kechara urtho stared at him blankly for a moment then grew just a little pale i believe he said carefully that i had better sit down you must hate me skan shook his head as urtho lowered himself into a chair and if he was any judge of human reactions the mage had been profoundly shaken how could i hate you the more time i spent with her the more i realized that you had done the best you could for her and once i had a few days to think about it i believe i managed to puzzle out why you had her up there instead of down with the rest of the gryphons it wasnt just to protect her from being teased and getting her feelings hurt he took a deep breath and ventured everything on his guess it was because shes a very powerful mindspeaker probably the most powerful youve ever seen urthos eyes widened and he caught his breath did she mindspeak at you he asked skan nodded pleased that he had been clever enough to figure out the puzzle i realized that i had been getting a great deal more information from her than she had the words to tell me that was when i remembered that she had hit me with a mindblast just before she attacked me and i figured out that she wasnt just telling me things with her voice but with her mind as well he told urtho the tale from beginning to end saving only that he had gotten into the chamber in the first place with vikterens magekeys thats why shes in the tower in a room with such heavy shields and why she creates the presence of a dozen gryphons when theres only her and thats why zhaneel and i would like to have her well protect her from teasing and ridicule and she can act asoha kind of relay for groups of gryphons that may need to speak with each other we have mindspeakers of course but none as powerful as she is i see that you put a great deal of thought into this urtho mopped his forehead with a sleeve as small beads of perspiration sprang up i must confessthat use for her had occurred to me i was too softhearted to well misborn usually die young anyway and i assumed that her nature would take care of the problems she represented for me when she didnt die though i had to do something about her shes as old as you are skan she only seems younger because shes so childlike and because her memory for things longer ago than a year is very poor i knew that if anyone ever discovered her and her power shed be a target for our enemies in the wrong hands she could be a terrible weapon i was afraid that i would have to go to war just to protect her and i couldnt reconcile the safety and freedom of one misborn with compromising the safety of all those who depend on me you see that was why i hid her in the tower and kept her existence secret i simply could not protect her otherwise and i would not risk a war over her urtho i hate to point this out but we are in a war and it isnt over kechara skan retorted with a little more sarcasm than he intended no one is going to get into this camp to steal her and there isnt much point in keeping her mewed up anymore skandranon sat down across from urtho he was rather surprised to learn that kechara was as old as he was as urtho said the misborn generally did not live past their teens much less grow to be as old as he it was something of a tribute to urthos care that she had lived as long as she had urtho sighed youre right he admitted reluctantly she deserves a little freedom anyway but keep her hereif not in the tower then near it of course skan nodded i should like to start moving the gryphon families out to where the other noncombatants are going if you dont mind all pairs with nestlings and fledglings and all fledged still in training i dont see any reason why they cant complete their training elsewhere he thought for a moment ill tell them that you are concerned that with all of us consolidated here we make a very tempting target for some terrible weapon you want to get us spread out so we arent quite so easy to get all at once urtho considered that as he studied the map what about here and here he pointed to two valleys easily defended at the farthest range for a permanent gate i can set two of the gates for those places and move not only gryphons but kaledain and all the nonhumans who are not combatants there anyone who wants to visit them can i have an even better idea skan suggested set up a secondary gate and put the gryphons out farther use the excuse that we are big eaters and need the territory send the kaledain to this valley in the south and convalescents and volunteers there to the north that gets them out from underfoot and they can train your human youngsters while theyre recovering urtho snapped his fingers of courseand whats more ill have the ambulatory and the youngsters run foraging parties make them as selfsufficient as possible have them send the surplus here skan added with growing enthusiasm it wont be much but it will make them feel as if we need to have them out there and a little fresh game now and then his mouth tingled at the very thought herd beasts have no real flavor a good raebuck though with hertasi in charge skan i am not certain i would be too ready to say that they wont send back much hertasi are remarkable scavengers urthos eyebrows quirked a little thats largely why i have them in charge of supply here they find ways to make ten loaves feed a hundred fighters but skan noticed that urtho was much more subdued than usual perhaps there is something he hasnt told me are things even worse than i thought a light tap at the door prevented him from asking any further questions cautiously urthos chief hertasi stuck his snout inside the commanders are here urtho the lizard said quietly urtho glanced over at skan and shrugged let them in seri he said they might as well hear it all at once the commanders filed in general judeth last of all impeccable and austere in her chosen colors of black and silver they gathered around the table and skan saw one or two turn a little pale when they looked over the latest conquests of maars forces didnt they know or does this mean something i cant guess at gentlemen ladies urtho nodded to the group i brought you here for several reasons the firstgeneral farle is dead assassinated as far as we can tell a sharp intake of breath around the table told skan that none of the commanders had heard the bad news yet i am afraid that under the circumstances i must dismantle the sixth as it has been known and spread its nonhuman and magical resources among all of you general judeth as urtho spoke her name the lady sat up straighter and lost her look of shocked dismay at the specific request of the new commander of all the gryphon wings i am assigning the wings that formerly belonged to the sixth to you i know that you will command them well the general did not salute or snap to attention but she gave the impression that she had i will do my best sir she replied simply the rest of you may decide among yourselves how to apportion up the rest of the sixths available manpower general shaiknam will command the human footsoldiers but all else will be available to you urtho nodded and skan saw with satisfaction that the commanders were already getting over their shock and thinking about the situation i am certain that you will not allow any kind of rivalry to interfere with the best possible deployment of that manpower nowi am certain you all know skandranon the black gryphon either on sight or by reputation nods and some slight smiles met that as skan bowed his head in a brief salute to all of them but especially to general judeth i have appointed him to be the overall commander of the gryphon wings in the same arrangement that i made with the mages urtho paused and waited for their reaction skan saw only slight frowns and one or two nods general judeth was the first to speak she cleared her throat delicately then spoke to both urtho and to skan the arrangement is working better with the mages than we had thought it would she admitted we thought it might make for problems if not outright mutiny among the mages but it didnt work out that way her mouth twitched a little although she did not actually smile there are even some mages who have shown a remarkable increase in their abilities apparently having someone to evaluate their performance who knows what they can do has made them a little moreeagerto do their best i trust both because urtho has chosen you skandranon and from some of your reputation that you will act in a similar manner skans nares flushed for there was no doubt just what the general meant by some of your reputation but he answered her steadily enough i can promise you that no gryphon will balk at anything he is asked to do without a reason for objecting skan replied gravely we all understand that this is a war and in war there is the risk of death we only ask that we not be sent into a certainty of death i can also promise you that if there are objections to what we are asked to do it will be because the loss will outweigh the gain for all concerned the gryphons will defend all the races the general nodded at that and turned her attention back to the table i see that you are all concerned by the amount of territory that maar has taken urtho continued you should be i have only just updated the map and a great deal of that gain has been within the last month you all knew youd lost ground but none of you has seen the real scope of the loss until now we are in trouble and i will not hide that fact from you in fact we have lost so much that maar himself has moved into the palace and made it his headquarters they took all that without flinching although skan was incensed at the idea that maar would have taken the palace for his own the idea of thatthat beast that tyrant soiling the halls that great leaders had called home soiling them with his bloody boots it would be rather difficult to hide that we are in trouble with this spread out before us general movat said dryly the question is what are your plans to deal with it urtho considered the map as heavy silence reigned the first thing i intend to do is to begin a quiet evacuation of the noncombatants from around the tower he replied some preliminary work has been done in that direction but now i want it to become a priority i want to move them into the west im going to take six of the permanent gates here on the tower grounds and activate them targeting them to six points on the western border thats mostly wilderness area mountains and forested valleys too steep to farm and not really suited for grazing my very first tower was there he added wistfully and i rather liked keeping it wilderness yes well now its a good thing it is wilderness general korad said briskly maar wont consider that you might have sent people into it my idea precisely urtho tapped the map pointing to the six places where the gates would have their other ends if we have to abandon the tower well have most of the people who would be trouble already out of the way they in turn will have advance camps ready for us if we inform our people that we are doing this only to spread out our resources and make one spot less of a target i believe we can keep them from panicking the generals contemplated the plan quietly for some time each one studying the map and making mental calculations urtho watched their faces skan watched urtho he looks satisfied well if they have simply accepted the plan that must mean its strategically sound so thats how he does it he puts out a plan waits to see what they think of it and changes it with their suggestions and objections i wondered how a mage had become such a good strategist general judeth broke the silence first id like to have one strong mage with each group she said adeptclass perhaps this would be a good place to send those who are frail or those who have moral objections to combative magics and those who simply do not have skill at combative magics this way if further gates need to be built there will be someone at hand rested and prepared to build those gates urtho nodded my kaledain will be here he pointed they will have mages enough in their ranks to cover that point if any of you can think of particular mages who would be suitable please let me know especially if they are familiar with this kind of terrain ifthey can deal with primitive conditions he means some of his older mageswell they ought to go with the kaledain the clans can make a home anywhere if they have to and the horsenomads are already set up for wandering there was more discussion and they put together a tacit agreement skan was impressed he hadnt known that there were humans anywhere who could agree to so much with so few wasted words but this is secondary general korad said at last the real question ishow in the name of all the gods are we going to defend the tower urtho hesitated then asked humbly are you certain that we should a chorus of objections met that statement but it seemed to skan that most of them boiled down toof course we should its your tower urtho waved them to silence there is a great deal in the tower that cant be moved and shouldnt be allowed to fall into maars hands but things can be destroyed the knowledge that made those things possible is as portable as the minds and the books that hold it this place may be my home and it is true that i have invested a great deal of my life in it but that is no reason to remain here when the situation becomes untenable others have lost their homes it would be arrogant of me to think mine was any more sacred than theirs i would be as foolish as my critics have claimed if i clung to this tower when every wise person would have fled he pondered the map if maar breaches our defenses here and here he can spread out his troops along this line he has manpower far exceeding ours if he does that he can force us to try to counter him until we are spread so thin we cant defend ourselves from here on the plain he has a clear run to the tower itself we cannot hold a line against him unless we can suddenly multiply our own troops by a factor of ten the generals studied the map with varying expressions of gloom youre right korad said with no emphasis damn but i hate to admit it if he can get that far hes got us if we remain at the tower urtho reminded them all if we retreat we can pick our place to make a stand or make no stand at all simply keep retreating making him string out his supply lines and his forces eventually even maar must become sated with conquest we can go west then retreat to the farthest south in the lands that the haighlei emperors hold the black kings said judeth skan knew that referred not to their predilections but their skin which was supposedly as dark as a moonless starless sky would they help us urtho shrugged i dont know i do know they would shelter us against a conqueror and despot like maar and their magic is so different from ours that i think even maar would hesitate before he attacked them its not wise to attack an unknown judeth bit her lip then nodded slowly and grudgingly its our best hope if maar gets that far i am going to see that he doesnt if it takes every drop of blood in my body to stop him she sounded and looked grim and skan shivered in a sudden chill as ice threaded down his spine as if a cold wind had just ruffled his feathers how are you going to explaineverythingto shaiknam korad wanted to know after an uncomfortable silence urtho shrugged ill tell him that ive seen he is best with ground maneuvers and im giving him the chance to concentrate on them without the distractions and annoyances of a mixed force then ill show him what ive shown you and well all meet tonight to plan the overall strategy to hold maar right now i want you all to go to your people and get those who are not essential ready to evacuate id like to start moving people out steadily starting tomorrow that sounded like a dismissal to skan and so the other commanders took it they saluted and filed out with only general judeth pausing long enough to have a brief word with the black gryphon as soon as youve seen to your new command come see me with the old sixth wingleaders she said and best of luck skandranon i think urthos chosen wisely she turned smartly and left leaving skan to gape at her back as the door closed behind her he turned to look at urtho the mage smiled wearily i think ive chosen wisely too skan he said nowgo deal with your people while i see to mine we both have a great deal to do and only the kaledain lady knows if we will be given the time to get it all done skan bowed deeply and profoundly but he hesitated at the door urtho had turned back to the map staring at it blankly urtho skan said the mage started turned to face him and stared at him as if he had not expected his new commander to still be in the room i want you to know something we never really considered flying off and abandoning you we are not only loyal to youwe love you that is why we are loyal to you love is harder to earn than loyalty and you are more than my friend you are my beloved father he turned quickly and left and the door swung shut behind himbut for one moment just before it closed completely he thought he saw urthos eyes glittering as if with tears packing too many people in this mess tent made it stiflingly hot amberdrake stood on a table and ran one hand through his damp hair in a nervous gesture that had become habit over the past few days every kestrachern in the camp had squeezed into the mess tent and they all stared at him with varying levels of anxiety wild tales had spread all through the camp since word came from the sixth that general farle had been killed and shaiknam assigned to his old command again most of those tales were variations on older rumors but some were entirely new all the stories that amberdrake had heard had been told with varying degrees of hysteria he held up a hand and got instant silence lamplight glittered in dozens of eyes all fixed on him all wide with fear or hope youve heard the rumors for weeks now the rumors are coming true he said abruptly we are evacuating all noncombatants from around the tower a murmur started but he shook his head and the murmurings died away urtho gave me complete control of what to tell you i am going to tell you the whole truth because urtho and i are counting on you to help keep people calm maar is in a dangerous position for us urtho is telling people that he wants the noncombatants spread out so that we dont make such a tempting target with everything clustered here the real reason is that if he has to evacuate he doesnt want to have civilians at the tower to get in the way or have the ones left worry about them he let them absorb that for a moment we will be one of the last groups out because we are also useful as healers im going to interview each of you tonight and tomorrow and you will decide which of the six evacuation sites you wish to go to i will give you an assignmentchit and when the last of the civilians are gone you will pack up your tents and go to your chosen sites you will still be able to service your clients there the gates will be open for twoway traffic and urtho expects a certain amount of coming and going someone down in front waved his hand what if urtho decides to evacuate completely what about people who are visiting over here good question anyone who goes from his evacuation site to the tower must be aware that at any moment urtho could call for a retreat at that point a noncombatant will have to fend for himself and count himself lucky if he gets to any gate much less the one to his own site amberdrake shrugged helplessly you would be much better off for your clients to come to you rather than vice versa we are going to try to discourage traffic from the sites to the tower for instance there is going to be a curfew in force once the civilians are theoretically gone and meals on the tower side will be strictly rationed to those supposed to be thereno visitors allowed he let them absorb that for a moment another hand appeared is it really looking that bad asked a young woman with frightened eyes he hesitated a moment i cant tell you everything he said finally but urtho is seriously worried and he has already undertaken the enormous task of stripping the tower of as much as possible and sending it to safer places another murmur arose but it died on its own finally lily rose to her feet and lifted her head defiantly there has to be something else we can do she said you know very well that most of our clients are going to postpone visits until the civilian evacuation is overso there must be something practical we can do to help amberdrake relaxed marginally as a chorus of agreement met her brave words thank you lily he said softly i was hoping someone would bring that up yes there is a great deal that we can do to help both on this side of the gates and the other he sat down slowly on the table top the very first job is to help with the children gesten looked out beyond the campfire counted noses and came up with a satisfactory total every hertasi tribe had sent at least one representative and most had sent several why he should have been chosen to be the leader of the whole lot he had no notion but urtho said he was and that was the end of it right he said and dozens of eyes blinked at him you know the story nonfighters are pulling out and were nonfighters the only hertasi who are supposed to stay here after the civilians leave are the ones serving the healers and the gryphons everyone else goes once youve gotten your own kit out come back and start helping the families the kestrachern are minding the children so youll be doing what we do bestyoull be helping to pack up the households and get em moving once thats done you go report to the tower if they need you theyll tell you if they dont you get back over to your assigned place and stay there got it what if youre doing split dutywith a healer and a civilian say someone called from the back gestens briefing hadnt covered that but urtho had told him that he could and should use his own judgment when it came to things that hadnt been covered depends on how close to the fighting you think you can stand to be he said finally if youre feeling brave stay here go fulltime with the healer if youre not stay on the evacuation site and help with whatever needs doing theres going to be a lot that needs doing he tilted his head to one side and narrowed his eyes as he recited the list urtho had given him well need winterproof housing built for everyone and that includes the fighters in case they have to come over well need food supplies located well need wells dug sanitary and washing facilities set up a lot of the families are going to consist of mothers with children theyll all need that extra hand to help well need facilities for the sick and injured and overland vehicles in case we have to retreat from there will there be mages to help us with all this asked an anxious voice and healers there are pregnant females with those civilians and i dont know a thing about birthing babies especially not human babies well have a lot of mages all of the apprentices most of the journeymen and at least one adept at each site gesten promised the healers are sending some of their apprentices a couple of masters and as soon as all the civilians are over the kestrachern will be joining them therere plenty of healers with them and they all have some healer training gesten sensed an easing of tension at that hertasi considered the kestrachern the most levelheaded of the humans and the ones most likely to react properly in a crisis right he said again we can do this we can do this they echoed it was after all the hertasi motto amberdrake rubbed his blurring burning eyes until they cleared then turned his attention back to the list he was compiling protea to tend a creche of tervardi little ones that will work loren with the healers putting together packs of supplies for the evacuees renton lily martina rilei amberdrake have i come at a bad time he looked up squinting across the barrier formed by the light from his lantern and made out the face of lionwind the clan chief of his own kaledain clan of kleshya what are you doing still awake he asked out of sheer surprise to see the perpetual dawn greeter up and active long past the hour of midnight lionwind stepped farther into the tent his heavy braids swinging with each soft silent step we had a clan meeting he said and wed rather not go off with the rest of the kaledain if its all right with urtho but amberdrake shook his head you cant stay he said flatly urtho cant make any exceptions lionwind halfsmiled and folded himself gracefully onto a stool on the other side of the desk we didnt want to stay we just want to be where the gryphons are he told amberdrake weve supplied most of the kaledain trondiirn for the gryphons weve worked with urtho on his breeding programand we like them theyll need someone besides hertasi with them after all hertasi are all very well but they dont like to hunt they cant lift what a human can and theyre a little short of imagination amberdrake listened to this calm assessment with growing relief hed wondered how the gryphons were going to manage for urthos plan called for a second gate to be built from the kaledain evacuation site and the gryphon families to be sent farther out from there the gryphons were huge eaters and it was doubtful that they would be able to stay anywhere that there was a large concentration of any other species all of the kaledain clans for instance but if kleshya was basically volunteering to be sent off beyond the rest that would solve the problem neatly are you certain you want to do this he asked lionwind shrugged im not certain we want to do anything at the moment he replied we dont want to run but we dont want to stay here to be slaughtered either wed like it best if urtho could suddenly produce a magic weapon that would eliminate maar and all his troops without harming anyone or anything else but short of the goddess working a miracle that isnt going to happen so this is our best choice and if urtho will allow it well take it im certain hell allow it amberdrake said and rubbed his eyes again as lionwinds face blurred and went out of focus ill take care of it lionwind rose and leaned over the table amberdrake rubbed his eyes again but they wouldnt stop blurring is there anything else i can do he asked blinking rapidly that didnt help either onlyget some rest lionwind answered leaning closer thats your clan chiefs order i cant theres too much to do he objectedas lionwind reached across and touched his forehead and only then did he remember belatedly that lionwind was also a mindhealer fully capable of imposing his will on the most recalcitrant the best attack is the one no one sees coming kestrachern lionwind quoted and chuckled as sleep snatched him up in surprisingly gentle talons and carried him away the six permanent gates were enormous quite large enough to accommodate the biggest of the floating land barges urtho had constructed them using fusedstone arches and tied each of them into its own node to power it only urtho had ever accomplished the construction of a gate that did not require the internal knowledge and resources of a single mage to target and power the gate only urtho had uncovered the secret of keeping such a gate stable of all of his secrets that was probably the one that maar wanted the most he had for the first time in many years left the tower briefly to journey through one of his own creations and set up a second permanent gate at that evacuation point this one he targeted deep in the western wilderness to a lovely valley he himself had once called home the gryphon families all those gryphons that were not fighters and those who were injured had all been sent there now the kaledain clan kleshya of all the clans the only one not named for a totemic animal but called simply the spirit clan slowly filed through the first gate to follow them he could not have said truthfully that he had a favorite clan but of all of them kleshya held the greatest number of his favorite kaledain lionwind the clan chief was one of the wisest men he knew with a wisdom that did not fit with the smooth youthful face and the nightblack hair that hung in two thick braids on either side of his face lionwinds father and mother had both been shaman perhaps that explained it or perhaps as lionwind himself had once claimed only half in jest he was an old soul the clan chiefnot then the chief but nearly as wisehad been of great comfort to amberdrake when the young kestrachern first joined his ancestral clan he continued to be of comfort on the rare occasions that amberdrake would permit anyone to help him lionwind had been first through the gate riding his tall rangy warmare he had not looked in any direction but forward although he surely knew he would never see the tower again and likely would not see many of those he left behind he had made his farewells as had all the kaledain and it was not the kaledain way to linger over such things long farewells give time for the enemy to aim that was what lionwind said to urtho as he clasped his hand and the words were sure to become a kaledain proverb although there was no enemy here kleshya followed that precept now urtho watched them go hiding his pain beneath a calm smile he did not know if he would ever see any of them again all he could be certain of was that he had sent them into a safer place than this one and now that the gryphons were in full control of their own destinies he could at least be certain that no matter what maar undid of his there would always be gryphons in the world if maar conquered the tower they would scatter using their mobility to take them beyond his reach so something of mine will survive in spite of everything that maar can do odd that it should be the gryphons creatures that his contemporaries had considered eccentric toys he had always had faith in them though of everything he had created they were his favorites he had given them the ability to do great good it only remained to see if they would fulfill that promise as well as they had fulfilled all the rest the last kleshya herdsman driving the last of the clan herds under a great cloud of dust passed through the gate the gate sensed that there was no one else waiting to cross it and the view of the crowd of kaledain at the terminus faded as the gate shut itself down to conserve power the space inside the arch went to blackthen showed only what was on the other side of the physical arch only then did urtho realize that he was not alone amberdrake stood behind and to one side of him staring at the nowblank gate the kestrachern was not wearing any of his elaborate robes or costumes only a pair of breeches and a sleeved tunic in a soft faded blue his hair had been tied up into a tail at the nape of his neck and he wore a headband of blue that matched his tunic urtho regarded him with a touch of surprise he had thought that it was understood that amberdrake would go with his own clan the rest of the kestrachern all had their assignments in the evacuation and as soon as they had completed those tasks they would head for their own evacuation sites he was not needed as their leader anymore and it was unlikely that anyone would have leisure in the coming days and weeks for the ministrations of a kestrachern however expert amberdrake seemed to divine urthos thoughts from his expression he raised one elegant eyebrow in a gesture so graceful it could only have been unconscious youre wondering why im still here he said urtho nodded winterhart is still here shes the trondiirn of the fighting gryphon wings of the fifth and i am not going to leave her alone in a camp that still holds her former lover there was a note of steel in his voice that was new to urthoor perhaps it had been there all along and amberdrake had simply hidden it better skan is still here and zhaneel and gesten to serve the two of them they are all the family i have urtho allowed a bit of steel to creep into his own voice i said no exceptions and you are not excused from that you heard it clearly enough kestrachern amberdrake you do not belong here i am a healer urtho you can verify that with lady cinnabar if you wish i volunteered for her group pain and fear shadowed amberdrakes eyes for a moment and urtho knew why and marveled at his bravery he knew all about amberdrakes past he knew how much it would cost amberdrake to work with the healers every waking hourhow vulnerable he was to losing control of his empathic abilitieshow he feared that pain physical and mental more than anything else yet here he was facing his worst fear in order to remain with his odd and tenuous family urtho bowed his head a little in acknowledgment of courage i stand corrected healer amberdrake you have every right to be here the lines at the corners of amberdrakes eyes softened a bit and urtho decided that he would ease another of amberdrakes worries there is a single mage still working with shaiknam and the sixth at his own request i approved his petition for field duty myself i am told his name is conn levas he let his own eyebrow rise just a little i believe the sixth is currently away on assignment urtho turned then not waiting for thanks already he had turned his mind to the next task and so probably had amberdrake long farewells give the enemy time to aim and they did not dare give the enemy time for anything seventeen aubris wings ached from shoulder to tip they burned with exhaustion on the downstroke of each wingbeat the heavy damp air in this particular valley always meant difficult flying but that was not why he was tired he had been flying scout for the fifth since dawn and it only lacked a few hours until sunset he had flown a double shift already and by the time he finished long after dark it would be a triple at least all the innocents were far beyond the reach of any disaster now the last of the noncombatants including the kestrachern had passed through the gates to their new locations several days ago and as urtho had expected there was steady traffic between the tower and the evacuation points but not in the opposite direction the word that any noncombatant caught on the tower side in an emergency would have to fend for himself kept the evacuees in their new homes aubri missed seeing the youngsters missed the sound of fledglings playingbut he would rather miss these things than have them at the tower lairs and at risk one slaughtered youngster was one too manyand he had seen the pathetic corpses of considerably more than one in the time he had been fighting for urtho his chest muscles complained growing tight and stiff from builtup fatigue poisons and he knew that by the time he landed hed be one sore gryphon at least on this second shift he wasnt fighting makaar this was all simple coordination scouting making sure that the sixth and the first were where they were supposed to be so that the mages with the fifth didnt hit their own troops with friendly fire huh friendly fire isnt thats what the kaledain say anyway maars generals hadnt pressed an attack on this point all day holding a purely defensive line and shaiknam hadnt made any offensive moves a reflection of the inertia here for the past two or three days both forces glared at each other from the opposite sides of a wide shallow ravine but the only attacking going on was from little presents the mages dropped which were easily deflected by their opposite numbers the situation was a stalemate at least here nowait he caught a hint of movement through the heavy haze somethings going on down there aubri circled higher to get a better perspective on the situation so far as he had been told shaiknam wasnt supposed to order any kind of attack unless an opportunity too ripe to ignore arose and aubri hadnt seen any evidence of that was this just false movement a little shuffling in place to make the enemy think that shaiknam was about to press an attack he pumped harder gaining more height and looked down half a minute later at first he couldnt make out anything at all then the haze parted a little giving him a clearer view of shaiknams troops his wingstrokes faltered with shock and he sideslipped a little before catching and steadying himself in the air demonsblood what does hewhyhe cant be that stupid can he shaiknams troops had parted right down the middle and were pulling back leaving the easiest place to cross the ravine wide open this would have been a classic move giving the enemy a place to penetrate and then closing companies in on either side of him while the troops to the rear cut his forces off from the rest the only problem was that there were no other companies in place and no time to get any in place shaiknam had not been positioned directly protecting one of the two vital passes but from here maars forces could easily get to one of those vital passes hes bluffing maars commanders wont believe this and he knows it hes just giving them something to occupy them he couldnt hover the best he could do was to glide in a tight circle panting with weariness and disbelief even as aubri watched the two groups that had pulled back moved on in a clear retreat and maars army marched across the ravine and into urthos territory with all the calm precision of a closeorder drill what in hell is going on here now he wished he was one of those gryphons with any kind of mindspeech if only he could tell someone what was happening by the time he lumbered through the sky to a messagerelay it would be too late to stop the advance damn its already too late iiicant stop it maybe id better find out who ordered this thats what skan would do has shaiknam lost what little mind he used to have or have his troops somehow been sent false orders aubri dropped through the haze well behind the line of advancement and landed just outside of shaiknams allbutdeserted command post he got out of sight just in case someone from the other side was watching under cover of a grove of trees right behind the command tent predictable he thought savagely trust shaiknam ignore the fact that someone can sneak up to your tent in favor of the fact that you get to sit in the shade all day i hope therere red ants in those trees biting on his fat behind hed wondered why there seemed to be so little activity going on around the command tent but hed figured it was simply because there was no activity along this section of the front lines now i know maybe either shaiknams been assassinated or replaced or or something worse has been going on he tried to emulate skan blessing zhaneel for all those hours on the obstacle course as he slithered on his belly through the underbrush the lessons were second nature now shove the branches aside with your beak close your eyes and let them slide over your neck and your tightfolded wings creep forward with forefeet until you were as stretchedout you could get then inch the hindfeet up until your back hunched and start over again vary the intervals and your steps make no patterns and why the hell arent there guards around the tent after what happened to farle because shaiknam isnt there or because he knows he doesnt need guards or because he has no guards left he had concentrated so hard on his stealthy approach that he didnt keep track of how far hed come the buff canvas of the tent suddenly loomed up in a wall from out of the underbrush a few talonlengths in front of his beak just as he heard voices coming from inside well theres someone in there anyway he closed his eyes and listened whoever was in there murmured rather than speaking in normal conversational tones as if they wanted to be certain they werent overheard from outside going very well my lord whispered an unctuous voice and maar is keeping his side of the bargain by the time judeth of the fifth realizes what has happened maars troops will have the pass well good that was shaiknam all right aubri had heard his whining tones often enough to be certain of that once he has the pass we can close behind him and no one will know we let him through his mages can set up gates to pour troops down onto the plains and i can surrender with no one the wiser my command and holdings will remain intact and without you levas i would not have been able to contact maars commander and bring all this to pass levas conn levas wasnt that the mage winterhart used to thank you my lord the unctuous voice was back i always make certain to be on the winning side and i was pleased to find you are a commander as pragmatic as i shaiknam laughed i have another task for you if you think youre up to it urtho may yet be able to pull off a miracle he has a disconcerting habit of doing so but without urtho there was a certain archness to the mages reply that held aubri frozen i am a mercenary my lord you knew that when we made our bargain there will be an additional price for additional services shaiknam laughed very softly name it he said as arrogantly as if he had all the resources of all the world to call upon whatever coin you choose twentyfour thousand silver and the coin of bodies my lord the mages voice already cold grew icy two bodies to be precise and both still alive and in a condition to be amusing to me the trondiirn winterhart and the kestrachern amberdrake done and done shaiknam replied instantly neither are combatants they should be easy to subdue cheap at the price you could have sold your services more dearly mercenary their value is peculiar to me aubri could bear it no longer ihave to stop them now he lunged at the tent wall slashing it open with his sharp talons back agape to bite the spines of one or both of them in half and tumbled ignominiously to the ground unable to move even his eyes he landed with bonebruising impact right at the feet of general shaiknam skidding a little on the canvas of the tent floor if he could have struggled he would have but there wasnt a muscle of his body that would obey him his heart continued to beat and his lungs to breathe but that was all the movement he was allowed hed been the recipient of a spell of paralysis of course idiot conn levas is a mage idiot how could you have been so incredibly stupid general shaiknam looked down at him with mild interest in his catlike eyes then searched his pockets for a moment then he turned to conn levas and flipped him a coin the mage caught it deftly and pocketed it shaiknams serene round face produced a smile that went no further than his lips payment for additional services he said his voice ripe with satisfaction indeed my lord conn levas replied as i expect payment on completion of your other task shaiknam shrugged and his eyes reflected his boredom they have no interest for me i will see that they are captured unharmed it should not be terribly difficult what ofthismy lord a new voice but another one that aubri recognized garber shaiknams secondincommand spoke from out of aubris lineofsight but there was no doubt of where he was a toe prodded him in the ribs waking pain in his chest muscles i can dispose of him if you like conn levas began but shaiknam held up a hand to forestall him no he said there is a use for him maar is rather fond of gryphons i believe we should send him this one as a gift in earnest of many more to come he waved at the unseen garber package this up for me would you and deliver it to general polden with my compliments to the emperor so the emperor enjoys the antics of these creatures conn said with interest he does shaiknam replied he smiled down at aubri the gryphon gasped as the ice of horror and the chill of pure fear swept over him i hope you can learn some new tricks beast he said sweetly other than playing dead dance for instance or better yet beg make certain to learn beg the longer you entertain the emperor the longer you will live or so im told urtho flung a plate across the room it shattered against the wall but did nothing to help relieve his feelings gods he cried the cadre of hertasi and human messengers ignored him there were no messengerbirds in camp anymore urtho had not wanted to leave these smallest and most helpless of his creatures behind even by accident they had been the first through the gate to go with kleshya and the gryphons urtho paced the side of the map table issuing orders as fast as hertasi and humans could take them doing his best not to seize handfuls of hair and start yanking them out by the roots what in the name of all the gods had happened how had maars men gotten past the defensive line why hadnt anyone noticed until theyd already taken the pass of korbast and had set up a gate to bring more troops in never mind its happened now deal with it this was his worst nightmare come true the tower still full of things he hadnt gotten out yet the traps not yet set and the enemy pouring down into the plain behind his own lines already the sixth and the third had been cut off from the rest and from retreat they would have to fend for themselves judeth was bringing the fifth in but no one knew for certain about the rest they have mages they can gate here they can even gate straight to their evacuation sites theyll be all right i have to believe that he sent the last of his messengers off on their errands with orders to send the healers and other support personnel to their gates and forced himself to stop pacing he clutched the edge of the table and stared down at it as if staring at it fiercely enough would make the situation reverse itself sir a hertasi scrambled in the door all out of breath the mage conn levas is here from the sixth he started and turned toward the door just as conn levas pushed his way past the lizard he looked as if he had personally fought his way through all of maars troopers to reach the tower his robes were filthy torn and bloodstained his hair matted down to his head with sweat go urtho told the breathless hertasi find me skan and bring him here ill need him in a moment the hertasi let the door swing shut behind conn levas as urtho took three steps toward the mercenary mage what happened he cried eager only to hear what had gone wrong too late he saw conns hand move saw an empty bag in it and felt the stinging of a hundred thousand tiny needles in his face and hands in every bit of flesh left exposed by his clothing he brushed at his face frantically while conn levas laughed that wont help the mercenary said very softly as urtho tried to cry out for help and realized that he couldnt do more than whisper miranda thorns urtho very potent quite impossible to magic away a little invention of my new employer i believe you might have seen their effects once or twice mages never do consider that someone might attack them physically urthos knees crumpled beneath him he managed to stagger back enough that he landed in the chair behind him before his legs gave out altogether his entire body tingled burned twitched uncontrollably his lips moved but nothing emerged strange swirls of light and color invaded his vision the furniture stretched and warped conns head floated about a foot above his body as the mercenary mage approached and the head looked down at him malevolently its a poison of course the head said each word emerging from his mouth in flowing script and encapsulated inside a brightlycolored bubble you should enjoy the effects i knew that all the defenses of the tower are keyed to you of course as well as the node beneath it and i knew that if i slew you outright i would die before i had a chance to escape i expect shaiknam knew that too and was counting on not needing to fulfill his part of the bargain but youll live long enough for me to get clear and hell just have to keep his word hmm urthos chest nearly burst with the need to howl in anguish but all that he could manage was a pathetic whimper conn levas head floated around the room for a moment then suddenly produced a new body as the old one faded away a large furry body of an eyesearing pink urtho shuddered as the fur turned into spines like those of a hedgehog then conn shook his body and all those spines shot forward piercing urthos limbs with excruciating pain the furniture grew tentacles and the walls opened up into pulsing starscapes i see you cant answer the mercenary said silkily no matter he turned to gothat is his head turned his body remained the way it had been and began walking backward toward the door with every step he took bleeding wounds appeared in the floor and it felt to urtho as if the wounds were to his flesh he whimpered again and conns head turned back oh one more thing the mage said casually in case you might have worried about that little misborn gryphon you named so charmingly kechara i offered her a nice bit of rabbit and she followed me out to the emperors new lines i decided to make certain that shaiknam would keep his word by ensuring that the emperor knows my name and what he owes to me shes my gift to maar to pave the way for my new rank and position i expect to be a duke at the very least kechara oh gods his anguish translated into more whimpers and streams of blood began to flow from his open hands conn laughed and turned to open the door which warped and deformed as he touched it becoming a blood clot lodged in an open wound the walls throbbed in time with conns laughter but the door opened before conn and there was someone out there skan hurried after the frantic hertasi talons clicking on the stone of the floor aubri missing the sixth gone silent why did you leave that lying bastard alone with urtho vikteren scolded the little lizard as they ran toward the strategy room he told me to get you the hertasi wailed caught in a dilemma between what he had been ordered to do and what vikteren thought he should have done i couldnt get you and stay there at the same time leave it vikteren skan snapped its donelets just hope that the young mage sprinted for the door and shoved it open in the surprised face of conn levas the mercenary mage recovered quickly from his surprise and backed up a pace when skan loomed up behind vikteren from his greater height skan could see right past conn and spotted urtho clearly in terrible pain collapsed into a chair in the corner conn followed his glance paled and began babbling urtho he said he said he wasnt feeling well the strain but skans hearing was better than a humans and the word urtho was forcing through spittlefrothed lips was poison skans vision clouded with the red of rage he saw conns hands move and he didnt hesitate the black gryphon lashed out with an open talon and caught the mage across the throat tearing it out in a spray of blood his second blow the backhanded return of the talonstrike flung the mercenarys body across the room to slam against the table with the wet crack of a snapping spine there the body of conn levas lay atop the tiny space of land that was still theirs blood pumping down onto the map flooding the representation of the tower and the plain around it with sticky scarlet vikteren had headed straight for urtho as skan stalked in through the doorway with every feather and hair erect in battleanger poison the young mage said shortly his face flushed and his voice tight with grief mirandathorns very rare no antidote the bastard probably had enough in his pockets to hit us both too thats what he was reaching for when you got him the hertasi gasped and scrambled off presumably to fetch help skan only heard and heeded one thing no antidote he roared so that urtho whimpered and vikteren winced what do you mean no antidote skan i cant change the facts vikteren shouted back theres no antidote its something maar created as an assassinationtool and we havent seen more than three victims since the war started all we can do is buy him some time and counteract some of the effects do it skan snapped spreading out his bloodstained claws over the body of his creator and friend invoking every tiny bit of magery he had he opened himself to urtho found the places in his mind that the miranda had muddled bringing hallucinations and pain and joined with vikteren to help urtho straighten the mental paths and banish those symptoms he fought with every bit of his grief and rage every atom of energy and still it was not enough he saw for himself that vikteren was right the poison replicated itself within urthos body spreading like some evil sentient disease and with every passing moment it destroyed a little more of urthos lifeforce corroding it away inexorably at last his mageenergies exhausted he dropped his outstretched claw and opened the eyes he did not realize he had closed vikteren supported urtho in his chair and the face that looked up at skan was sane again the evacuation urtho whispered harshly get mehealers i have to hold on vikteren looked up into skans puzzled face i think hes keyed some kind of destructive spells into himselfif he leaves the tower the place is going to go unstable and if you thought what happened with that gate at jerlag pass was impressive the young mage left the rest unsaid leaves the tower or dies he means and there must be two dozen permanent gates here not to mention the tower itself and everything still in it the destructive potential staggered him anyone still here would be obliterated by the result pulverized to dust the noise of running feet from the hallway made him turn sharply ready to attack again but these were friends the hertasi had returned with tamsin and three more senior healers who squeezed through the door as one not cinnabar he must have sent her through the gate while he could we know tamsin said shortly taking vikterens place at urthos side well buy him all the time we can skan did not move out of the way the healers shoved past him ignoring him as if he had been an inconveniently placed piece of furniture he started to say something but vikteren motioned to him to remain silent tears trickled down the mages face and his shoulders shook but he didnt produce so much as a stifled sob to distract the healers from their work skan himself shook from beak to talons with the effort of repressing a keen of grief he closed his eyes and clamped his beak shut flexing his talons into the wood of the floor feeling it splinter beneath them and wishing he could kill conn levas a hundred more times someone tapped him on the shoulder startling him making him jump his eyes snapped open and focused on tamsins face not more than a finger away from his beak weve done all anyone can the healer said in a voice gone flat and dull with sorrow and exhaustion he needs to tell you something the four healers staggered out the door holding each other in pairs and not once looking back vikteren still stood beside urthos chair tears falling steadily down his cheeks and dropping onto the breast of his tunic get all the gryphons you can find one of the healers told the hertasi who waited trembling beside the door hes going to try to get everything open that he can before the end and he wants them to take all they can carry the hertasi looked up at the healer for a moment too griefstricken to reply the man spoke again knowledge will always be the best weapon against tyrants he choked out urtho said that and at that the hertasi ran to carry out the orders skantheres a weapon urthos voice was the merest whisper but his words were clear enough never meant to use it butnow maar is coming help meweapons room vikteren helped him to his feet and got under one shoulder while skan supported him on the other side they both knew where the weapons room was and that it was locked to be unsealed by urthos presence alone they carried him across the strategy room and to the door across the hallway urtho had no more strength than a newborn kitten he fell against the door to the weapons room to open it and directed them both to a box on a stand in the far corner of the room itslike the box i gave zhaneel but bigger got one on the tower roof dissolves the bondsof spells take it to maar when you can trigger it same thing that happened at jerlag urtho did not look at skan the gryphon had the feeling that perhaps he couldnt bear to made it for gryphons stick your talonsin the holes all at once skan saw then that what he had taken for decorative perforations in the side were actually holes made to fit a gryphons talons in a pattern of two on each side to fit the twoforward two backcurved talons of the foreclaws you havea count of a hundredto get away urtho finished better havea gate handy and closed fast the mage of silence tried to smile and coughed instead go he whispered fiercely when the coughing fit was over go get maar later survive now skan lifted the box from its stand and saw that it had a carrystrap meant to go around the neck he pulled the strap over his head awkwardly and turned back to the mage urthos eyes were clouded with pain and his lips formed the word go beak clamped down on the deathkeen skan backed out of the room but before he left he saw vikteren helping urtho to the next door to be unlocked and the first of the combatgryphons arrived to carry away what he could knowledge will always be the best weapon against tyrants unable to hold it back any longer skan fled down the hallway and into the sunset his deathkeen echoing through the tower as he ran winterhart flung books and packages through the gate whenever there wasnt someone actually traversing it from the pile that formed as the gryphons brought them to her her arms and back one long pulled muscle there would be some time after urtho succumbed before everything went dangerously unstable they should all have time to get out all but urtho her eyes stung with tears but she would mourn him later when they were all temporarily at least safe somewhere on the other side of this gate was another trondiirn pitching packages through the gate to kleshya the farther away this dangerous knowledge went the better off they would all be she did not bother to think about how they would continue this war or even if they would be able to regroup the important thing now was simply to escape to live and to worry about the rest later other gryphons too exhausted to be of any use staggered up to and through the gate while she paused in her labor humans and hertasi tervardi and kyree and dyheli also presented themselves for passage burdened with everything they could carry there were fewer of them now than there had been as combatants staggered in from the field they grabbed what they could and headed for their evacuationgates and by now virtually everyone who could make it back had that left only the few faithful like her and amberdrake who would stay until the bitter end to help save as much as they could from the wreckage she still did not know why urtho was reportedly dying although she trusted the news it could not have been something simple like heart failure or the healers would be able to save him had maar somehow penetrated their defenses with a mageattack another pair of exhausted gryphons and a pack of mudstained kyree staggered up to the gate and she stopped long enough to let them pass but before she could pick up another package from the pile someone else appeared a human this time but he headed for her and not the gate and it took her a moment to recognize amberdrake his face was absolutely blank with shock and he was as pale as snow she leapt for him as he stumbled and started to fall catching him and holding him upright what she began i just saw skan he replied dully i just said goodbye to him something in the way he phrased that made her freeze goodbye as inpermanently we have to get zhaneel out of here now to kleshya he continued numbly we cant let her find out skan is gone or shell try to follow him urtho gave him a weapon and told him to use it to stop maar skan is determined that urtho meant him to do it now winterhart realized that she was clutching her hand in her hair at the side of her head only when it began to hurt she let go slowly couldnt you stop him she cried involuntarily i tried he wouldnt listen amberdrake stared at her eyes blank and blind he told me that shaiknam garber and conn levas went over to the enemy a cold ring of terror constricted her throat cutting off her gasp but he said he caught conn levas right after hed poisoned urtho with miranda thorns and he tore the traitors throat out by then it was too late there was nothing they could do for urtho but buy him time she sensed his pain as if it were her ownif she wanted to mourn for urtho he would have ten times the grief to deal withand ten times that for skan illwait there she is zhaneel came hurrying up with a bundle of books in her beak and another clutched to her chest running on three legs with her wings spread to help her balance winterhart grabbed the edge of her wing before she could put her burden down zhaneel she cried i need someone on the kleshya side to make certain all this is carried as far away from the gate as possible we dont know how unstable these things are zhaneel nodded and darted through the gate without waiting for further explanation you go after her winterhart ordered ill follow you as soon as i get the last of this stuff across at least she had something to do something to keep her from thinking are you all right amberdrake asked suddenly a little life coming into his eyes she knew what he meant conn is dead conn is a traitor and hes dead she paused and collected herself examined her heart its best that skan took care of the problem she said firmly looking deeply into amberdrakes eyes so that he would know she meant what she said if he hadntid have done so but with less elegance myself beneath all the pain all the grief she saw a moment of relief it was enough for now she shoved him gently toward the gate ill see you on the other side she said take care of her he took a last long look at the tower then turned and stumbled blindly across the threshold she picked up another package as soon as he was clear and pitched it across skan knew exactly who he was looking forthe kaledain adept snowstar the person urtho himself had appointed as the chief of all the mages he knew snowstar knew that the man was truly second only to urtho in knowledge and ability and knew one other crucial fact snowstar had been working with urtho long before the king collapsed snowstar was one of the mages that urtho had with him when cinnabar called them all to the palace that terrible morning snowstar knew the palace as well as skan did which meant that snowstar unlike many of the other mages could build a gate there and maar was at the palace after three false tries he located snowstar at the tower stables turning away from the last empty stall an odd place for a mage perhaps unless the mage was kaledain and the horses here were the precious warsteeds skan grinned savagely to himself snowstar had not expected an ambushand doubtless intended to head straight for the kaledain gate from here hot on the heels of his beloved equines there would be a brief delay as he turned skan stood in the aisle between the stalls and spread his wings to block his way the mage looked up at him blankly skandranon what i need a favor skan said quietly but with an edge to his voice and you dont have a choice i need a gate to the old palace and i need it now snowstars eyes went wide and he shook his head with disbelief are you out of your mind he cried putting out his hands to shove skan out of the way theres no time for this kind of nonsense we have to get out of here there is time and you will do this skan hissed i have a prrresssent to deliver to maar from urtho snowstar blanched and his eyes dropped to the box around skans neck as if he had only just this moment noticed that it was there skan was gambling on a number of things the black gryphon was known as urthos confidant snowstar should assume that urthos request was an order and that it was not meant to be implemented at some far future date but now snowstar knew very well what kind of shape urtho was in he would not risk a single precious moment by going to urtho or sending a messenger to confirm what skan had just told him he might even assume that urtho had ordered skan to find snowstar knowing that the adept would be one of the few at full strength and capable of building a gate that far away snowstars pupils widened and contracted as all those thoughtsand likely a few moreraced through his mind right he said then still pale but grimly determined i wont gate you into the palace itself if that is agreeable to you i have no idea who or what maar has stationed where i could gate you into the servants quarters only to find out that hes got it full of soldiers or traps but theres one place i know very well where you wont find much opposition and the little you find i suspect you can silence the stables skan breathed amazed at snowstars quick thinking exactly snowstar shoved at skan again but this time to make some room to work and skan gladly moved over ill position the gate to come out of the last stall in the back its a big loosebox partitioned off from the rest with floortoceiling walls and with no outside windows we never put a horse in it unless it was one that was so sick it needed dark and quiet no grooms are likely to change that it sounded perfect and skan nodded put it up and bring it down once im through he said decisively then get yourself out of here what about snowstar began then saw the look in skans eyes the rage skan held bottled up inside must have been blazing snowstar grew just a bit paler then turned away raised his hands and began the adept had had decades of practice to refine and hone his craft the gate went up with scarcely a ripple in mageenergies skan did not even wait to thank him clutching his precious burden with one foreclaw he dove through to the other side this is poorly planned stupid gryphon but there isnt time urtho cant die without knowing maars dead and gone you dont do helplessness well at all and if you cant save urtho you can still do something he landed feet skidding a little in the straw in the dark and empty loosebox as snowstar had guessed it had not been used in so long that the straw covering the stone floor smelled musty and was full of dust he suppressed a sneeze and moved cautiously to the door he listened carefully all senses straining against the darkness odd lots of voices and the sound of something struggling what did they have penned up in here some kind of feral stallion are you sure thats going to hold the beast the voice was doubtful and very frightened i tell you orders or no orders if that thing breaks free dont think im going to stand here and try to stop it the crack of hand on flesh and an exclamation of pain youll do as youre told and like it coward a second voice growled if i tell you to stand there and let the thing take your arm off youll damned well do it not a stallion then a bull some new monster maar just dreamed up a muttered sullen curse the sound of spitting heavy boots walking away more struggles chains rattling muffled thuds more mutters a stream of illwishes directed against the second voice his family and all his progeny to come the thin high wail of a young gryphon faaaather a voice he knew kechara he pushed against the stalldoor and it swung wide while he stepped out and mantled his eyes locked with those of one poor spottyfaced groom clutching a pitchfork in one hand a bloody rag held to his mouth with the other the boy couldnt have been more than sixteen he took one look at skan went pale as milk and fainted dead away skan stepped over him and looked into the stall hed been guarding there were two canvascovered bundles there one thrashing one whimpering the whimpering bundle was the smaller and the whimpers were definitely in kecharas voice how did shenever mind conn levas or shaiknam or both quickly he squeezed into the stall but he did not free the little one not yet the larger bundle of the two also smelled of blood and of gryphon and it was a scent that he thought he recognized hold still he whispered its skan the bundle stilled immediately he took a moment to examine the situation chains wrapped around the bundle but they were not fastened to the stall itself if he could get the gryphon inside to bend a little he might be able to slip one loop off and that would give him enough slack to undo the whole thing without having to unlock it can you bend this way he whispered harshly pushing down on what he thought was the back of the gryphons head it must have been the place bent over in response to his pressure and he was able to work the loop of chain off as he had hoped once he had the slack he needed two more loops followed and he worked the entire chain down with the squirming assistance of the gryphon inside now he could slit the canvas bag and see if the contents were who he thought it was he ripped open the canvas with a slash of a talon and a head popped outa head covered in an enormous version of a falcons hood with the beak tied firmly shut he pulled off the bindings and the beak opened damn it skan aubri croaked in a whisper no louder than his had been you took your own sweet time getting here it took both of them to convince kechara that she had to be quiet but for once maars men had done them all a favor they had cut off all the primaries on both her wings and aubris and in kecharas case that meant she wasnt tripping over her own awkward wings kechara wasnt at all clear on how she had gotten there but the picture in her mind projected strongly was of a blurred conn levas offering something that smelled lovely skan assured her that he had gone away and that skan had made certain he wouldnt come back not in this lifetime anyway aubri was a lot clearer on what had happened to him and kept his explanation down to a terse couple of sentences he only wanted to know one thing urtho he asked with a sideways glance to see if kechara was listening skan closed his eyes letting his grief show for just the briefest of moments and shook his head aubris beak clamped shut and when skan opened his own eyes the broadwings eyes were blazing as red with madness as any goshawks i got conn levas skan said around the lump of rage and grief in his own throat this will take care of maar if we can get it to him he tilted his head to one side i have to admiti was told that id have a count of a hundred to get away and then this thing will make jerlag look like a campfire he shook his head if you can think of any way you can get yourself and kechara out of range aubris pupils dilated and he produced a harsh bark of a laugh on clipped wings i dont think so besides all i ever asked was to go down fighting im sorry about the little one but this is going to be clean right he nodded as clean as fire and i can still send you both into the light if all seems hopeless as youve done too many times beforeurtho why must we feel these burdens why well aubri rumbled you need me bet we can even find a way kecharall be useful and if it gets maar aubris savage grin and the scrape of his talons on the stone told the rest andah demonsblood skan you always were the luckiest son of a vulture i ever saw your luck youll find a way out for us ill take my chances with you skan let out the breath he had been holding in well he said lightly that was the hard part now the easy part which is aubri asked as kechara gave a breathy squeal of glee and pounced on something she stuffed it in her mouth and looked up innocently the tail of a rat hanging out of one corner of her beak for a heartbeat before she swallowed and it vanished skan looked cautiously around the corner the doors to the stable stood open wide and the apparentlydeserted stableyard stretched between them and the palace kitchens oh its nothing much he replied offhandedly just getting into the palace and the throne room the last tower door had been opened there were still books and devices here urtho wished he could save but the vital things had been carried off he had persuaded vikteren and the rest to leave now there was only the small matter of hanging on living every possible second for every second meant more time to ensure that all of his people who could would reach safety the tower echoed with the whisper of air through doors long locked and the occasional thud of something falling echoing through stone corridors suddenly more empty than imagination could bear in all of his life urtho had never felt so alone he had never expected to die alone much less like this at least the mages and healers had taken all the pain blocked the hallucinations and the convulsions and left him only with growing weakness he was so tired so very very tired no he had to fight it to stay conscious awake every heartbeat was vital all we have done and all i have learned and i cannot slow the progress of my own death by even a candlemark he had never thought much about revenge but now he burned with longing for it revengeno i want to protect my people my children and when the tower goes i want it to be something more than the end i want it to mean something to accomplish some purpose he had always hoped if it came to that he would be able to lure maar or at least some chief mages of maars into the towerturnedtrap hed planned for that all along a desperate gambit that if nothing else would keep maar so busy cleaning up the damage that his children and his people would be able to get far beyond maars reach or ability to find now when he died the tower would die in an expanding ring of sound and light and it would be no more than the most impressive funeral pyre the world had ever seen wait a moment something stirred under the morass the poison had made of his mind an idea and a hope maar cannot know that conn levas succeeded what would happen if i challenged him there was a permanent gate a small one big enough only for one human at a time not more than a room away it would take no effort at all to open it a moment of clear thought and it could be set for the palace the throne room urtho had used it to step directly from his own audience chamber into the kingsan impressive bit of nonsense that never failed to leave foreigners gaping and a little frightened that was how he had gotten to the palace the night that cinnabar had summoned him he had opened a larger gate elsewhere for skan he hadnt been certain what the effect of trying to squeeze through a toosmall gate might be and that had not been the moment to find out the odds are good that hell be in the throne room waiting to hear from his army what if i opened that gate and challenged him to come over a fierce and feral joy flooded him and for the first time he understood how his gryphons felt at the kill iopen the gate he cant fight me through the gate he has to come over i close it he cant reopen it while i keep him busy and by the time he gets his own gate up im dead and so is he if i were alive i would never consider itbut i am dead already that terrible joy gave him the strength to rise to his feet stagger into the next room and take his place on his own modest version of a throne hardly a throne at all really just a large comfortable chair raised off the floor on a platform about half a stairstep high he had never seen any reason to build a dazzling audience chamber everything in the small room was made of old timemellowed wood on the few occasions that he had needed to impress someone hed transformed the whole place with illusions much cheaper and much easier to clean he gasped with effort as he stumbled up onto the platform and lowered himself down into his throne the exertion left him dizzy and disoriented for a moment he closed his eyes and when he opened them again there was a faint haze of rainbow around everything the hallucinations or whats left of them i dont have much time if this doesnt workat least i tried and skan can make his own try someday that in itself comforted him a little skan would get to safety plot and plan with the sharpest minds of the kaledain and make his own attempt maar had not and would not win not while there was a single gryphon or kaledain left to oppose him he stared fixedly at the ornamental arch across the room from him an arch built right into the wall that seemed only to frame a shallow purposeless nook he wrapped his mind and his fading powers around the mageenergies woven into wood and stone beneath and twisted within the frame of the arch the blank wall writhed then turned into a swirling haze of colors like oil on water for just the barest instant then the colors darkened steadiedand urtho looked across the leagues into the throne room of the palace of high king leodhan a massive room constructed of six different kinds and colors of the rarest marbles a place that seemed vast even when it was packed full of courtiers now it held only one man but that man had presence enough to fill it maar stared fixedly at the gate that had suddenly opened up in his throne room a gate he clearly had no notion ever existed he had not been born a handsome man but over the years he had sculpted his body into the image of a young god his squarejawed face with precisely chiseled cheekbones and sensuous mouth framed with a mane of hair of dark copper topped a body that would be the envy of any warrior in his ranks all that remained of the old maar were the eyes small shrewd and of an odd yellowgreen kiyamvir maar urtho said genially it has been a very long time maar recovered his poise much more quickly than urtho would have credited him for urtho he leaned back in his throne a real throne much more impressive than the alabaster bench the king had used this one might not be solid gold but it certainly looked as though it was and the single redblack ruby over maars head carved in the shape of the head of a snarling cat was twice the size of the largest such stone urtho had ever seen have you called on me to offer your surrender urtho smiled gently not at all he countered i recall that you used to enjoy a gamble i am offering you just that maar barked his laughter you and what have you to offer me that i cannot take urtho waved a gesture that made him dizzy again why this im sure you realize that ive had as much carried away as i couldbut i am sure you also realize that there is far more than could ever be carried away im sure you also realize that what i did at jerlag i can do here maars face darkened and his lips formed a soundless snarl however urtho held up a finger to forestall any reply im proposing a challenge the prizethe tower and everything thats left if you kill me i obviously cannot trigger the destructive spells and lets hope he hasnt figured out as conn levas did that it isnt a spell that does the destruction its the lack of one you have the tower and everything you want if on the other hand i kill youwell i suspect that your underlings will immediately begin fighting among themselves and leave me and mine alone the bickering is inevitable and i will have protected my own maar frowned but he was obviously intrigued you underestimate what i have done here urtho i took a weak land torn apart by internal quarreling and wrecked by the greed of shortsighted idiots who thought no further than their own fat profits i forged it into an empire that will live long beyond me and i intend to live a very long time what makes you think i would risk all that for your stupid wager urtho leaned forward in his chair ignoring another wave of dizziness and spoke two words knowledge power then he settled back and closed his eyes think about it kiyamvir maar you win or i do all the knowledge and all the power i can afford to wait but feel as though i should retire your army is on the way and i prefer to reset this gate tosomewhere else somewhere very warm and leave your army with an unpleasant surprise he slitted open his lids just a little and saw to his satisfaction that maar was staring at the gate chewing his lip in vexation hes going to do it i always said you were the luckiest aubri muttered before skan hushed him its not luck he muttered back its memory cinnabar used to play with the princes and she showed me all the secret passages i took a chance that maar wouldnt have found them all and that i could take care of the traps he put in the ones he did find he didnt like to think of how cinnabar had shown him all the secret passages shed impressed them directly into his mind and it hadnt been a pleasant experience nor had the circumstances been pleasant shed put him in charge of searching the passages for that damned dyrstaf because he was the only mage there she could do that to she took the humansized passages and i took the ones big enough for a gryphon he shook off the memory it didnt matter anyway what mattered was how many guards kiyamvir maar had with him in that throne room please please please o lady of the kaledain make him so arrogant that he does without guards entirely please the gryphons didnt have a deity as such and this was the first time hed ever felt the urgent need to call on one the gryphons had only had urtho and themselves and when this is overtake kechara somewhere safe and warm and bring urtho to herand keep amberdrake and zhaneel happy there were no peepholes in this passage and no human would have been able to hear what was going on in the throne room anyone using the entrance here would have to do so blindly trusting that there was no one there unless that someone was a gryphon he closed his eyes and concentrated becoming nothing in his mind but a pair of broad tufted ears listening hes talking to someone demonsblood its now or never go he hissed at aubri the broadwing hit the release on the doorway and rammed it with his shoulder tumbling through as the panel gave way skan leapt his prone body and skidded to a halt on the slick marble kechara romping puppylike behind him maar swung around to stare at the open panel and now faced away from urtho oh stareyed lady is that a gate what else could it be when urtho lay back in a chair framed by an archway with a faint shimmering of energy across the portal skan did not even stop to think about his incredible unbelievable good fortune did not stop to think about the poleaxed expression on urthos weary face aubri he screeched get kechara across now but aubri didnt have to do anything kechara spotted urtho on her own screamed father in a joyful shrill voice and shot across the intervening space like an arrow squeezing through the gate as if shed been greased aubri followedand stuck skan reached for the box while maar stared at all of them as if he thought they were some kind of hallucination finally he spoke all of this was to save two gryphons the black gryphon held the weapon before him and slid his foreclaws home and triggered the box no to save all of us he ducked out of the carrystrap and slung the whole thing across the floor at maar who dodged in purest reflex but dodging didnt help the boxs strap caught his feet and tripped him the fall knocked the breath out of him and delayed any reaction he might have for a crucial moment maar clutched at the box which glowed and sparked when his hands touched it his expression changed from one of indignation to one of surprise and thenfear then insane anger he stood trembling with rage and kicked the box aside it clattered on the marble floor to rest by the throne you think this is it he screamed this toy of urthos is supposed to kill me gryphon watch the emperor drew a glittering silver knifeand with both hands drove it into his own chest his face wrenched into a maniacal grin and he locked his eyes on skandranons as blood streamed down his sumptuous clothing the grin grew wider you see i know some things you dont i have won i will live forever and i will hate you foreverall of urthos people all your children and their children and i will hunt you all down do you hear skandranon rashkae will you wake up maar is playing for time hell keep you occupied with his little spectacle until the box goes and takes you with it the gryphon snapped himself awake from maars mesmerizing speech maar withdrew the dagger from his chest blood blossomed anew and dripped to the floor without saying anything else the emperors face went ashen and he fixed his gaze of madness on skandranon with both hands he held the daggers point to his throat behind the chinand in one swift movement thrust the long dagger upward skandranon was running toward the gate before maar fell behind him over the clatter of his own talons he could hear the daggers pommel strike chips from the stone floor muffled only by the sound of the body the black gryphon hurtled to the gate at full speed aubri was still wedged there and if this didnt work they were both doomed he hit aubri from behind with all of his weight with a scream of pain from two throats they ripped through leaving behind feathers and a little skin and the gate came down so quickly that it took off the end of skans tail kechara was already cuddling in urthos lap unable to understand why her father looked so sick skan picked himself up off the floor and limped over to the mage who looked up with his eyes full of tears i never thought id see you again he whispered hoarsely what did you think you were doing i meant you to save that weapon but before skan could reply he shook his head carefully as if any movement pained him never mind you are the salvation of everyone you brave vain gryphon everyone we saved will be safe for the rest of their lives i have never been so proud of any creature in my life and never felt so unworthy of you skan opened his beak trying to say something wonderful but all he could manage was a broken fatheri love you urtho raised one trembling hand and skan moved his head so that the mage could place it there son he said very softly son of all of the best things in me i love you skans throat closed as urtho took his hand away and he was unable to say anything more kechara looked at them both with bewildered eyes father she said timidly to urtho father has to go away kechara urtho said gently skan will be your father for a while do you understand it may be for a long time but skan will be your father and when the bad men who hurt you are all gone you can come join me she nodded clearly unhappy but her one taste of the bad men had been enough she gazed up at urtho in supreme confidence that he could and would deal with the bad men and nibbled his fingers in a caress aubri limped over to both of them scuse me urtho he asked humbly can that gate go somewhere else urtho closed his eyes then opened them with visible effort i can try he said amberdrake thought that he was prepared for the inevitable but when the great flash of light in the east turned night into full day for one long horrible moment he realized that he was not ready he had accepted the loss of skan of urtho of everything he had known with his mind but not his heart the entire world turned inside out for a fraction of a heartbeat as if he had crossed a gate the universe shook and trembled his vision blurredbut there was no gate it was all in himself then everything was normal again the night sky returned spangled with stars but wreathed in the east with everexpanding multicolored rings of light and a cool breeze brought the scents of crushed grass and dust normalexcept all was gone no he cried out one voice of fruitless denial among a multitude nooooooo he started to fall to his kneesa terrible moaning burst from his chest and tears etched their way down his face in long trails of pain urthoskan hands caught him and supported him winterhart but another set of hands took his shoulders and shook them dammit man no one can fall apart yet vikteren snarled at him tears of his own leaving trails down his dusty face we arent safe didnt you feel what happened back there when the tower went up something more happened than even urtho thought gods only know whats going to happen now we need to get under shields but he protested but just dont fall apart on me people are watching you you can collapse after i get the shields organized vikteren punctuated every word with another shake of his shoulders and amberdrake finally nodded weakly vikteren let him go and he got a wavering grip on his emotions turning his face into the serene mask of the kestrachern although deep within pain was eating him alive vikteren turned away from him and waved his arms frantically over his head listen he shouted over the keens the weeping everybody thisthe trap didnt do what we thought all right we dont know how much is left of maars forces we dont know how far away is safe we dont know who or how many of the rest survived all we do know is that what happened was worse than we thought and we have a couple of hours to get ready for it its going to be awell have to call it a magestorm i guess i cant tell you how bad just listen i need all the mages over here with me no matter how drained you are and the rest of you start getting things tied down like for a really bad storm the worst youve ever seen somehow the desperation in his words penetrated hertasi carried the bad news to the rest of the camp to those who had been too far away to hear him mages pushed their way through the crowd to reach his side the others stopped milling and started acting in a purposeful manner glancing at the slowlyexpanding rings of light with a new respect and no little fear winterhart went looking for her gryphons her first duty was to them amberdrake let her go then stumbled through the darkness to the small floating barge that held his own belongings but once thereit all left him there was nothing left in him but the dull ache of grief he couldnt even bring himself to care what might happen next he sat down on the side of the barge and his hand fell on the feather he still had tied to his belt zhaneels feather how would he tell her she still didnt know theres nothing left nothing left for any of us he didnt even hear them come up beside him he was so lost in despair so dark that not even tears served to relieve it one moment he was alone the next zhaneel sat beside him and winterhart took a place next to him on the edge of the barge when he did not follow i guessed zhaneel said her voice no more than a whisper and although he had not thought that his grief could grow any greater it threatened to swallow him now the tears choked his breath and stole his sight and left him nothing nothing said a voice in his mind as a hand closed over his nothing said zhaneel aloud are we nothing and amberdrake sensed the two of them joining reaching into his heart to heal it reaching to bring him out of the darkness the gryfalcon touched one talon to the feather he still held will you not redeem this now my friend my brother she asked softly we need each other so much and the rest of them need you winterhart added ive heard you used to ask who heals the healerand we have at least one answer for you those he healed zhaneel said giving back what he gave blindly he reached for them they reached back as he held tightly to feathered shoulder and human and shook with sobs that finally brought some release the first flood of tears was over for the moment at least when he heard someone snouting his name amberdrake it sounded like vikteren amberdrake the gate its opening again the what he stumbled to his feet and ran back to the site of the old gateterminus a roughlymade arch of stone sure enough there was a shimmer of energy there energy that fluxed and crackled and made him a little sick to look at what is it he asked as vikteren ran across the clearing to him i dont knowcant be maar the energy inside the gate surged again whatever it is whoever its been affected by the mageblast he turned hopeful eyes on amberdrake you dont suppose its skan do you amberdrake only shook his head numbly heart in mouth the energies built a third time the mouth of the gate turned a blinding white and kechara tumbled through squalling with fear winterhart and zhaneel both cried out and ran to her to comfort her but before they could reach her side the gate flared whitely a second time and aubri leapt across the threshold smelling of burned fur and feathers to land in an exhausted heap skan the broadwing screeched turning his head blindly back toward the gate skan hes still in there the gate fluxedand collapsed in on itself slowly taking the stones of the arch with it the entire structure began to fall as if in a dream no vikteren screamed amberdrake was not certain what the young mage thought he was doing he was only supposed to be of master rank and amberdrake had always been told that only adepts could build gates but vikteren reached out his hands in a clutching clawlike motion and amberdrake felt the energies pouring from him into the collapsing gate seizing itand somehow holding it steady amberdrake sensed vikteren faltering and added his own hearts strength to the young mages and felt winterhart join him and zhaneel the gate flared a third and final time but this time it was so bright that amberdrake cried out in pain blinded vikteren cried out too but in triumph amberdrakes vision cleared after much blinking and eyerubbing and lying before them was skandranonshocked senseless and no longer as hewas the elegant black form they had known was thinner and bleached to snowwhite but it was unmistakably skandranon the gate and vikteren collapsed together then there was no time to think of anything as the eastern horizon erupted with fireagain and for some reason amberdrake could not understand he could feel the death far away of the mage of silence content that his people including those he loved most were safe at last they had just enough timebarelyto establish their shields before the double magestorm hit the worst effects lasted from before dawn to sunset but their preparations held and they all emerged from shelter to find a bloodred sun sinking over a deceptively normal landscape normaluntil you noticed the places where trees had been flattened where strange little energyfields danced over warped and twisted cairns of halfmelted rocks normaluntil night fell and did not bring darkness but an odd halflight full of wisps of glowing fog and dancing balls of luminescence we cant stay here winterhart said wearily as she returned to amberdrakes hastilypitched tent it was the only one big enough to hold four gryphonsskan and aubri and zhaneel and kechara the former two because of their injuries and the latter because they would not leave skans moonwhite form id assumed that well have to pack up and move west i suppose he looked up at her and smiled then turned his watchful gaze back down to the slumbering skandranon i dont mind if you dont well i wish we knew how many of the others survived she sighed but the mages cant get anything through thiswhatever it is magical noise and smoke no scrying no magemessages and we dont want to risk the poor little messengerbirds the tervardi dont want to scout the kyree are as scared as we are the hertasi are traumatized and the gryphons dont trust the winds well have to go west and assume any others are doing whatever they have to so were back to ordinary human senses he reached out for her caught her hand and drew her down beside him not so bad when you come to think about it i have no complaints she leaned her head on his shoulder and stroked one icewhite wingfeather of the stillshocky skandranon except one oh he replied she probably wishes we could stay here long enough to restbut at least we know there wont be anyone following us this she pointed to skandranon curled around zhaneel like a carving of the purest alabaster is going to make him twice as vain as he was of course it will came a sleepy rumble a pale skyblue eye opened and winked slyly and deservedly so amberdrake smiled and held his beloved no matter what tears were shed or what trials were faced some things would stay the same there would always be day and night stars and sky hope and rest there would always be love always compassion and there would always be skandranon and forever in the hearts of all the clans there would be urthoand for his memory a moment of silence
