bardic voices the robin and the kestrel mercedes lackey copyright dedicated to dr paul welch and the other avian veterinarians who keep the namesakes of our free bards wild and tame alive and well chapter one jonny bredeaka free bard kestrelshook mud and cold cold water out of his eyes he grunted as he heaved another shovelful of soft mud from beneath the wheel of their foundered travelwagon and the hole immediately filled up with water this was not how a honeymoon was supposed to be conducted not in a blinding downpour with more mud on him than even this flood of rain could wash away not with their wagon stuck in a pothole the size of birnam what happened to and they lived happily ever after its stuck at the end of tales in stupid guild ballads thats what happened to it real people get stuck in potholes not platitudes jonny brede grinned at that in spite of the miserable situation it had a good ring to it a nice turn of phrase hed have to tell robin she could store it away in her capacious memory and put it in a song some time she was the one with a talent for lyrics not he they hadnt been out of birnam for more than a week when shed already crafted a song about the two of them the gypsy prince if i dont someone else will she reasoned and if it isnt rune or talaysen theyll probably get it all wrong never trust your story to someone else well she had a point though he simply could not think of himself as sional much less as prince sionalnot anymore not when the prince was in command of no more than himself two mares and a shovel better jonny or better yet free bard kestrel he shoveled a little more muddy gravel under the wheel of their caravanwagon and took a cautious peek at his bride of a few scant weeks through a curtain of rain the last time hed looked at her shed been giving the wagon a glare as black as the thunderclouds overhead shed been standing to one side of their patient sturdy ebony mares fists on her hips gaudy clothing pasted to her body by the rain with her ebony hair flattened down on her head and her lips moving silently he did not think she was praying the look on her face had boded ill for the kings road crew if she ever discovered who had permitted this enormous pothole to form and fill with soft sucking mud her temper did not seem to have improved in the past few moments she held the bridles of their two wellmuscled horses and murmured encouraging things into their ears but the scowl on her face belied her soft words hopefully her temper would cool before she actually needed to find a target for her anger other than the storm itself robin had a formidable temper when it was aroused kestrel sighed and stamped down on the gravel to make it sink into the mud and hopefully pack down he was happy despite being soaked to the skin cold and muddy their horses had shied at a lightning strike running off onto the verge of the road and now their wagon was mired at the side of the road so what it was not an insurmountable problem the wagon had not been hit their horses had not broken legs neither of them were hurt it was just a matter of hauling the thing out themselves or waiting until someone came along who could help them so what he wasnt going to let a little accident upset his cheerful mood in fact he thought he had never been so happy before in all his life certainly not during his bestforgotten childhood he shoveled in another load of gravel which splashed into the yellow mud and sank prince sional huh oh its a great thing to be a prince when your father sticks you in a socalled palace thats half derelict with one servant to care for a child an invalid queen to do all the char work and deal with leaky roofs and cracks in the walls its a great thing to be royal when your kingly father trots you out only for special occasions when a live son is useful its a fine thing to be a prince when youve got snow on your satin bedspread in the winter leaks onto your head in the summer and the servants at the crown palace eat better than you do when your only friend is a guild bard who should have retired a hundred years ago hed been ignored by his wastrel father who was too busy debauching himself to pay attention to his son or his land and willfully neglected by his fathers underlings the only thing good in that childhood had been his mother and tutor a guild bard of birnam one master darian who had been father mother and mentor to him master darian had taught him about honor and about care and within his own specialty first the love of music then the means of making it kestrels eyes misted over and a tear or two joined the rain on his cheeks darian my good darian faithful one oh master i wish you could see me now i think youd be pleased you always said it was the music that should be important and the skill of those who played it i think youd like robin i know youd like talaysen king charlis royal chickens had come home to roost with a vengeance when he had wrung his land neardry to support his selfindulgence some of his subjects could bear no more one charlis own brother was willing to act on their desperation he staged an uprising flooded the palace with his own men and killed his brother taking the throne for himself now at long last kestrel knew why his uncle had taken those drastic steps and he knew now what neither he nor darian had known then that rolend had no intention of harming his nephew and that the orders that night had been to stay away from the dowager palace then in the morning after the situation had been resolved rolend had planned to bring sional to the crown palace to be installed with his cousin and his cousins tutors whether he would have given me preference for the throne over victorwell that hardly matters he wasnt going to kill a child but sional had been snooping as a young boy would in places he shouldnt have been he had seen his fathers assassination and the beginning of the uprising and had run to his tutor in terror old darian not knowing any of the plans afoot had assumed the worst and had smuggled them both out of the palace out of the city and out of birnam through the terrible fens between birnam and rayden as a guild bard from birnam the old man was given a certain respect even though he had been in the scant train of the queen until she died then had chosen to live in obscurity as sionals tutor for her sake but the guild in rayden was not minded to see any prize places go to some outsider and jonny and his ailing mentor had been shuffled off to the guild hall at kingsford and left to rot kestrel wiped away a couple more tears of anger this time at the arrogant bastards whod politely jeered at the brave old man and had accounted his stories of revolt and assassins to be a senile fools meanderings they had never questioned the boy that darian called jonny brede i was sick with marshfever and they wouldnt have believed me anyway the marshfever had taken his memory and left him thinking he was no more than a peasant boy that darian had chosen for his apprentice despite the obvious unsuitability of the boy either the fever or the trauma of flight had also left him with a stutter he still suffered he scrubbed the back of his hand across his mouth and tasted grime and dilute salt damn them darian should have been covered with honors and what did they do they stuck him in the worst room in the guild hall a room they wouldnt even put a servant in and left him to die if it hadnt been for me he would have died within a week he was too old and too tired to flee across two countries with a sick boy he had to keep reminding himself that it was all in the past otherwise hed get too angry about things he couldnt change that was what master wren kept telling him and he was right he shoveled in another load of gravel packing it down savagely oh that was what everyone told him but forgetting nowthat was the hard part the guild had a lot to answer for when master darian died it was their own law that he be found a new master he was after all a full apprentice and had anyone been watching out for his rights he would have gotten that new master but no one wanted to be bothered with a stuttering apprenticeand one who was a legacy chosen by a bard from another kingdom at that there would be no grateful parents sending gifts as there would have been if he had been born welloff there would be no gifts from the boy to the master who had discovered him if and when he achieved fame for that master was darian there was no one to insist that the boys rights be observed for that troublemaker master talaysen had vanished after tossing all his honors into the face of the guild master in short there was no profit in taking the boy and it would mean a great deal of wasted time trying to train him out of the stutter so the guild master and his chosen cronies told him he was feebleminded a halfwit told the same tale to anyone who looked the least bit curious then they had thrown him out into the street with only the clothes on his back and those few personal possessions he still had denied his rights to a new master denied even the old harp his master had left when he died something talaysen had said made him smile in spite of his anger the irony is they trained plenty of halfwits in there and they are still doing so it doesnt take wits to play without any sense of the music halfwits are conscious only of form and style not contentand form and style are all the guild cares about if id had that harp i could at least have made some kind of living as a streetbusker that had been the worst of it he had no skills and he was too old to find another apprenticeship in a trade if id had the harp i would have found the free bards earlieror they would have found me the way they found rune theyd have told me i wasnt worthless still there was no point in dwelling on that no he certainly had no pleasure in looking back at those years nor at the ones that followed with no harp to play to make a living and no way of ever getting one he had been forced to look for whatever work he could find as an unskilled laborer he worked himself to the bone in the worst of conditions stealing when there was no work that was when his life had truly fallen to pieces his uncle king rolend had gotten wind of the fact that he was still alive the kings own grasp on the throne was as shaky as his predecessors had been he could not afford a pretender to it however young and a young boy had anyone known what he was would have been easy to manipulate there were plenty of people in birnam who would have been very pleased to get their hands on a figurehead for a counterrebellion so king rolend had made the cruelest decision of his life to have seekingtalismans made and send out hired killers bearing them to find sional now only fifteen or sixteen and kill him since sional had no inkling of who and what he was this was even crueler than it seemed he was now caught in the heart of a senseless nightmare hired killers were after him and he had no notion why their mere existence made it impossible for him to accept a permanent job even when one was offered for he dared not stay in one place for too long he shook rainwater out of his eyes and glanced over to his beloved robin again she had that knack for dealing with animals that all gypsies seemed to have the mares were listening to her and had calmed considerably flickering light overhead made him cock his head to look at the sky an area of clouds just above him lightened again and a distant mumble of thunder followed the light good all the lightning was up in the clouds may it stay there this was a bad place to be caught by lightning here in an area of road lined by oaks oak trees seemed to attract lightning for some reason and several of the huge trunks nearby bore mute testament to that he had done all he could for this wheel he moved to the other and started in again his thoughts returning to the past if anyone wanted to devise a hell for someone he thought packing the gravel as far in under the wheel as he could it would surely have been a life like mine able to find only the most menial of work watching over ones shoulder for the mysterious killersand not knowing why they pursued much less how to get rid of them he had taken a job as a goatdriver a job that brought him to the edge of the downs and the little town of karsdown what he had not known was that this late in the season there would be no further work in karsdown for an unskilled laborer he found himself trapped in a tiny sheepherding town with no work in it without enough money to buy himself provisions to get to someplace else and without the woodsknowledge needed to live off the land he had been desperate desperate enough to try to pick the pocket of a tall man with graying red hair who appeared to have enough coin that he would not miss a copper or two his target was a man he had not then known was a bard since he was not carrying an instrument nor wearing the guild colors of purple and silver or gold he had tried to pick the pocket of one known both as master wren andby a chosen fewas the great free bard master talaysen wren was the same man who had fled acclaim and soft living to form the loose organization known as the free bardsbut before he had done that he had won guild mastery as well under the farfamed name of master gwydain the songs and music of gwydain were famed in every kingdomthough the songs and music of free bard talaysen bid fair to eclipse that fame funnywren outshines even himself all he had known at the time was that the man was accompanied by two young and attractive women and to jonnys eyes was spending a great deal of money he had assumed that the man waswelltheir honeypapa as the shepherds would say an older man who bought young ladies nice things and received most particular and personal attentions from them in return that he had been mistaken was his good fortune rather than his bad for that was when his streak of horrible luck finally broke talaysen had caught him but had not sought to punish but to help him the young women had been his wife the free bard rune and a gypsy free bard named gwyna but far more often referred to as robin kestrel grinned at that memory robin had first loaded him down with all her packages to carry without so much as a byyourleave and then had marched him off to get a bath in the stream and had made it very clear that either he would bathe or she would bathe him and her expression had told him wordlessly that if she did the bathing it would be thorough but not pleasant he opted to scrub himself down and change into some old clothing of runes rather than his own rags amazing how much better being clean for the first time in months can make you feel and she certainly thought i cleaned up well enough he stole another glance at her and it seemed to him as if she looked a trifle less angry perhaps talking to the horses had calmed her he hoped so there was no reason to be angry after all even though the pothole seemed to be the size of birnam the wagon that was stuck in it was theirs the horses that drew it were theirs and it all was a gift of his uncle the same uncle who had tried to kill him true but king rolend wasnt trying to kill him anymore he grinned again poor uncle rolend he had been no match for the wits of talaysen the magic of the gypsies and the determination of his three new friends to see him out of the mess one of the elves whod come to his wedding one of those who were allies of both talaysen and king rolend had told him that it was no accident his being in karsdown at the same time as the other three your bardic magery was awakening the elf had said with lofty offhandedness it called to them as theirs called to you if you had not met then you would have met soon he rubbed his nose uneasily he wasnt altogether certain about this bardic magic business it was easy enough for wren to be blithe about it he was a master twice over in the guild bards and the free bards and a nobleman to boot he was used to power of all sorts kestrel was far from comfortable with the idea that he could influence people and events just by thinking and singing well right now that hardly mattered no magic bardic or otherwise was going to get this wagon out of the muck it was going to take nothing more esoteric than muscle of man and beast but was that really why talaysen had so readily adopted him master wren said not no matter what the elf said all it took was to hear you play the bard had said simply i knew you were one of us and that we had an obligation to help you he grinned through the rain dripping down his back and in spite of the aches in his muscles to hear that from the one he admired most in the world i wouldnt have blamed him if hed gotten rid of me that night in ralenvale when the killers caught up with me though no one had been hurt except the killers themselves it had been a terrorfilled night both for kestrel who had hoped to escape his pursuers and the gypsies they had camped with but before that he had been having the time of his life for the gypsies treated him as one of their own and made him feel at home with them that was when jonny had earned his bardic nickname of kestrel from the gypsies he had said in disgust that his stutter made him sound like a kestrel the gypsies had seized upon that and promptly dubbed him free bard kestrel theyd included him in their music their dancingand never once teased him about the way he sounded when he talked then the attack had come one of the assassins had died challenging a magical trap set by the gypsy mage peregrine the rest had fled when their weapons missed their target i thought for certain when they realized how much trouble i was bringing to them that they would tell me to make my own way but instead wren had decreed his lost past must be plumbedto find out why he was the target of such attacks so that something could be done to prevent or evade them peregrine had performed the magic that unlocked kestrels lost memories and then jonny brede learned who and what he really was it had been a shock to all of them but it had been talaysen who decreed they must go to the source of those memories to discover the truth of the matter and what if anything they should do about that truth from the first he had never really entertained fantasies of being the lost prince returned to reclaim his throneor not for long anyway he wasnt certain what the others had in their minds but the further into birnam they got and the more questions they had asked the more the truth about the current and past king emerged although they had more questions on the whole than they had answers so at last they had taken the risky chance of summoning elves to answer what had become a series of vital questions and the answers the elf gave them had not been in keeping with any fantasy of lost princes kestrels father charlis had indeed even by elven standards been a terrible king he had wasted the resources of his land on his own pleasure and had taken no thought to truly governing it king rolend had acted in part to keep his brother from destroying his own lands and people with his greed rolend was the very opposite of his brother and had through sacrifice and hard work brought birnam back into prosperity the obvious question then was why had such an apparently good and honorable man been sending killers to rid himself of a child the elves had an answer to that as well for they were privy to rolends counsels and many of his secrets rolend believed that the kings concern lay with all the peoples of his realm and not just those who were human rolend they said had learned that the prince had survived his flight into rayden and had become more and more nervous as the boy grew older that one day someone might use the prince as a front in an attempt to regain the throne he was after all the rightful heir to his father and there were plenty of folk who had profited when charlis sat the throne who now were not profiting in the reign of his honest brother these folk a mixture of dishonest priests of the church discontented dukes and sires who had enjoyed considerable autonomy in their own holdings under charlis and the birnam bardic guild who had lined their pockets with birnams gold would have been overjoyed to have a figurehead to use for a counterrebellion particularly one as romantic as a lost prince most particularly one who could be manipulated as a young and presumably naive child could be so king rolend had gritted his teeth and sent assassins armed with tokens that would lead them to the prince he would never feel safe until prince sional had been taken out of the picture permanently intellectuallywell i could understand that kestrel stood for a moment to ease his cramping shoulders then went back to his work and now that ive met with uncleall i can say is im glad things worked out this way the trouble with uncle rolend is that he is very good at convincing himself that he is doing something for the best possible reason its awfully easy for someone like that to think that the end justifies the means kestrel did not want the throne he knew deep in his heart that he was a good musician but would make a terrible king he knew nothing of governance outside of the little gleaned from a few ballads which was hardly the best source of information oh rune would have made a better king than me the only way to stop the assassins short of dying or taking the throne was to find a way to renounce his heritage so with the help of talaysen rune and the gypsy named robin whom he had come to love he had taken himself out of the picture permanently a midnight incursion into the palace was in order they held rolend hostage briefly while they explained themselves and worked a little bardic magic to make him believe what they were saying that was followed by a sunrise abdicationa very public abdicationon kestrels part and then kestrel sealed his unsuitability by publicly proposing marriage to a gypsy and being accepted the corners of his mouth turned up in a smile he could not repress the look on her face when he had proposed it probably matched the look on mine when she accepted no king could ever wed a commoner the dukes barons and sires would never permit it no nobleman could ever wed a gypsy by doing so he had rendered not only himself but all his future offspring completely ineligible for the throne of birnam by that single action he had ensured his safety and that of those with him no matter how suspicious his uncle might become so here they were riding off to make their way in the world as mere free bards in a gypsy caravan complete to the last detail and as luxurious in its appointments as it could be and not attract robbers and brigands well we were riding up to an hour ago anyway the wagon itself a gift of his uncle who had been only too obviously relieved to see the last of him with talaysen and rune now safely installed as rolends court bards and talaysen actually appointed laurel bard to the throne hopefully rolends fears would stay safely buried but kestrel had always preferred to hedge his hopes with defenses a man who fears shadows can sometimes manufacture enemies as gwynas people say besides there had been no point in courting trouble or giving king rolend any cause for more sleepless nights the best way to show him that prince sional was dead and not lamented was to keep as far from birnam as possible not exactly a hardship to keep his distance from one little pocketkingdom when he had all the wonders of alanda to roam in he had always been fascinated even as a very tiny child by the stories about all the myriad races and cultures of this strange and patchwork world now he had the chance to see them firsthand all of them or at least as many as he could in a single lifetime i am far more likely to thank my uncle than hold a grudge against him this time he didnt bother to hold back the grin he is stuck on that stupid block of a throne for the rest of his life and he will never move more than twenty leagues from his own castle he will never see the mintaks and their steppyramids the canalstreets of the looooalains the walled fortresscity of the deliambrens why he probably wont even go under the elven hills with the elves in his own little kingdom birnam had never been a home to him in fact he had never really known a home nor did he have a clear recollection of a time when he had owned more than he could carry in a thin rucksack on his back a luxurious wagon was home enough for him and the road was all the country he needed besides now he need no longer watch his back for the mysterious men who had kept trying to murder him his grin widened altogether this was a wonderful life mud stuck wagon and all what are you grinning about robin came around the side of the wagon and scraped a draggle of wet hair out of her eyes as she spoke jonny seized her wrist and pulled her over to him giving her a muddy hug and a passionate kiss both of which she returned with such interest that he began to think he might steam himself dry in her arms he let go with reluctance im gggrinning at ththis he said waving his hand at the wagon the horses themselves i mmmean think abbbout it we may be ssstuck but we cccan just unhitch thththe horses and ggget inside if wwwe want thththeres nothing ssstopping us if wwwe ddecide to gggive up for a little its ours yyyou sssee she nodded finally and a ghost of a smile appeared as her frown of worry faded you know youre right we dont have to be anywhere weve got anything a gypsy could ever want we can get out of the wet if we get tired of trying to fish this thing out of the mud and the horses will survive a soaking he nodded vigorously you sssee we arent even bbblocking the rrroad wwwe can wwwait untttil someone cccomes along who cccan give us a hhhand and if anything is bbbroken wwe have the mmoney to fffix it thththats mmmore than ive ever been able to say bbbefore he lowered his eyelids suggestively thththeres lots of wwways to get wwwarm now she grinned right along with him and tossed her head to get her wet hair out of her eyes true she agreed but i would like to think id at least tried to get this thing out of the muck before we give up and go inside the horses are ready any time you are her smile turned wistful i dont think either of us thought wed be spending part of our honeymoon trying to boost a wagon out of a pothole a mmmuddy pppothole he said ruefully looking at the state of his clothing impossible now to tell what color it had been as mudsoaked as it was she shrugged and put her shoulder to the other wheel still ill keep telling myself that it is our wagon we have options i never had before a year ago id have been huddling under a rock overhang if i was lucky or trying to stay warm under a fallen log if i was not he bent to his wheel and she whistled to the horses who strained forward in their harnesses while the two of them pushed the wagon from behind indeed this was their beautiful if mudsplashed wagon they were safely in rayden again and on their way out after which dear uncle would have no clue as to where they might have gone and shoving away at his side was the loveliestif muddiestlady he had ever known in all his life and she had picked him all right im prejudiced he admitted as the wagon rocked a little in place but otherwise refused to move but im also not blind and i think ive seen enough lovely ladies to know true beauty when i spot it after several attempts the wagon was not budging the horses were straining and the rain showed no signs of abating robin panted bending over with her hands braced against her knees her wet hair dangling down kestrel massaged his hands and again tried to see if anything was obviously wrong he was beginning to think that there might be something broken or jammed this wagon had axles built into the body to protect them a good idea but it made it difficult to judge what might have gone wrong without the tedious business of taking off the bottom plate he sighed and robin turned her head and caught his eye are you sssorry you dddidnt get the kkking of bbbirnam after all he asked ruefully you wwwouldnt be standing in the mmmud if you had but robin only grinned her good nature restored by the exertion powers forfend she replied the king of birnam would be fair useless getting this blasted wheel out of the mud lets try that notion of yours of heaving up and trying to shore up the wheel while its up it had been a faint hope more than an idea but if robin wanted to try it he was game you dddo the cccounting he said with a selfdeprecating laugh if i dddo well bbbe here all ddday chapter two gwyna shoved little bits of wood under the wheel using a larger piece to protect her hands in case the wagon slipped back damn the rain always comes at the worse possible time a rainsoaked lock of hair fell down across her nose in a tangled curl again and she didnt have the hand to spare to push it out of the way it tickled and it got in the way of her vision it was hard to stay cheerful when you were dripping wet your hair was snarled and soaked and there was mud everywhere the rain didnt wash it away but there was kestrel laboring manfully beside her for all his slight build and he wasnt complaining poor thing he wasnt much taller than she nor much more muscled though regular feeding had put a little more weight on him he still inspired women to want to take him home and feed him pastries and milk and then feed him something else entirely girl she told herself and grinned in spite of the cold rain dripping down her back and the certain knowledge that at the moment she looked more like a drowned kitten than a seductress well he was hers the others would simply have to look and wish even soaking wet and muddied to his ears he was a handsome piece though he hadnt a clue that he was bless his heart long dark hair as dark as a gypsys now plastered to his head but luxuriant and wavy when it was dry set off his thin gentle face with its huge innocent dark eyes and prominent cheekbonesdefinitely a face to set maidens hearts aflutter and when you added in the promise in the sensual mouth and clever hands well it set the hearts of nolongermaidens aflutter too and he looked fine very fine in the flamboyant colors and garments favored by the gypsies he did most of his speaking when he could with eloquent gestures and with his eyes right now they held a cheer that not even their dismal situation could quench and relief that once again she had affirmed that she would rather have kestrel the free bard than all the kings in the twenty kingdoms and what would i do with a king if i had one thank you no she was nothing if not practical a king has all of his duties and little time for pleasure if he is a good king i should see him for perhaps an hour or two in the day i have my kestrel with me as much as i like the horses stamped restively she went up to the front of the wagon to reassure them thank the lady that king rolend had the sense to fling gold at gypsy raven with which to outfit a wagon and buy horses for it rather than trusting such a task to his own stablemen not that the kings stablemen were unfit to choose horses but a pair of pampered highbloods would be illsuited for tramping the roads in all weathers no these mares were as sturdy as they were lovely two generations out of the wild horses of the long downs and crossbred to kelpan warmbloods for looks and stamina truly a wedding present fit for a prince for all that he was prince no more a prince of the road then why would she ever trade a life bound to one place for her free life on the road anyway shed had a dislike for being tied to one spot before her unfortunate encounter with the darkmage priest an encounter that left her with a horror of cages and being caged now she was positively phobic about the notion kestrel did not know about that beyond the bare bones that a renegade priestmage had turned her into a bird and caged her he did not know how she had refused the priests demand she be his mistress and that he had not only turned her into a bird he had turned her into a bird too heavy to fly hed put her in a cage just barely large enough to hold her and had displayed her by day for all the kingsford faire to see as his possession and by night to the guests at his dinners only the intervention of rune and talaysen had freed her only talaysens acquaintance with a decent magepriest had enabled them to break the spell making her a bird it had then rebounded upon its caster who was still for all she knew languishing in the same cage he had built for her in the guise of the ugliest and biggest black bird she had ever seen but ever since the thought of staying in one place for too long brought up images of bars and cages no thank you no kings for me no matter how luxurious a cage is still a cage the horses calmed she went back to her task of shoving wood wedges under the wheel trying to at any rate it was awfully hard to tell if she was getting anywhere at all the mud was only getting worse not better as the rain continued to pound them ware kestrel warned her with a single word he could usually manage single words without stuttering she snatched her hands and board out of the way called to the horses and the wagon settled as kestrel and the mares let it down he closed his eyes and sagged against the back of the wagon she appraised him carefully trying to measure with her eyes just how exhausted he was how strained his muscles we cant manage too many more of these attempts she decided he hasnt got them in him and neither do i she thanked her lady that he was not like so many men she knew inclined to overextend himself in the hope of somehow impressing her that sort of behavior didnt impress her and it inevitably led to the man in question hurting himself and then pretending he was not hurt kestrel on the other hand was naive enough about women to take what she said at face valueand bright enough not to do something stupid just for the sake of impressing her and i am just contrary enough to say precisely what i mean so all is well she had to shake her head at herself as she admitted that i would not have him change for the world and all that is in it i am no easy creature to live with he would not change me either so he says and so i believe she leaned against the wagon and tried to knot her wet hair at the nape of her neck but little strands kept escaping and straggling into her eyes she gave it up as a hopeless cause this naivete of his was something to be cherishedif that was precisely the right thing to call it perhaps it was simply that he had no one to teach him that women were anything other than persons truly he had no one to teach him that women were anything after all his childhood was spent with that old master of his and not even a female servant aboutand the rest of his time was spent trying to earn enough to keep fed and running to save his life for whatever reason he was one of the few men she knew free bards and gypsies included who simply assumed that she was his partnerhis equal in most things his superior in some his inferior in others she had met a few men who were willing to accept her as a partner but kestrel was only one of three who simply assumed the status and the other two were raven and peregrine there was a difference subtle but very real to her between that acceptance and assumption it was a distinction that made a world of difference to her he never asked her to prove anything he simply assumed that if she claimed she could do something it was true when she said she could not he worked with her to find a way around the problem when he knew how to do something he asked her opinion before he simply did itand she gave him the same courtesy like this situation that they found themselves in now neither of them knew a great deal about wagons at least of this type and neither of them were large and muscular without any arguing they had each tried the others suggestions and when things didnt work they simply went on to try something else oh they had arguments everyone did but when it counted they were partners arguments were for times of leisure in a peculiar way even standing in the pouring rain wet and miserable cold and besmeared with muck was a wonderful and rare experience it proved something to her that she had hoped for all along that she was his friend companion the person he trusted as well as his lover she could count the number of couples who could say that on one hand and have fingers left over ready she asked when it looked as if he had recovered as much as he was going to he nodded tiredly cccant dddo this mmmuch llonger he said simply im abbbout gone so am i she admitted and so are the mares but lets give it what we have yes he nodded she counted on four she shouted to the horses and they all strained to the limit nothing happened just as nothing had really happened all the times before no matter what they had tried ware she shouted and they both let go as the horses slacked the harness the wagon did not even move a great deal as it settled back her good temper finally broke under the strain she clenched fists and jaw and glared at the wagon the pothole the mud that now reached halfway to the wheelhub damn she swore under her breath as she backed off and stared at the cursed thing stupid stubborn blasted demonpossessed pile of junk it was pretty obvious that there was nothing they were able to do alone that was going to free the wheels they were not going to get it out and everything they did now that it was obvious was a wasted effort she muttered a few gypsy curses at the wheels under her breath for good measure kestrel just pulled the hair out of his eyes and leaned back so that the rain washed the mud from his face after a few moments with his mouth open drinking the fresh rain he lowered his head and looked at her apologetically as if he thought that he was somehow responsible for the situation its really ssstuck isnt it she nodded and in a burst of fading annoyance kicked the wheel as she had known it would this accomplished nothing except to hurt her toe a little damn she swore again but with no real vehemence she was too tired then she sighed its really really stuck or else something is broken lets get the horses under whatever cover we can and try and dry off before we catch something as if to underscore the triumph of nature over the hand of man the skies truly opened up sluicing them with rain that seemed somehow much colder than the downpour that had already drenched them the horses cooperated but their harness didnt stiff leather soaked with water and heavy met cold stiff fingers it took so long to unharness the mares that robins temper was well on the way to boiling by the time they had the two sodden beasts hobbled under the scant shelter of a low tree wrapped in woolen horseblankets they did not tether the team under an oak and they did spread a canopy of canvas over the branches above giving each beast a nose bag of grain to make up for their sad excuse for stabling robin and kestrel finally took shelter in the wagon involuntarily bringing at least four or five buckets of rain in with them through the open door by then they were so cold that robin despaired of ever feeling warm again the charcoal stove in the wagon took time to heat up that made it safer in a wooden wagon but it meant it took a while to make any difference in the meantime they huddled in blankets that didnt seem to help very much even though they were dry robin stared at the tiny stove willing it to get warmer the rain showed absolutely no sign of stopping shed had a forlorn hope that once they gave up the rain might too shed even seen a patch of blue to the east but it had closed up again before it had ever fulfilled its promise she and jonny were too far from any village to walk to shelter even assuming they would be willing to leave the horses the wagon and everything in it neither of them were of course she didnt know if the mares were broken to saddle if they werent trying to ride them would probably end in someone getting dumped on his head besides only a fool would walk or ride off and leave everything he owned unprotected she pulled the blanket closer around her shoulders and shivered rain pounded the wooden roof making it very hard to hear anyone who wasnt shouting if i can just get warm again this could be pleasant oh the frustration that a little prosperity could bring and the unexpected discomforts the more you have the more you have to lose and the less willing you are to let go of it back when she was on her own traveling afoot burdened only by her pack and her instruments she would never have found herself in such a fix it seemed so long ago that she had been so footloose and yet it was no more than a few months ago hard to believe that this was the first really bad rain of late falland she had begun journeying with lark and wren at the very end of summer they didnt even meet jonny until the first of the harvest faires if i was still alone i would be sitting beside a warm fire right now her conscience which had a better memory than the part of her that controlled wishful thinking sneered at her and her pretensions a warm fire maybe if she had been clever enough to read the weather signs and if she had been lucky enough to get a place at an inn and even if she met both those conditions there was no guarantee that the fire would be a warm one and she would probably not be sitting right beside it but rather off to one side the paying customers got the flame more often than not the entertainers had to make do with the crackle anyway it would be under a solid roof solid maybe maybe not her conscience called up a long litany of leaking roofs inns without shutters stinking little hovels without windows dirtfloored buginfested places with only a hole in the center of the roof to let the smoke from the fire in the middle of the room escape which it mostly didnt maybe if she hadnt even found that kind of scant shelter not a roof at all in fact if she hadnt been clever or lucky she could be shivering in the socalled protection of her traveltent right now a lot colder and wetter than she was or even be huddled under a bush somewhere the wagon was solid the fire was their own and they were entitled to the flame and the crackle once the stove warmed up if it ever does but memory did supply some honest memories of sitting on the clean hearth of a good clear fire in a good quality inn sipping a mug of spiced cider or even wine listening to the rain drum on the roof while she tuned her lute in fact she had spent whole seasons in such venues the valued fixture of the tap room who brought in custom from all around will this stove never heat up ththey ssay a wwwatched ppot never bboils kestrel said his voice muffled under his blanket ddo wwatched ssstoves nnever heat im beginning to think so she replied i hello the wagon having trouble the clear tenor voice from outside carried right over the drumming of the rain on the roof she was out of her blanket and had poked her head out of the door at the rear of the wagon before kestrel could even uncurl from his nest that voice was more than welcome it sounded familiar another vehicle had pulled up on the road beside them a wagon much much larger than theirs so large in fact that it probably had to keep to the major roads entirely for the minor ones would not be wide enough for it as it was there was just barely room for a farmcart to pass alongside of it anything larger would have to go off to the side of the road and wait it had tall sides as tall as a house and rather than wood it was made of gray mattefinished metal it had glass windows real glass covered on the inside by shutters below the windows were hatches perhaps leading to storage boxes it was drawn by four huge horses the like of which robin had only seen when the sires held one of their silly tournaments and encased themselves in metal shells to bash each other senseless as if they werent already senseless to begin with the huge beasts stood with heads patiently bowed to the wind and weather rich red coats turned to a dull brown by the rain white socks splattered with mud feathers matted they were beautiful beasts but she did not envy their driver for they would eat hugely and be horribly expensive to keep that was why only the sires could afford such beasts although their great strength would be very useful to any farmer then again anyone who could afford a rig like this would have no trouble affording the feed for these four huge horses their little gypsy caravan would easily fit inside this colossus with room for two or three more the driver sat in sheltered comfort inside a porchlike affair on the front enclosed on the left and right roofed and floored he leaned out around the side just as she tried to make out who or what he wasand as soon as he saw her his face was lit by a mixture of surprise and delight old owl she exclaimed jumping from the back of the wagon to the ground by our lady i cant think of anyone id rather see more kestrel poked his head out of the door of the wagon just in time to hear robin address the driver of an utterly amazing vehicle as old owl both made his eyes widen the wagon was like nothing he had ever seen before in his life it seemed as alien to this road and forest as a coronet on a rabbit the driver was as astonishing as his wagon and he certainly saw why robinand presumably the other free bardswould call him by that name he looked quite owllike although he was more human than a mintak or a gaznerbut much less so than an elf while kestrel stared the driver grinned down at them both perfectly protected from the rain by the roof over the drivers box kestrel simply gaped at him unashamed since he didnt seem to mind welladay i can think of places and times id rather see you in other than mired in a morass gypsy robin the driver replied cheerfully cocking his head to one side i suppose now i shall have to get you out if i dont youll write some kind of nasty little ditty about me and i shall never be able to show my face in polite company again i robin made innocent eyes at him and pretended shock why should i do anything like that because you are the gypsy robin and no male human or not escapes your charm without regretting it the strange being bowed from the waist and winked at kestrel give me a moment to change and i will be down beside you robin snorted and shook her head to kestrels bemusement gwyna was now as cheerful as if their wagon was safely on the road and the sun was shining overhead what magic did this man have to make her suddenly so certain he would be able to fix all their problems still a clotheshorse now as ever your wardrobe no doubt is the reason for the size of your wagon how not he countered why not and disappeared inside kestrel blinked old owlwhoever and whatever he was had been one of the oddest attractive creatures he had ever seen his face and bodywhat kestrel had seen of the body anywayhad been fairly human but that was where the similarity ended he had long flowing pale hair growing along his cheekbones giving his face the masklike appearance of an ancient owl these were not whiskers or a beard this was hair as fine and silky as the shoulderlength hair on his head and it blended into that hair on either side of his face to complete the image of an owlmask his eyebrows were enormous as long as kestrels thumb and wingshaped the hair on his head had been cut in some way that made parts of it stand straight up while parts of it lay flat all of it forming a fountainlike shape it gave the mans head a fantastical appearance and his clothing well what kestrel had seen of it left him dazzled and astonished and quite quite speechless it had certainly rivaled anything hed seen on any gypsy not only was it brightly and brilliantly colored and cut in fantastic folds and draperies with flowing sleeves and a capelike arrangement at the shoulders but parts of it gleamed with a distinctly metallic sheen and some had the look of water and still other parts were as iridescent as an insect wing no wonder he had not wanted the mud to spoil it first and foremostwho was this person this old owl and what was he to robin whwh jonny began who is that robin asked turning around to give him a lopsided grin she waded back to the wagon through ankledeep mud well we call him lord harperus or old owl since he is something of an honorary free bard hes pulled so many of us out of fixes like this one no one knows if hes really entitled to the lord part but he has piles and piles of money as much as any sire so everyone calls him lord hes a deliambren a deliambren kestrel blinked and his interest sharpened considerably the deliambrens were top of the list of beings kestrel had always wanted to see they were reputed to be wizardly mechanics building clockwork creations that could do almost any task you found their constructions in the homes of the wealthiest of the barons and dukes and the palaces of kings very few sires could afford the handiwork of deliambrens and very few merchants even guild masters those who could afford them boasted about it the deliambrens knew how to make magical lights that illuminated without creating heat or needing any oil to fuel them they created boxes that produced music melody after melody fifty tunes or more without repetition boxes no bigger than a wine cask it was even said they could build wagons that did not need horses to pull them and conveyances that could fly they lived so kestrel had been told by his tutor in a place called bendjin it was a free republic whatever the hell that was there were no kings sires dukes or anything else there hed been told how they were governed he had no notion it sounded completely chaotic to him and that was all he knew of them other than the fact that they had something so complicated it was akin to magic that they used to create their toys and the toys answered to anyone mage or not ive nnnever ssseen a ddeliambbbren he managed to get out dddo they all lllook llike ththat robin laughed and reached up and hugged him old owl is not the only one youll see on the road and that is just about the only place you ever will see them she told him all her good cheer back now that the stranger had offered his help unless you earn an invitation to bendjin that is they dont make very many of those so dont get your hopes up i dont know if they all look quite like that but they are all pretty flamboyant we call him old owl because erdric back at kingsford is an owl too but harperus is his senior by a century or so kestrel tried not to goggle at that how old is he she shook her head as the rain slacked off a little i dont exactly know she replied after a moment of thought wren said he was at least a hundred years old and guessed from records and stories that he might be as old as two hundred that was the best guess he had but wren said he couldnt be sure he hopped down off the back of the wagon to join her she gave him a flirtatious kiss wed better get things ready so when he comes out all he has to do is use our chains to pull us out kestrel nodded and waded through the mud beside her they were already so wet and mired that a little more wouldnt matter ive been inside bendjin she offered as they got the towchains out of the box on the back of the wagon where they were kept safe from rusting in an oiled bag once when i was very small they brought in my clan to entertain for a festival of some kind i dont think they let anyone but free bards and gypsies inside the walls i dont think they trust anyone else she chuckled i suppose they know we have no reason to covet their powers since no gypsy would ever own anything he couldnt repair himself in a pinch and no free bard would care about anything other than making music wwas it llike they ssay he asked fascinated by the mere idea of being inside the deliambrens mysterious fortresscity robin took her end of the chains and fastened them carefully to the loops built into the frame of the wagon before she answered i wasnt very old but it was rather amazing even to a child it was quite dazzling thats all i can tell you she said reminiscently as he copied her movements with the chains on his side lights thats what i mostly remember lights everywhere not candles or lamps or anything of that sort they have lights outside that glow when darkness falls and little lightglobes inside that light up and grow dark again at the touch of a finger all the colors of lights that you can possibly imagine they do have wagons that move by themselves without horses and they have boatshaped things that fly i only saw the little ones old owl told me there were bigger ones that they use for their special trading missions outside bendjin and some even bigger ones that they only use once in a while because they kind of break down a lot kestrel grimaced he couldnt imagine anything involving a deliambren breaking down i wish i could describe what i saw for you she concluded with a little shrug of apology but i was only five or six years old i dont remember much more than that oh i do recall one other thing they had some pet birds that were just as flamboyant as their costumes birds that sat on your shoulder and talked i played with one for hours and i really wanted one but old owl told me that they just couldnt stand cold and it would die in the first winter ill fffind you one ththat wwwont kestrel promised and was rewarded with a smile a warm and lovely smile that said you understand and he did he truly did besides it was not all that difficult a promise to fulfill with all of the creatures of alanda surely there was a bird like that somewhere well said harperus popping his head out of the door of his vehicle are you ready i think so unless you want to come down here and look things over first robin called up to him he nodded that amazing hair was all tucked under a shiny hood the hood of a coat made of the same shiny blue material water slid right off it without soaking in as if it were made of bright metal like the wagon itself good idea i probably know a bit more about wagons than you do little one unless youve studied them since i saw you last or this young man is an expert kestrel shook his head not trusting his voice he would surely stutter and look a fool robin laughed this young man is my vanderlan old curiosity you vanderie harperus seemed as delighted as he was surprised which was something of a relief to kestrel it must be a truelove match then for you would never settle for less my felicitations and blessings my children not that you need either from me or anyone else he leapt down to the ground with remarkable agility for someone who was a hundred years old or maybe two hundred he held out his hand to kestrel who took it and shook it gingerly then harperus kissed gwyna chastely on one cheek and that is all you shall get from me you young minx he said when she pouted forget your flirtations please i have no wish to make your young man jealous or he will begin to look daggers at me when kestrel grinned shyly and managed rrrobin ccan tttake cccare of herssself the deliambren laughed with pure delight i see you have yourself a wise partner pretty bird harperus said with approval now let me have a look at this bit of a predicament he continued talking as he peered under the wagon then extracted an object from his coat and did something around the axle flashes of light came from beneath and kestrel wondered what he could be doing under there are you new to the free bards youngster he asked kestrel his voice emerging from beneath the wagon as if from the bottom of a well i dont recall anyone mentioning someone of your description before now kestrel was in a quandary he wanted desperately to talk to this manbut he was afraid that his stutter would make him sound like a fool but then harperus cocked his head just enough so that he could look out and kestrel could see one intelligent eye peering up at him the color of that eye was oddnot quite brown not quite yellow a metallic gold perhaps with the soft patina of very old metal take it slowly lad and take your time in answering im in no great hurry and you mustnt be ashamed if you have a trifle of trouble speaking plenty of intelligent people do it is often because they are so intelligent that their thoughts run far ahead of their mouths simply work with one word at a time as if you were composing a lyric aloud kestrel was momentarily speechless but this time with gratitude ihave only bbeen wwwith the fffree bbards since ffirst hharvest fffaire we found him wren and lark and i i mean gwyna put in she gave kestrel an inquiring glance he nodded vigorously much relieved that she wished to tell their story better she tell the tale if he tried theyd be here all day she summed up the entire mad story in a few succinct sentences harperus made exclamations from time to time sounds that were muffled by the fact that he was halfway under the wagon by now finally he emerged amazingly mudfree and dry fascinating he said eying jonny as if he meant it absolutely fascinating i must hear more of this and in detail i must have a record of all thisit could be very significant in the next few years robin laughed at him you and your datas she mockscolded thats all you people are interested in data he corrected mildly the singular is the same as the plural it is data whatever she replied you deliambrens are the worst old maids i ever saw you cant ever hear a story without wanting every single detail of it like sharpnosed old biddies with nothing more on your minds than gossip to kestrels surprise harperus did not take any offense at gwynas words it is all information my dear child he told her and information is yet another thing that we collect analyze and sell somewhere sometime there will be someone who will want to know about this story for there will be all manner of rumors and wild versions of it before the winter is over and we will tell him for a price and he will trust our version for he will know it to be composed of nothing but the facts facts are what we sell among other things just so long as you dont sell him who we are and where we are robin replied sharply suddenly suspicious those same people could be more interested in using jonny than in facts my friend you people you know better than that he said with immense dignity now however is not the time to discuss the ethics of informationselling firstly it is very wet tell me something i dont know robin exclaimed tossing her sodden hair impatiently and secondly i have some bad news concerning your wagon i fear you have cracked the axle he tsked and shook his head as robin winced and jonny bit off a groan that was something they could not fix themselves not without help at any rate it is just as well that you could not budge it you might have caused more damage if you had attempted to drive on it that would break it within a league he nodded as gwyna grimaced you must go somewhere there is a cartwright i do not have the equipment to fix a vehicle such as yours i know where theres a cartwright and it isnt that far from here but robin began biting her lip anxiously he brightened ah well then in that case there is no true problem i can get you out without further damage and i can tow your wagon without breaking the axle kestrel gaped at him how he gasped harperus laughed watch he said and see am i not a deliambren there will be wonders or at leasthe amended with a sheepish smilethere will be winches chapter three there were indeed winches just as harperus promised or a winch with a hook on the end of a cable a winch that swung out from the back of harperus vehicle once gwyna had an idea of what he intended she made him wait while she extinguished the fire in the charcoal stove there was no point in risking coals spilling and setting fire to the entire wagon it was quite a powerful winch although not at all magical simply very well made harperus maneuvered his huge wagon so that the winch was as close to the back of their wagon as possible without the wheels of his vehicle leaving the firm roadbed then he unwound the cable fastened the hook of his winch to the chains they already had in place and enlisted the help of both bards with the businessend of the winch it required handcranking if there were any of the magical machines legend painted anywhere in or on the wagon they were not in evidence as the two bards helped harperus turn the capstan the cable and chains slowly tightened then the rear rose with a wide and amusing variety of odd noises as the mud fought against releasing the wheels the mud was no match for harperus winch jonny was relieved at how relatively easy it was to crank it up by hand he knew a little a very little about machinery this winch must have some clever gearing to make it so easy to use as the wagon creaked and groaned the wheels pulled free with a sucking sound and rose above the muck blobs of thick mud plopped back into their parent pothole they didnt stop there harperus continued to winch the wagon higher until the damaged rear was well above the roadbed jonny hoped that everything was stowed away properly in there if it wasnt well there was no hope for it it was going to be a mess inside with things tumbled everywhere a small price to pay for getting out without losing the axle while moving that would have caused more than a mess they might have lost the whole wagon they surely would have been injured perhaps seriously depending on how fast they would have been going when the axle broke the rain finally slacked off and by the time harperus was ready to actually haul their wagon up onto the road it had thinned to a mere drizzle they fastened the halters of the mares to the frontnow the rearof their wagon stowed the harness away in the exterior storage boxes under the drivers seat but left the blankets on them and put away the tarpaulin and nose bags the mares didnt look unhappy about moving they couldnt have been very comfortable in the rain and chill wind before too very long everything was ready harperus checked and doublechecked everything from the set of the hook to the lock on the winch before he had convinced himself that all was as it should be then with a selfsatisfied grin he handed them both up to the drivers bench on his wagon jonny admired the arrangement as he took his place there was a clever set of steps built into the front of the wagon and the front panel had a door set into it harperus took his place beside them handling the reins of all four horses with the confidence of long practice he clucked to them and shook the reins the four huge horses leaned forward into their harnesses pulling with a will the wagon crawled forward the wheels creaked and squealed and more creaks and groans came from the gypsy wagon behind them as harperus sought to pull it free sucking mud made obscene sounds that sent robin into giggles kestrel leaned around the side of the drivers box and gazed anxiously back at their precious wagon but harperus knew what he was doing the wagon was fine protesting but fine inch by inch bit by bit harperus pulled it free of the mud that had held them trapped for most of the day as the front wheels rolled up onto the roadbed with a rumble and a crunch of gravel kestrel let out a sigh of relief and pulled his head back in under the shelter of the roof harperus regarded him with faint disappointment you doubted me he accused nnot yyou kestrel protested i wwwasnt sure abbbout our wwwwagon ah harperus beamed with the pleasure of accomplishment then his expression changed to one of concern oh you two look nearfrozen and youre certainly soaked there are blankets under the bench wrap yourselves up in them before you catch something kestrel was a little disappointed he wanted badly to have a look inside the fascinating vehicle and it would have been nice if harperus had invited them to go inside to warm up he sighed as he fished around under his seat with one hand until he encountered something soft that felt like cloth he pulled it out it was a blanket with no discernible weave of a tan color nearly the same as all the mud it seemed awfully light and thin to do any good but it was better than nothing or so he thought until he actually wrapped it around his shoulders and head suddenly he was warmer much warmer andwas he getting drier as well it seemed so he stared at harperus in surprise the deliambren returned his look blandly maybe all the wonders werent inside the wagon after all he began examining the drivers box covertly while pretending to watch the horses they were under as much shelter as most porches on a house provided the drivers seat was wellpadded and quite soft covered with something that looked superficially like leather but didnt feel quite like leather and now that they were moving there was a gentle stream of warm air coming from underneath it drying his feet the box itself was quite spacious with a great deal of room behind the drivers bench more than had been apparent from the ground there was quite enough room for all three of them on the bench sidebyside and there was enough room for a second bench behind the first maybe harperus intended to put one in some day for passengers who would rather not ride inside the wagon then he noticed something else now that they were on the move the horses did not seem to be leaning into their harness at all in fact on a closer look he would have said if he were asked that they were guiding the wagon rather than pulling it they certainly werent straining in the least could it be that the wagon propelled itself and their presence was a deception it was certainly a very good possibility but his curiosity would have to go unappeased he had no way of checking his supposition and if harperus did not want them to know something then that was his business still that didnt help assuage his curiosity in the least the deliambren was the first nonhuman being kestrel had ever seen up close with the exception of the elves who had attended the wedding there had been both a mintak and a gazner at king rolends palace but they were ambassadors of some kind and he had not wanted to approach them that had been more caution on his part he could not have gone near them without causing new suspicions in his uncles mind just when it had been settled he had been very very careful how he looked and acted around rolends court why would he be talking to a foreign ambassador after he had renounced his title rolend would have immediately suspected he was intriguing perhaps plotting with nonhumans looking for a way to get power again surely that is how rolend would have thought of it he had told himself that he had the rest of his life to talk to anyone he wanted what would have been the point of creating trouble when eventually he would find other nonhumans to talk to freely he wanted to ask lord harperus thousands of questions harperus seemed amazingly approachable and quite affable gwyna had closed her eyes and was settling back for a nap so he wouldnt be interrupting anything she had planned whwhat are yyyou ddoing out here lllord he asked trying to frame each word carefully gwyna snuggled into his shoulder and gave him a little smile and a nudge of encouragement what is my reason for being on the road do you mean harperus replied and chuckled as robin grimaced a little collecting information as your dear lady will tell you we deliambrens do an inordinate amount of that this is a much more elaborate vehicle than i am wont to use however as i assume our gypsy robin has noted i am also acting as an advance scout of a kind this time my people will be embarking on a most ambitious project shortly and i am establishing contacts for them so that they will never lack for allies on the ground in the initial part of the journey ambitious project robin said just what do you mean by that she sounded suspicious again and her eyes opened but narrowed thoughtfully are you planning something we gypsies ought to know about nothing sinister my dear harperus replied soothingly in fact it is something that your people will find useful i think we intend to make mapsmaps of all of alanda eventually and those like the gypsies who assist us will get maps for their efforts road maps terrain maps population maps resource mapswe intend to build something we call a data base so that if someone has an abundance of corn or copper coal or precataclysm artifacts we will be able to find a buyer for him which information you will no doubt give him for a price robin said dryly but despite her heavy irony she had relaxed again and was braiding her hair and if he does not have the means to transport his product or fears being cheated we can act as broker harperus replied just as blandly why not we also have an honorable intent though you might not believe it gypsy robin he added we intend to see to it that those with superior forces do not take those resources that do not belong to them i mean this he finished his voice suddenly without any hint of humor i am quite quite serious about this before the cataclysm my people acted as a policing force among the stars presumably the rest of them still do somewhere now that we have stabilized our position and regained our mobility our mission can be resumed albeit on a smaller scale it is after all in our interest to see that no culture is exploited they are all potential customers when all is said and done huh gwyna replied so now youre looking for more allies than just the gypsies allies on the ground yes harperus replied we cannot do everything we will need folk we can trust in or near every land we travel through in case there are things we need or repairs we need to make allies on the ground an interesting choice of words did they imply that this project would involve people traveling through the air were they going to bring one of those airwagons robin had described out into alanda how much dared he ask without becoming impolite or worse perceived as dangerous harperus had power money and resources he could not even dream of it would be very foolish to make harperus think he might be a threat of any kind hhhow long hhhave you knknown rrobin he asked instead of the questions he wanted to ask perhaps after feeling the deliambren out he could ask them later oh since she was very young harperus told him turning to wink at him the skin around the deliambrens eyes crinkled when he smiled and he pulled back the hood of his coat and shook his hair free i first met her when her clan came to perform at the four worlds festival she was always getting into places she was not supposed to and i was detailed to keep an eye on her me gwyna exclaimed i never then she began to cough as if she had not intended to say anything most adventuresome was her foray into the upper reaches of the butterfly conservatory i had no notion that a fiveyearold could climb so high harperus continued as if he had not heard her protest most interesting was when she decided that the fountain in hazewood square required fish and began transporting them in her bare hands one at a time from the viewponds in the aquarium nearby amazingly they all survived the trip it was quite a surprise to the fountainkeepers however he turned to gwyna who was blushing furiously how did you catch them anyway i have never been able to figure that out i tickled them she said in a small choked voice you tickled them harperus shook his head and peered ahead through the curtain of rain some sort of obscure gypsy secret i suppose he turned back to kestrel at any rate i have been the adopted uncle for any number of gypsy youngsters and she is one of them although i must admit that our dear robin is one of my favorites kestrel relaxed a trifle if robin had known him that long ago then certainly he was not one of the odd creatures you heard about from time to time whose behavior was so bizarre you never knew whether they considered themselves your dearest friend or your worst enemy dddo you dddo mmuch trtraveling he asked i would say that i am probably on the road for about half of the year harperus said after a moment of thought the wagon swayed slightly beneath them nothing like the rough jouncing of their own little caravan some of us enjoy traveling trading and gathering information and those of us who do spend as much time out and about as we may usually we travel in wagons about the size of yours and there is very little to distinguish it from a gypsy caravan frankly dear boy i would not have taken this vehicle if it were not for two things and one of them is that it can defend itself from an unpleasant visitor it is far too conspicuous for my liking a little shiver ran down kestrels back at that it can defend itself he could not even begin to imagine what that could imply he did not want to find out at first hand and he was very glad that harperus did not consider them unpleasant visitors have you made any good bargains lately gwyna asked casually harperus brightened at that and began rattling off a number of trades that he considered to be something of a coup a laser imaging system still functional if you can believe it for a small glasssmelting furnace a complete cache of memory crystals for an equal number of precious stones or rather kestrel assumed they were precious harperus referred to them as cultured pearls rubies and sapphires kestrel was not certain just what cultured meant perhaps they were better educated than other gems something else harperus said made him feel a little better you know value lies in rarity really the deliambren told gwyna when she raised her eyebrow and asked who had gotten the real bargain they were using the memory crystals for jewelry and valued them no more than quartz we simply gave them something better suited to displayand tripled our library to us memory crystals are rare to them our cultured stones are everyone benefits and no one feels cheated that is the essence of a good bargain gwyna laughed and told him he would never make a horsetrader and then settled back for a real nap against kestrels shoulder as the rain changed to a dismal drizzle he held her with an arm around her shoulders supporting her so that she could nap as the unknown source of warmth beneath their seats dried them all and made her drowsy harperus patiently waited through kestrels stuttering and answered all of his questions though jonny could not tell just how much of what he said was evasion finally he turned the tables on the free bard and began his own series of questions mostly he concentrated on kestrels own story and seemed particularly fascinated by the intervention of rune and talaysen and the latters discovery of the power of bardic magic i have often suspected something of the sort existed among you humans harperus said thoughtfully particularly in light of some things i have seen gypsy bards docalming crowds that were in an ugly mood or charming coins out of the previously unwilling fascinating and you have this power wren sssays ssso kestrel replied but with uncertainty and he says gggwyna does too i ththink hes rrright bbut i dddont know if i wwwwant ttto use it sssince it ccan ccause as mmuch ttrouble as it ssolves harperus nodded his face very still and sober i can understand thatbut you may be forced to you should at least master this power before it masters you not learning to use it could be more hazardous than mastering it jonny shook his head if you do not learn how to control this magic it may act without your knowledge or control harperus amended let me give you an example some peoples we have encountered have the power to read the thoughts of othersand if they do not learn how to do this at their will it happens without control and they can be overwhelmed by intruding thoughts so that they do not know who where or even what they are do you understand now kestrel nodded then and harperus was right if he did not learn how it felt to invoke this magic he might use it when he didnt want to and that could have some unfortunate consequences especially if he was using it on someone who had the ability to tell when magic was being used and had a reason to resent it being used on him if i may bring up a possibly delicate subject harperus said carefully yourahdifficulty in speaking kestrel flushed wren ththinks its bbecause of the ffffever i cccaught when wwwe escccaped bbbirnam harperus shook his head i would think not from all that i know such a problem is more because of some kind of extreme upset in the past your escape i would say is itself to blame and the fear and stress you went through not the fever my people have been known to treat such things and they are usually successful may i offer some advice jonny nodded eagerly wren had some advice to give but he had been no expert and admitted it no one else had anything to say on the subject robin didnt seem to carebut it would have been so wonderful to tell her all the things she deserved to hear without falling all over the words as i said this is sometimes the case of your mind running ahead of your words first you must learn to relax and think about the words not about what your listener is going to think when he hears you harperus smiled as he saw jonnys eyes widen with surprise you see some of this is also from tension you wish to make a good impression so you tense up your mind runs on ahead and ceases to control your speech so the tension makes you stammer you stutteryou fear you are making a bad impressionyou grow tenserand you stutter more you try to speak faster to get your words out through the stuttering and this makes you more tense which makes it worse yet if you relax and take things at their own slow pace you will find your problem easing think of each word as a note in a melody and pronounce it with the care you have in singing and do not think about your listener when you sing what are you thinking of the audience or the song the sssong kestrel replied in surprise i alwwways rrelax when i ssing and you do not stutter i wager harperus shrugged this is how i would begin to overcome the difficulty the rest is much much patience it will take a very long time and you must not be discouraged it took perhaps ten years to establish this pattern in you it cannot be unlearned in a day or a week or even a year necessarily but you will improve a very little every time you speak and people who have not heard you for some time will be astonished at what you think is no progress at all kestrel bit his lip and stared at the ears of the nearest horse he wanted a magical cure for harperus to touch his lips with a machine and make the stutter go away but something that could take the stutter away might not keep it away and understanding it might he raised his eyes and stared at the road ahead misty in the steadily falling rain and followed the deliambrens advice concentrating on each word thank you llord harperus he managed with a minimal stammer i will ttry your advvice i hope that it works harperus replied earnestly and try to keep this in mind every time you are tempted to hurry your words it will take longer to get them out if you stammer than if you took your time with them you are a good young man and a bright one you do not speak without much thought a wise man will be willing to wait to hear your words and you need not waste them on a fool he might have said more except that at that moment there was a polite tap on the wall of the driving box behind them kestrels head snapped around as the back of the box slid open so that was how harperus had gotten in and out of his wagon and evidently harperus was not alone on this collecting mission of his harperus said a deep resonant voice from the darkness beyond the open door i wonder if i might join you and your guests the opening was shrouded in shadow and all jonny saw was a vague humpbacked shape in the darkness but the voice sent a thrill of pleasure down his spine it was a pure delight simply to hear it a deep bass rich with controlled vibrato certainly tfyrr the deliambren replied immediately there are no xenophobes here im sure my friends would welcome meeting you and your company i am pleased to hear it the voice replied and the shapeless figure who was shrouded in fabric or an allenveloping cloak ducked its head and came out into the light it was not wearing a cloak as it carefully closed the door at the rear of the box behind it with one taloned hand and folded down a hithertoinvisible seat from the side of the box the shrouding cloak proved to be a set of wings and the hood headfeathers gwyna woke from her half sleep to glance at and then stare at harperus road companion tfyrr was nothing more or less than a true nonhuman an enormous birdman as the being arranged himself on the seat with a care to those folded wings and a tail that must have made most chairs impossible for him harperus made introductions tfyrr this is gwyna who is also called robin she is a gypsy and a free bard and i believe i have mentioned her before this is her husband jonny who is called kestrel he is also a free bard as you know tfyrr all free bards have tradenames so that the bardic guild will never know precisely who they truly are in public you must call them robin and kestrel my friends this is tfyrr the huge beakquite obviously that of a raptorgaped open in what was very likely tfyrrs attempt at a smile i see from your expressions that you have never met one of my kind before this you should not be surprised since the haspur do not travel much outside their own land and few wish to venture into it my land is very mountainous and since we fly we have not made such niceties as roads and bridges this makes it difficult for the winglessand thus the harder to invade so you keep it that way robin had recovered enough to show her sense of humor as a gypsy i approve our way to keep from being hunted and hounded is never to stay in one place for more than a day or two the best defense is to let something besides yourself provide the weapons and barriers so we say much talk of weapons and dangers but our world is not a kind one tfyrr said towards harperus in what must have been a private joke the avian had very little difficulty with human speech despite his lack of lips and jonny was completely fascinated how could something with that huge stiff beak manage human words he watched closely as tfyrr spoke your tttongue he blurted aloud without thinking tfyrr intuited what he meant with no difficulty and laughed a low odd sort of caw it is very mobile yes a kind of finger almost this is a good thing for i like the two of you am a singer of songs and i am thus not limited to those of my own people youre a bard gwyna exclaimed do they have such things among your folk a kind of bard indeed though i am far more like the free bards we do not have anything like this guild harperus has told me of he made a clicking sound that expressed very real disapproval they seek to cage music or so it would seem i like them not it is a pursuit for fools a waste of intellect gwyna grimaced we dont like them either free bards dont believe in caging anything music people or thoughts within moments the two of them were immersed in a deep discussion of freedom thought the politics of both and other philosophical considerations much to harperus amusement jonny was completely content with the situation since it gave him the opportunity to study tfyrr to his hearts content the only thing at all human about the birdman was his voice and his stance upright on two legs he had just told them that the wings he bore on his back were entirely functional and jonny would have given a great deal to see him in flight as large as he was his wingspan must be very impressive he was as completely feathered as any bird jonny had ever seen from the top of his head to his knees his hands were modifications of his feet both had sharp talons on fingers and toes and scaled skin stretched over bone with prominent thin strong muscles beneath the skin those feet and hands were formidable weapons kestrel was quite certainand he was just as certain that in a pinch tfyrr would not hesitate to use his strong sharp beak as a weapon as well tfyrrs chest was very deep much deeper than the chest of a human and probably accounted for the resonance of his voice in color he was a graybrown with touches of scarlet on the very edges of his wings and tail he wore clothing of a sort a closetailored wrapping that covered his torso without impeding the movement of any limbs or his wings and tail it did not look very warm and jonny did not blame tfyrr for staying in the shelter of the wagon until now an odd spicy scent came from his feathersor perhaps from his clothingwhen he moved very pleasant and aromatic but it was his voice that interested jonnyas a musician there were over and undertones to his speaking voice that made jonny sure his singing voice would be incredibly rich it would surely sound as if it were three people singing in close harmony rather than one i am a folklorist he said at last when the discussion of philosophy ended in mutual agreement i am collecting songs most particularly songs of what my people refer to as the outreach era when we first ventured outside of our borders after the cataclysm we have long known of the deliambrens and in fact have traded with them for certain rarities when it became obvious that to complete my quest for certain knowledge i would have to go outside the skytouching mountains and the aeries of my people i knew whom i must recruit to my efforts he nodded at harperus who chuckled and bowed i think it was a matter of mutual recruitment harperus said modestly after all there are things even deliambrens cannot do and that is to fly without a machine we are trading in skills he originally pledged to aid me in return for deliambren aid when i asked if he would aid me now he agreed he is to scout by air for me i am to help him continue his musical quest he and his people have a way of capturing music and sound and holding it we had this ability before the cataclysm but we have lost the skill of making the devices as well as the tooling tfyrr said before harperus could finish his sentence so there you have it we aid each other and we each have skills the other does not i had been learning the songs i did not know from harperus collection at about the time i had learned all that he had he decided to go out on this collecting venture and asked if i would pay my debt by accompanying him when i learned he would be visiting some of the lands where my songs originated i agreed of course jonny was completely fascinated and a bit dazzled after years of hearing about exotic creatures and never meeting one he had just encountered not one but two in the same day so while gwyna engaged both harperus and tfyrr in yet another discussion this time concerning politics he simply sat quietly and watched and listened with every nerve gwyna was charmed by kestrels open fascination with both lord harperus and tfyrr although she did not share itor at least not to the same extent she had been around nonhumans all of her life after all her clan had often been asked to perform by harperus and there were any number of talented linguists in her family so they were often requested as translators wherever they went while she had never seen a birdman before and she was intrigued by the sheer novelty of such a creature the novelty wore off fairly quickly she was far more interested in what harperus and his companion had seen and heard so far on this trip and in the philosophies of an avian race which to her seemed very complimentary to the gypsy way of life harperus wagon astounded and intrigued her far more than either harperus or his friend she didnt often lust after anything material but she had the feeling that the more she saw of this wonderful conveyance the more she would want it for one thing it was quite obvious to anyone who knew horses that this thing was propelling itself the horses were only there for guidance and she had not missed the fact that harperus had disconnected some esoteric device before he had asked for their help in winding up the winch if she and kestrel had not been present he probably would not have used that capstan at all doors appeared in walls that seemed solid seats could be folded down out of nowhere the wagon itself had glass windows with metal sides that obviously required neither painting nor maintenance what a timesaver that would be there was none of the jouncing around associated with their vehicle and she rather doubted that harperus would ever suffer the inconvenience of a broken wheel or a cracked axle the heated air coming up beneath their seat must be coming from somewhere and only gave a hint of how comfortable the interior of this vehicle must be she already knew about the deliambrens magical heating and lighting and she could not imagine harperus doing without either and harperus little dropped comment about how the wagon could defend itself there must be wonder upon wonder inside this vehicle and she wanted to see the inside badly and yet if she didshe would have to try to calculate just how much it would take to get the deliambrens to part with enough of their precious technology to give her something like the luxurious appointments in this thing and she had the horrible suspicion that it would require selling herself jonny and any children unto the ninth generation into virtual slavery to acquire it but wouldnt they thank you for it every time they woke in warmth or cool comfort maybe if she saved harperus life or something even as part of her was thinking these thoughts the rest was aghast how could she want anything that badly wasnt she a gypsy and a free bard how could she even think about becoming tied down to anything or anyone for the sake of a mere possession but that interior voice of greed wailed to get her mind off that greedy little inner self she turned the subject to politics the deliambrens always wanted to hear about politics for politics affected trade and trade was a large part of their life and there were serious changes occurring changes that seemed minor and subtle but could build to devastating results it isnt just the bardic guild though its the worst of the lot what talaysen thinks is that the guilds are trying to get as much power as the dukes she said after describing some of the troubles the bardic guild had been causing for the free bards and the high king seems to be letting them get away with it harperus looked troubled i fear that is because the high king has lost interest in governing the lesser kings he said after a moment there is much unrest among the twenty kings and more still among the nobles many of them have gone back to feuding quarrels which would have been strictly squashed a few years ago there is something amiss in the high kings court what is worse to my mind is that the guild and the church seem to be working together to cause problems for anyone who does not agree to the rules of the guild and church gwyna said and the high king is letting them get away with this but the twenty human kingdoms are but a small part of alanda tfyrr objected flipping his wings impatiently they are insignificant in scale surely harperus you concern yourself too much with them they are a small part it is true but they are strategically placed harperus pointed out if there is war among them as there was in the days before the high king they can effectively cut us off from many things that we need and as you have often pointed out to me humans breed like rabbits gwyna interjected with some sarcasm they may only be the twenty kingdoms but they have spread out to occupy a great deal more territory than they held originally we arent a peaceful species harperus and i dont care how superior your weapons are my friend enough bodies with spears and swords can take over that precious fortress city of yours either by treachery or by siege while they may not have the stomach for losses that great they can certainly lock you inside that fortress for ever and aye that had not escaped our notice was all harperus said but though his tone of voice was mild she detected an edge to it this is the other of the reasons why i was willing to take this particular vehicle i can leave small devices now that can collect more information without the need for human agents i fear that we will have need of such information gwyna sighed are we heading for the waymeet between westhaven and carthell abbey she asked if we are that would be a good place to talk to people and to leave one of your little collectors both im certain that the waymeet family will give you no difficulty over leaving such a thing at harperus nod tfyrr asked with puzzlement what is a waymeet you have not told me of this i did not tell you because we were not going there until we encountered our two young friends harperus replied but robin tells me that there is a cartwright there and a cartwright is what they most urgently need at the moment the gypsies created the waymeets gwyna told the haspur we created them and we continue to run them even though now there are a number of nongypsies who know about them and use them she thought for a moment she had lived with the knowledge of waymeets all her life and had never needed to describe them to anyone before you find them just off the major trade roads she continued finally theyre a special permanent campingplace with a caretaker certain things like bathhouses and laundries a small market and a population of craftsmen one thing is pretty important theyre all on land that doesnt belong to anyone not duke nor sire not guild nor church and another no one stays there more than a few days at a time except when bad weather really bogs things down i know there will be a cartwright there which solves our problem and there will be people for harperus to talk to with fresher news than ours tfyrr nodded as he followed her words and the caretaker charges a certain amount for the amenities he hazarded such things would make camping there more attractive than camping in the wilderness civilized exactly so she said nodding theyre also as the old owl here well knows excellent places to pick up information gossip or both people speak more freely thereand if i pass the word she added a little arrogantly they will speak very freely to him harperus smiled i am certain of that gypsy robin for all of us this waymeet will be most productive chapter four stillwater waymeet lay just off the main trade road down a lane of its own that wascurrently at leastin better repair than the trade road the sire had not been keeping up his road repairs lately another sign that the king of rayden had become lax in seeing that his nobles attended to their duties probably the road would remain in poor repair until a guild master or a high churchman had to pass this way ruts were the least of the problems along the trade road much worse were the potholes at the edge of the road that gradually crept into the rightofway and formed an actual hazard to traffic by contrast the waymeet lane was smooth graded gravel welltended and potholes had not been permitted to form on the edge there was a single sign at the joining of the lane and the road a sign that said stillwater waymeet and had little carvings of a bucket of water a caravan and an ear of wheat signifying that water camping and food were available as large as it was harperus wagon negotiated the turn easily although the wagon filled the entire lane and the wheels were a scant finger length from the edge of the gravel robin yawned discreetly it had been a very long day and trying to get their wagon out of the mud had pretty much done her in as thick as the clouds were there had been no real sunset only a gradual thickening of the darkness it was dusk now though a thick blue dusk with darker blue shadows under the trees and she was going to be very glad to stop get something hot to eat and get to sleep how long is it to the waymeet itself harperus asked probably puzzled by the fact that the long tunnel of trees arching over the lane gave the illusion that it went on without any end most of the leaves had fallen from the seasonal trees but there was a healthy percentage of evergreens along here that kept the lights of the waymeet from showing despite the constant rain the bitter scent of dead leaves hung in the air along the lane and the gravel was covered with a carpet of fallen leaves that muffled the steady clopping of the horses hooves not far robin assured him theres a slight sshaped bend up ahead that you cant see from here it keeps this from being a straight line to the road keeps people from driving up like maniacs and running someone over the gypsies were responsible for the creation of the waymeets building them up from a series of regular camping grounds along the roads when a camping site always seemed to hold at least two gypsy families and never was completely unoccupied people would naturally begin to improve it after a while permanent if crude amenities protected fire pits stocks of wood bathing and laundry areas wells were built at such places slightly more elaborate than similar arrangements at large fairesites with people always at a site there was little chance that such amenities would be vandalized and incentive to take care of them then the next logical extension was for someone to decide he was tired of living on the road but did not want to live in a town that unknown gypsy had settled instead at one of those camping grounds and had built not only living quarters for himself and his family but a bathhouse a laundry and a trading post and had begun selling odds and ends to the others who came to camp this had the result of bringing in more campers after all why take the possibly dangerous step of camping alone when you could go somewhere not only safe but which boasted some small luxuries from that moment it was only a matter of time before others who wished to retire in the same manner found other such sites and did the same thing then someone had the bright notion to open the sites up to anyone who traveled the traderoads for a fee the results of these enterprises were varied some waymeets wound up resembling an inn but without a building to house travelers some turned out as was the case with stillwater rather along the lines of a village without the insularity robin had been to stillwater many times the camping grounds were laid out in sections for wagons and for tents and patrolled by the proprietors two tall sons and three of his cousins to discourage theft and misbehavior there was clean water in both a stream and a well it also boasted a bathhouse and laundry a cartwright a blacksmith and a carpenter a small store sold the kinds of things people who traveled often broke lost or forgot it served as a trading post for those who had goods to trade or sell the fee to camp was minimal the fees charged for the other services reasonable virtually all of the permanent residents were gypsies since generally any gypsy who wished to retire from the road but still wanted the excitement of life on the road looked for a waymeet that needed another hand about the place at a waymeet it was possible to have most of the excitement and change of traveling without ever leaving your home waymeets were well known and their locations clearly marked on most maps since most experienced travelers with their own wagons used themoften in preference to the church hostels set up for similar purposes most merchants would rather pay the higher fees of the waymeets than endure the lodgingwithsermons one got at the hostels only in truly vicious winter weather were the hostels more popular than the waymeets the result was a peculiar village where the entire population changed over the course of a weekmore often than that in summer when travel was easier as they rounded the first curve the lights of the waymeet began to glimmer through the screening of trees as they rounded the second the waymeet lay spread out before them right on the lane at the entrance surrounded by lanterns on posts was the building housing the laundry bathhouse store and proprietors quarters a tall handsome young gypsy was already waiting for them beside the lane as harperus pulled up he wore a cape of oiled canvas against the rain but he had pulled the hood back and mistbeads glistened in the lantern light as they collected on his midnightblack hair not full are you harperus asked anxiously as the young man strolled over to the drivers box after appraising the horses with an admiring eye fullish old owl but not fullup the young man replied its about the last chance of the season for traders an we got folk comin home from harvest faires ye dont recognize me i reckon but im jackdaw guitan clan i mind i met you when i was kneehigh youre the lad with the knack with pennywhistles harperus exclaimed to the young mans delighted smile that the deliambren had remembered him dear heavens has it been that long since i saw you last how did you come here i thought you and your family were somewhere near shackleford sister went vanderei with blackfox he got stillwater from his nuncle reckoned he could use some hands an tough heads jackdaw shrugged and grinned his teeth gleaming whitely in the gathering dusk not much call for a pennywhistle carver and never could carve naught else fees ten copper pennies for th two wagons indefinite stay you bein free bard an all he peered through the gloom and robin spoke up to save his eyes robin of kadash clan vanderei with free bard kestrel i hope the cartwright isnt fullup weve got a cracked axle or so old owl says the road has gone all to pieces since i was here last nay nay nothin he cant put aside anyway since hes a cousin jackdaw looked the pair of wagons over with an expert eye kin come afore gajo ill tell him t come look you over as soon as this blasted rain clears right about the road though an the sire aint done nothin about it probly wont till he breaks his own axle tell you what theres two sites all the way at the end of the last row left pull both rigs into the first site drop the little wagon then pull the big un up into the second site youll both be right an tight t pull straight out when y please robin had already pulled out her purse and passed the ten coppers over to jackdaw before harperus had a chance to protest or pay the lad himself you pulled us out and towed us here so let me discharge the debt and cover your fee she said firmly harperus had known gypsies more than long enough to understand the intricate dance of discharging debt so he did not argue he simply followed jackdaws instructions and drove the horses to the nexttolast path on the left then all the way down to the end the lanes were also marked clearly with lantern poles with another set of poles halfway down and large white stones marking the place to pull into each site parking the wagons was as simple as jackdaw had stated which was a relief robin had known far too many gypsies who would try to wedge a wagon into a space meant for a oneman tentshelter the camping sites were on firm level grass with trees and bushes between each adjoining site and a rockrimmed sandlined fire pit for each site as well robin didnt get a chance to see much of the waymeet however for by the time they were parked and the horses unhitched night had fallen and a thick darkness made more impenetrable by the mist had taken over the area kestrel took all six horses to the common corral and stable area shelter was provided and water but food must either be bought or supplied from their own stores just as he left the mist thickened and then the rain resumed pouring down just as hard as it had during the day robin cursed under her breath and harperus looked annoyed tfyrr you stay in the wagon he ordered there is nothing worse than the smell of wet feathers and i dont want to chance you catching something in this cold robin and i can deal with unhitching her caravan and pushing it back he did something at the side of the drivers box and soft white lights came on at the rear and the front of his wagon robins eyes widened but she said nothing the lights looked exactly like oil lamps and if you had not seen them spring to life so suddenly and magically you might have thought that was what they really were a flamelike construction flickered inside frosted glass in a very realistic manner but the flames were just a little too regular in their flickering there was certainly a pattern there and besides oil lamps required someone or something to light them they simply didnt light themselves then she shrugged mentally if harperus wanted to make things look as if he was driving a perfectly normalif rather largewagon that was his privilege if he wanted to pretend that he had no deliambren secrets in there that was his problem no one who had ever seen deliambren magic was going to be fooled for a second the glass in the windows was enough to show this was no ordinary wagon and the smooth metal sides were too unlike a wooden caravan to ever deceive anyone together they cranked the winchedup caravan down it was no problem for only two to handle even in the downpour since it was always easier to get something down than it was to get it up and it was not as hard as she had thought it would be to push the caravan back a few paces from the rear of harperus wagon the wheels moved easily on the wet grass harperus climbed under the damaged rear end again and poked and prodded and created his mysterious little flashes of light then finally emerged and shook water and bits of leaves off his hands that axle will hold your weight i think he said as robins nose turned cold and she shivered in the light breeze i wouldnt worry about sleeping or moving around in the wagon i wouldnt trust it to take the abuse of the road but sitting here on grass there should be no problems she had no idea how harperus could tell all of this just by looking at the axleor what little could be seen of the axle inside its enclosurebut she was quite confident that he was right deliambrens were seldom if ever wrong about something that was physical or structural thank you old owl she said with gratitude i dont know how wed have managed if you hadnt come along he cut short her speech of gratitude with a wave of his hand you are freezing little one and all this can wait until morning i will go and see to our horses while you get something warm to eat and some sleep think of it as trade for the rumors you are going to track for me you can thank me in the morning all right she nodded with a tired sigh deliambrens as a whole were not very good at judging the strength of human emotions nor the strength of the actions that emotions were likely to induce but this time harperus had gauged her remaining reserves quite accurately right she said without any argument talk to me in the morning and let me know what you want me to listen for tomorrow what you want me to say to the others harperus nodded and turned back to his own wagon hurrying through the rain to the front which was the only place on the vehicle with an entrance the exterior lights went out as abruptly as they had come on as soon as she reached the door of her own little caravan no matter she knew where everything was and lit the four real oil lamps by feel filling the interior of the wagon with a mellow golden light and very grateful for the stock of sulfurmatches that had come with the wagon they were precious and hard to come by she only used one then lit the rest of the lamps from a splinter she kindled at the first lamp once again she lit the tiny charcoal stove and waited for the place to warm up the interior of the caravan was wellplanned as far as usable space went their bed was in the front just behind the drivers seat and the door there slid sideways rather than swinging open so that someone could lie on the bed and talk to the driver while the wagon moved down the road and on warm nights a curtain could be pulled across the opened door giving privacy and fresh air a second curtain could be pulled across the other side of the bed giving privacy from the rest of the wagon it was possible to sleep four in a pinch an ingenious table and bench arrangement on the righthand wall under the side window could be made into a bed just wide enough for two but the arrangement would not be good for long periods unless the people in that bed were children there was storage for their clothing under the bed more storage above it the stove was bolted away from the wall in the rear beside the rear door and had a cooking surface on the top of it storage for food was nearby and their pans and utensils hung from the ceiling above it there were small windows surrounded by shallow storage cabinets on either wall where they kept everything else they needed from instruments to harnessrepair kits the table and benches bolted to the wall and floor were beneath the righthand window and a builtin basin above a huge jar for fresh water with a spigot on the bottom were beneath the lefthand window the basin could be removed from its holder to be emptied out the window or filled from the jar harperus suggestion of hot food was a good one how long had it been since theyd eaten certainly not since noon still shivering she made the simplest possible hot meal toasting thick slices of bread and melting cheese over the top of themand putting a kettle for tea on top of the stove the activity kept her from feeling too cold and by the time kestrel returned the wagon had begun to warm igot the hhorsesput up kestrel told her as she stripped his sodden clothing from him and wrapped him in a thick robe made from the same material as their blankets and ffed goodhere eat this youll feel better she put a slice of toastandcheese in his left hand and a mug of tea wellsweetened with honey in his right with a smile of gratitude he started on both and next time i can put the horses up and you can make dinner ddone he agreed as he joined her on the bed thank goodness harperus came along she sighed wed still be out there if he hadnt jonny nodded ive nnever seen a ddeliambren before are ththey all like hhim so ccourteous most of them she sipped her tea carefully it was not that far from being scalding all of them would stop to help someone they knew and most would stop to help a stranger they can afford to with their magic there arent too many people who would be a threat to them ah he shifted a little more and tucked his feet in under his robe i wwas wwondering if they all are sosodddetached as if harperus is always observing the rest of the world without really being part of it she asked in reply and at his nod she pursed her lips they really are pretty much all like that she told him all the deliambrens ive met anyway they just dont understand our emotions but theyre completely fascinated by them i think thats why they enjoy being around the free bards and the gypsies they like to hear the songs that we sing that are full of very powerful emotions and they like to watch the emotional reactions of our listeners it seems to be a neverending source of entertainment for them kestrel made a face of distaste llike were ssome kind of bbug no not at all she hastened to tell him no its something like the fascination i have for watching someone blow glass i cant do it i dont understand it but i love to watch this fascination of theirs gets them in trouble toothey are very apt to go running off into a bad situation just because it looks interesting wren had to pull harperus out of a mob once for instance and another deliambren we know nearly got disemboweled for asking one too many questions about a particular sires lady she hoped harperus had more sense than that its not that they dont feel things they just dont express them the way we do harperus has a very good sense of humor and tells excellent jokesbut he cant always tell when things have turned serious and he cant always anticipate when serious things have turned deadly they seem on the surface to be very shallow people and ive heard some churchmen call them soulless because of that kestrels expression grew thoughtful ththe things the church is ssaying about ththe nnonhumans hhaving no souls and bbeing ddamned could be very very dangerous for the deliambrens she said catching his meaning and they dont even realize it they have no idea how very emotional people can be when it comes to religion and how irrational that can make them kestrel finished his bread took the last sip of his tea and put the mug down on one of the little shelves built above the foot of the bed mmaybe and mmaybe he dddoes he asked you tto listen for rrumors she licked her lips thoughtfully then nodded as a sudden flash of lightning illuminated the cracks around the doors and the shutters the thunder followed immediately deafening them both for a moment you might be right she admitted if so it may be the first time hes been able to figure out when hes treading on dangerous emotional ground but it ccan wait unttil tomorrow kestrel said firmly and took her mug away from her he put it down beside his own and then took her in his arms i mmay be ttired bbut i hhave other pplans and he proceeded to show her what those plans were afterwards they were so exhausted that not even the pounding rain the thunder or the brilliant lightning could keep them awake jonny woke first as usual he poked his nose out from under the blankets and took an experimental sniff of the chill air clear clean air but one without a lot of moisture in it maybe the rain had cleared off he opened up one eye and pulled back the curtain over the door by the bed sunlight poured through the crack and as he freed his head from the bedclothes he heard a bird singing madly probably a foolish jay with no notion that it should have gone south by now he smiled let the curtain fall and closed his eyes again in a few more minutes robin stirred right on schedule she cracked her eye open muttered something unintelligible about the birds and slowly painfully opened her eyes completely jonny grinned and stretched another day had begun he crawled past robin who muttered and curled up in the blankets she was never able to wake up properly so he was the one who made breakfast he got the stove going and made sausage tea and battercakes while she slowly unwound from the blankets he ate first then cleaned himself and the tiny kitchen up while she ate and about the time her breakfast was finished robin was capable of speaking coherently about the time she finished her second mug of tea the cartwright arrived kestrel left her to clean herself up and joined the cartwright in the clear and rainwashed morning there was no sign of life in harperus wagon but it was entirely possible that the deliambren and his guest were up and about long ago there was enough room in there for six or eight people to set up fulltime housekeeping certainly it was possible for harperus to be doing anything up to and including carpentry in that behemoth without any trace of activity to an outside watcher the cartwright was a taciturn individual although not sullen he seemed simply to be unwilling to part with too many words clearly another gypsy by his dark hair and olive skin his scarlet shirt and leather breeches he nodded a friendly greeting as jonny waved to him free bard kestrel he asked then crawled under the wagon without anything more than waiting for kestrels affirmative reply he had brought a number of small tools with him he took off the protective enclosure on the offending axle while kestrel watched with interest he studied the situation with no comment or expression on his dark face then replaced the cover and crawled back out right he said then cracked axle not bad start now done by nightfall fifty silver good axle is thirty ten each for me and crackle robin poked her head out of the wagon as he finished and kestrel blanched at the price of the repair they had it had it and a nice nestegg to spare but all the years of abject poverty made kestrel extremely reluctant to part with any money much less this much he looked to robin for advice was this fair or was the man gouging them robin shrugged its a fair price she said an axle has to be made of latheturned kilndried oronwood and the nearest oronwood stand that i know of is on the other side of kingsford the cartwright whose name kestrel still did not know nodded respect in his eyes presumably that robin was so wellinformed kestrel sighed but only to himself there would be no bargaining here ggo ahead he said trying not to let the words choke him the cartwright nodded and strode briskly off down the lane towards the cluster of buildings at the front of the waymeet presumably to get his partner tools and the new axle ddo we sstay here he asked robin are wwe ssupposed to help not at that price she replied jumping down out of the wagon i heard him out here so i locked everything up figuring if he could start immediately we could go wander around the waymeet for a while and see if theres anyone i know here we cant do anything in the wagon while he has it up on blocks changing out the axle she reached up and locked the back door then slipped the key in her pocket the bird in the tree above them who had been silent while the cartwright was prodding the wagon burst into song and she looked up and smiled at it that smile lit up his heart and brought a smile to his lips he reached for her hand and she slipped it into his ththeres lots of nnews tto tell and mmore tto hear llets at least ggo tell gypsies and ffree bbards abbout wren and lllark and ththe wwelcome to free bbards in bbirnam ththats ggood news surely she agreed and well see if theres anything of interest to us in what the other folk here have to tell us in the way of news to robins delight the first people they encountered cooking up a breakfast of sausage around their fire were people she knew very well it was a trio of free bards linnet gannet and blackbird blackbird jumped up nearly stepping into the fire when he spotted robin and rushed to hug her linnet was a tiny thing with long copperybrown hair that reached almost to her ankles when she let it down gannets hair was as red as flame his milky face speckled with freckles blackbirds redgold hair was lighter and wavy rather than curly like gannets all three had sparkling green eyes and slight builds they made a striking group whether they were dressed for the road or in their performance costumes she made the introductions hastily none of the trio had ever seen jonny or even heard of him so far as she knew linnet is flute gannet is drum and blackbird is a mandolin player she told him concluding the introduction kestrel is a harpist and hes learning lute well if master wren declared hes one of us thats good enough for me blackbird declared no other qualifications needed now we heard there was some kind of todo over in birnambut how did you end up mixed in it and how did you end up wedded she glanced over at kestrel who shrugged and settled down on one of the logs arranged as seats around the open fire finish your meal and well see if we cant get it all sorted out for you she said following his example weve already eaten so go right ahead jonny didnt say a great deal but he did interject a word or phrase now and again enough that it didnt look as if she was doing all the talking linnet and her two partners kept mostly quiet although by their eyes they were intensely excited by the whole story they passed sausages and bread to each other and filled teamugs without their gazes ever leaving the faces of the two taletellers and then well it was just a matter of getting wedded robin concluded kestrel grinned wryly and sso pppublicly that kking rrolend ccouldnt ththink i wwas ggoing to bback out of my pppledge ssso here wwe are lark and wren are still in birnam and king rolend made wren his bard laurel so he said to pass the word that free bards are welcome in any place in birnam robin added thats the biggest news really apparently the bardic guild in birnam was one of the biggest benefactors of the old kings spendthrift ways and they are not happy with rolend and ththe fffeeling is mmutual jonny pointed out ththings ththat wren wwants hes hhappy tto ggive ppolitely ththumbing his nnose at the ggguild like the right for any musician to work anywhere and take anyones pay at least in birnam gwyna made no secret of her satisfaction and the other three looked so satisfied that robin wondered if they had been having trouble finding a winteringover spot well thats the best news ive had since the kingsford faire linnet exclaimed she glanced over at her two partners who nodded i think the situation in birnam is well worth crossing those damned fens even at this late in the year we havent found a single winteringover job and weve been looking since the first harvest faire robin blinked in surprise at that as gannet carefully poured the last of the teawater over the fire putting it out steam hissed up from the coals and blew away in the light breeze thats odd she said carefully odd its a disaster blackbird never had been one to mince words no one will take us theres guild musicians in every one of the taverns weve wintered over in before the innkeepers just shrug and wish us wellelsewhere they wont tell us why they hired guild when they couldnt afford guild before and they wont tell us why they dont want us when the guild musicians arent as good as we are but gannet looked up with shadows in his dark eyes got a guess he offered just now put it togetherbeen a lot of priests around preaching on morality were a trio robin shook her head baffled but linnet put her hand to her mouth oh she exclaimed looking stricken i never thought of that were she blushed a startling crimson weve always shared a room you see robin grimaced if the church priests are going around the inns threatening to cause trouble if there are immoral people there you three would be right at the top of their list wouldnt you i never thought it necessary to announce that were siblings every time we ask for a job blackbird said with icy anger it doesnt exactly have anything to do with music well maybe it does now gannet said his jaw clenched churchs poking its nose into our lives time we went on the defensive maybe or time we went into birnam where we dont have to make excuses just music linnet said firmly no i dont like running away any more than anyone else but the church scares me its too big to fight and too big to hide from she stood up and shook out her skirts decisively if they decide not to believe that were siblings we have no way of proving that we are she continued and for that matter a nastyminded churchman can make nasty assumptions even if they accept our word call me a coward but there it is gannet rose nodding as robin and kestrel got to their feet leaving only blackbird sitting he stared up at them stubbornly for a long moment then he finally sighed and rose to his feet as well were too good a trio to break up he said with an unhappy shake of his head i think youre overreacting but if it makes the two of you happy to head for birnam then thats where well go robin let out the breath she had been holding i think youre being wise she said its just a feeling i have butwell incest is punishable too and the punishments are pretty horrible it might be worse for church priests to know you are related and sharing a room better to be safe linnet said with a twitch of her skirts that told robin that she was not just nervous she was actually a little afraid and had been the moment that gannet mentioned the church and that was not like linnet not at all something had frightened her something she hadnt even told her brothers threats from some representative of the church or some priest deciding he liked her looks and promising trouble if she wouldnt become his mistress it had happened to robin and the trouble had come small wonder linnet would rather leave the country than come under church scrutiny again robin would make the same choice in her place she and kestrel found several more gypsies and two more free bards besides a round dozen wandering players who were not associated with either the guild or the free bards to all of them she passed the news that any musician was welcome to play wherever he could find work in the kingdom of birnam some of the ordinary musicians were interested most were notbut they were folk who had a regular circuit of tiny inns local dances and festivals and very small faires they had places to play that no guild musician would touch with a bargepole and while the living that they eked out was bare by her standards it was enough for them the free bards were like linnet very interested in her news and had similar tales of finding guild musiciansor at least musicians in guild badgesplaying in the venues where no guildsman had ever played before but it was not until they found another musician who was both a gypsy and a free bard that they had anything like an answer to the question of why this was happening the ethereal strains of a harp drew kestrel across the clearing and into the deeper forest beyond the immediate confines of the waymeet dead leaves crackled underfoot and the scent of tannin rose at his every step this was no simple song this was the kind of wild strange dreamhaunted melody that some of the gypsies playedthough robin never would claiming she had no talent for what she called adastera music she said it was as much magic as music and told him it was reputed to have the power to control spirits and souls to raise ghosts and set them to rest again robin followed him under the deep shadows of the trees as the bare branches above gave way to thick longneedled evergreens a voice joined the harp singing without words the two creating harmonies that made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end this was music powerful enough to make even harperus weep the harpist must be a gypsy but who was the singer it did not sound like any human voice the path they followed seemed to lead beside the stream that watered the waymeet it led through deep undergrowth along the bottom of a rocksided ravine that slowly grew steeper with every twist and turn of the path the stream wound its way through a tangle of rounded boulders but its gurgle did not sound at all cheerful although it was very musical it held a note of melancholy that was a match for the sadness in the music floating on the breeze ahead of them nightingale robin muttered shes the only person i can think of who plays like that but who is the singer they had their answer a moment later as the stream and path brought them to a tiny clearing made by the toppling of a single tree that bridged the water there beside the tree was the harpist seated on a rock with her harp braced on her lap and standing beside her was tfyrr not even the birds were foolish enough to make any sound that might disturb these two the haspur stood like a statue of gray granite in the twilight shadows of the forest only his chest moving to show that he was alive with his eyes closed and his beak open just enough to permit his voice to issue forth nightingales eyes were closed as well but most of her face was hidden in the curtain of her hair as she bent over her harp all of her concentration centered on her hands and the melodies she coaxed from the delicate strings both of them were too deeply engrossed in the music to notice their audienceand robin and kestrel stopped dead to keep from breaking their concentration the song came to its natural end a single harpnote that hung in the air like a crystal raindrop a sigh from tfyrr that answered it for a long long moment only silence held sway beneath the branches then finally a bellbird sang out its threenote call and the two musicians sighed and opened their eyes tfyrr caught sight of them first and clapped his beak shut with a snap ttfyrr kestrel said softly ththat was wwwonderful the birdman bowed graciously it was an experiment he offered it was not meant to be heard but since it was the gypsy that robin had identified as nightingale cocked her head to one side robin evidently knew her well enough to answer the unspoken question as critique from two fellow harpistsyouve found the best match to your harp and your music ive ever heard robin replied i know kestrel agrees with me and hes a better harpist than i am that was nothing short of magical nightingales mouth twitched a little as if she found robins choice of words amusing well we had agreed tfyrr and i that this song would be the last of our experiments this morning and while my heart may regret that you found us and are about to make us cleave to that agreement my hands are not going to argue she began flexing them and massaging each of the palms in turn a forest in autumn is not the best venue for a performance it is very damp here and a rock makes a chilly and nonetoosoft cushion her eyes met kestrels sharp and penetrating and just a little strange and otherworldly tfyrr said that you would turn up eventually and that you had some news once again the two of them passed on their own news with the added tales from linnets trio and some of the other musicians we started out with only good news robin concluded ruefully but we seem to have acquired news of a more sober flavor i feel like a bird who just finished the last song of summer and sees the first storm of winter coming nightingale nodded and now you will hear why i am here and not in my usual winter haunt and i think i may have the answer you have been looking for as to why there are fewer places for free bards and guild musicians crowding into our old venues as robin took a place on the fallen tree and kestrel planted himself beside her nightingale glanced up at tfyrr i think that some of what i have to say will affect you my new friend she said butlisten and judge for yourself when nightingale had found her usual winter position as the chief instrumentalist at a fine ladies teashop closed to her taken by a barely tolerable guild violist she did more than simply look for work she began looking for the cause and just as gannet had she had found clerics from the church posted on streetcorners preaching against immorality but unlike gannet she had listened to the sermons time after time i heard sermons specifically against music she said and not just any musicbut the music performed by what these street preachers referred to as wild and undisciplined street players they always went on to further identify these street players as people no guild would permit into its ranks because of their lack of respect for authority their immorality and their dangerous ways us in other words robin said grimly free bards just what were the complaints against us anyway nightingales mouth had compressed into a tight line and kestrel sensed a very deep anger within her according to what they said directly our music is seductive and incites lust our lyrics licentious and advocate lust and we destroy pure thinking and lead youths to rebel against proper authority to hear them talk the free bards are responsible for every girl that ever had a child out of wedlock every boy that ever defied his parents and every fool who sought strong drink and drugs and ruined his mind and body but it wasnt only what they said directly it was what they implied which wwas kestrel prompted quickly that were using magic she said flatly that were somehow controlling the minds of those who listen to us to make them do things they never would ordinarily he was full of examplesboys that had been lured into demonworship by a song girls that had run off with young brigands because of a song folk who had supposedly been incited to a life of crime or had committed suicide all because of the magic spells we free bards had cast on them through our music they even had the tides of the songs on their tongues to prove their liesdemonlover follow come follow free fly the fair the highwaymans lady as if simply by knowing the title of a song that proved there was evil magic behind the singing of it that is why there are no jobs for free bards not because were immoralbut because no one wants to risk a charge that some patron did something wrong because the musician at the hearth somehow cast a sinister spell upon him and took control of his mind most especially they do not want to risk an accusation that such a spell had been cast against a minor child kestrel felt cold that was too close to the truth as wren had uncovered it some free bards could influence the thoughts of others not to any sinister purpose but and the guild in its infinite wisdom and compassion has been offering an option to the owners of the better taverns and those citizens of modest wealth who may hire a musician or two nightingale continued her voice dripping with sarcasm they have been recruiting what they call guildlicensed musiciansplayers who are not good enough to pass the guild trials but who may be barely competent musicians on one or two instruments these people are certified by the church and licensed by the guild as being capable of entertaining without corrupting anyone they wear guild colors and doubletithe to the church plus pass back a commission to the guild brilliant robin muttered bitterly this of course does leave us the street corners the very poor inns and taverns the common eatingshops and the patronage of younger people who usually dont have a great deal of money nightingale concluded and of course the countryfolk who havent gotten the word of our immorality and possible corrupting magicuse yet tfyrr who had remained silent through all of this finally spoke i like this not lady he said his voice echoing oddly through the trees no more do any of us friend robin answered for all of them they finished making their rounds of the other nonmusical residents of the waymeet at just about the time that the cartwright who they now knew was called oakhart and his helper were taking the wagon down off the blocks shell hold now oakhart said with satisfaction they shook hands on it and the cartwright departed with his promised fifty pieces of silver kestrel let robin pay the man it gave him pain to see that much money leaving their hands harperus appeared just as oakhart was leaving and invited them to dinner and a conference around the fire he had just built he had quite a civilized little arrangement there folding chairs a stack of baskets each containing a different warmed dainty and plates to eat from tfyrr told me what your gypsyharpist friend said the deliambren told them as they accepted plates full of food that obviously had never been prepared over a fire tasty little bits of vegetables and meats each with different sauces or crisp coatings or sprinklings of cheese this is some of what i had heard the rumors that i wanted you to track for me but not the whole of it gwyna picked up a bit of fried something and bit into it with a glum expression i dont know how were going to fight the church old owl i dont know how anyone could i hheard some other things kestrel added casually after popping a sausagelike thing into his mouth i ddont knknow if it mmeans anyththing or if ththe chchurch has anyththing tto ddo with this nno one else ssseems tto think it mmeans anyththing jjustththat nnonhumans are hhaving a hharder ttime of it just llike the ffree bbards all of a ssudden its all rright tto ssay yyou ddont ttrust em ththeyre ththieves or shshifty or llazy ththat its hharder for em tto gget any kkind of pposition any kkind of jjob and even ttraders are ffinding it hharder tto gget cclients unless ththeyve ggot something exexclusive and ththere are ssigns showing up at inns and ttaverns and llodgings what kind of signs harperus asked sharply ones ththat ssay huhumans only he shrugged nnot a llot of them ththey ssay bbut ive nnever heard of ththat bbefore nor have i harperus was giving him a particularly penetrating look you seem to think this is nothing terribly important certainly nowhere near as important as these preachers and the apparent backing of the bardic guild by the church kestrel shrugged again its jjust a ccouple of bbigots he said whwhat hharm ccan they do could they express their bigotry so openly if they did not have some sanction harperus countered sharply and if there are signs reading humans only now how long will it be think you before there are signs that say citizens only guild members only or even no one permitted in the gates without church papers and permissions kestrel blinked and his level of concern rose markedly ddo you ththink the chchurch is behind this too harperus stroked his cheekdecorations with a thoughtful finger i find it peculiar that a church whose scriptures speak of love and tolerance should suddenly have words of hate and intolerance in its collective mouth he said i find it disturbing that it is effectively sanctioning things that should be repugnant to any thinking being and i do not think that it is any accident that this should be happening to the two main groups who escape the churchs authoritythe nonhumans who do not share this human religion of the sacrificed god and the free bards and gypsies who have no address and cannot be followed controlled or intimidated i find it significant too my friend boomed tfyrr out of the darkness what is more i have been speaking in greater depth with nightingale who tells me that the church has never before preached against the use of magicbut now finds reasons to condemn even such beneficial magic as healing if they are not performed by a priest and i wonder how long before use of magic is declared a crimeand how long before anyone that the authorities wish to be rid of is called a magician a very good question tfyrr robins face was grim and kestrel felt a cold and empty place in his stomach that the excellent food did nothing to fill a very good question and i am beginning to wonder if the answer to your question can be measured in months that harperus said is precisely what i am afraid of chapter five kestrel thought about the revelations of the day long into the night and in the morning while gwyna took their mudstained garments to the laundry to try to scrub them clean again he waited for harperus to make his appearance it was another clear cold day with a bite in the air that warned that winter was not far off kestrels thin fingers chilled quickly and he stuffed his hands into the pockets of his coat to warm them the deliambren came out of his wagon from the door at the front looked around and greeted kestrel with some surprise i didnt expect to find you here still harperus told him i expected that you and robin would be on your way as soon as the sun rose have some breakfast he had his hands full of something and offered jonny a very odd object indeed a thin pancake folded around a brightly colored filling strangelooking but kestrel already knew that harperus oddlooking food was very good and he accepted his second breakfast of the day with alacrity there had been too many days in the past that he had had no breakfast no lunch and no dinner old habits said eat when you can so he did wwe have chchores kestrel offered after first trying a bite and discovering that it was as good as dinner had been last night ththings wwe didnt gget to llaundry a llittle clcleaning resstocking and wwe hadnt ddecided where wwe wwere ggoing yet ssouth that wwas all wwe knew wwe needed tto look at ssome mmaps there was still hot tea left in their wagon he turned and got mugs wellsweetened with honey for both of them harperus accepted his with a nod of thanks the warm mug felt very good in kestrels cold fingers so youll be going out of rayden i take it given the word you gathered yesterday harperus regarded kestrel shrewdly over a mug of steaming tea obviously you cant go back to birnam so where are you thinking of heading ddont know he finished harperus offering and dusted off his hands ththis bbusiness wwith the chchurch i ggot the fffeeling youd heard mmore than you ttold us llast night and if i have the deliambren asked levelly kestrel studied the odd inhuman face it was very handsome the more so as he became accustomed to it the swaths of silky hair only added to the attraction there was no sign of aging at all certainly no sign of the years robin had claimed for the deliambren and there was no sign of any emotion that kestrel recognized harperus oddcolored eyes studied his seeming more coppery this morning than yellow yyouve bbeen wwatching ththings for a lllong ttime he said finally ccollecting informmmation sso maybe you knknow hhow ccan whwhat the church is ddoing bbe jjjustified one of the characteristics of organized religion is that no action it takes has to be justified from outside if it is justified by the religion itself kestrel harperus said patiently that is a truism for nonhuman as well as human religions no matter how irrational an action is if it is done in the name of the religion that alone serves the organizers jonny shook his head i ddont understand he said plaintively harperus sighed neither do i but then i have never claimed to be religious both of them wore coats against the chill in the air and once again jonny shoved one of his hands into his pocket and wished that he were somewhere warm that had never heard of the church whwhen i asked the trtraders whwhy these ththings were happening ththey ddidnt know either and ththey didnt sseem worried he tried to make his glance at harperus an inquiring one and evidently harperus read it that way that seems to be the prevailing attitude harperus looked up at the sky broodingly the only human folk who are worried are the free bards and the traveling musiciansand they seem concerned only with the immediate effect these sanctions are having on their livelihood no one seems at all concerned about what could happen next or the sanctions against nonhumans to be honest with you kestrel those worry me the most and not because i am deliambren either jonny had formed some ideas of his own last night and he wanted to see how they matched with the deliambrens why he asked harperus smiled thinly you pack many questions into a single word youngster he leaned back against the side of his vehicle i am not concerned for myself and my race because there is no one in the twenty kingdoms who can effectively threaten us my earlier protestations notwithstanding we can simply outlive human regimes we have the capability of closing up the fortress and outliving this current generation we have done so before and are always prepared to do so again it is simply not our policy to boast of that ability jonnys eyebrows rose he had not expected harperus to be so frank however the reason that these little petty annoyances worry me is that they seem to have been formulated by accident or deliberately to undermine a great deal of the progress that has been made here in the last few centuries progress in cooperation that is the deliambrens expression was a brooding one each little action seems designed to strike in such a way that the group that is acted against is quite certain that the actions against them are far more important than the petty annoyances of other groups he leaned towards kestrel his mouth set in a thin tight line look at youthe gypsies think there is no problem at all because it is only happening in the settled places and they pay very little heed to anything done in towns they assume that if trouble spreads they can simply drive away from it the free bards are more concerned with the restriction on their ability to make a living and not on the reputation they may be getting thanks to the tales spread by churchmen nnot nnightingale kestrel protested true not the nightingale but she is unique among all the free bards and gypsies i have spoken to he shook his head none of them are at all thinking about what is happening to the nonhumans because they think their own problems are much greater i have not heard from the nonhumans themselvesand that alarms me are they being harassed are they being arrested and taken off into oblivion are they being deported or is there nothing happening at all i have heard nothing and when i hear nothing i worry more than when i hear rumors i only know that the few nonhuman traders i know have simply turned over their routes in rayden to human partners the human traders frankly see this in terms of less competition and more profit the nonhumans are gone and i cannot question them kestrel blinked he had not considered the possibility that there might actually be bad things happening to the nonhumans do you thththink that any of that has happened harperus grim expression lightened a little not yet kestrel he said gently but i greatly fear it may mmme tttoo jonny was serious about that he had seen too many insignificant things turn out to be dangerous had things that should have been no more than annoyances turn out to be lifethreatening there is a last why that i have not answered harperus continued that is because i do not know why is this happening i honestly have no idea partly because my people do not think like yours it would seem to me that the church is doing very well without all this nonsense or it is if you take the churchs primary goal as being the saving of souls and directing people to act in a moral and responsible manner but if the churchs goal has changed to something else ththen ththat mmay bbe the why jonny licked his dry lips nervously and ventured his thought on the matter mmaybe it isnt jjust a whwhy mmaybe its also a who now it was harperus turn to raise his eyebrows this might be the work of one person perhaps a person in a position of power within the church orsomeone who wishes to use these changes as a means of gaining more power for himself at jonnys nod he pursed his lips thoughtfully an interesting speculation i will look into this harperus handed jonny his mug then shoved away from the side of the wagon turned on his heel and headed back to the door vanishing inside jonny turned and went back to his vehicle walking slowly and thoughtfully he was not offended by harperus abrupt departure he knew better than to expect human behavior or even what a human would think of as politeness out of a nonhuman in fact he was rather gratified it meant that the deliambren took him and his speculations seriously but harperus was not the only person who now had that particular speculation to look into jonny had decided last night that if the deliambren thought enough of his idea to take it seriously he would see what he could do to track down the center of all these troubles as he had told harperus there often was a who in the middle of something like this and if you could find him and deal with him before he had become so protected that it was impossible to get near him you could actually do something in fact you could effectively stop the movement before it had gained its own momentum and had not one but many people devoted to keeping it alive it was like extracting the root of a noxious plant before it spread so far and had sent up so many shoots it was impossible to eradicate he had learned a great deal about politics in the short time he had been in birnam watching the way the people opposed to his uncles rule had operated he had probably learned more than anyone else had ever guessed ordinary people he had noticed tended to do what they were told as long as they were given orders by someone who was a recognized authority or as long as the orders did not affect their own lives very much they would support the orders through simple inaction if you made changes gradual and made them seem reasonable no one really cared about them and the changes mounted imperceptibly until one day people who had been good neighborswhich basically meant that they had not disturbed each other and had no serious quarrels with each otherwere now deadly enemies and it all seemed perfectly reasonable by then as long as nothing bad happens to them people they know or anyone who agrees with thematrocities only happened to your own land just retribution was what happened to other people a cult or a myth was someone elses religion your religion was the right and moral way or as the free bards put it one mans music is another mans noise as long as people were able to listen to what they called music they didnt care if noise was banned well this all might be something the free bards could do something about at least if it was at a controllable stage maybe that was another whywhy the free bards had come in for the greater share of trouble so far they poked fun at pompous authority they made the strange into the familiar it was very difficult for a person who had heard linnets pearls and posies to think of gazners as coldblooded for instanceor wrens own spellbound captive to believe that elves truly had no souls the free bards opened up the world just a little to those who had never been beyond their own village boundaries jonny knew that master wren had wider ideas for the free bards than most of them dreamed at the moment wren saw his creation as a means to spread information that others would rather not have publicand perhaps he might even have a greater goal than that but that was enough for jonny at least at the moment so this whole situation just might be a state of affairs that free bards could do something about it definitely was something they should know about if it turned out there was a single person behind the persecution sothe first thing to do would be to see if he and robin could track the sermons to their source he thought about that for a moment there were only two of them and they could only go in one direction there was harperus who would be looking into things as well but what about asking nightingale as well she was the one who had stopped to listen to the preachers in the street she was the one who had given them the most information she was already observing if she was willing to expand that a little he locked up the wagon and went in search of nightingale he would find out what direction she planned to go when she left the waymeet they would go in the opposite direction perhaps this little group of free bards would be able to find some answers to all their questions anddare he hopesolutions as well kestrel sighed and took up the reins as the first fat drop of rain plopped down on the gravel lane in front of the horses annother bbeautiful dday he said sardonically it could be worse robin replied and patted his knee at least the rain held off long enough for our laundry to dry and wwe ddid get that nnice hhot bbath he admitted although it had been something more than a mere baththe bathhouse proved to be the kind that had several small rooms each furnished with a huge tub fully large enough for two it had been well worth the money all things considered we did we are clean the wagon is clean all our clothing is cleanwe just might be presentable enough that they wont throw us out of westhaven robin said cheerfully the horses stamped showing their impatience but kestrel was not going to let them move out just yet not until a sharp whistle behind him told him that harperus was about to pull out the haspur had once again vanished into the depths of the wagon kestrel doubted that more than a handful of people had even glimpsed him during the three days they all camped here it had been tfyrr who had spoken to nightingale and obtained her agreement to reverse her planned course and return to kingsford to see if the strange church activities originated there or elsewhere but then i am going to birnam she had said firmly i must eat and i cannot eat if i cannot play kestrel got the feeling that if it hadnt been for tfyrr she wouldnt even have agreed to that much harperus huge vehicle moved slowly into the lane parallel to theirs once they reached the trade road kestrel planned to follow him for the short period when they would both be going in the same direction a few leagues up the road a minor seldomused traderoad branched off this one this was the road to westhaven which just happened to be runes old home and that was the direction he and robin were going while harperus and tfyrr took the main road it was robins notion to spy on runes mother if she was still there she wanted to be able to tell rune something about what was going on in her old haunts she had told jonny that she thought rune would feel less guilty over leaving if she knew her mother was all right personally jonny hadnt detected any concern for her mother on runes part but he wasnt a female there might have been things the two of them said to each other that made robin think lady lark felt guilt over leaving her mother to fend for herself and one road was as good as another reallyat least when the road led eventually to gradford that particular city had a high bishop in residence which made it another logical candidate for information about the church what was more so far as he was concerned there was an abbey carthell abbey lying on that littleused road that linked westhaven and gradford priests and the like who lived in isolated abbeys liked to talk to visitors they might say something to give kestrel a place to start how harperus maneuvered that huge wagon so easily kestrel had no notionbut he brought it around smartly and was already on the lane leading to the traderoad by the time kestrel got his mares in motion the rear of the wagon was a blank wall peculiar sort of construction wagons were dark enough that most people cut windows everywhere they could the new axle performed exactly as oakhart had promised they jounced along in harperus wake but thanks to the deliambren their course wasnt as bumpy as it could have been harperus wagon was much much heavier than theirs and his wheels much broader although the distance between his left and right wheels was about the same as between theirs that was why jonny was letting him lead as long as he kept their wheels in the ruts left by the deliambrens wagon their ride was relatively smooth at about noon they all stopped at the crossroads for a meal harperus supplying more of his odd but tasty food and robin offering fresh honeycakes she had bought at waymeet be careful out there robin said as they made their farewells if we see you at gradford i dont want to see you in trouble i the deliambren arched an eyebrow at her i am a wellknown and respectable trader you on the other hand are a disreputable gypsy and a free bard to boot i am far more like to see you in a gaol of one sort or another jonny shivered after the things that nightingale had told them that was no longer very funny dddont even jjjoke about ththat he said llets jjust ssay wwwell sssee yyou bbbefore mmmidwwwinter so we shall may your road be easy friends harperus responded gravely nowif you are to make westhaven before nightfall we had better be off robin swung herself up into the drivers seat leaving jonny to accept harperus clap on the shoulder and tfyrrs handclasp or clawclasp or whatever then they parted company harperus to take his wagon onward and robin to turn theirs down a much smaller road one covered with wet fallen leaves and shaded by sadly drooping branches with undergrowth so thick that once they were on the lane it was no longer possible to hear or see the larger vehicle in moments they could have been the only people in the entire world there was no sign of any human nothing but the forest the occasional birdcall and the steady drip of water from the bare branches kestrel sighed in some ways he was glad that the two of them were alone again but he had enjoyed harperus company and he wished he could have heard tfyrr sing a few more times but most of all he liked the feeling of security hed had being around the deliambren and his formidable wagon no one was likely to give harperus any trouble and if anyone did against all common sense he was probably going to regret doing so he only wished that the same could be said for them they reached the village of westhaven quite a bit before nightfall the fact that the road was considerably less traveled meant that it was conversely smoother than the main road less traffic during all this bad weather had made for fewer ruts though there were erosion cuts to rattle across the mares made much better time that he or robin had any right to expect if i recall the inn is on the other side of the village robin said there wasnt much there really a few buildings around a square although there did seem to be a farmers market going on this was the kind of village that jonny brede would have passed by if hed had the choice there was no room for an outsider here everyone knew everyone else still though strangers might not be welcome their coin was and spending money usually brought some form of speech out of even the most taciturn of villagers wwe should gget some bread he said mmaybe chcheese ssstillwater dddidnt have either robin glanced at him out of the corner of her eye and smiled so we can find things out without asking questions hmm she replied oh i can think of a few more things we could use roots for one and more feed for the horses even at the good price they gave me for being a gypsy the price for grain at stillwater was outrageous by that time they were actually in the village virtually everyone in the square or the stalls along one side stared at them as they drove in robin pulled the horses up to the single hitching post with ostentatious care then jumped down and tied the mares up to it kestrel climbed down on his side trying to look as formidable as possible the village square was centered around a well no great surprise there most small villages were there were four buildings on three sides of the square with two larger buildings one clearly a small church and the other a guild hall on the fourth side a joint guild hall from the look of it there were boards with the signs for the millers the joiners the smiths and the tanners guilds up above the door no bardic guild harp though which was a relief the stalls had been set up along this side and kestrel followed robin as she opened the back of the wagon got a basket and made her way directly towards them it looked as if the rain that had plagued their travel so far had scarcely touched westhaven the dust of the street was damped down but had not turned to mud and beneath the dust the street itself was packed dirt that must surely turn into a morass every time it rained heavily now i remember why i like cities kestrel thought paved streets and regular collection of refuse were two very good reasons as robin approached the first stall looking determinedly cheerful he decided he did not like the faintly hostile way the woman minding it and the two loitering in front of it were staring at her he steeled himself for trouble but it never came at least not in the form of outright trouble instead the thin disagreeablelooking wench who had a face like a hen with indigestion and hair the color and texture of old straw completely ignored them she began chattering away at her two cronies at such a high volume and rate of speech that it would have been impossible for anyone to get her attention without interrupting her forcibly and rudely but kestrel knew that robin had no intention of doing anything that would give the stallkeeper an excuse for further rudeness and if the wench thought she was going to outmaneuver a gypsy instead robin silently surveyed the contents of the stall with a superior eye counterfeiting perfectly the airs of a highborn nobleman she raised one supercilious eyebrow then sniffed as if she found the selection of baked goods vastly inferior to what she was expecting and sailed on without a single word to any of the three at the sound of a smothered giggle from just ahead of them robin smiled and exchanged a quick glance with kestrel he nodded slightly in the direction of the giggler an older woman in the next stall one with a plain but merry face who was selling eggs sausage and bacon although none of these things had been on their tentative shopping list robin headed straight for her and engaged her in a spirited bargaining session as robin put her purchases in her basket she cocked her head to one side and paused for a moment is there anyplace here in westhaven where i can get fresh bread she asked loudly enough that the women at the first stall could hear her clearly properly made bread the disagreeable henwoman flushed and the eggsellers mouth tightened as she held back another giggle well mother tolley isnt a baker precisely but she sells the freshest bread on marketdays the eggseller said with a slightly malicious sparkle to her eyes that told kestrel there was a petty feud probably of long standing between her and the henwoman its from an old family recipe and her own yeast and i buy it myself shes got the last stall in the row thank you so much robin replied with a warm smile i really appreciate your courtesy she made her way past the next four stalls still smiling and paying no outward attention to the varied expressions of shock amusement and hostility the women there displayed interesting that there were only women in the market today perhaps the harvest was late or perhaps the men did not consider marketday to be within their purview now kestrel was no stranger to small villages or the behavior people who lived in them exhibited particularly to outsiders but the feeling here wasodd by their clothing by the condition of the buildings and by the unused state of the road leading to westhaven this village was not exactly prospering the women with stalls here should have been falling all over each other to attract the money robin was so willingly spending but they werent the first woman had been actively hostile and only the woman with the sausages seemed at all friendlyand that was simply because of the quarrel she had with the first stallkeeper what was going on here the last stall held something they could actually use some nice freshly dug rootvegetables and two round golden loaves of breadobviously the last of a large baking by the blank places on the cloth where they sat mother tolley behaved in the way kestrel had expectedshe was obviously pleased to see them and their coins and was only too happy to sell them whatever they wanted robin chatted with her about the weather the terrible state of the roads revealed the fact that they had come from birnam by way of kingsford and that they were on their way to gradford my how youve traveled and youve been through kingsford oh i wish i could see it some day mother tolley said brightly i hear the kingsford faire is something to behold it is indeed robin replied nodding i have been there as a performer every year since i was a child of ten truly mother tolleys eyes widened what is it like is it as great as they say robin spread her hands wide absolutely hundreds of people attend the faire from dukes to guild masters to every manner of peddler you can imagine if there is anything in the world that can be sold youll find it at kingsford faire all the best performers in the world come there and the holy services at noon on midsummer day are beyond description all the world comes to kingsford faire mother tolley repeated the old cliche as solemnly as if she had made it up on the spot well say since you are so welltraveled and a musician and all she hesitated a moment then with a sly glance at the other women continued on there was someone i knew once who had a hankering to go to the kingsford faire it was a local child with so many dreamswell there arent too many folk who believe in dreams especially not here i dont suppose youve ever heard tell of a fiddler girl named rune by now kestrel would have had to be a blind man not to notice how all the women even those who were feigning indifference or displaying open hostility were stretching their ears to hear robins reply to that question and by the look in her eyes and the set of her jaw robin was about to give them more than they bargained for rune lady lark she said brightly why of course i have everyone in all of rayden and birnam knows all about free bard rune why shes the most famous free bard in two kingdoms except for master wren mother tolley blinked apparently that was not precisely the response she had expected kestrel figured she had hoped to hear something good about rune but not this rune famous she said blankly why fancy that but robin wasnt finished not by half oh of course she continued raising her voice just a little to make certain everyone in the market got a good chance to hear first there was her song about how she bested the skull hill ghosti dont think theres a musician in rayden that hasnt learned it by now sheactually mother tolley was still trying to cope with the notion that rune was famous oh indeed and she still has the ghosts ancient gold coins to prove it now robin was getting beyond the truth and embroidering and that made kestrel nervous gold the ghost has gold that was one of the other women her voice sharp with agitation he did but he gave it all to rune for her fiddling robin said brightly but that was just the beginning then she became an ally of the high king of the elves for getting the better of one of the elven sires elves said another in a choked voice she robin ran right over the top of her words but of course what really made her famous was that she won the hand of master bard talaysen himself with her talent and her musical skillin fact she was the one who saved him from that elven sire she bested he wedded her and now the two of them are the laurel bards to the king of birnam king rolend not just laurel bards but his personal advisors mother tolleys face had gone so completely blank from astonishment that kestrel couldnt tell what her feelings were he guessed she would have been pleased to learn that rune was doing wellbut that this was something she wasnt prepared to cope with i was at the ceremony myself robin rattled on in a confidential tone as if she was a namedropping scatterbrain as one of lady larkthats what we call her lady larkone of lady larks personal friends of course my even a dukes daughter would envy her she has twelve servants all her very ownthree of them just to tend to her wardrobe kestrel elbowed her sharply shed already gone too far three lies ago she ignored him the king himself gave her so much gold and gems that she couldnt possibly spend it all and the weight of her jewelry would drown her if she ever fell into a river wearing it robin gave him a warning look when he moved to elbow her again she wears silk every day and she has three carriages to ride and she bathes in wine they say robin simpered kestrel did his best not to laugh at her expression despite his unease he hadnt known she could simper she was a better actress than hed thought our wagon and the horses and allthat was her present to me you know she gave wagons and horses to all her gypsy friends who came to the ceremony so sweet of her dont you think mother tolley had gone beyond astonished yes she said faintly yes very sweet of course calling rune one of king rolends laurel bards and a personal advisor was not exactly the truthand the picture robin had painted of rune and talaysen wallowing in luxury and wealth was not even close to being true but kestrel watched the faces of those who had been so eager to hear some terrible scandal about their prodigal runaway and their puckered expressions told him that some of the good citizens of westhaven were less than thrilled to hear that she was doing well and the more sour those expressions became the more robin embroidered on her deceptions he didnt think he had ever seen her look quite so smug before but while this was all very amusing to her he was beginning to worry more than a little that she might be digging a hole they both were about to fall into wwe must ggo he said firmly and loudly before she could make up any more stories this time out of whole clotheither about rune or about their supposed importance to her or worse yet told the whole truth about him he didnt know what was worseto have these women believe robins tales or to have them think her a liar ah robin said blankly as he completely threw her off her course for a moment with his interruption then she regained her mental balance and blinked as if she had suddenly figured out that she might have gone a little too far of course youre right we have a long way to go before we stop tonight she tucked her purchases carefully in her basket and allowed kestrel to hurry her off what wwere you ththinking of he hissed as they followed the sausagewomans stammered directions to the mill im not sure she said weakly i got kind of carried away he refrained from stating the obvious it was justthose sanctimonious prigs you saw how they wanted to hear that i had never heard of rune that she was a nothing and a failure i wanted to smack their selfsatisfied faces yyou ddid that all rright he replied a little grimly as they arrived at the mill the miller himself was busy but one of his apprentices handled their purchase of grain for the horses it took a while the boy was determined that he was going to give them exact measure by the time they returned to the wagon the stalls were deserted and the women gone from the marketplace kestrels stomach told him that there was no sinister reason for the empty market it was suppertime and these women had to return home to feed their families but the silence of the place unnerved him and for once even robin didnt have much to say she unlocked the back of the caravan quickly and stowed her purchases inside he went to one of the storage bins outside to put the grain away suddenly he wanted very much to be out of westhaven and on the road quickly he felt eyes on his back unfriendly eyes the women might be gone but they were still watching from their homes and their kitchens the sooner he and robin had westhaven behind them the better he had put the last of the bags of grain away in the bin and locked the door when he heard footsteps behind him hey said a nasal obnoxious male voice what kinda thieves do we have here chapter six he turned but slowly as if he had no idea that there was anyone at all there pretending he had not heard the voice or the notsoveiled insult they werent in any troubleyet an official even in a tiny provincial village like this one would not be as young as the voice had sounded obnoxious surely officious of course but not young so this must be some stupid troublemaker a village bully and his friends he knew as soon as he turned that he had been right for the young men wore no badges of authority there were three of them none of them any older than he all three were heavily muscled and two of them had teeth missing all three were taller than kestrel he looked up at them measuring them warily definitely bullies else why have three against two dont do anything maybe theyll get bored and go away so gyppo whatd ye steal one asked rubbing his nose across the back of his hand it was a very dirty hand and the nose wasnt exactly clean either dirty hair pimpled face a sneer that would have been more appropriate on the lips of a bratty little sixyearold then again i doubt his minds grown much beyond six kestrel ignored them and moved to the front of the wagon robin was already there untying the horses from the hitching post bad luck there they would have to lead the horses around to turn the wagon and the three bullies were purposefully blocking the way the horses were welltrained but it would be easy enough to spook them hes a gyppo he had ta steal sumthin said the second the troublemakers moved in a little closer blocking any escapeunless they left the wagon and horses and fled on foot and they were trapped between the wagon and the blank wall of the guild hall even if anyone here might be inclined to help there would be no way to see what was going on mebbe he stole th wagon mebbe he stole the horses said the third theys too good a horse fer a gyppo sos the wagon replied the first mebbe he stole both hey gyppo ye steal yer rig thas more likely than that tale yer slut spun bout rune given it to ye something about the bullys tone warned kestrel that robins stories about rune had brought them the trouble he feared this fool had been no friend to rune while shed lived hereand he held a longstanding grudge against her like the henfaced woman yah said the third sniffing loudly and grinning we know all bout rune her mams a slut shes a slut an i reckon her friendsr all sluts too he stared at kestrel waiting for an answer and became angry when he didnt get one how bout it he growled aint ye gonna say nothin kestrel had been watching them carefully assessing them and had concluded that while they were very likely strong and probably the town bullies they also didnt have a brain to share among them they were slow and moved with the clumsy ponderousness of a man used to getting his way through sheer bulk and not through skill and the way they held themselves told him they were not used to having any real opposition they wanted to goad him into anger into rushing them like an enraged child they would not be prepared for someone who struck back with agility and control still if they could get away without a physical confrontation he simply stood his ground and stared at them hoping to unnerve them with his silence stalemate they stared at him not sure what to do since he wasnt reacting to their taunts in the way they were used to he stared at them not daring them to start anything but not backing down either robin made a movement toward the slit in her skirt that concealed her knife he put his hand on her wrist to stop her unfortunately that movement broke the tenuous stalemate yah runes a slut an her friendsr sluts said the first one loudly right hill warren he grinned as the other two nodded hey boys i gotta idea we got our filla herso how bout we get a tastef her friend eh they say gyppo women is real hot and he made the mistake of grabbing for robinwho had fended off more bullies in her time than there were people in this village as she launched herself at her wouldbe molester kestrel sprang at the one grabbing for him fighting off assassins for most of your life tends to make you a survivor it also teaches you every dirty trick anyone ever invented kestrel turned into a whirlwind of fists and feet and robin was putting her own set of streetfighting skills into action he hadnt wanted this to turn into a physical confrontation but the bullies had forced it on him and now they were going to find out that the odds of three large men against a tiny man and woman had been very unevenbut not in their favor he kicked the legs out from beneath the one nearest him by slamming his foot into the fools knee before the man had a notion that he had even moved the bully went down on his face and started to scramble up putting his rear in perfect targetrange kestrel followed his kick in the rump with one to the privates so hard that the bully could not even scream only gasp and double up into a ball robin had already done the same to the fool who had grabbed her except that she hadnt bothered to knock his legs out from under him first and she hadnt hit him with the knee either he was expecting that he had backed out of knee range laughing she had snapkicked him as she had intended all along and the laugh turned into a gasp as she put her full weight behind the kick she had followed up her foot to the groin with a backhanded blow in his face with the hilt of her dagger that put him to the ground with a bleeding nose and a few less teeth they both converged on the third bully the one who seemed to be the leader slamming him up against the side of the wagon before he had quite comprehended the fact that his two friends were no longer standing they knocked the breath out of him and robin had her dagger across his throat before he could blink kestrel grabbed his wrists and twisted his arms back while he was still stunned holding him so that no matter how he moved it would hurt and the more he moved the more it would hurt now breathed robin as the bullys eyes bulged with fear and the edge of her blade made a thin painful cut across his throat i think you owe us an apology dont you kestrel jerked the bullys arms so that they wrenched upwards in their sockets he gasped and nodded his eyes filling with tears of pain now the very fact that nothing of this confrontation could be seen from the square or the houses around it worked in their favor so long as no one missed these fools and came looking for them if things went well then againthey probably wont come looking for someone who might be beating the pulp out of two strangers no one wants to know what these three are doing ill bet i also think it would be very wise of you to make that apology like a gentleman and say nothing more about this she continued dont you frantically he nodded his eyes never leaving her face the bloodthirsty expression there would have terrified a denser man than he just a few things i want you to think about before you make that apology she said harshly you might have what you think is a clever idea about claiming how we attacked you after we drive off she shook her head as he broke out in a cold sweat that would be a very very stupid idea first of all youd end up looking like a fool why look how small we are we weigh less than you do the two of us put together think how brave youd look saying that two tiny people attacked you and beat you up and one of them a girl you would wind up looking like a weakling as well as a fool and everyone from here to kingsford would be laughing at you whats more theyd say you cant be any kind of a man if you let a girl beat you up theyd say youre fey and theyd start beating you up any time you left home the sick look in his eyes told kestrel that her words had hit home but she wasnt finished with him theres another reason why that would be a very very stupid idea she continued were gypsies do you know just what that means he shook his head very slightly that means that we have all kinds of ways to find out what youve been doing even when we arent around it means we have even more ways of getting at you afterwardsand all of them will come when you arent expecting them her eyes widened and her voice took on a singing quality and kestrel sensed the undercurrent of music in the mind music that could not be detected by the ears the music he only heard when someone was using bardic magic robins voice matched that music turning her singsong into a real spell a spell meant to convince this fool that every word she said was nothing less than absolute truth well come in the night when youre all alonecatch you on a path and send monsters to chase you until your heart bursts well send invisible things nighthags and vampires to your bed to sit on your chest and squeeze the breath from your lungs while you try to scream in pain and cant well come at you from the full moon and set a fire in your brain until you run mad howling like a dog the bully was shaking so hard he could hardly stand now orwell waitand one night when youre sitting at your ease her eyes widened further and he stared at them unable to look away watching the fireall aloneno one around to help you or save you he was sweating so hard now that his shirt was soaked suddenly the fire will flare it will grow youll be unable to move as it swells and takes on a form the form of a twolegged beast with fangs as long as your arm and talons like razors youll scream and scream but no one will hear you youll try to escape but youll be frozen to your chair youll watch the demon tear out your heart watch as it eats your heart still beating and howl as it takes you down to hell at the word hell a burst of flame appeared under his nose cupped in the hand that was not holding the dagger a slow spreading stain on the front of his pants and a distinctive smell betrayed just how frightened he was the bully had wet his breeches with fear kestrel let him go in disgust and the man dropped to the ground gibbering incoherently robin stepped back and smiled at him sweetly now she said do you apologize for calling me a slut he nodded frantically do you apologize for calling rune a slut his head bobbed so hard it practically came off his shoulders are you going to keep your filthy tongue off rune and any other free bard are you going to take your two playmates and go away and never say anything about this again she smiled but it was not sweetly are you going to pretend all this never happened yes the bully blubbered through his tears yes oh please you may go robin said coolly sheathing her dagger so quickly it must have looked to the man as if she had made it vanish into thin air he fled the other two were just getting to their feet but they had heard and seen everything robin had said and done and they had been affected by her bardic spell too just not as profoundly or immediately as the first bully the one kestrel had kicked helped the one with the bloodied face to his feet and the two of them supported each other getting out of sight as quickly as possible which was precisely what kestrel had in mind as wellgetting away before some other variety of trouble found them he jumped into the drivers seat and picked up the reins giving robin just enough time to scramble into the passengers side before turning the mares and heading out of the village at a brisk trot thanking whatever deity might be listening for the thickening dusk that hid both them and their erstwhile attackers and for the emptiness of the village square whwhy ddid you ddddo that he asked as robin arranged her skirts with a selfsatisfied little smile what she asked as if he had astonished her by asking the question why did i use the bardic magic i wanted him to believe me if i hadnt hed have gotten another dozen of his friends and come after us nnot using ththe bbardic mmagic he scolded guiding the mares around a tricky turn mmaking ththem ththink wwe wwere evil mmmages rremember whwhat the chchurch has bbbeen saying abbbout mmages oh that she replied indifferently what difference does it make he wont tell anyone anything now hell be sure that the moment he opens his mouth a demon will come after him nnow kestrel retorted you knknow the mmagic wwears off hhow llong bbefore he ttells a ppppriest so what were never coming back she had something cradled in her skirts a moment later he heard the distinctive clink of coins hah she said in the next moment as the wagon jounced a little we actually came out ahead whwhat he yelped he knew exactly what that meant shed not only beaten and terrified those bullies shed picked their pockets yyou ddddidnt of course i did she said calmly taking the coins and pouring them into her beltpouch why not they deserved worse than that didnt you hear them ill bet those louts absolutely terrified rune while she lived here they should be grateful that i was in a good mood i almost made the three of them eunuchs while i was at it bbut he protested ththat mmakes us nno bbetter ththan ththey are i dont think so she folded her arms stubbornly across her chest i think we were simply the instrument of proper justice bbut he gave up she would never admit she was wrong even if he managed to convince her of itand even if he did she would only think he was worried about the possible consequences that wasnt what made him so upset but how could he make her understand that she had just acted in as immoral and irresponsible a manner as the church claimed free bards were how could they honestly refute the claims of the street preachers when they actually did what the street preachers said they did even though they had been provoked never mind right now the best thing he could do was drive maybe this would sort itself out later he hoped darkness had fallen by the time they reached the next building on the road the hungry bear inndistinguished as such by the sign over the door a crudely painted caricature of an animal that could have been a bearor a brown pigor a treestump with teeth the sign was much in need of paint the inn was much in need of repair even in the fading twilight and the feeble flame of a torch beside the door that much was all too obvious it was clean superficially at least but so shabby that gwyna would have passed it by without a second thought if they were really looking for a nights work but they werent so when kestrel pulled the horses to a halt outside the front doorwhich didnt even have a lantern only that crude pitchandstraw torchshe hopped down to see if she could find the innkeeper she had barely one foot on the ground before a round blob of a woman dressed in clothing more suited to a coquettish girl came hurrying out to see if they might be customers as she came out of the darkness of the tap room and into the flickering light from the torch gwyna felt her eyes widen in surprise was this runes mother she must becertainly the lavish use of cosmetics and the strawblond hair the lowcut blouse and the kiltedup skirt matched runes descriptions but if this was runes mothereither runes memory was horribly at fault or the woman had doubled or even tripled her weight since rune had left welcome to the hungry bear the woman said her eyes taking in their equippage and probably evaluating it to the last penny my name is stara and i am the innkeepers wifehow may i serve you well that certainly clinched it this was runes mother and she had evidently managed to wheedle connive or blackmail her way into more than jeoffs bed well rune was right about that much and since idont see any other helpers around i suspect they either cant afford more help anymore or no one will work for them so rune was right there too in thinking stara would have turned her into an unpaid drudge given half a chance if rune had stayed shed have found herself shackled to this shoddy inn for the rest of her life with music taking second place to whatever her mother wanted her to do we are musicians innkeeper robin said in a carefully neutral voice we hadnt really expected to find an inn here but we usually offer our services in return for a room and a meal not that id sleep in any bed you had anything to do with you probably havent washed the sheets in months the balding and middleaged innkeeper himself appeared at the door as robin finished her little speech but he held back diffidently saying nothing quite obviously very much the henpecked husband stara looked them over critically and her eyes sharpened with mingled envy and greed at their prosperity no one who drove a rig like theirs new and wellmade would be an inferior musician or poor and given the general air of abandonment when rune ran off most of the business went somewhere else there should be at least a handful of customers in there and the tap room is empty i dont smell anything cooking either which means they dont get enough customers of an evening to have a regular supper ready so if they stayed thered be an empty tap room a poor meal and a cold and musty bed and given what had just happened back in the village it probably wouldnt be a good idea to stop here no matter what else i could find out about stara i think ive seen enough to tell rune all she needs to hear enough to make her glad that she got out while she could uhstara the innkeeper said timidly we dont know these people we dont know anything about them remember what the priest has been preaching these people arent wearing guild colors so many of these free musicians sing that licentious music that music that makes people do sinful things stara started to wave him to silence but it appeared that on this subject at least he would not be henpecked he raised his chin and his voice stubbornly you know very well how sinful we were when that daughter of yours was playing her music here and every night the tap room was full of people dancing singing taking no thought of their souls i know stara muttered resentfully no doubt thinking how full the cashbox had been back then well what if these people are the same kind he asked her his voice rising with a touch of hysteria im sure the sacrificed god has been punishing us for our sin of letting people like that play here while that daughter of yours was here worse than that what if theyre magicians i dont think we should let anyone play here who hasnt been approved by the church harperus words rang at her out of memory how long before the signs say no one permitted without a church license she grimaced her expression hidden in the shadows of the wagon not that id want to play here with or without a license i would not want to make anyone uncomfortable much less give them the impression that they were sinning by simply listening to music robin said smoothly i personally have never heard of any such nonsense as musicians who were magicians but since your priest evidently has i will take his word that such things exist and since obviously you dont want us and no one can prove he isnt a mage well just be on our way we would never want to play where we were under suspicion or where our music wasnt wanted she raised her voice a little more and pitched it to make certain that it carried we are really in no great need of lodging as you can clearly see so do not concern yourselves for us on that score not that you would care but its a nice little dig isnt it stara looked disgusted and stormed back into the tap room the innkeeper followed wearing a look that mingled triumph and apprehension in equal measure triumph that he had his way no doubtand apprehension for the way that stara was going to make him pay for getting his way the door shut behind them kestrel looked over at her holding the reins quietly interesting he said she nodded i really think we ought to try camping somewhere down the road between the bullies and priests with tales of music that leads you into sin id sooner trust myself to wolves than westhaven but would ye trust yerselves to ghosts young friends asked a hoarse voice from the shadows of the rear door across the innyard from the sorry excuse for a stable an ye would not turn back round and take the long roador follow th righthand fork o this one a stolid woman with a round red face moved out of the shadows and into the uncertain light of the torch she wouldna tell ye an he would be justs pleased tsee a sinner come tgrief but yons the road over skull hill there be a ghost there a murderin ghost its taken a priest in its time no less so it dont care a tot fer holiness yer safe enough by day but by night aint nobbut safe on skull hill kestrel nodded gravely ththank you llady the cook looked pleased at being called lady tush taint nothin no decent person wouldna pass warnin bout robin looked closely at the woman they knew all about the ghost from rune of course but rune had described someone very like this womanone of her few supporters after the innkeepers first wife had died the cook are you annie cook robin asked the woman stared at her and nodded slowly her expression turning to one of apprehension how dye know annie began clearly suspecting robin of an uncanny unnatural method of learning her name rune told me about you robin replied quickly not sure how long it would be before stara or jeoff came to chase them off she said you were a good friend to her while she was here the uneasy expression turned again to one of pleasure rune i hope th childs well she did aright t run off from here impulsively robin decided to tell annie a more editedand truthfulversion of what she had told the villagers rune is doing wonderfully she is a master free bard herself shes wedded master bard talaysen and they are both in the service of the king of birnam she is very happy and she and talaysen are expecting their first child in the summer annie gaped at her then the gape turned into a smile ye dont say welladay the smile widened why good for the girl if ever there was a child deserved a bita luck it was that un she glared at the closed door of the inn not like er mother that bit cant get nothin without it bein through some mans bed an had rune stayed here sheda been slavin away i that tap room while her mam sat on er fat rump an held th cashbox annie the voice from within was muffled but clearly staras annie rolled her eyes waved a friendly but silent farewell and retreated to her kitchen dark as it was the road was smooth enough to permit them to travel by night at least for a while kestrel held the horses to a walk it wasnt as if they had to fear pursuit from the village it wasnt likely that even if by some miracle the three bullies got over their fright any of them would come pursuing the gypsies in the dark sso that wwas sstara he said nnnasty ppetty piece id have run off long before rune did robin said thoughtfully long long before rune did that woman cant see past the end of her nose and if she ever had a generous bone in her its long since gone kestrel chuckled ssunk in ffat it was still barely warm enough for crickets which sang a melancholy tune in the grasses beside the road overhead thin clouds obscured the stars the overcast was blowing off but the moon was not yet out no way to see past the dim lanterns on the front of the wagon but the underbrush was so thick on either side of the road that there was no chance of the horses wandering off and this road according to the maps went straight to carthell abbey without forking by way of skull hill that was according to the map according to rune and annie cook the road forked a little way ahead and while the old road still went over skull hill the locals had cut another cruder path around the dangerous place passable she had said i ththink that ccompared to sstara the ghghost mmust have been a ppleasant audience he said trying to make a small joke robin chuckled certainly more appreciative and the ghost rewarded talent instead of stifling it ttrue the horses clopped on through the thick darkness carefully feeling their way kestrel had been watching for roadside clearings but there didnt seem to be any he was beginning to wonder if they ought to stop and camp along here even if they had to camp in the center of the road after all it wasnt as if it got very much usethey were hardly likely to block anyones travel by the old tracks they had seen they might have been the only wagon along here in the past week ththat pplace where the rroad fforks should bbe around here ssoon he said what if wwe what if we go up skull hill robin asked suddenly for a moment he wasnt certain he had heard her right whwhat he blurted what if we go up skull hill she repeated confront the ghost just like rune did he had heard her correctly are you ccccrazy he spluttered why she laughed she didnt sound crazy she did sound rather determined however why not she replied rune did and she wasnt even fully trained we already know it likes music and it might have another silver hoard or something equally interesting to swap for our music we might be able to get him to grant unmolested passage to gypsies and free bards and that would be worth a night of playing alonewe might need a road some day that no one will take he chewed on his lip fiercely and thought about it she had a point she had a very real point the old road ran this way for a reason it was a shorter route than the one that harperus and tfyrr were taking if gypsies and free bards knew it was safe for them to use it could take a couple of days off their trips in this part of the world and if no one else would use the road for fear of the ghostit made a very neat escape route in case of trouble from here to stillwater was no great distance and stillwater could be held against even armed men if necessary let me get a lantern and walk ahead of the horses so i can spot the place where the road forks she said while he was still thinking about it he pulled the horses to a halt she wriggled back over the bed and popped out the back with a lit lantern in her hand she trotted up to take the halter of the righthand horse and held the lantern over her head to keep from getting glare in her eyes well that was all very well for her but nothing saved him from the lanternglare he squinted but he couldnt quite make out the road he let the reins go slack she was the one who could see where they were going and he realized a few moments later that she was leading them down the lefthand fork of the road the overgrown but obviously older fork of the road robin he yelped whwhat are you dddoing she stopped the horses and looked back at him a little defiantly i told you she said i want to climb skull hill to meet this ghost face towhatever robin left the mares and brought her lantern back to kestrel placing it at his feet she looked up into his face carefully gauging his expression i dont think theres any real danger she said calmly and reasonably watching his eyes honestly or i wouldnt even consider this he didnt seem frightened of course he could be hiding his fear nno ddddanger he repeated sarcastically whwhen whwho knknknows how mmmany ppppeople have dddied up ththere she took a very deep breath and got a firm grip on her temper he wasnt saying she was stupidwasnt even implying it when have i ever done anything really reckless she asked him he looked as if he was about to say somethingbut thought better of it and closed his mouth again ggo on he said grimly im lllistening if yyou have a rrreal argument bbbesides ccuriosity i wwant to hhear it ive known something about magic for a long time she told him at least about some of the tinier magics not bardic magic but little things gypsies take for granted healing animalcharming that kind of thing and i think i know how this ghost kills i am pretty sure that his only real weapon is fear and he cant do anything unless youre already afraid of him kestrel looked skeptical but a little less grim sso she licked her lips and stared at the lamp flame for a moment if youre afraid of him he can turn that fear against youhe can make it so overwhelming thatthat it becomes something the human body just cant deal with the heart races until it just gives up he chases you until you drop dead of exhaustion that kind of thing maybe some people dont diemaybe most of them dont die they just run mad in this wilderness until they die of thirst or starve or wild beasts get them ththats vvvery cccomforting he said with heavy irony but the point is that if you arent afraid of him he cant hurt you she insisted or if you interest him he wont use that weapon of his rune wasnt completely terrified of himand she interested him so she was able to stand up to him i dont know why we cant kestrel shook his head whwho sssaid wwe arent afffraid of hhim he muttered nnnot mmme she chuckled as if he had made a joke jonny do you think i would have suggested this if you werent a master bard in your own right think a minute rune managed to entertain this ghost before she was even trainedwhen she was just a little better than a common traveling musician like all those people back in the waymeet just think for a moment what we might be able to find out from him jonny youre going to be the best thing hes heard inwell since he got stuck up there the only thing he was vain about was his talent and his ability as a musician he began to soften as she appealed to that vanity i think we can do this with no danger she said persuasively i think you could do this all alone but with two of us there we can keep from getting too exhausted finally the stubborn line of his jaw softened and he sighed you rrreally want ttto ddo ththis ddont you yes she replied firmly i do call ita sort of test i want to measure myself against the same standards as the best musicians i know this is one of them he shook his head all rrright he replied ththis mmakes mmore ssense than whwhat you ddid back in wwesthaven anywwway and as she led the horses up to the top of skull hill she was left to wonder what in heavens name did he mean by that chapter seven gwyna was just as glad that jonny was not as familiar with runes history as she was it had not been easy to convince him to go along with her scheme but her appeal to his only point of pride had turned the trick if he had known as much about the ghost as she didhe might not have agreed even under a threat to their lives robin knew she had a distinct advantage over kestrel she had heard rune tell the story of the skull hill ghost in detail several times jonny had only heard the song she knew pretty much what to expect and when to expect it she knew all there was that rune had been able to put into words about the effect the ghost had on people she had paid very close attention to that story each time rune had told it because even before she had ever met jonny or had learned that she too had the gift of bardic magic at her disposal she had intended to come to skull hill one day not just because she was determined to proveif only to herselfthat what rune could do she could duplicate no that was the easy answer the one she thought jonny would best understand robin had spent her life in the pursuit of answers for the questions that plagued her the story of the ghost had created more questions for her than answers and had powerfully aroused her curiosity what was this spirit anyway the impression shed gotten from rune was that it was not and never had been human so what was it was it really a spirit at all or something more like an elf except that it was both more limited and more powerful if it was a spirit then why was a spirit bound to skull hill and if it was the spirit of some creature that had not been human when alive then what had brought a nonhuman creature here to the heart of a human kingdom and what had bound its spirit here after death and why was it killing people with fear runes story made it very clear that the ghost was deliberately trying to murder his victims the deaths that had occurred were as a result of the ghosts deliberate use of his powers to kill by that definition it was a murderer but the fact that heithad also let rune buy her way free with her music implied that the ghost could spare people when it chose to do so the things it had said implied that it was not free to leave those implications only opened up a horde of questions so far as robin was concerned before she had ever met jonny curiosity had driven her to do things and go places when nothing else would have questions would burn inside her until they found an answer talaysen often said it was her greatest strength and her greatest weakness and she didnt see any reason to disagree but her curiosity had gotten her information that might never have come into the hands of the free bards or the gypsies otherwise and many times that information had been important to their survival this time both intuition and curiosity had combined forces this is important that was the message she was getting from both she didnt get many hunches and she tried hard to follow them whenever she did they were right more often than they were wrong she kept the lantern over her head to keep her eyes from becoming dazzled by the light and led the horses up the untidy longneglected track it wasnt as overgrown as she would have expected though no bushes or trees only weeds and those looked sickly and were no taller than her calf even after a summers worth of growth she knew what that meant there was a road underneath this track one of the old roads the ones no one knew how to build anymore if she got out a shovel and dug she knew she would hit the hard surface of one of the roadways that dated back to the cataclysm it would be a lightless black substance like stone but yielding like tar but much harder nothing could grow through it that was why there was nothing growing on this track but short weeds the earth and loam that had covered this road couldnt be more than an inch or so thick just enough for grass and weeds to take root in there would be no cracks or imperfections in it unless she came to a place where an earthquake had split it or the edge of a cataclysmboundary where it would be cut off as if by a giant knife the old roads usually connected two or more important placesor at least places that had been important before the cataclysm there were often ruins along them the deliambrens always wanted to know about old roads so the gypsies kept track of the ones they ran across did harperus know this one was here probably not whatever this segment had connected before it certainly connected nothing of any import now gradford was a very minor citystate despite its pretentions otherwise and what was westhaven nothing full of nobodies a deadend dying and not even aware it was in its deaththroes too stupid to know that its days were numbered the only thing that makes it important is that rune came from there gwyna thought cynically thinking of the women in the marketplace and the three bullies they had left damaged of course she hadshe hopedinflicted some emotional damage on the women who deserved it with her descriptions of runes fame and prosperity i hope that henfaced bitch is so envious of rune that she chokes on her dinner i bet shes the one that set those bullies on us i hope she nags her husband about silk gowns and carriages until he beats her senseless i hope that fool i scared into incontinence is her husband and i scared him into impotence as well she kept her feral snarl to herself vindictive oh a tad she knew better than to say any of this out loud jonny bless his sweet little heart was not vindictive he believed that concentrating on revenge simply reduced you to the level of your persecutors gwyna believed in an old gypsy proverb get your revenge in early and often you might not have another chance maybe that was why the ghost fascinated her so was he somehow working out some bizarre scheme for revenge if so on who and why was he choosing to let some people by people they never even heard of because they were unaware that they had been in any danger at all or was he a strange revenant from the distant past from the time when this old road had been in use could something have called him up out of that past to haunt this stretch of roadway could his reasons and motives or need for revenge be buried so far in the past they no longer had any relevance or if this creature was strange enough could they even understand his reasons much less his motives an owl called up above her and she sighed no point in following that line of speculation he had to be understandable there was no point in this otherwise well hes enough like us to enjoy our music the track grew steeper and she felt the strain in her calf muscles too bad she couldnt ride but if she let the horses try to pick their own way they might get hurt she glanced back at jonny he was watching all around them nervously expecting the ghost to pop up at any moment she didnt think that was likely the ghost and things like him often picked specific times to appear sunset midnight moonrise or moonset seemed to be the most often chosen since people had been caught out on this track by the spirit after dark not knowing that it was there and since rune had climbed skull hill without seeing the ghost and had to actually wait for it to appear robin guessed that it probably appeared at midnight or moonrise tonight the two would be almost simultaneous midnight and moonrise within moments of each other and they would be at the top long before either there would be plenty of time to rest her aching legs and eat a little time enough to park the wagon and ready the instruments time to think about what they were going to play what they were going to say everything needed to be perfect for this performance after all it was going to be the performance of a lifetime and it had better be the best performance of their lives she had the feeling that the ghost would not accept anything less you might as well eat something robin observed biting into her breadandcheese with appreciation mother tolley did indeed make very good bread firm and sweet with a chewy crust about the onlything good in that whole town she decided unless annie cooks skills match runes memory the tasty bread settled into her stomach comfortably and she took another bite cccant jonny replied nervously fingering the tuningpegs on his harp as he watched the shadows for any sign of the ghost there was nothing and had been nothing since they had parked the wagon here and if runes story was accurate there would be plenty of warning when the ghost did arrive it was not going to sneak up on them when they werent looking likes to make an impressive entrance i wonder if it was an actor once they were at the very top of the hill with the slash of the road going right across the clearing at the very peak as overcast as it was even with the lamp burning you couldnt see a thing beyond the darker forms of trees and shrubbery against the slightly lighter sky a cool breeze blew across the clearing but it held no hint of moisture and no otherworldly scent of brimstone or the fetor of the grave either robin shrugged as she caught jonnys eye this would steady your stomach she suggested its going to be a long time until dawn youre going to need a little sustenance before the night is over i gguess sso he said after another long moment but he groped after her hand then seized the slice of breadandcheese she handed him without looking at it and wolfed it down without tasting it his eyes never leaving the clearing in front of their wagon with the help of the lantern gwyna thought shed identified runes rockthat is the one rune had been sitting on when the ghost appeared to her they had parked the wagon with the tail of it facing that rock and the clearing in front of it she figured it was the most likely place for the ghost to manifest now it was just a matter of waiting jonny was not taking the waiting well he was as tight as a harp strung an octave too high and if she hadnt seen him in crisis situations and known that he handled them well and settled once the crisis was upon them shed have been very worried about his steadiness her stomach was flutteryhence the breadandcheeseand her shoulders were tight but her senses seemed a hundred times sharper than usual and everything happened with preternatural slowness she heard every cricket clearly and knew exactly where it was she knew where the owls were hooting and about how far away they were she felt the breeze across her skin like a caress she tasted the bitter tannin of dead leaves the promise of frost in the air all of it was very immediate and very vivid she wanted this to happen she had not felt so alive for weeks that was what performance nerves did to her shed felt exactly like this when theyd gone in to confront jonnys uncle king rolend afterwards she might shake and berate herself for doing something so riskybut now there was only the chill tingle of anticipation and and the moon was rising she caught the barest hint of it a mere sliver of silver at the horizon before it was covered by the clouds but that was enoughand enough to tell her that the chill tingle she felt along her nerves was not anticipation it was something else entirely magic the crickets the crickets stopped chirping abruptly with no warning they had not faded away no they had stopped entirely leaving behind a hollow and empty silence that seemed louder than a shout the breeze dropped into a dead calm then in the very next moment a wind howled up out of nowhere just as rune had described a wind carrying the chill of a midwinter icestorm it flattened their clothing to their bodies and if robin had not taken the precaution of binding her hair up for travel it would have blinded her with her own tresses this was not a screaming windno this wind moaned it sounded alive somehow and in dire deadly despairing pain a hopeless wind a wind that was in torment and not permitted to die a tortured wind that carried the instruments of its own torture as lances of ice in its bowels it whirled around them for a moment mocking their living warmth with deathly cold as they huddled instinctively close together on the wagontail there was more than physical cold in this wind the hair on her arms rose as she realized that this wind also carried power not a power she recognized but akin to it the antithesis of healingpower malignant bitterly envious and full of hate the horses were utterly silent and when she looked back at them she saw them shaking sides slick with the sweat of fear and the whites of their eyes showing all around she didnt blame them now now that it was far too late she realized what an incredibly stupid thing she had done whatever had made her think she could bargain with this thing this wasnt a spiritit was a force that was a law unto itself she shook with more than cold she trembled with more than fear she had walked wideeyed into a trap her own confidence had betrayed her her guts clenched and her throat was too tight to swallow her mouth dry as dust and her heart pounding the wind spun out and away from them in the blink of an eye it swirled out into the clearing gathering up every dead leaf and bit of dust with it in a moment it had formed into a column a miniature tornado swaying snakelike in the middle of the clearing there were eyes in that whirlwind not visible eyes but something in there watched her she felt those eyes on her skin felt them studying her and searching for weaknesses hating her hating jonny hating even the inoffensive horses hating every living thing because they were alive and it was not she couldnt take her eyes off the whirlwind and runes description quite vanished from her mind all she could think of were the words of the song then comes a wind that chills my blood and makes the dead leaves whirl but the song had said nothing about how the leaves glowed with a fight of their own nor about the closing in of malignant power as it surrounded her and increased until it choked her each leaf glowed in a distinctive shade of greenishwhite the veins a brighter white against the shape of the leaf somehow calling to mind things rotting things unhealthy the leaves pulled together within the center of the whirlwind forming a solid irregular shape in the middle of the whirling wind and dust a shape that was thicker at the bottom than the top with a suggestion of a cowl crowning it all the shape grew more distinct by the moment as the wind whipped faster and faster until the individual leaves vanished into a glowing blur then the odd shape at the top of the column was a cowl and the entire form was that of a hooded and robed figure somehow proportioned in such a way that there was never any doubt that this thing was not and had never been human exactly as rune had described rising up in front of me a thing like shrouded death oh it looked like death in his shroud all rightworse it felt like death the wind died it had after all done its work and was no longer needed robin had never felt so cold or so frightened her heart seemed lodged somewhere in her throat and her fingers were frozen to her instrument its doing this not you the thought came sluggishly up through a thick syrup of fear this thing is making you afraid didnt you feel the power fight it fight it or you wont be able to speak and if you cant speak you cant bargain and you certainly cant sing with the thought came determination with the determination and the sheer stubborn will came the realization that the fear was coming from outside her she clenched her jaw as momentary anger overcame the fear and broke it it was gone all in that instant and once broken the spell of fear did not return she sat up straighter she was free her stomach unknotted her heart slowed her throat cleared and she was able to breathe again the last of the leaves settled around the base of the robe the figure within that robe was thin and dreadfully attenuated if it had been human it would have been nothing but bone but bone that had been softened and stretched until the skeleton was half again the height of the average human male elongated that was the description she was searching for and yet there was nothing fragile about this thing the cowl turned towards them slowly and deliberately and there was a suggestion of glowing eyes within the dark shadows of the hood the voice when the thing spoke came as something of a surprise robin had expected a hollow booming voice like the tolling of a deathbell instead an icy spidery whisper floated out of the darkness around them as if all the shadows were speaking and not the creature before them how is itit whisperedthat you come here not one but two musicians have you not heard of me of what i am of what i will do to you robin felt the pressure of magic all around her as the ghost tried to fill her with fear and make her flee but the fear failed to touch her she sensed only the power and not the emotion the ghost sought to use against her so it did not know she had broken its spell time to enlighten it of course we have heard of you she said clearly and calmly the whole world has heard of you listen her fingers picked out the introduction to the skull hill ghost and she began to sing i sit here on a rock and curse my stupid bragging tongue and curse my pride that would not let me back down from a boast and wonder where my wits went when i took that challenge up and swore that i would go and fiddle for the skull hill ghost as she sang she exerted a little magic of her own warm and loving magic bardic magic and gypsy magic and the magic of one true lover for another she sent it not at the ghost but at kestrel all of it aimed at breaking the spell of fear that held jonny imprisoned in his icy silence as she had been imprisoned a moment before the warmth must have reached him for as she reached the chorus he shook himself and suddenly his harp joined the jaunty chords of her gittern as his voice joined hers in harmony ill play you high ill play you low for im a wizard with my bow for music is my weapon and my art and every note i fling will strike your heart that was a change from the original wording of runes contestsong more of a metaphor for the lifeanddeath battle she had waged to save herself from the ghost and a life of grim poverty than the original chorus had been robin continued in the rune persona with kestrel coming in with the ghosts first linein a cunning imitation of the ghosts own voice give me reason why i shouldnt kill you girl she watched her audience of one as closely as she had ever watched any audience had she seen the spirit start with surprise at hearing his own words she responded as rune ive come to fiddle for you sir kestrel came inand again his voice was not a booming and spectral one as wren usually sang the part but in that deliberate imitation of the ghosts true disembodied whisper oh have you so then fiddle girl and pray you fiddle well for if i like your music then ill let you live to play but if you do not please my ears ill take you down to hell the cowl nodded ever so slightly and the pressure of magic eased off now robin concentrated on the music and not the ghost she had his attention now she must keep it the song was a relatively short one meant for a faire audience that might not linger to hear an extended ballad the last verse came up quickly at last the dawnlight strikes my eyes i stop and see the sun the light begins to chase away the dark and midnight cold and then the light strikes something more i stare in dumb surprise for where the ghost once stood there is a heap of shining gold then she and kestrel swung into a double repeat of the last chorus laughing and triumphant ill play you high ill play you low for im a wizard with my bow and music is my lifeblood and my art and every note i sing will tame your heart they finished with a flourish worthy of master wren himself the ghost regarded them from under his hood with a speculation and surprise that robin felt just as she had felt the fear he had tried to force on her well it whispered the voice now coming from beneath that cowl and not from every shade and shadow in the clearing so the little fiddler girl survived did she thrive as well as survive there was more than a little interest in that question and not a hint of indifference he remembered rune and he wanted to know about her she continues to thrive sir robin said boldly your silver bought her lessons and instruments and brought her to the kingsford faire and the free bards she got a master from the free bards and then more than a master for she wedded him and earned her title of master and of elffriend as well they sing for a king now and wander no more a good king i am sure came the return whisper she would settle for naught else the bold child who dared my hill then amazingly something that sounded like a hint of chuckle emerged from beneath the cowl it is i trow hard to find a rhyme for silverand that heap of shining gold tells me why on a sudden a fool or two a year has come to dig holes in my hill when they never did before and they fffind jonny asked boldly rocks and sometimes me again the chuckle but this time it chilled and had no humor in it once again she sensed the power coiled serpentlike behind him a power that quickened to anger at very little provocation so before he had time to be angered at the song at them she spoke sir we came to ask a bargain of our own not gold or silver or even gems she was the entire focus of the ghosts gaze now the antithesis of the tropical sun it fell upon her and froze her in a silence of centuries or tried it was at that moment the ghost must have realized she was not caught in his web of terror for the spirit straightened a little in what looked very like surprise whatbargain it said at last we will tell you anything you care to ask in as much detail as you wish if we know the answers she said faintly from beneath the weight of that gaze we will sing and play for you until dawn as rune did information and entertainment and in return the frigid pressure of his regard deepened in returnwhat besides your lives of course you have notyetearned those she tried to answer and could not for a moment she struggled in panic knowing that if she did not answer he could and would use that as the only excuse he needed to take her kestrel ffree ppassage ffor ggggypsies and fffree bbbbards kestrel stammered forcing the words out for her fighting his stutter as she fought the ghosts compulsion the ghosts cowl moved marginally as his gaze transferred to kestrel and the pressure holding her snapped exactly she said quickly into the ominous silence free and unmolested passage across your pass at any time of the day or night for gypsies and free bards including us of course thats all she remembered now something else that rune had saidthat the ghost had heard her tale of being harassed and plagued and then had said that he and she might have more in common than she guessed were something less than popular with the church right now she added and had the reward of seeing the cowl snap back to point at her and with the bardic guild we sing a little too much of the truth and we dont hide what we know for the sake of convenience we might need an escape route the ghost hissed and nodded yes i can see that he stood wrapped in weighty chilling silence for a long time she studied him trying to determine what his race wasor had been he matched nothing she had ever seen or heard of too tall for a deliambren a gazner or a prilchard no place under that robe for the wings of a haspur i amastonished the ghost whispered at last to dare me and my power simply to assure your friends of an escape route in case of dangerto dare me he did not breathe but he paused for as long as it would take someone to take a deep breath yes i will make that bargain with a single exception exceptions why would he have to have exceptions her eyes narrowed with speculation and suspicion the ghost returned her gaze but this time without the pressure of his magic behind it i must have the exception he said simply i ambound to a task as i am bound to this place now she sensed the full scope of the terrible power of his anger once long ago she had been in the presence of a dreadful weapon of what the deliambrens called interstellar warfare this interstellar thing was something they could not explain to her but she had sensed nevertheless the shattering potential for destruction encased within the metal podskin of the object they showed her the ghosts anger felt like that like the moment before the storm is about to break when the earthquake is about to strike when some force too large for a mere human to comprehend is about to be unleashed and yet it was not directed at her nono his anger is for those who have bound him here may their gods help them if he ever does get free if your gypsies and free bards are not sent here from carthell abbey they may pass he continued in his icerimed whisper but if they are sent i have no choice iam bound to slay anyone who is sent from the abbey any other i shall let pass freely this is the bargain take it or not fear not for yourselves i shall let you pass without your music if you choose not to take it she looked at kestrel out of the corner of her eye he nodded slightly it was the best they were likely to get the ghost was giving a pledge within the limits of his ability to fulfill it kestrel sensed that as well as she did done she said i wont hold you to something you cant promise the ghost nodded ever so slightly but the atmosphere suddenly warmed considerably physically as well as emotionally although he did not sit she felt a relaxation about him and the chill breeze that had swept through the clearing vanished to be replaced by a breeze as comfortable as any of early fall with a hint in it of false summer i should have given this small comfort to the fiddler girl had i recognized her bravery and honesty the ghost whispered as jonny took her hand for a brief congratulatory squeeze but she was the first i had ever seen who deserved that consideration so perhaps it is not surprising i did not recognize this until after she was gone sotell me first of her in more detail and of her song she almost smiled at that and caught herself just in time so he likes being famous as well as any living being well i think i can oblige him she told him runes history or at least as much of it as she knew from the moment that rune had left skull hill how she had put his money to proper use investing it in instruments and lessons how she had gone to kingsford faire to take part in the trials for the bardic guild how her song of the skull hill ghost had won her acclaim and the highest points in the trials how the guild had treated her when they learned she was a girl and not a boy that made him angry again interesting how she could sense his moods now as if he had let down some sort of wall or she had become more sensitive she pitied the next guildsman bard or minstrel that might pass this way by accident he would take out his anger at what they had done to his fiddler girl on any of the guild that came into his hands she went hastily on to describe how the free bards had rescued her and what had happened to her then he asked her detailed questions about talaysen master wrenand about king rolend and her position in birnam she sensed his satisfaction in the rewarming of the emotional atmosphere good he whispered at last very good i am pleased despite her enemies she has triumphed despite fools she has prospered he nodded and the crickets began to sing again down the hill at first then up around the clearing he turned his cowl towards kestrel now music he continued you harper something with life in it warmth the sun kestrel nodded without speaking and set his hands to the strings of his harp as always he was lost in his music within the first few bars and as always he invoked bardic magic without any appearance of effort robin wondered if he realized what he was doing the magic that he called was mild harmless and did nothing more than invoke a mood in this case in performing a sweet childs song about a mountain meadow he enhanced it with a mood of sunny innocence the ghost either did not notice or else since it was not threatening he simply ignored it probably the latter robin had the feeling he noticed everything as jonny played she paid careful attention to the flow and flux of powers about them all about halfway through the song she knew that there was a pattern to those flows and near the end she knew what it was she had a suspicion when he agreed to the bargain that the ghost would take power from them through the music through the bardic magic he hoped they would invoke and it looked as if she was half right but only half he was not stealing their power nor pulling it in it was as if they were campfires and he was basking in the warmth they produced taking nothing only enjoying what flowed to him naturally but she sensed something else as well this benign enjoyment was the reverse side of something much much darker that was the side that his victims saw the icy chill to the warmth as he stole their lifeforce along with their life he chose a gypsy love song from robin next she hid a grin because she had the feeling he was hoping shed sing something at and for kestrel well he would get thatbut not just yet instead she sang a song of a night of celebration and tangled lovers who could not make up their minds over who was going to pair off with who until in the end everyone ended up sleeping alone for that night at least she got the definite impression that her audacity pleased him and that the song itself amused him tell me what this quarrel is that the church has with your kind he whispered as soon as she had finished how did you come to this conclusion and what are you doing to remedy it all that you know tell she found herself recounting what nightingale had told them what she and kestrel had seen and harperus speculations he listened silently to all of this not prompting her by so much as a single word as she concluded with what she and jonny were doingheading to gradford on the chance that the source of the problem lay in that direction while nightingale went in the opposite direction the anger was back again but this time she could not imagine what had invoked it she was only glad that it hadnt been any of their doing i thinkthe ghost began after a cricketfilled silenceyour searches are like to bear more fruit than hers but before she could follow up that astonishing bit of information with a question of her own he had already demanded a ballad with free wind in it from kestrel he obliged with one of the gypsy horsetrainers racing songs and by the time he had finished she knew without asking that questionhow he knew that gradford was the direction they must gothat the ghost would only give them what he chose to in the way of information it would be enigmatic they would probably only understand what he meant after they discovered answers for themselves and he was much too dangerous to play games with verbal or otherwise so when he asked her again for a love song this time she played one of her own made for jonny and put her whole heart into it i think the ghost said tilting his cowl up towards the eastern sky that it is not long until dawn gwyna shook soreness out of her weary arms this had taken a lot more energy than she had ever suspected and if she felt this way with kestrel and talk to spell her how had poor rune ever survived her night of playing i did not lend my strength to you as i did to the fiddler girl the ghost said matteroffactly as if he had just read her mind perhaps he had she would not place anything beyond him at this point and she was very glad that they had both chosen to tell him only the strict and complete truth when he had asked his questions about the outside world his interrogation had been fascinating to experience things he had wanted to know he wanted to know in depth and things she had assumed he would be curious about he cared nothing for but those things he wished to knowhis questioning left her feeling like a rag that had been used to soak up something then wrung dry he not only extracted information from her but as the night went on he became more and more adept at extracting her feelings about something from her she was not certain of his motives it might only be that he had wished to feel things if only vicariously it might be he extracted some nourishment from emotions which might also explain why he killed through terror it might also be that for some reason he needed to understand if she felt strongly about something and why you did not need that strength he continued there were two of you and you did not play continuously so dawn approaches your bargain is complete you have given as you pledged and fully i shall pledge likewise from this moment all gypsies and free bards that are not sent from carthell abbey may pass this way freely he cocked his head a little sideways i may appear and request a songbut it shall be a request kestrel blew on his fingers to cool them and echoed the ghosts headpose i ththink ssuch a reqqquest would bbe honored he said dryly there was a whispered chuckle from the ghost you need not give them identifying marks the spirit continuedwhich was something that had been in gwynas mind such things can be stolen or counterfeited i shall know them from their thoughts she didnt bother to hide her start of surprise so he could read thoughts on occasion he whispered and there was a hint of humor in his voice and perhaps a touch of smugness you have been generous in your bargain i shall be as generous spend the morn in safety here if you wish or go on nothing shall molest you or disturb you while you sleep my choice of manifestation is my own for their compulsions were limited in natureand if i choose to expend myself the daylight need not hinder my powers and with that final astonishing pronouncement he disappearedjust as the first light of the dawnred sun touched the precise spot on which he had been standing just the moment before the sunlight glinted on something metallic it was kestrel who climbed down from the tail of the wagon placed his harp carefully on the floor of the wagon and walked stiffly across the sungilded weeds to the spot that shone with such bright and promising glints well he said carefully looking down at the small mound its sssilver jjust llike rrrunes she let out the breath she had been holding and rubbed her tired eyes he said he was going to be generous kestrel tilted his head to one side and dropped down to sit on his heels beside the pile of coins sso llets ssee how gggenerous shall wwe she yawned hugely and blinked at the morning sun i cant think of any better way to relax before a good long sleep can you he shook his head and stole a kiss from her as soon as she joined him then the two of them knelt down beside the pile of coins that the ghost had left as their personal reward they counted with one hand each their other two hands were clasped together lovingly chapter eight robin woke to the sounds of birdsong and the soft whistling of a human she knew by the absence of a warm body next to her that she was alone in the bed but since the whistling was nearby she was not alone in the wagon after a moment the sound of creaking and tapping told her what was going on kestrel was caching the silver coins in little hiding places all over the wagon all gypsy wagons had a few hidden caches for valuables but none had so many as this one while it was being built hed been with the wagonwrights every day planning hiding places everywhere it was possible to cache even a single tiny copperpiece robin knew where some of the caches were but she hadnt a clue where he hid most of the money they had i think he does it so i cant spend it or give it all away she thought with amusement probably not a bad idea sometimes i get a little too generous i suppose and i know i get a little too spendthrift when i know we have the money those days when he had not had even regular meals made him more cautious about money and lean times than even old erdric so she could hardly blame him it was just something she was going to have to learn to live with she stretched enjoying the rare luxury of having the bed to herself for a moment and opened her eyes to stare up at the intricate carving on the underside of the cupboard over the bed a nice touch that it was a sinuous form called the endless knot that was supposed to aid in concentration and relaxation if you followed it with your eyes long enough the encounter with the ghost had given her more than she had hoped they had the monetary reward completely unexpectedand they had the saferoute across these hills for their people and theirs alone provided of course that none of their people managed to have themselves sent here from carthell abbey therein lay the puzzle that kept her lying abed carthell abbey now what in the name of all that is holy could carthell abbey have to do with a murderous ghost the church had never dealt with ghosts at all except to exorcise them at least not that she had ever heard well the obvious answer was a simple one the church officials knew that the ghost had been bound up on the hill and they used him rather callously as their convenient executioner the church was supposed to remand criminals to the civil authorities for trial and punishment but everyone knew that a criminal priest was dealt with within the church itself and in using the ghost as their executioner the church kept its hands officially clean of blood cynical yes but the church was full of cynics an obvious answer except for a few problems the first was that the minions of the church should have been under spiritual obligation to exorcise the ghost once they learned he was herenot use him especially since he had managed to kill one perfectly innocent priest already at least according to annie cook well maybe they did try to exorcise him and thatwas how the priest was killed maybe they figured since they couldnt be rid of him they might as well use him the church employs other executioners after allthis would just be one rather strange executioner maybe but if the church was using this spirit they were definitely under moral obligation to warn travelers about his existence yet there were no warning signs and nothing telling a traveler that this was a dangerous road there was no guard on the way up skull hill what few warnings there were at least on the westhaven side were haphazard at best if the people of westhaven had been charged with warning travelers they were doing a damn poor job of it that brought everything back to the same question why would the church have anything to do with a spirit like the ghost they should do any number of things that they had not and should not be doing any number of things that they were she rolled over and poked her nose through the curtains on the wagonside of the bed jonny was fitting a small pile of silver coinsthe last from the look of thingsinto the hem of the curtain above the sink that was one of the caches she already knew about and as he caught the sound of the bed creaking he turned and grinned at her all hidden she asked he nodded its abbout noon he told her if wwe move out nnow wwe should bbe at the abbey bby sunset she nodded and swung her legs down over the side of the bed pushing the bedcurtains back to either side and you think we should go there you think that we might find something out about this vendetta the church seems to have with us she asked as her bare feet hit the wooden floor with a dull thump he handed her a wooden comb and cut bread and cheese while she washed her face and dealt with the tangle of her hair ththe ghghost made a ppoint of mmentioning it he said thoughtfully llike he ccouldnt ttalk about ssomething bbut wwas trying tto ggive us a cclue hmm she accepted breadandcheese with a nod of thanks there is something very strange going on here she observed do you remember when i was describing how nightingale went off towards kingsford and i said we were looking towards gradford he said that we were likelier to find the source of our troubles than she was mmore llikely to bbear fruit he said kestrel agreed i ddont know whether he mmeant the abbey or ggradford bbut i ththink we nneed to sstop at the abbey its a start gwyna replied popping the last of her breakfast into her mouth and licking a crumb of cheese from her thumb you know the proverb soonest begun is soonest done right kestrel kissed her nose and gave her a playful shove in the direction of the drivers seat as she crawled over the bed she saw that he had already harnessed the horses and turned the wagon so that it faced down the hill right he agreed and yyou ddrive i wwas up early and i nneed a nnnap jonny had learned long ago the art of sleeping in odd places and under adverse conditions a swaying jostling wagon was no impediment to his drifting off to sleep he had expected nightmares or at the least dreams troubled by the ghost but he slept deeply and soundly and there was nothing to trouble his sleep he woke shortly before suppertime he exchanged places with gwyna driving while she rummaged around in their stores for something for them both to eat that was not breadandcheese while he recalled only too well the days when he would have been happy to eat breadandcheese for a month running those days were in the past and if he had a choice well the same food for three meals in a row was not going to be his choice this was true wilderness except for the occasional sheepfarm and by the rocky condition of the hillsides he wasnt too surprised soil here was too thin to farm or graze basically the only growing things keeping these hillsides from being completely barren were specialized plants suited to driving their roots into rock and holding tight two or three kinds of trees wiregrass lichen moss and some tough bushes that was about it small wonder there were no people out herethe ghost was hardly to blame for the condition of the land funny he thought somehow though this looks like land thats been worn out as if people were here a long time ago but exhausted the soil so much that it couldnt support anything but this wilderness again well that could be alanda was a strange world and there were places in it like this sidebyside with rich and virgin land or a place like the stronghold of the deliambrens maybe there had been people here just after the cataclysmand maybe they had depended heavily on things coming from far outside because they had depleted their own land so much and after the cataclysm when outside wasnt there anymorethey had died off or gone elsewhere leaving behind the land to recover on its own he shook himself out of his reverie as gwyna reappeared with dinner for both of them speculation about the past was all very well but at the moment he was perfectly willing to put such thoughts aside to concentrate on driving and dinner it was to be bread again but this time with sausage and an apple apiece they thriftily saved out the seeds to be given to the owner of the next waymeet every waymeet had some sort of orchard planted from the seeds the gypsies brought with them so you might find apple trees growing sidebyside with deliambren pares mintak tiers and likonian severins quite often fruits thought to be delicate turned out to thrive in unlikely climates at least under the careful tending of the gypsies thats the last of the loaf robin told him as she handed him his dinner through the hatchway at least we ate it before it went dry hows the road interesting he replied taking a bite wwell kkept it was too one of the reasons why gwyna hadnt been tossed all over the wagon while he negotiated potholes and pits the road had been very carefully patched and graded and that recently she poked her head out then clambered over the ledge into her seat youre right she exclaimed now why keep up a road that only leads to a dangerous pass and a nothing little village kestrel shrugged ddont rread tttoo much into it he cautioned her ccould jjust bbe the ssire ddoing his rrroad dduty rright after all wwe wwere jjust ccomplaining that ththe last ssire wasnt ddoing his dduty on the rroads so nno ppoint in rreading something into it whwhen ththe ssires a ggood one it could be youre right she settled beside him with her arm around his waist and smiled up at him he smiled back and caught her hand in his a small hand but very strong with callouses on the fingers where only a musician would have them a proper hand to match the proper lady just being with her made him feel so warmneeded and wanted being best friends is the only way to be lovers he decided as she rested her head against his shoulder staying best friends is the only way to be married i ththink the abbey isnt ttoo far he said as shadows deepened under the trees and the skies above the branches turned crimson and gold the nnext vvalley mmaybe his guess was correct as they topped the hill and looked down into the shallow valley stretching below them it was obvious that they were back in some vestige of civilization the leafless trees of an orchard lined both sides of the road immaculately tended and as the horses stretched their necks out with interest the sound of bells ringing for evening services drifted clearly up the road he flicked the reins to get the horses moving again for at the sound of the bells they stopped their ears flicking forward nervously long shadows already filled the valley and as they moved down the hill and went from the last light into evenings mist and blue dusk the temperature dropped perceptibly gwyna huddled against him for warmth as well as companionship and he shivered as a chill breeze cut through his shirt once they were beneath the trees they saw the lights of the abbey shining up ahead of them at the side of the road there didnt appear to be any activity at all around it which was a little odd well their harvest is obviously over theres no real reason for anyone to be moving around at sunset not when they just rang the bells for evening prayers the abbey was fairly small a complex of two or three buildings surrounded by a stone wall with a heavy wooden gate in the front trees grew right up against it however and kestrel could only look at them wryly and remember a certain small boy who had found walls to be no hindrance as long as there were trees nearby presumably many generations of novices here had discovered the same truth he pulled the wagon up to the gate handed the reins to gwyna and jumped down to knock for admission it opened immediately there was a lantern just outside and the light fell on a sourfaced brother in a dull gray robe who scowled at him as if kestrel was personally responsible for everything that was wrong with the world the man had the soft inkstained hands of a scholar and a squint that suggested many hours spent in a library bending over halflegible manuscripts his mouth was framed with frown lines and his jowls quivered when he spoke what do you want his voice was not pleasant a harsh and untrained croak kestrel smiled encouragingly and shyly he tried a ploy that had worked with other officious selfimportant men in the past to look as harmless and humble as possible this was the one time his stutter might be useful he bobbed his head submissively wwe are tttravelers sir and wwe are sseeking shshelter ffrom the cccreatures of the nnight wwithin the wwalls of the the brother did not even give him a chance to finish his sentence be off with you he growled this is no hostel and we do not take in any neerdowell who comes requesting shelter this is a holy order of recluses we have chosen to leave the world and all the sin within it we sought to leave such as you in our past not to open our gates to you bbbut kestrel began shocked as well as puzzled by the gatekeepers vehemence he hadnt said or done anything to warrant such a reaction the man acted as if they were dressed in rags and covered in filth yet the wagon was quite clearly visible from the gate and it was just as clear that they were not penniless wanderers he had never yet met a churchman who could resist the possibility of a donation except that it seemed this brothergatekeeper most certainly could and would be off he repeated raising his voice no one is allowed within these walls but the brothers no one find yourself some other shelter vagabonds and mountebanks are not welcome here and before kestrel could get another word out the gatekeeper slammed the gate shut right in his face he turned slowly and walked the few steps back to the wagon to join gwyna who was just as surprised as he was what was that all about she asked a little dazed what on earth made him say those things was he quite mad he shrugged at lleast he dddidnt fforbid us to cccamp up against the wwwalls he pointed out ththere mmight bbe a wwwell or a sstream where wwe ccan gget wwwater he took the halter of the horse nearest him and led it off the road onto the grassy area surrounding the walls of the abbey and beyond the circle of light cast into the blue dusk by the lantern beside the gate gwyna sat on the seat of the wagon shaking her head i have no idea what could have set him off like that she observed dispassionately you were the essence of politenesshe was the one who was rude and every single abbey i have ever seen or heard of has always been willing to take in a traveler or two especially in the wilderness like this this is very strange he noticed that she was pitching her voice to carry as if she was speaking to an audience and he grinned to himself if gwyna had her way her voice would drift right over the walls and just might reach the ears of someone who cared a little more than the gatekeeper what a couple of vagabonds and mountebanks thought of this abbey on the back side of the walls he found the rear gate and the path the brothers took to the orchards and to a small vegetable garden there was a well beside the garden as he had hoped there would be he picketed the horses a little way away from it in an area where there was some grazing and left them water and grain to augment the grass as he worked he took in what he could of the area around the walls the place was unnervingly ordered especially in comparison with the country they had just passed through the garden had been thoroughly plowed up for winter leaving not a trace of whatever vegetables had been growing there he had no clue what variety of tree grew in this orchard of theirs the thrifty monks had left not so much as a windfall fruit underneath them and without leaves it was impossible to make any accurate guess as to what they were growing here while he took care of the horses gwyna bustled about the wagon preparing dinner heating water for washing setting up a pictureperfect campsite too perfect he realized after a moment this was not like the gypsy robin he knew and he grinned again as he saw what she was up to she was acting in every way like a proper little wife a welltrained traders wife who was a good churchgoing woman and a lady who knew her proper place there was nothing to show that they were gypsies and free bards and not ordinary middleclass traders and if the free bards were in disfavor with the church the traveling traders were not so they would look like traders industrious godworshiping traders eh he silently congratulated gwyna on her cleverness and did his best to emulate her right down to shoving their instruments into hiding when he returned to the wagon just in case whoever showed up next from the abbey happened to look inside the wagon there would be someone gwyna had made certain of that not only by her words but by the busy clatter she made with her pots and pans but they were left in peace to wash up and eat that hot dinner she had prepared so carefully and he began to wonder if this abbey was inhabited by nobody but a single mad old man but just as full darkness fell the expected visitor arrived they didnt even notice him he moved so quietly with hardly even a swish of his robe against the grass there were no twigs beneath the branches of these trees to betray him by snapping unexpectedly underfoot the ground had been swept as clean as the floor in a house in fact when the man cleared his throat to announce his presence he succeeded in startling both of them they looked up to see him standing just within the light of their fire a thin diffident man with a pleasant expression and shy eyes oh the brother said immediately apologetic and hurrying forward into the light of their fire im so sorry i certainly didnt mean to frighten you i thought you knew i was there please forgive me kestrel had been sitting beside the fire he stood immediately and went to meet the brother holding out his hand which the man took in a firm and friendly clasp nno offense jjust ddidnt notice you mmy nname is jjjonny bbrede good ssir he said concentrating on speaking slowly and rhythmically as harperus had instructed him mmy wwife ggwyna and i are ttraders and not vagabonds and mountebanks i know the brother said pulling back the cowl of his gray robe so that they could better see his ascetic but friendly face and his apologetic smile i hope you will find it in your heart to forgive brother pierce he is old often ill and altogether very unhappy life has not treated him well most of the brothers here are not like him kestrel returned his smile well i cccan ssee ththat you arent at any rrate bbrother oh ah brother reymond trader brede the brother replied his smile widening when jonny did not meet his friendly overture with a rejection i am the abbey librarian and i wanted to apologize for the fact that we simply have no room for you and your wife that is why brother pierce has been instructed to tell travelers we can take no one in every cell is occupied we have no guest rooms and since our order has taken a vow to use no beast of burden we have not even a stable you might shelter in i also wished to be certain that you were warned about the dangers hereabouts dangers jonny looked around nonplused this certainly didnt look like a very dangerous area but on the other hand this abbey was a small island in the middle of the wilderness they had been lucky so far there was no telling what wandered under the branches of these trees once darkness fell i fear so brother reymond had the grace to look guilty of course to experienced travelers like you and your wife these things are likely to be no more than an inconvenience why dont you tell us what they are first before we decide gwyna said dryly from her place beside the fire perhaps we ought to move on after all oh no the brother said paling no you dont want to do that theres a beguiler about perhaps more than one what if it found you on the road jonny shrugged that was not a threat he took seriously since they had a wagon to sleep in beguilers couldnt get into a closed wagon then i ssuppose wed ddrown he replied lightly beguilers were creatures that hypnotized their victims then lured them into swamps to fall into deep water once their victims were safely dead they feasted on the remains they cast their spell with a combination of sound and light if you saw them but did not hear them you were safe enough and if you heard but did not see them it was possible to remain in control of yourself most often they caught unwary travelers who mistook the light for the lantern of a house or wagon and were then lulled by the beguilers humming to their death it was not too difficult to evade them if you knew they were around oh dont say that brother reymond seemed genuinely distressed why only last weekone of the farm boys hereaboutsnot strong in his mind but still jonny shook his head apologetically i bbeg your ppardon bbrother he said as quickly as he could i ddidnt mean tto mmake a jjoke of it i know you didnt how could you have known brother reymond sighed and signed himself may the poor lad rest in peace but there are also treekies an entire flock of them out in the forest beyond the orchard i hope you have nets for your horses if you dont the abbey can loan them to you in that much at least we can do our charitable duty with or without brother pierces permission gwyna asked lightly and chuckled at brother reymonds blush no matter brother we do have nets and fitted blankets for the horses and good shutters on the wagon we should be safe enough if that is all we need to worry about she patted the stool next to her can we invite you to stay for a while the treekies certainly wont come while the lanterns and the fire are burning and the beguiler may not come at all tonight even if it does i see no reason why we cant avoid it i wouldyes i would like to speak with you if you do not mind brother reymond said shyly he settled down onto the stool placed between gwynas and jonnys and accepted a mug of tea but waved away a bowl of stew thank you dear lady but i have supped and i am not in the least hungered while your stew smells delicious our order regards greed very seriously he cradled the mug in both hands and smiled at both of them i am the archivist you see and i have so little opportunity to speak with outsiders i try to collect as much information as i can but he shrugged my opportunities are few we do not see many travelers on this road i cant think why it is a much shorter route to gradford than the main trade road and the sire tends it well at least within his lands jonny kept his expression completely under control but with difficulty either this reymond was the finest actor in the world or he was completely unaware of the skull hill ghost less than half a day away from here i had heard there was a legend about a haunted hill on this road gwyna said casually we didnt see anything of coursebut we also traveled between here and westhaven by daylight i dont suppose that could have anything to do with the scarcity of travelers brother reymond blinked at her in surprise i suppose it might he replied clearly taken aback i should think but this is the first time i have ever heard anything about a haunted hill his expression grew doubtful perhaps the villagers in westhaven were making a jest at your expense it ccould bbe jonny said easily you knknow hhow sssome of ththese vvvillage ffolk are abbout someone wwith an afffliction i ddo sstutter ththey mmay have ththought i wwas ffeebleminded as wwwell and chchose tto mmake a ffool of mme brother reymond flushed averted his eyes in embarrassment and murmured something appropriate and apologetic jonny watched him carefully and became convinced that the brother was no actor he really didnt know about the skull hill ghost i ddont ssuppose ththere mmight bbe ssomething in your aarchives he added im ccurious now it wwould bbe nnice tto knknow if i wwas bbeing mmade a ggame of certainly brother reymond said after a moment of awkward silence i can look of course i dont remember anything but that doesnt mean a great deal he chuckled with selfdeprecation my memory is not very good i make a fine archivist precisely because of that you know for i have to index and crossindex everything or i would never be able to find a single reference jonny laughed and refilled the brothers mug they continued to chat about some of the things he and gwyna had seen on the road and inserted a question now and again about the internal affairs of the church and the abbey they continued to talk for some timeor rather he gradually turned the conversation so that gwyna was doing most of the talking and he could simply listen and look wise the brother was certainly a guileless sort and quite transparently enthusiastic about any new knowledgebut he had no notion of any kind about the internal politics and policies of the church of the present day politics and policies of the church a hundred years ago now he knew quite well but nothing current it was fairly obvious why he was here he was so innocent he would never have survived in one of the larger church installations the best and safest place for him was out of the way in some other abbey he was far too likely to overhear something he shouldnt and repeat it to anyone who cared to ask him about it three mugs of tea later he finally took his leave with obvious regret here in the lee of the abbey walls there was very little wind but from the nip in the air it had gotten much colder while they talked brother reymond stood and sniffed the air there will be frost by morning he said and sighed this seems like such a sad time of year to meand yet it is such a pleasant season for the farmfolk well so it isone mans pleasure is another mans melancholy jonny saw gwyna raise her eyebrow at this unconscious echoing of a gypsy proverb by a sober scion of the church and smiled just a little quite true brother reymond she said smoothly accepting the mug he returned to her but i cant conceive of anyone finding your conversation unpleasant thank you very much for coming out and proving to us that your fellow brother is the exception within your walls brother reymond colored up with pleasure and murmured a shy disclaimer jonny had decided after the first mug of tea that he liked the archivist as much for his modesty as his eagerness to share knowledge and if there were more men like him he thought as brother reymond thanked gwyna for her hospitality and her tea the world would be a much better place than it is dont forget about the treekies brother reymond reminded them over his shoulder as he hurried away towards the abbey and the beguiler we wont gwyna promised and as soon as brother reymond was out of sight she exchanged a chuckle and a hug with jonny i like him she declared he nodded agreement i ddo too he told her hes honest she didnt answer immediately instead she went to one of the storage bins that contained more of the horsetack and opened it taking out carefully constructed horse blankets that covered everything except the ears and legs then shook out a pair of nets made of wirewrapped cord treekies the little nocturnal flying beasts that brother reymond had warned them about were more of a pest than anything else although their attentions could prove fatal to the unwary light kept them away and any material made of mesh too small for their mouths foiled and frustrated them but if the bloodsuckers caught an animal out unprotected or an unwary human there would be no next generation they could drain a poor creature of blood completely without the victim ever waking up they were usually creatures of much milder climes than this it was the first time that kestrel had ever heard of them being this far north i trust him jonny gwyna said as they fitted the horses with their thick protective blankets then hung the nets over them to keep the little monsters off the mares legs and ears i really do i dont think hes ever told more than a handful of lies in his life and every time he did id bet he gave himself away hes never heard of the ghost kestrel nodded and shrugged i ccant explain it mmind i ddoubt ththe bbbrothers are ever allowed out of ththe abbey sso if ththey arent ffrom around here ththey wwont knknow about llocal ststories bbut ststill still he should have heard something she arranged the net over the patient mares head i cant imagine why he wouldnt have unless she paused and kestrel waited unless the abbot was keeping the existence of the ghost a secret from the brothers she raised an eyebrow at kestrel who had already come to that same conclusion it ccould bbe innocent he reminded her if ththey knknew about a ghghost sso nnear the ddevout and ththe ambbitious wwould bboth rrush tto ttry tto exexgget rrid of it good point she replied as they both turned to go back to the shelter of the wagon we already know what fate they would have and those who were neither devout nor ambitious would probably flee in terror thats quite a reasonable explanation theres only one problem with it remember what the ghost said about people being sent from here he did only too well it ststill ststands as an explanation he replied jjust nnot as innocent hmm she gave him a long look from under her eyelashes as they climbed into the wagon to fasten down all the shutters you arent as guileless as you look jonny brede he grinned nneither are you their night passed with no real disturbance they heard the beguiler humming off in the far distance but it never came anywhere near the abbey eventually they fell asleep without ever hearing anything more sinister than a distant hum out there in the darkness kestrel could not help but be glad that they were not afoot on this journey however they might have escaped the beguileror they might not if it had floated up to their camping spot in the middle of the night and begun singing right over their heads they might have awakened and been trapped by it before they realized what it was no it was a very good thing that they were traveling by wagon and if the beguiler was an example of the kinds of dangers lurking in this wilderness areawell perhaps they didnt have to look for sinister reasons for the abandonment of this traderoad who would want to camp in woods where there were beguilers and treekies but the abbey should be acting as a travelers haven and shelter against things like that came the logical response just as he drifted off to sleep why isnt it and why did the ghost say that people were sent from here and that brought up yet another questionfor brother reymond had said that this abbey was full why send so many brothers to such a remote location surely there werent that many men seeking the solitude of the wilderness and the purity of a womanless existence kestrel loitered over their morning preparations hoping that brother reymond would be able to get away and speak with them before they left but it was not to be instead they packed up and took to the road without any sign from within the abbey walls that there was anything or anyone alive within them even the bells ringing for morning services could have been coming from somewhere else by midmorning they had passed out of the true wilderness and had struck the same traderoad that they had left after the waymeet the road was broader and better tended here than it had been when they left it there was quite enough room for two vehicles the size of harperus monster to pass on this section of the road and it was very obvious that the local sire took his roadtending duties very very seriously there was scarcely an uneven place in the roadway much less one the size of the pothole that had brought their wagon to grief gradford had no sire it was a political entity unto itself although it owed allegiance to the king of rayden the inhabitants referred to it as a citystate or a free trade city and it was very nearly the equal of kingsford in size and importance located deep in the hills it commanded an impressive number of resources water mines and an advantageous position on a traderoad the sole disadvantage to its location was the terrain the hills grew steeper and rockier with every passing hour and they often got out of the wagon and walked alongside it to spare the horses these steep grades were very hard on them going down holding back the weight of the wagon was very nearly as wearing for them as climbing they were so caught up with watching the mares for strain that it was almost nightfall before robin noticed a peculiar lack of traffic on the road and mentioned it to kestrel he furrowed his brow for a moment and shook his head slightly but he waited until they took a breather for the horses before he spoke its ffall he pointed out but with uncertainty its the offsseason ffor ttrade but she shook her head vigorously no it isnt she contradicted him sharply not for the variety of trade that gradford does oh maybe the faires are over for the year but there should be a lot of people on this road and theres no one we havent seen anyone all day wwe might not he told her ththey ccould be rright ahead of us and wwed nnever ssee them nnot with all ththese hhills by the look in her eyes she clearly did not believe him or his explanation wwell sstop at an inn he promised i wwant a rreal mmeal and a bbath if wwe ccan gget one yyoull ssee but when they did find an innfortuitously just over the top of the next hill for the mares needed a real restshe was not the one who found her notions contradicted robin finished ordering supper and went hunting her husband she found kestrel out in the stable making certain that the mares were getting all the care he had paid for she dragged him away from his interrogation of a hapless stableboy and into the common room of the inn their supper was waiting but that was not why she had brought him in here the dark but cozy common room was half empty and from the forlorn expressions on the faces of the barkeeper and the serving girls this was not an anticipated situation they had been the last travelers to seek shelter here tonight and most of the few patrons had already had their dinner and sought their rooms or wagonsbut she had managed to find one man at least who was willing to delay his rest and talk to them in return for a pitcher of beer the quiet of the common room holding nothing more than the vague murmur of talk and the crackle of the fire in the fireplace at their end of the room was relaxing and prompted confidences kestrel she said tugging him towards the table she had taken in the corner and away from any other where they might be overheard as they talked this is rodrick cunart rod this is kestrel she did not bother to introduce jonny as her husband rod was a packtrader a man whose entire life during tradingseason was contained in a single pack carried by a donkey he knew the road and the life on it if a gypsy with a birdname was wandering the roads with another with a birdname it was safe to assume they were together and not safe to take liberties rod trades in books in the north and ribbons and laces in the south she continued as jonny took his place beside her and gave rod a nod of greeting and hes going up to gradford because of some news he got she was pleased to see jonnys interest perk up at that i asked him to tell us whats going on up there kestrel settled down to his dinner of shepherds pie without a word but his eyes never left rodricks the packtrader poured himself a mug of his beer and took a long pull of it before beginning its a good thing yer lady found me he said slowly his accent marking him as coming from one of the southern kingdoms you bein free bards an all it could be bad for ye in gradford theyve gone religious they have an they dont look well on musickers less they be outa the church itself even guild is lookin a bit thin there these days not much trade in anythin but church music an even the guild musickers get mortal weary of that as for ushe shook his headthas why ye see nobbut on road tis dead to trade is gradford even robin who had been expecting some sort of bad news had not been prepared for so bald a statement what happened she asked incredulously the hearty meal before her entirely forgotten for the moment rodrick finished his first mug of beer before replying its all on account of one priest he told them his eyes thoughtful as if he was putting things together for himself right there on the spot very persuasive they say the birds come down offa the trees t hear his sermons he was a count countpresumptive that is count padrik he woulda been if hed waited till his papa died fore he joined the church butlikely he made the better choice if ye read him as a man with a bita ambition hes been arisin in the church like a lark in the mornin fact is he cant be no oldern me an already hes been made high bishop of gradford kestrels brow furrowed isnt ththat a pppost ththat ggoes tto a gggraybeard usually rodrick nodded never heard it go to a man under the age of fifty thats sure well now hes high bishop and seems like all gradfords gone mad for his notions innstheyre closing cause they got no business trade in fancygoods is way down people are actlly taking vows an doin it like they thought the second cataclysm was this midwinter only one trades doin any good an thats the trade in religious stuffs he nodded to himself with smug satisfaction and robin took a few bites of her neglected dinner while he basked in his own cleverness i took mself home gathered up evry book on the church list an ive got em all loaded down on mpoor little donkey havna been able t unload the half of em all these yearsif gradfords gonna come down with a plaguea piety im gonna use the chance t be rida this stuff he beamed at them and robin chuckled good for you rod and thank you for telling us about this it may not make us change our travel plans but were going to have to change our trades i can see that rod drank the last of the beer in his pitcher and stood up to leave so long as it be religious gypsy robin yell profit he said with a nod an on that note ill be takin mleave and a good night and fair profit to you she returned the traditional traders greeting and once again thanks glad t be of service rod replied and took himself off up the stairs to the sleeping quarters used by those who had no wagons to sleep in well robin said turning to kestrel as soon as rod had taken the stairs out of sight and hearing now what do we do chapter nine jonny glanced around quickly to make certain there was no one near enough to overhear their conversation he neednt have bothered they were the only two patrons left in the common room and since robin had already paid for their meal the serving girls were gone the barkeeper polished the top of the counter and put clean mugs up on the shelf obviously there only in the hope that they might order a drink if this common room was typical of the rest of the inn it was one of the better such places jonny had seen in all of his travels then again my pocket wasnt up to bearing the price of inns when i was on my own he thought wryly but this was a good solid place immaculately clean the simple wood furniture was scarred by use and dark with age and many years of cleaning but sturdily made the floors were covered with clean rushes and the smokeblackened beams above were free of cobwebs a few lanterns burned along the walls but most of the light came from the fireplace there were more lanterns along the walls but they were not lit perhaps in the hope of saving a little money on lamp oil eat robin advised him no one is going to hear us or care what we say theyve heard everything in a place like this they know were gypsies and free bards and i rather doubt that the innkeeper is very fond of the church and the high bishop of gradford right now theyre more concerned that their custom has dropped off than in anything we might say or do were just ordinary musicians remember what possible damage could two musicians do to anyone he shook his head and followed her advice there was no point in wasting a perfectly good meal especially not one as tasty as this the cook had a good hand with pastry and the tender flaky crust covered a meat pie rich with brown gravy but his stomach was a trifle uneasy and it took concentrated effort to calm it rodricks information frankly disturbed him it appeared that the ghost might have been right certainly this high bishop was an excellent candidate for the source of the sentiment against free bards an ambitious manas padrik clearly wascould look for no better and quicker road to power than through the church and no quicker way to rise in the church than to find something to get people upset about on religious grounds there arent too many things that can get people aroused the way religion can he observed and with this outbreak of piety sooner or later someone is going to find a cause to expend all their energy on unless padrik is a fool hell be that someone it will be the only way he can continue to control his followers and if the cause turns out to be the control of music and musicians by the church its going to be a bad day for the free bards there his thoughts might have ended if he hadnt spoken with harperus and tfyrr but those conversations had opened his eyes to the fact that an attempt to control would not end with music control had to begin somewhere and the best target for the initial stages of control would ideally be someone who was very obviously different someone who was in the minority an obvious set of targets for that method of control were the nonhuman citizens of the twenty kingdoms so gwyna said as he finished his dinner and pushed the wooden plate away we obviously need to go to gradford even more now than before what are we going to do we cant go in as musicians i have the feeling that wed better have an obvious reason for being there or we might find ourselves the center of some unwelcome attention bbut we ccan ggo in as ttraders jonny replied even ththe ghghosts silver wont llast fforever wwe nneed tto support ourselves sssomehow ththe only qquestion is whwhat do we sssell she toyed with a bit of bread and a stray lock of hair slipped over her eye curling in a most distracting and charming manner religious goods that would be the most obvious reason to be there and it would be the safest really i dont think anyone is going to accuse a peddler of religious goods of impiety she tucked the flyaway lock of hair behind her ear and dropped the bread on the plate the quickest and easiest things for us to come up with on short notice are jewelry and display pieces godstars are very easy to make theyre just tedious and theyre the kind of thing that only common country folk display so very few craftsmen ever bother with them if no one in gradford has thought of selling them well have a temporary monopoly jonny nodded he had never seen godstars until he had arrived in rayden as a child for no one of noble blood would ever be caught wearing or displaying one as walldecorations they were simply fourarmed crosses with colored yarn woven about the arms to form a solid square the colors used varied with the prayers of the owner red yellow and white for instance meant the star was a prayer for prosperity blue green and white meant a prayer for health while blue green and brown was a plea for good harvests he had never heard of anyone making godstar jewelry however how ddo you make sstars as jjewelry he asked it isnt often done because real jewelers and silversmiths cant be bothered she replied with a wry twitch to her mouth you can make them of embroidery thread and twigs or metal and wire with the wire ones you have to be very careful so the wire doesnt breakbut you use iron copper brass and silver wire and two nails for the sacrificed god as the crosspieces easy enough and they make rather pretty little pendants he brightened ththat would wwork bbut where ccan wwe gget materials she thought for a moment sipping at her mug of beer well gradfords a center for metals and gems id bet that we can find someone making wire outside the town and buy up a stock nails are easy it shouldnt be too hard to find a weekly market to get dyed wool yarn and linen embroidery thread and sticks are under every tree whwhy not ask ththe innkeeper he asked with a sudden inspiration wwouldnt he know the bbest pplaces tto find things around here she licked her lips and nodded he would and if hes like any other innkeeper ive ever met hell probably have a relative only too pleased to sell to us thats fine well make him happy and get our stock with a minimum of effort the amount of money well save looking around for ourselves wont be worth the time well waste she shoved her stool away from the table and trotted across the common room to consult with the barkeeper after an exchange of a very few words the barkeeper went off and returned with the man jonny had seen supervising the stable hands gwyna spoke with him for a little and returned to her seat beaming there she said its taken care of i told him part of the truth that we were headed for gradford and just heard we wouldnt be welcome there as musicians so we need to continue our journey in another of our trades peddlers selling handcrafted holy objects since we couldnt afford the loss that going back would mean he snorted said religious trinkets you mean and i knew hed be willing to help us he has a brotherinlaw who can supply us with wire and a cousin who can bring us the wool yarn and linen thread hell sell us horseshoe nails himself so were set jonny shared her grin and took her hand for a congratulatory squeeze sso far he replied sso ggood its a ggood sstart anyway four days later thanks in no small part to the ghosts gift they left the inn with a full stock of godstars in several forms they had bought all of the supplies that the innkeepers relatives had brought and still had some of the ghosts silver left when they were done with their bargaining there were several traysworth of the tiny stars robin had made up as pendants from the cheapest stars of linen thread and tiny twigs to inexpensive copper stars through stars of mixed metals to ones made entirely of silver wire and thin silver bars jonny had learned the knack of turning out wallhanging stars at a goodly clip and he had used up all their yarn at about the same time gwyna had run out of wire he was glad to pick up the reins and drive for a change they had worked for as long as daylight lasted all during those four days and his hands and wrists were sore from twisting yarn around sticks in movements he was not accustomed to making he knew that gwynas hands hurt just as much working with the wire was enough to try the patience beyond bearing for it broke when flexed too often and then it was impossible to mend without the mend showing shed been pierced with the sharp ends of nails and wire so often that her fingerends looked like pincushions and it was just as well that they were not going to be playing their instruments for a while for her fingers needed to heal before she picked up her gittern or harp again they drove off into the dawn with a friendly farewell from the helpful innkeeper who had without a doubt skimmed off a commission from his relatives the road was going to take them through a series of steep hills and if they were going to get to gradford before the gates closed at sunset they needed to get this early start for a price the cook had provided them not only with fresh rolls dripping with melted butter for their breakfast but a packet of meatpies for lunch on the road with so little traffic about kestrel was able to eat with one hand and drive with the other he enjoyed the fresh hot bread but robin was in heaven over it sensuously licking the dripping butter from her fingers until he warned her that if she continued in that fashion they were going to have to make an unscheduled stop she laughed and pouted at him tossing her long hair over one shoulder in a flirting manner and he growled at her playfully ah well she sighed she popped the last bite into her mouth and wiped her fingers carefully on a bit of rag i suppose wed better behave if we make an unscheduled stop we wont get to gradford before the gates close pprecisely he said with mocksternness one of us hhas tto have ssome sselfcontrol she laughed and folded her hands modestly in her lap under the protective warmth of her coat looking about with interest it was a breathtakingly beautiful day in a stark monochromatic fashion but there was no doubt that winter was only a breath or two away frost was so thick on the branches and dead dry grasses that they looked as if they had grown white coats of fur the cloudless blue sky held a sun that gave very little besides light as the road wove its way onward they passed streams that had rims of ice at the edges and their breath and the mares puffed out in white clouds whenever they talked or breathed crows called occasionally off in the distance the hills themselves were covered with forests of hardwood trees that had long since lost their leaves and made a mistlike haze on the hillsides with the interweaving of their graybarked barren branches if it looks like we can pass as churchapproved we might actually be able to play some music she remarked when the inn had receded from sight i ththought about ththat while they had been hard at work on the godstars in order to get themselves into the proper mood they had polished up all the ballads about heroes of the church that either of them knew if nothing else those songs were often used as teaching aids by the priests and singing them made a painless refresher course in theology and accepted doctrine not to mention providing a good source of pious quotations to sprinkle over their conversation ppurely instrumental mmusic ought tto bbe safe if it isnt a ddance ttune and even dddance ttunes ccan bbe made ssafe how she asked full of immediate interest oh of course if we slow the tempo so it isnt a dance tune anymore likely no one will recognize it and add lliturgical chchord sequences ththe kkind you hear in hhhymns he was very pleased with that idea hed already tried it out in his head and it made even the liveliest toetapper sound as if it came straight from holy services she nodded her face full of pleasure at his cleverness then her eyes grew thoughtful he let her sit in silence knowing that she was trying to work a sudden thought to its conclusion he listened instead to the steady clopping of the mares hooves and the jingle of their harness in the clear cold air finally she spoke music isnt going to be forbidden everywhere she said slowly in fact the one way to give brothels and pleasurehouses more business than they can handle is to try to forbid pleasure itself and a pleasurehouse is going to be a very good place to learn whats going on in gradfordreally going on that is and not just what the officials are telling people or what streetgossip says musicians are probably going to be welcome there if all the places havent already been taken by gradford natives bbut it ccould be ddangerous kestrel finished for her if church officials ddecide tto llook for ssomeone tto use as an example ssomeone wwith nno importance still pperhaps if wwe ddo what rune ddid and have ttwo personae one ffor the sstreet and one ffor ththe bbbrothel its worth thinking about when we get there she agreed i have to admit i didnt think this was going to be all that important even after listening to harperus and nightingalei thought this was just another bout of petty harassment the kind we had when we first formed the free bards somethings up though something is different this time i dont like what ive been hearing and i want to do something about protecting our people before its too late jonny nodded but did not add what he was thinking i only hope its not already too late their sturdy mares were in fine fettle after four days of rest and good feeding and made much better time than either of them had expected the walls of gradford appeared in the distance in midafternoon and they had plenty of time to study the citystate during their approach it had been built on the top of an enormous hill or very small mountain and was supposed to be the oldest complex continuously inhabited by humans in the twenty kingdoms the city had expanded several times and each time it had a new set of walls had been built to accommodate the expansion the original structure looked to have been either a military fortress or fortified castle probably the original duke of gradfords holding its strange blocky angular architecture was at violent odds with the rest of the city and it was easily the tallest structure either of them had ever seen in their lives it must have been at least a full twenty stories tall and jonny could not imagine anyone climbing all those staircases to get to the top on a regular basis the building itself taken over by the duke was supposedly a structure that had made it through the cataclysm intact but the dukes line had died out and no relative could be found to claim the holding before the mayor of the city below his fortress had claimed independence supported by the high bishop that had been in the early days when no one really wanted the remote city even though it was on a major trade road gradfords heyday had come when enterprising souls roaming the hills had discovered rich veins of silver and copper beneath them to the east and ironore and coal to the west to the south were finds of semiprecious and precious gems garnet beryl amethyst topaz peridot citrine tourmaline moonstone and fine clear quartz of all kinds suddenly gradford had something to trade and by this time it had the blessing of the high bishop a strong lord mayor and a council comprised of guild masters from every major trade the council immediately let it be known that they were hiring the best mercenaries money could buy and there were no more rumors of war gradford prospered and grew but apparently the mayor and council never forgot that there were nobles out there who lusted for its wealth every building was neatly tucked inside that last wall and all of the walls sported sentries and guards tiny as gnats at this distance but clearly vigilant and visible the road did not actually lead through the city but rather went past the base of the hill it was built upon long ago the hill had been cleared of trees to keep any hostile forces from creeping up under cover of the branches what remained was rock rock and very thin soil covered with tough wiry grass the dead brown grass matched the sandy brown rock the same rock that had been quarried to form the city walls so that the city rose out of the hillside as if it had grown from the rocks themselves a switchback road cut out of the hillside and reinforced with more of the same sandybrown stone led up to the city gates which stood wide open at this hour hardly surprising jonny reflected the guards on the walls would see enemies coming long before they were any threat and by the time an enemy force was within striking distance the gates would already be closed and barred the road was wide and even and so wellmaintained that the mares were not even sweating by the time they brought their wagon in under the enormous gates which had clearly been built to handle vehicles much larger than theirs there was not one gate but several although jonny suspected that only the outer wooden gates banded and reinforced with iron straps were ever closed at night behind the wooden gates was a portcullis of iron bars that dropped down from above behind that was another portcullis of thick stakes of wood woven with iron straps and behind that was a second set of wooden gates this pair sheathed with iron plates on the inner side jonny suspected that there were murderholes in the floor of the walkway topping the gates and that anyone who got through the first set of gates would find molten lead stones or boiling oil or water rained down on him from above a truly cruel trick would be to let an enemy pass the first set of gates then drop the outer portcullis trapping him between the inner gates and the outermost portcullis and destroy him at leisure they were stopped at the inner gates by a guard a very brisk and efficient middleaged man in chainmail and a tunic with a badge emblazoned on the front the badge was not one that jonny recognized it was not the five coins of gradford but a single coin with a fourarmed cross superimposed upon it this guard wanted to know their names their trade and where they had come from before he would let them pass gwyna spoke up for them both although this made the guard frown slightly evidently women were not supposed to be so forward in gradford these days as to dare to speak for a man but neither of them wanted someone as marked by a distinguishing characteristic as jonnys stutter to be on a guards list gwyna could dye or cut her hair change her clothesjonny could not open his mouth without betraying himself so he feigned being mute when the guard made a hushing motion at robin and ordered him to speak up he hoped that robin would pick up on his cues they hadnt had time to rehearse this subterfuge he shook his head as the guard frowned and raised his voice sorry sir robin said falling into the part of a woman forced into the role of caretaker me husbands mute sir been so since the storm a year agone she sniffed and the guards expression turned from one of disapproval to sympathy struck by lightning he was mind is as sharp as ever but he cant speak a word jonny nodded vigorously and spread his hands in a gesture of helplessness thanking whatever god might be listening for gwynas quick mind the guards expression softened further then give us the names and all lass he said condescendingly as if she were just a little feebleminded kestrel clenched his jaw a little and hoped she wouldnt react to that tone she didnt she kept her temper and smiled at the guard sweetly jonny brede and jina brede were traders in religious keepsakes godstars we came from kingsford in birnam when we heard of the work of your great high bishop and how gradford had turned to pious ways jonny let out his breath in a silent sigh of relief evidently gwyna decided her name sounded a bit too much like she might be a gypsythey had taken the precaution this morning of dressing soberly rather than in their gypsy or free bard finery or else she was afraid someone might know the name gwyna even though she called herself robin in public she could hardly use that name with the guard without branding herself a free bard and she had wisely chosen a city far enough away that no one was likely to send to find out if they had been there recently godstars the guard said with interest gwyna dimpled and brought out the samples they had stowed under the drivers seat little ones for pendants like and the big ones of course she preened with pride as the guard examined both and praised the work she started to offer him both but to jonnys surprise he refused thatd be bribery dear and were honest men here in gradford he replied no and i thank you but you keep those in your pretty hands best of luck to you go right on in theres no one in gradford selling godstars like these so youre no competition to a local trader and that means you can set up in the market whenever you like theres no tax on religious goods other than the usual tithe gwyna thanked him and did not argue if the guard was too silly to understand that a customer who bought a godstar would probably not buy something else it was not her problem kestrel shook the reins to send the horses forward and as soon as they cleared the gates it was only too obvious that rodrick had been right although this was clearly the start of the marketdistrict there was not a single busker anywhere no jugglers no streetdancers no musicians the streets seemed to have plenty of people on them until you realized that this should have been the busiest part of the city then it slowly became obvious that there was barely a third of the people here that there should have been the undercurrent of music to the chaotic crowdnoises was something that both of them had taken for granted now that it was gone the lack made jonny at least feel oddly offbalance straining his ears listening for something that simply wasnt there they passed several innsit was never wise to take the first set of accommodations offered for such places were invariably overpriced they shared their side of the street with a number of other vehicles but none of them were traders wagons so rodrick had been right about that as well the traders appeared to have deserted the city entirely theres no rain that doesnt water someones garden jonny thought at least therell be no shortage of rooms and probably good prices gwyna had told him that in most large cities it was against the law to sleep in wagons anyone who wished to camp in his wagon had to do so outside the city walls he still wasnt certain which inn to patronize and when he finally saw the sign he knew instinctively he had found the right place for them the signboard sported a bird beak wide open and pointed to the sky obviously singing for all it was worth it also unlike many others had the name of the inn written under the painted bird the singing bird the name seemed a good omen and jonny turned the horses into the arched gateway that led into the inns court the lean and balding innkeeper was frantically happy to see them and a glance at his stable showed them why no more than a third of the stalls were occupied and if that was an indication of the number of customers inside it was no wonder that he was glad to see them and their cash he was not a gypsy somewhat to jonnys disappointment but his stables were good and he saw to their needs personally well need to be able to take the wagon out during the day gwyna told him well be using it as our stall in the marketplace that stopped him cold just as he directed the stableboys to put their mares in two spacious looseboxes i hope you arent selling anythinglike luxury goods he said hesitantly the bald spot on the top of his head growing red with anxiety theres not much call for such things in gradford these days jonny mentally gave him the accolade for his honesty he could have gotten one nights lodging out of them before they found out the hard truth for themselves instead he warned them then again if we were selling something proscribed maybe hed get arrested or fined for giving us lodging it was a possibility given the lack of buskers and all that implied jonny was not taking anything for granted but gwyna laughed lightly godstars she said simply as jewelry and as wall decorations the innkeeper heaved a very audible sigh of relief and mopped the top of his head with his apron theres no problem then ill have the boys ready your wagon and horses at the bell for sunrise service from the cathedral you come down for breakfast at calling bell for prime service and youll find them harnessed and waiting when you finish best place for you will be in the marketsquare in front of the cathedral and to get there you just follow this street until it comes out at the square they locked up the wagon and took their bags from under the drivers seat following their host across the yard to the inn itself it was a sturdy threestoried affair substantial and built of dark timbers with whitewashed stone between im sorry i cant offer you any entertainment he said apologetically but musics not allowed unless its from a churchlicensed musician his expression said what he would not say aloud and those are so bad id rather have no music than theirs gradford has changed since last i was here gwyna replied casually there were no restrictions then on what music could be played and what a peddler could sell the innkeeper shrugged and once again his expression of faint distaste told jonny that he did not care for the current state of things but then what innkeeper would his custom had been cut down to a third of what it had been he certainly was not prospering i cant sell you strong liquor either he continued only beer and ale and hard cider by his wary expression some of his customers had found a great deal to object to in this particular edict but jonny only laughed nnever ddrink anything sstronger he said shortly with a grin that made the innkeeper smile in return at that point they entered the inn and that was when jonny realized just how bad things had gotten for the innkeepers of gradford not that the place was illkempt quite the contrary the common room with polished wooden tables and real chairs with hangings on the walls and lanterns or candles on every table with not one but two fireplaces was clearly a quality of hostelry they would not have been able to afford in the days of gradfords prosperity orperhaps if their music pleased the innkeeper they might have graced this room but only as paid performers and then only if a guild musician didnt want the job or if the innkeeper didnt want the guild musician ill have a table ready for you as soon as you like the innkeeper was saying as he hurried them across the waxed and polished stone floor of the common room and towards the staircase at the other side its a good ham tonight and sweetroots or chicken and dumplings with carrots and a nice stew of apples for after your room is up here the room up on the third floor was obviously not the best in the inn but it was finer than they should have gotten for their coin it shared a bath with three other rooms there were good rag rugs on the varnished wooden floor a plain but handsome wardrobe matching tables on either side of the bed and the bed boasted heavy bedcurtains a feather mattress and feather comforter no fireplace of course but it did have a small coalfired stove and presumably a certain amount of heat came up from the common room below there were sturdy shutters to shut out the wind and cheap thick glass in the windows full of bubbles and wavybut in the class of inn they generally frequented they were lucky to have shutters much less glazed windows they ordered a bath for after dinner put their gear away and took the stairs back down to the common room the ham as promised was good and the room no more than a third full small wonder there were only two choices for a meal with so few customers this innkeeper could not afford to have several dishes prepared so that a patron had a wider choice you know we have a few hours of daylight left gwyna observed as they lingered over their stewed apples and spiced tea we ought to walk around and see whats to be seen jonny raised an inquiring eyebrow over that remark had she seen something he hadnt he had been too busy driving to pay a great deal of attention to anything else there seem to be a lot of street preachers she said in answer to his unspoken question in fact it looks almost as if the street preachers have taken over from the buskers ah he replied enlightened wwe should ssee what ththeyre ssaying exactly she sighed and put aside her empty bowl and the spoon much as i hate to ruin such a nice meal with a sour stomach i think we really need to get a feel for things before we go out tomorrow right he rose and offered her his arm wwould mmy lady ccare ttake a sstroll why yes i think she would she dimpled and took the proffered arm the company at least will be pleasant even if ththe sstroll isnt he replied she didnt answer him she only shook her head with a warning look as they walked out into the innyard and joined the thin stream of people leaving their work and going home chapter ten there were plenty of street preachers one for every corner sometimes shouting so loudly that their speeches overlapped and some of them were unintentionally funny the trouble was no one else seemed to see anything humorous in what they were saying a chilly wind whipped up the street tossing skirts and cloaks and numbing kestrels nose it was a wind remarkably free of the usual stinks of a large city and the gutters were empty of anything but a trace of water perhaps this place was like nolton with laws regarding the disposal of garbage and crews to clean the streets in a city like this one with so many people crowded into so small an area and no river to cleanse it that was not just a good idea it was a necessity buildings on both sides of the street loomed at least three stories in height built of stone with tiny windows in the upper stories roofs were of a brownish slate or of sandy tile there wasnt a great deal of color even in the dress of the passersby only the brilliantly blue sky above gave any relief to the unrelenting gray and brown nothing delineated the changes in gradford quite so clearly as that elsewhere people reacted to the coming of winter by bringing out as much color in their clothing as they could afford presumably the people of gradford had once done the same but no more the city looked sober as if it already hosted nothing but brothers and sisters of various ascetic orders they walked about a quarter mile towards the cathedral which loomed over the smaller buildings just as the dukes palace loomed over the city itself they both paid careful attention to each preacher for at least a few minutes at a time usually a few minutes were enough to get the gist of what each was saying gradually kestrel began to get a sense that there were three kinds of preachers and each set shared a common style and a set of messages the first kind were the wildeyed unkempt street preachers he was used to seeing in every city or town he had ever found himself in dressed in strange assortments of tattered and layered garments they exhorted the crowds passing with wildly waving arms and hoarsely shouted diatribes they were fairly incoherent contradicting themselves from sentence to sentence and full of dire prophecies about the second cataclysm hed always thought they were a little mad and he didnt see any reason to change that opinion now interestingly these men had only the same sort of audiences they got in other cities people as mad as they were gawkers and adolescents who got a great deal of amusement out of making a mockery of them but the adolescents making mock were uniformly ruffians rather than the mix of neerdowells and ordinary youngsters that usually tried to give these poor old men a difficult time and the authorities in the form of the city constables ran the youngsters off with warnings and not the preachers who would elsewhere have been considered nuisances so these days in gradford even the lunatics come in for a smattering of respect kestrel wouldnt have believed it if he hadnt seen it himself the second variety of street sermonizers was a type he normally saw only during faires countryfellows who were not ordained priests and supported themselves through what they could collect on their own these were men who would say if questioned that they felt called by the sacrificed god to preach the truth as they and not the church saw it they generally leapt at the chance to preach restraint to a crowd bent on celebration their motives were simple enough perhaps move some of their listeners to moderation or at least through a bit of passing guilt charm a pin or a coin out of their pockets and into the collection plate kestrel thought of them as a different form of busker for they used the same venue as buskers their messages were along the line of repent of your sins and be purified and do not waste your lives on shortterm pleasures when your energy could better be spent in contemplating god they urged sacrifice with the veiled hint that a sacrifice tossed in their direction would find favor with god more often than notat a faire at leastthis kind of preacher would manage to save some fellow whod been a chronic drunk all his life and had just hit bottom having saved the fool the preacher would parade him about like a hunters prize and the former drunk having found a new addiction that made him the center of attention would perform obligingly there were at least two with reformed drunks in tow on this street and although these men were normally ignored by fairegoers who often parted around them like the water in a swiftmoving stream avoiding a rock here their message was falling on more appreciative ears more than one listener looked both attentive and impressed interesting but not unexpected then there was the third class of preachera type that kestrel had never seen preaching in the street before real priests in immaculate robes who clearly did not need to be out here and in fact had no collection plates at their feet these menthey were always men even though women could aspire to the priesthood as readily as menwere clean erudite and wellspoken pitching their trained modulated voices to carry their words over the heads of the crowds it was this third type of preacher that had the messages that were very disturbing come from god are alone pure and righteous the first of these was saying as they came within hearing distance he had a very welltrained and sonorous voice and he already had a crowd three deep around him he was brown of beard and hair and eye his wellkept robe was a dark brown and he should have blended in with his surroundings but he didnthe stood out from them as if he was a heroic statue the focus for all eyes no matter what the ignorant and unholy will tell you all things called magic are inherently evil magic can only be the tool of demons and false gods there is no truth in it and none in those who practice it he looked around at his audience kestrel was very careful to school his features into a semblance of sober interest this man was no fool any show of resistance to his words would cause him to single that person out for special attentions and special messages the onlookers would notice things could become very awkward very quickly perhaps you have heard somewhere that there are mages within the church itself but i tell you that this is not true whoever has told you this has lied to you he said lying gracefully and believably magic is deception magic only counterfeits the real and holy powers granted only to priests by god those powers practiced within the church come directly by grace and blessing of the sacrificed god and they are nothing like magic and only those within the church within the ranks of the ordained will be blessed with those powers those who claim to achieve the same ends through their magic are false deceptive and evil they seek to mislead you seduce you to muddled thinking and questioning and then to lead you astray down the paths of darkness neat jonny thought admiring the priests command of rhetoric though not his words redefine magic as anything that is not performed by a priest and then you can condemn it without condemning the priests not only is the magic itself inherently and by its very deceptive nature evil the priest continued warming to his subject but anyone anyone who uses it or allows himself to be touched by it is evil magic is a mockery of gods powers god will not be mocked he will not permit his servants to be mocked the day is coming when all those evil ones who practice magic will perish and those who permitted them to work their magic will perish with them those who live by magic will die by the hand of the righteous there was more in this vein although jonny noticed that the priest was very careful not to say who would be dealing out this punishment to the evil magicians given the tales that had been spreading of musicians using magic to manipulate their listeners it was easy to see where this was going he might not have brought up the evil musicians yet but it was only a matter of time nightingale had been only too right and so had harperus he felt a sudden sickness in the pit of his stomach and it didnt take any effort at all on his part to persuade gwyna away and get out of hearing range the priest was still going strong when they left and as far as jonny could tell it was more of the same no mention as yet of musicians but given the fact that there were no musicians anywhere in sight perhaps he saw no need to mention them in his condemnation of every other person who ever made use of magic and mages about the only encouraging note in this was that the priest was losing listeners at a fairly steady rateperhaps people who had used the services of a healer or those who had employed a mage for some minor work in finding a lost object locating water or taming a beast that would not respond to normal efforts it would take more persuasive means than simply saying that magic was evil to convince most folk that it was bad after all most people in their lives saw many instances of the use of magic all of it hired and completely matteroffact how could any of this be evil mages created amusing illusions for parties rid homes of poltergeists and koboldsthey didnt do anything that a priest couldnt do and they generally didnt ask as much in return priests were often greedy in their demands when someone turned to them for help a simple mage could only ask the usual rate and did not care what god you followed or whether you were up to date on your tithing that was what kestrel read in the faces of those who turned away from the preacher but there were some who stayed nodding in agreement a very bad sign the sun had turned the sky above the city to a glorious crimson as they came into the circle of another of the real priests out on the street this man had a much larger gathering of listeners and fewer of them were leaving with looks of stubborn disbelief on their faces jonny steeled himself to hear something unpleasant this one also wore a brown robe but he was a much older man the kind that people would instinctively turn to for advice cleanshaven with snowwhite hair but there was something subtly cruel and hard about his eyes and the set of his mouth indicated a man who would never accept any opinion but his own if a soul is the image of god and god created humankind in his image how can any creature that does not wear that image have a soul the priest asked his voice rational and reasonable it is there in the holy writ for all to read for god then created them male and female in his own image male and female and human the soul is the reflection of god and is in the image of god human entirely and wholly no creature that is not fully human could possibly be in possession of a soul the implications of this are obvious to anyone who takes the time to study the holy book and think a creature that does not have a soul cannot be saved by the grace of the church it is that simple and that profound only humans can be saved only humans have souls this priest had an interesting demeanor unlike the last one who clearly preached at his audience this man kept his voice calm and steady his tone ingratiating his expression persuasive his manner invited his listeners to discover truth for themselves not just to be told what the truth was and was not in a village this man would be the one most would go to for the settling of disputes but there is a much more seriousyes and frighteningside to this and one that is not as obvious he continued his expression turning to one of warning a creature that does not have a soul and cannot be saved by the church must by definition be evil oh do not shake your heads only think about it to be evil is to act against the interests of god but a creature that is soulless cannot know the interests of god so how can he act in accord with them they cannot be anything but evil by their very natures nothing can change that not all the good intentions in the world for it is bred into them blood and bone by their very differences they are the damned and the doomed and they will always be the enemies of the church for their inmost nature will cause them to resist the guidance of the church his expression hardened and yet became sorrowful at the same time surely you who are thinking men can see the result of this the churchs charge is the safety spiritual and actual of humanity the enemies of the church must become sooner or later the enemies of all humankind and the enemies of humankind will inevitably seek to destroy humanity kestrel had no trouble anticipating the next statement those who would seek to destroy humankind must be destroyed first the priest said fiercely there can be no sin in this it is not murder for they have no souls it is selfdefense and no more ridding humanity of their cursed presence is no worse than ridding the city of rats and who is it that has these unnatural magics that you have been warned against more often than not it is these unhuman monsters this time it was robin who pulled him away but he was not reluctant to leave he had certainly heard enough to nauseate him god is llove llove is bblind i am bbblind therefore i am gggod kestrel muttered under his breath something that had become a very unfunny joke horrid how the rules of logic could be twisted to make the illogical irrational and idiotic sound reasonable robin shushed him and they crossed over to the other side of the street to return to their inn the last light of the sun died away overhead the little canyons between the buildings were already full of shadows and lamplighters made their way along the street pausing at each of the street corners there were not too many people out at this point those that were did not seem to be in any great hurry to get anywhere kestrel noted with thankfulness that the preachers had taken the coming of nightfall as a signal to leave their posts and find some other venue for their speeches hed had a bellyful of them and he was not in the mood for any more but he was to get one more dose of holy word before they reached the relative safety of their room the last preacher of the night was hard to classify he had the collection plate and the common clothing of an ordinary street preacher but the trained voice and command of rhetoric of a full priest they could not get by for his listeners had temporarily blocked the street so they had no choice but to listen for a moment and for a moment it seemed as if his message was no more insidious than any of the other lunatics out here this afternoon idle time time that is not spent in work or in contemplation is time spent in evilness he was saying kestrel could not see his face in the shadows he kept his voice deliberately soft so that anyone really listening had to lean forward to hear his words the combination of the darkness the soft words the persuasive voice worked in a hypnotic fashion before a listener was really aware of it unless you were a musician and had used similar tricks yourself to create a mood of quiet persuasion in the middle of a crowded tavern because of this anything done purely for pleasure or for simple enjoyment is also evil because these are things done in idleness the only fit occupation for a true man is work either the work of his hands and mind or the work of god and the church those temptations of hollow pleasure must be eliminated and those who will not give them up must be taught the error of their ways gently if possible but if nothe concluded darklythen by whatever means necessary at that point the blockage cleared and robin and kestrel hurried on quickly until they were well out of range of sight and sound of the final preacher now im glad we were warned robin sighed if we had come into town the way we usually enter a city pplaying and ssinging the ssaucy pppriest kestrel finished i ththink our wwelcome mmight have bbeen wwarmer ththan wwed llike that at least robin held his arm tightly as much for comfort as for appearances as they entered the inn courtyard it opened up like a haven of sanity after the speeches of the past hour as they opened the door to the common room one of the serving girls spotted them and hurried over to them would you like your baths now she asked the water is hot and ready and no one has bespoken the room until later please robin said and lowered her voice a little we were just taking a walk outside and we couldnt help wonderingis every night like tonight ive never seen so many preachers in one place before is there something special about tonight or this street the girl sighed and rolled her eyes a little nothing special about tonight but they do seem to pick this street t be doing their ranting prhaps its cause most visitors lodge here or prhaps its cause the cathedrals so near theres laws thank heavens they cant be preachin long after dark to disturb folks rest or wed not get any no offense she added hastily kestrel managed a wan chuckle nnone ttaken he said were here tto ppeddle our ccrafts and if its ggodstars ththese ppeople wwant ththats what ththeyll gget the girl smiled warmly i shouldntve said what i did but i didnt think you was lunatic religious she replied fr one thing they dont bathe near often enough and she wrinkled her nose be glad its bout winter i tell you some f them d choke a goat in hot weather robin shrugged were traders she said we were warned what had happened and we changed our trade goods for something that would sell under the circumstances perhaps it may sound cynical but if theyd all gone mad forfor some actor who fancied feather masks for some reason wed be peddling those instead of godstars but actors dont get y pilloriedor worse the girl muttered then shook herself well sir an lady take yrselves upstairs whilst i call th upstairs wench an by the time y reach the bathing room the bathsll be ready she was as good as her word the bathing room had two tubs side by side and both were full and steaming as promised by the time they arrived at the bathroom door they sank into the hot water with gratitude jonny simply let his mind empty he did not want to think about what he had just heard he wanted to relax just for a moment and pretend that none of this was happening church bells woke them not uncommon in a large city but they seemed unusually loud until kestrel remembered the cathedral was not far away and they were very loud he hadnt heard bells like this sincesince since i was a child and living in the guild hall with my master the cathedral was across the street and every morning the first bells would wake us no matter how tired we were or how late we had been up the night before the remembrance was tainted with a little less bitterness now it helped to know that his beloved master had not been a crazed and halfwitted old man but a very brave and very frightened one it helped to know that the guild had been wrong about both of them robin groaned as kestrel got out of bed and pulled back the thick dark curtains he actually felt rather good even after those wretched street sermons of the night beforeand even though his dreams had been haunted by priests leading fanatic mobs in chasing him one thing about being in a city obsessed with religionthere was little or nothing to do after sunset so going to bed was the only option ill bet they have a population explosion around here in a few monthsdepending on how long this has been going on he thought pulling open the shutters to let the sunlight in robin groaned again i wonder if the herbs that protect against conception have been put on the proscribed list too that would be a logical move if the church really was interested in restricting peoples interests if a girl had a real chance of getting pregnant she might be a bit warier about distributing her favors and if a wife was burdened with one baby after another she wouldnt have a great deal of leisure for anything else like thinking for herself robin sat up her curly hair tousled and a lock dangling over one eye yawning hugely gods she moaned squinting sunlight sun poured through the thick glass and pooled on the floor catching the reds and blues in the rag rug there and making them glow kestrel grabbed clean clothing while robin watched blinking sleepily from her nest of bedclothes sober clothing muted browns and dark grays for him browns and sandtones for robin no gypsy reds and yellows here if hed had any doubt as to the wisdom of such disguises last night in the street had convinced him ttime tto get to wwork he reminded her wwere ppeddlers remember wwe have tto be out ffirst ththing when ththe mmarkets open i remember she said around another yawn well last night we heard the poison now we need to find out what the source is and why all these people are suddenly so full of maniacal religious fervor a lot of the changes here required some changes in the laws jonny and that doesnt happen overnight you have to convince very powerful people to make changes that may not be to their advantage youre vvery articulate this mmorning he observed with a bit of a smile then lost the smile as something occurred to him one of ththe ppowerful ppeople who ssupported gradford ffrom the bbeginning was ththe high bbishop wwouldnt he bbe on ththe ccouncil ddid you ththink about ththat hmm i think i was thinking about it even in my sleep she climbed out of bed to join him in dressing pulling on linen petticoats wool stockings and boots a sober brown wool skirt and sandcolored linen shirt lacing her brown leather vest over both someone has gotten the ears of anyone important and has convinced the merchants who are losing money right now that they are better off not complaining about their problems we should keep our ears open in the marketplace there are probably some merchants out there that are just as cynical as rodrick and we might get them to tell us something theres a piece missing to this puzzle as promised a breakfast was laid ready for the inns patrons a buffetstyle breakfast where they could help themselves to oatmeal sliced bread and butter honey fruit last nights ham and pastries and as promised when they were finished and went out into the court the wagon was standing ready with several others mares in harness and stamping impatiently they swung themselves up onto the drivers bench and took the wagon out into the street all traffic foot and wagon was going in one direction this morning towards the cathedral robin had the reins and she simply let the press of people carry them along at footpace im ccurious kestrel said as the cathedral loomed at the end of the street hhow ddid you ddo that bbusiness wwith ththe ffire in yyour hhand in wwesthaven robin chuckled gypsy trick she said lightly meant to fool the stupid special paper that burns very quickly so quickly there isnt any heat to speak of and it ignites with just a spark a little misdirection flintandsteel and a bit of paper in your hand and agile fingers and there you are i always carry some and powder of the same sort good for throwing into a fire to create a big flash jonny watched the faces of the foot travelers around them they were uniformly eager clearly anticipating something ccan all of you ddo that she nodded useful skill to have when you need to make someone think that youre more powerful than you really are we pledge never to teach outsiders though so im afraid i cant even teach you ddont nneed it he assured her ggot enough to worry about by that time they reached the place where the street emptied out into the square in front of gradford cathedral for the first time they saw the cathedral as something other than bits of towers and roof and in spite of himself jonny was impressed and moved you couldnt get a sense of the cathedral simply from the bits you glimpsed over the rooftops and at the end of the street he had no idea how anyone could construct something like this building without it toppling straight over it looked as fragile and delicate as any confectioners masterpiece and just as ephemeral he guessed that the four round steeples one at each corner must have been at least fifteen stories tall maybe more they spiraled up like the shells of some seabeasts he had seen coming to a point at their peaks they were pierced by a fretwork of windows and looked as delicate as lace there were no sharp angles in these towers nothing but curves curved arches round windows spiraling ramplike exterior ledges that ran from the bottom all the way to the top the towers were covered with a network of carvings as well cut in shallow relief into the pristine marble and alabaster none of the towers were carved alike the tower to his right was encrusted with waving kelp and seaweed sinuous eels spiny urchins undulating waves and delicate fish the one to his left bore clouds in every form from wisps to towering thunderheads and among them sported all the creatures of the air from birds to butterflies rainbows arched from cloud to cloud and the delicate seeds of thistle and dandelion wafted among the flying insects on the lower level the other two towers were harder to see since they were on the opposite side of the cathedral but on one jonny thought he made out sensuous and abstract depictions of flames salamanders and the legendary phoenix and on the other carvings of plants and animals crept climbed and sported on the curves on the top of each tower was a single statue of an angel they spread wide wings and empty hands over the square below as if bestowing blessings from on high unlike many carved angels jonny had seen the expressions on the faces of the two facing him were full of childlike wonder and joyand there were no weapons in those hands these angels beckoned the beholder to share in their exultation neither warning dourly of punishment for sins nor offering a fatuous and simpering there there in lieu of real comfort within the pinnacle of each tower hung the bells half hidden in the shadows but gleaming with polished bronze whenever the sun struck them with those four towers to gape at it was hard to imagine how the cathedral itself could be any more impressive than the towers were but somehow it was and it left him gaping though by necessity it had to be square in form with a peaked roof it had been ornamented in the same sinuous style as the towers the carvings all over the facade depicted the life of the sacrificed god and the lives of the saints and heroes of the church somehow even those who had died grisly deaths seemed not to be contorted with suffering but rather dancing to their deaths arrows and nooses torture devices and instruments of punishment seemed idle accessories to the dancewounds mere decorations and among the carvings were the windows rather than making pictures with glass the builders of the cathedral had chosen to make the windows a backdrop for the carvings so instead of complicated scenes and designs there were flowing abstractionsmore curves of courseof four or five pieces of glass in harmonious colors some echoed the blue and white of a sky full of clouds the dark blue and scarlet of a sunset the crimson and orange of flames the greens of ocean waves the golds and browns of a field in harvest colors the result was breathtaking and the cathedral sparkled in the sun like a giant box of jewels jonny found himself thinking only one thing how faced every day with this can these priests be preaching things that are so smallminded and petty for the cathedral as a whole was a song an expression in stone of the wholeness of man and the world however that world was put together there was no room in this structure for pettiness and prejudice it had clearly been designed built and ornamented by men who loved all of creation and felt at one with the world it took a conscious effort for him to turn his attention back to the mundane but the cathedral would be here for longer than they would and there was business to attend to there were many more wagons and stalls here in the cobblestone square all of them in a row ringing the cathedral some of the stalls still untenanted some with traders setting up the buildings facing the square were not shops as he had assumed they would be rather they were private residences very expensive private residences the owners of the stalls and wagons had courteously faced their businesses away from these homes and towards the cathedral while waiting for prime to begin the first service of the day that would be open to the public the crowds gathering here perused the contents of the wagons and stalls with varying degrees of eagerness some were plainly killing time others were in a holiday mood and prepared to buy robin tucked their wagon into a good comer across from a private home and beneath a lamppost no sooner had they tethered the horses than a city constable came hurrying over carrying a board to which several papers were attached jonny let robin deal with him keeping up his pretense of being a mute and set up their display on the side of the wagon facing the cathedral following the example of the rest of the merchants the wallstars he hung on the side of the wagon itself where they caught the sun and made a cheerful display of color against the brown wood for the trays of jewelry he propped open the lids to two of the storage compartments and laid two trays each on them two of the inexpensive threadandtwig stars one of the lesser metals and one of the solid silver and mixed silver copper and bronze the constable went away and robin carefully attached the paper he had given her to the side of the wagon jonny took a look at it as soon as he was done with his preparations it described both of them their goods their wagon and horses and declared that they were certified by the authority of high bishop padrik clearly since it described them so minutely it would do an uncertified merchant no good to steal the certification of another he had to admit grudgingly that it was a good idea the tithe here is fifteen percent not ten robin told him in a low voice as she straightened the stars in their tray its because of the location he was nice enough to tell me that if we moved to the rear of the cathedral it was the usual ten if wwe mmove wwe wwont see what wwe ccame to see that seemed obvious enough as llong as wwe ccome out even but already the first of their potential customers was hurrying over attracted by the brilliant stars in the sunlight and within a short time it was clear they were not going to come out even they were probably going to run out of stars before two days were over if they continued to sell at this rate no matter they could make more it would be a good excuse to linger around the inn walk about the town and not go to the market for a day or more the jewelry proved unexpectedly popular somewhat to robins obvious surprise the metal stars sold as well if not better than the cheaper stars of thread jonny saw why once he realized what it was that had been bothering him about the wealthier women and their clothing the very drabness of it fooled him into concentrating on the color but as he watched customer after customer immediately don her star stringing it on her own chain or using the ribbon robin provided he saw faces transformed with delight and he knew that these women had given up jewelry and missed it after all gradford was famous for gemcraft and metals and it was known across the twenty kingdoms that gradford women all had dowries of lovely jewelry some of it very ancient passed down from generation to generation the current austere state of things dictated they must give up such adornments they missed their jewelry and here was a perfectly pious way to get it back there had been a number of women and men in finer materials than those coming to the wagon who had spent some time studying the godstars from a distance silversmiths he decided after a while goldsmiths and jewelers there will be work into the night tonight and fine silver and gold stars by morning poor apprentices then again considering that the apprentices had probably been doing and learning nothing of late one long night wasnt going to hurt them and inadvertently he and robin had breathed new life into a dying business with that in mind he sidled over to her in his first free moment whispered his suspicions into robins ear and added a suggestion she nodded and he went back to hanging up yarn godstars to replace the ones sold confident that his idea was in good hands a few moments later she left the wagon to hurry to the side of a grayhaired man in gray velveteen who had a young cleverfaced woman at his side the girl bore a remarkable resemblance to him most probably his daughter and possibly his apprentice as well robin spoke to them in a low voice for a few minutes then waved inviting them to come to the wagon they took her up on her invitation and as they watched she took apart one of the copper stars then remade it so they could see how it was done the transformation in them was remarkable they went from interested to animated in a few short moments finally ending up laughing as she placed the copper star into the girls hands jonny saw all this in between sales of smaller and larger stars by the time he was finished with the last customer the two were gone by this time all of the wagons and stalls were losing their custom as the crowds left en masse and flowed in the direction of the cathedral prime was about to begin evidently and no one wanted a place in the rear well he asked as she sidled up to him and gave him a quick squeeze around the waist master tomas and his daughter will be very happy to supply us with basemetal and silveralloy wire and thin barstock at a very reasonable price in return for my instruction just now she said with the intense satisfaction of any gypsy who has made a good bargain i made some suggestions about chains made of very tiny stars and suspending stars from some of the more elaborate chains they already had made up and couldnt sell in return they suggested ornamenting the ends of the posts with beads putting a semiprecious stone or glass bead at the center join and stringing the stars on necklaces of beads everyone is very happy me included she grinned happily i could wish we were here just for the profit were doing very well even after the fifteenpercent tithe she had been the one doing all the talking to the customers and the other traders who had come to see what they were offering that was doing so well he had played mute and evidently the customers had assumed that meant he was deaf as well whwhat ddid you find out sso ffar he asked as the crowds gathered tightly about the front of the cathedral and acolytes brought out a portable altar evidently in spite of the cold high bishop padrik was going to hold prime outside presumably because there was not enough room in the cathedral itself for everyone waiting jonny wondered how on earth the man expected anyone to hear him most churches were built to magnify the voice he wouldnt have that advantage out here or would he the magnificence of the cathedral had made him ignore the structure and the two wings of church buildings on either side of it inside a walled compound they werent on the square they were slanted like a funnel with the front of the cathedral the bottom of the funnel and the elaborately carved front was in the shape of a shell hadnt he heard of something like this in an outdoor theater it should be just as effective in amplifying a speakers voice as the interior well im not sure i believe it she said slowly shaking him out of his study of the cathedral but ive heard it from so many different people her voice faltered they say padrik works miracles he stared at her startled she nodded thats what they say she told him padrik works miracles not just simple healing but really impossible things like straightening limbs that have been malformed from birth healing people born blind or deaf even the most skeptical are really awed by him that is why everyone in gradford has been overcome with religious fever because theyre sure the high bishop is a modern saint she was about to say more when the bells rang out drowning her voice in their clangor and the doors of the cathedral opened the sun struck something inside setting up a reflective glitter that made kestrels eyes water an invisible choir saluted the crowd with music that made the heart stop with its pure measured beauty and a single figure clad in white priestrobes and glittering with gold strode confidently out in front of the cathedral and raised his hands they were about to discover if the stories were true high bishop padrik had begun the prime service chapter eleven padriks voice as beautiful a speaking voice as any kestrel had ever heard rang out over the crowd as clearly as one of the bells it was such an incredible voice that jonny wished he could hear padrik sing and listened closely for any signs that the high bishop had bardic training padrik was the single most impressive speaker jonny had ever heard in his life surpassing even the bardic guild masters and the wren himself then came the moment in the holy services when the sermon was given if he had not been braced to be skeptical and critical he might have found himself convinced of the truth of the high bishops words for in comparison with padriks superb command of rhetoric and argument the street preachers of last night were as clumsy as toddlers arguing over a toy padriks sermon was a combination of all three of the dangerous ideas jonny and gwyna had heard last night magic is deception and only the miracles of the church are the truth and therefore magic is evil nonhumans are without souls and therefore the enemies of the church and humankind things done purely for pleasure are evil because they take time away from the work of god and the church but padrik made them all seem logical sane and part of a whole part of a conspiracy in fact of nonhumans and their friends the betrayers of humanity to destroy mankind after first weakening it with magic and to enslave the survivors only the vigilance of the church stood between the faithful and these perfidious servants of demons who sought to bring on the second cataclysm and make all humankind the helpless prey of demons how they were actually going to do that was not specified but then most people had no notion how or why the original cataclysm had occurred padrik completed his sermon with a glorious depiction of the triumph of humanity and a presumably allhuman world dedicated to the glory of god and the church kestrel shook off padriks spell with a shudder and the cold wind whipping across the square was no match for the chill of fear in his heart how long had this been going on long enough evidently that now no one openly objected to his ideas kestrel had not seen any nonhumans in gradford and now he was certain he wouldnt see any if theyd had brains worth speaking of theyd have packed up as soon as the first rumblings of this nonsense started probably back when the nonhumans were only without souls and had not yet graduated to being the enemies of mankind prejudice could be as damaging as persecution and there had been outbreaks of nonhuman prejudice before this to act as an example the trouble was they hadnt stayed to hear what simple prejudice had become a call for a crusade against them if they had there would be alarms raised all through the twenty kingdoms and beyond to all of the nonhumans across alanda in fact since only rumors of this had percolated to the outside world as a growing prejudice against nonhumans it appeared that whoever stayed here long enough was coopted into padriks ranks or elsethey were gotten rid of somehow before they managed to bring warning to the nonhumans oh that was a comforting thought but before he got too panicked he took a moment to think the situation through traders looking to buy and sell metals and gems would probably find business mostly as usual with only a few annoyancesthe prohibition against the sale of strong drink for instance they would arrive do their business and leave probably without even listening to a street preacher much less padrik himself most other people didnt travel much in the late fall and winter not even gypsies and free bards the gypsies tended to hole up in waymeets for the winter the free bards found winteringover stops in inns and the courts of minor nobles all over the kingdoms those intending to winterover in gradford would have gotten the message last summer that nonguild musicians were not welcome in the citystate why go where you werent welcome so one of the best sources of information in all the world was shut out of gradford before all this escalated into madness as for other visitorshow many would stay in a city that had gone mad for religion the only people coming here would be those coming specifically to hear padrik and would be pulled into his followers immediately and as for the citizens themselvesnothing had really happened yet to show them that this was anything other than talk oh the nonhumans were gone but theyd gone off on their own surelyand they were taking jobs and custom that could have gone to humans instead so where was the harm nothing to alarm anyone in that the prime service wound to its dignified end and if only padriks words had not left such a bad taste in jonnys mouth he could have enjoyed it the music was glorious and padrik quite the most impressive clergyman kestrel had ever seen as a show alone it was fabulous the trouble was this show was like a tasty candy with poison at the center a slowacting poison one whose effects were so subtle that the poor fool whod eaten it had no notion of what was happening until it was too late padrik vanished into the cathedral and a secondary priest stepped forward onto the platform this was not a usual part of prime services let the sick be gathered and the poor be brought the priest cried out for all the world like a sires herald announcing the start of a feast let all those in need come forward into gods own house for the high bishops prayers and gods blessing the entire crowd surged towards the door kestrel and robin exchanged a single look and in a heartbeat had packed up all their remaining godstars locked up the wagon and were joining the tail of the crowd as it squeezed in through the wideopen doors of the cathedral the building was as impressive on the inside as on the outside with the same sinuous sensuous carvings everywhere and sunlight shining through the brilliant colored glass of the windows staining the pristine marble with splashes of crimson and gold azure and emerald they were not there to sightsee however or to gawk at the statues and glass what they wanted lay at the front of the cathedral where the altar stood their experience in faire crowds stood them in good stead here they were able to wiggle and squirm their way up the side along the wall until they were near enough the altar to hear every word and to see padrik clearly and it seemed that no one was too terribly concerned either about damage to the carvings or to their dignity people in the rear climbed up onto the pedestals of the carved saints and clung there hanging onto their alabaster robes like so many children clinging to their mothers skirts robin found footholds for two in the carving of saint hypatia the librarian and kestrel joined her there both of them clinging to the saints arms while the alabaster lips smiled down at them as if hypatia was enjoying their company on her tiny pedestal they tried to compose their faces into the appropriate expressions of piety but only saint hypatia was paying any attention all eyes were riveted to the altar padrik and the young man who had been brought to him on a sedanchair the man seeking padriks blessing was in his twenties or thereabouts dressed in an expensive silk and velvet tunic and shirt of a dark blue that seemed too big for his thin body unlike virtually everyone else theyd seen so far in the city he wore heavy gold chains about his neck massive gold rings and matching gold wristcuffs there was a velvet and fur robe covering his legs padrik was young for one with such a high position in the church kestrel judged him to be in his middle thirties at most there was no gray in his golden hair no wrinkle marred the perfection of his face in fact he was just as handsome as any of the alabaster carvings in here a face that matched the glorious voice in his pristine white robes he was the very ideal priest the image of a modern saint the white surcoat over his white robes gleamed with gold embroidery and kestrel was willing to bet every copper penny theyd made that day that the embroidery had been done with real gold bullion what brings you to me for the churchs blessing my son he asked the young man who was not that much younger than he the young mans voice quavered when he spoke it is my leg my lord bishop all of my life my left leg has been shorter than my right and twistedi cannot walk on it no one has been able to heal it and many have tried padriks voice grew stern are you saying you have sought the services of the deceivers the unbelievers those who dare to work that blasphemy they call magic the young man did not answer instead he broke into tears sobbing his plea for forgiveness padriks voice softened immediately and he laid a comforting hand on the young mans shoulder god is not mocked but neither is he unforgiving he said his voice taking on the same tones of his sermon you have come to god for his blessing and forgiveness and he shall be generous to you he raised his voice let all who see believe and let all who believe rejoice as the crowd held its collective breath he pulled the lap robe off and laid his hands on the young mans legs it was very clear that one was shorter than the other although if it was twisted kestrel couldnt tell for the young man wore loose velvet trews with open bottoms instead of breeches or hose and expensive leather boots still every healer would be the first to sigh and admit that those born with defective limbs were doomed to live with them there was nothing any healer could do to heal those born with an ailment nothing any healer could do except it seemed this one as silence held sway over the crowd padrik slowly stretched the young mans bad leg straightening it and pulling on it until it was exactly even with the good one and as the cathedral rang with cheers the young man leapt up from his sedanchair and ran to the altar to strip off his gold jewelry and place it there in thanksgiving there was more of the same much more padrik healed several more people one blind one deaf and one palsied plus at least three cripples and a leper then as the secondary priests brought forward a group of raggedly clothed folk padrik produced a shower of silver and copper coins out of the air as alms for the poor finally he singled out one young priest for a blessing of the hand of god a beam of golden light came from padriks upraised hands and bathed the priest in momentary glory the young man fell to the ground chanting in some foreign tongue while another priest translated what sounded like prophecies and messages from the blessed spirits and angels about members of the congregation those were all suitably vague enough they could have come from the head of any common fortuneteller at the faire but the rest of it impressed and even frightened jonny but padrik was saving the best for the last a shout came from the back of the cathedrala cry of demon and possession and shortly several cathedral guards came forward dragging a filthy disheveled struggling man with them the mans eyes rolled wildly and he shouted a string of blasphemies and insults that had jonny flushing red within a few moments as they threw the man down in front of padrik knocking over one of the manybranched candelabra at the front of the altar he howled like a beast and spat fire at the priest setting fire to his robe someone in the crowd screamed the crowd surged back a pace the guards seized him again at that as one of the secondary priests beat the flames out with his bare hands through it all padrik remained where he was his face serene his hands spread wide in blessing the high bishop looked down upon the writhing man whose face was contorted into an inhuman mask and began to pray alternately exhorting god to help the sinner and ordering the demon to release its victim the man spat fire again this time touching nothing then vomited a rain of pins all over the carpet in front of the altar then he howled one final time and lay still padrik directed one of the priests to sprinkle the man with holy water presumably as a test to see if he was still demonhaunted evidently he was for the holy water sizzled when it touched him and left behind red blistered places there were gasps from the crowd and a few moans finally the high bishop himself knelt down beside the man and laid his hands upon the mans forehead there was a tremendous puff of smoke from the mans chest and an agonizing screech rang through the cathedral a terrible sound that could never have come from a human throat unless it was a human being disemboweled alive the man went limp and padrik sprinkled him with holy water again this time it did not burn him and padrik declared him free of the demon that had possessed him gently directing the other priests to take him to the cathedral complex to recover that it seemed was the end of the show for as padrik stood he suddenly swayed with exhaustion and one of the priests hurried forward to support him he leaned heavily against the man and immediately all of the others but one gathered around both of them taking the high bishop off through a door behind the altar that one priest announcedunnecessarilythat the high bishop was exhausted by his ordeal and there would be no more healing until the morrow he did not use the word miracle but everyone else in the cathedral was already shouting the word aloud praising god and the high bishop in the same breath spontaneous hymnsinging broke out three different songs at once most of the crowd headed for the door but some flung themselves fulllength in front of the altar to pray at the tops of their lungs jonny clung to the arm of saint hypatia feeling dazed and dazzled in the face of all of that surely padrik was a saint and if he was a saint how could what he had been preaching be wrong all of his earlier convictions went flying off like scattered birds and if robin had not pulled him down off his perch and dragged him out he probably would have remained there clinging to the alabaster saint and wondering if he should prostrate himself as so many others were doing and pray for forgiveness for his doubts he did not really take in robins expression until they got outside then he got one of the great shocks of his life for her eyes burned with anger fiery and certain and her face was a cold mask donned to hide her true feelings she pulled him along until they reached their wagon then shoved him roughly at the rear door as a hint to unlock it he did so hands shaking and they both climbed in once they were inside and not before she finally spoke convinced were you she said her words hot with rage although she whispered to keep her voice from carrying outside the wooden walls just like all those other fools out there you saw padrik perform real miracles didnt you with your own eyes damn the man may real demons come and snatch his soul and carry it down to the worst of his nightmare hells bbbbbut jonny couldnt get any more than that out produces alms from thin air does he well so can i and before he could say or do anything she showered him with coins that came from out of nowhere i can heal the blind and the deaf too if they were never blind nor deaf in the first place bbut the lleper he managed she snorted flour and water paste make the open sores paint makes the skin pale and you can wash it all right off its an old beggars trick remember how he passed his hands over the lepers limbs he was wiping them with a damp sponge hidden in the big sleeves of that robe the ccccripples her eyes narrowed think a minute the only one you actually saw healed of anything was the first one the rest simply showed up on crutches and danced off without them here she sat down on the bed and did something with her boots spreading her skirts over her legs to hide them as the first cripples trews had hid his and as soon as she sat down sure enough one of her legs was longer than the other the right was longer by far than the left by a good two inches kestrel felt his eyes goggling hhhow youll see in a second take my feet in your hands the way padrik did he followed her instructions taking her feet one in each hand now pretend to pull on the left one but push slowly on the right one he did so as soon as he began he realized what she had done she had pulled her right boot down and as he pushed on the right foot he pushed her foot back into place within the boot the skirts hid most of what was going on distance would take care of the rest and because attention had been focused on the short leg it would appear that the shorter leg was being straightened not the other being shortened you see she said jumping down onto the floor of the wagon again and stamping to get her feet back into the boots properly you see what hes doing tricks and chicanery and probably every one of the people his miracles cure is someone from the abbey here the light that struck the priest came from a mirror he had hidden in his palm i saw him get into position to catch a goldcolored sunbeam coming through the stainedglass windows remember how he held his hands over his head when he prayed he must have the location of every sunbeam in the cathedral charted and timed ththe pprophecies wwere ppretty vague kestrel said feeling his confidence and conviction returning with a rush of relief and if you get a big enough crowd of people in a place someone is going to match the widow who has lost a sum of money and the tradesman searching for the son that ran away gypsy fortunetellers work that way all the time when they dont have the true gift of sighting the future her expression was still angry however whatever had put her in a rage it was not that he had temporarily been convinced of padriks genuineness bbut the ddddemon he ventured wondering at the truly grim set to her mouth that is what got me so mad she said gritting her teeth in anger someone has been teaching padrik gypsy magic everything else is the brand of chicanery that professional beggars and false preachers have been doing for hundreds of years but he could not have simulated that possession without the help of gypsy magic spitting firethats done with a mouth full of a special liquid in a bladder you keep in your cheekremember how close the man was to the candles he even knocked one over and that was the one that he used to light the liquid as he spit it out vomiting pins is something only we know how to do the first batch of holy water had a secret dye in it that only turns red after it touches another dye which you paint on the skin the water droplets left behind looked like blisters because you expected blisters to be there the sizzle came from someone dropping real holy water into one of the incense burners while everyone was watching the show i watched him and i saw the steam and the smoke when the demon left the body is another one of our tricks the howl came from someone frightening a peafowl up in one of the towerseither that or theyve trained it to cry on command she spread her hands wide some of the hot rage gone from her expression replaced by determination and a colder fury some of that padrik could learn to do on his own but most of it was done with accomplices that means that not only is someone teaching him someone is helping him and i am going to find out who it is kestrel nodded remembering she had told him that the gypsies swore never to reveal their tricks to outsiders this was an even greater betrayal of that oath than teaching gypsy magic to him would be by an order of magnitude he was after all a gypsy by marriage and he suspected that if he really needed to learn the tricks gwyna could get permission from the head of her clan to teach him but to teach them to a complete outsiderworse to one who was using those tricks to promote an agenda that would ultimately be very bad for other gypsiesthat was the worst of betrayals nnot only whwho he told her but why ppadrik is already hurting nnonhumans and ffree bbards hhow long bbefore he sstarts on ggypsies good point she straightened her skirts weve done enough business already that no one will question our packing up earlyin fact if i drop the right remarks as i pay our tithe as we leave we might even be considered very pious for not making too much of a profit from the faithful sso whwhat are we ddoing he asked opening the back of the wagon again to let them both out modestly through the door rather than crawling out the window over the bed were hunting information she told him as he took the reins of the mares and she counted out the tithe from the bag of coins shed hidden under her skirt who and what and why when they paid the reckoning for the next week in advance the innkeeper was positively faint with gratitude kestrel felt very sorry for him apparently hed lost two more patrons who had simply not been able to conduct the business they needed the nonhuman gemcarvers these men wished to patronize had left in the summer and the quality of the gems that the humans who had bought their business produced was apparently inferior to the original work so the innkeeper was only too happy to learn that their business was prospering and that they were prepared to stay some time but then robin took him aside for a long discussion in hushed whispers and the man looked so alarmed that kestrel wondered what on earth she could be telling him when she returned she had a set of written directions in her hand and a smug expression on her face i thought with a name like the singing bird this place had to have some sort of connection to the free bards or the gypsies or both she said as she took his arm and led him from the inn into the street i said as much and frightened him half to death until he realized i was both a free bard and a gypsy and not some sort of informer or blackmailer then he was frightened because he thought i was going to demand something unreasonable from him her tone grew a little bleaker im afraid that there are already some musicians in gaol here on the charge of perverting public morals and i think he expected me to ask for help in getting them out are ththey ffree bbbards kestrel asked nervously keeping a discreet eye out for anyone who might be following or listening to them no they cant be she told him theyve been in gaol since early fall and we would have heard something if they were free bards someone would have missed them and passed the word no im afraid theyre just ordinary musicians with bad luck or else they simply didnt pay enough attention to what was going on with the high bishop wylie says they were arrested for singing the saucy priest right at one of the street preachers kestrel shook his head sympathetically they had performed the same song any number of times and quite often when there was a clergyman who clearly deserved to hear it nearby bad luck bad timing and worse ability to observe the situation around them that was all it was whwhats the cconnection tto the free bbards he asked out of sheer curiosity gwyna chuckled dear old master wren again when wylie tried to start this inn he was in a bad case bills piling up and no customers coming in wren offered to play for room and board alone all one winter if he always gave free bards the best venue thereafter he filled the inn every night within the first week and kept it filled all winter so wylie renamed his place the singing bird in talaysens honor and hes always kept the bargain it was a little past midday and the street preachers were already out in force but there were none of the dangerous type the trained clerics that confirmed kestrels notion that they were real priests or at least it did in his own mind real priests would have duties during the day that they could not avoid teaching performing holy offices attending to the business of the church only after the workday was done would they be free to come down to the street to pretend to be one of the common folk and spread padriks word to those who might not come to the cathedral to hear it sso what ddid you ask him ffor kestrel asked grateful that everyone on the street at the moment apparently had somewhere to go the street preachers were pouring their exhortations out to the empty air none of them had an audience except perhaps a few idle children with nothing else to do at the moment directions turn here she nodded at a sidestreet that cut away from the main street he followed her direction obediently ddirections to whwhere well i asked him for directions to a place where i could buy information and just let it go at that she told him i told him i had a former friend whod been in the whores guild here and i wanted to find out where she was he was the one who told me what i really wanted directions to the worst part of town the what he felt his eyes boggling again the worst part of town she patted his hand reassuringly dearest its broad daylight and once people there know im a gypsy theyll leave us alone unless were really really stupid thats where you find things out and thats where the whores guild moved after padrik shut down the houses thats where well find out whos helping him if theres anyone in this town who knows outside of the cathedral he felt sweat start up along his back in spite of the chilly wind that cut right through his coat why did she do things like this but it was too late to back out now robin knew that jonny was nervous all the signs were there for anyone to read from the way he clutched her hand to the utter lack of expression on his face and she didnt really blame him despite her cavalier attitude she was not particularly comfortable here either this district tucked away between the tanners and the dyers quarters was called the warren it merited the name for it was a maze of narrow streets too small for any size of cart to travel along with buildings that leaned over the streets until they nearly touched blocking out the sun they hadnt been built that way either the warren had been built over ground that had once been a refuse dump and was now in the process of collapsing and as it sank the buildings leaned coming closer and closer to falling down with every passing year constables never ventured in here there were not enough of them it would take a small army to clean out the warren and no one wanted to bother sound echoed in here and it was impossible to tell where a particular sound came from this early in the afternoon though it was very quiet in the warren somewhere there were children playing a counting game a man coughed and could not seem to stop babies wailed and there were two people having a screaming argument that was nothing compared with the noise and clamor in the inn district the streets here were always damp and slimy with things robin didnt care to think about the stench was not quite appalling the horrible odors from both the tanners and the dyers district overwhelmed the local effluvia a few undernourished wiry children played in the streetsnot the source of the childish voices for these children were playing an odd and utterly silent game involving stones and chalk but they were the exception here most children in the warren were hard at workat a variety of jobs some legal most not as soon as a child was able to hold something and take directions it was generally put to work in a district like this one she was looking for a particular tavern one of the few reputable establishments down here and probably the only one boasting a sign this was whereso wylie had told hermusicians were wise to come and where he would have sent them if they had come to gradford as free bards and not as traders finally she spotted what passed for a sign an empty barrel suspended over a tiny door it looked nothing like a tavern on the outside but when they opened the unlatched door and stood at the top of a short set of stone stairs it was clear they had come to the right place although the enormous rooma converted cellarwas very dark it was also clean a few good lanterns placed high on the wall where they would not be broken in a fight gave a reasonable amount of light the furniture was simple massive seats and tables built into the walls or bolted to the floor so that they would not be broken up in a fight or used as weapons a huge fireplace in one wall with ovens built to either sidean ancient stone structure as old as the buildingbetrayed that this had once been a bakery wylies directions included a namedonnarand when the boldeyed shortskirted serving wench sauntered up to them with hips swaying that was who robin asked for fortunately they had chosen the middle of the day for this little visit for donnar a remarkably wellspoken and entirely ordinarylooking man with nothing villainous about him proved to be the owner of the empty keg if ye a come past supper ida given ye short words he said as he sat down at their table and wiped his hands on his apron an thosed been curses i well reckon so mfriend wylie sent ye robin nodded kestrel looked as if he felt a little more secure with a wall to his back and a fellow who could have been a perfectly ordinary citizen sitting across from them come to think of it she felt a lot more relaxed herself were free bards she said shortly donnar raised an eyebrow thas more dangerous these days than bein anythin but a buggie he said using the rude term for a nonhuman it came from the term bugeyed monster notwithstanding the fact that most nonhumans were neither bugeyed nor monsters wwere here as tttraders kestrel said softly in ggodsstars bbut wwe nneed tto know whats bbeen happeningwhywhy has ggradford ggone crazy ah donnar nodded wisely good choice of tradegoods so ye want the short an sorry talea whats been goin on eh what happned with our padrik the miracleworker robin sighed with relief that and other things whats it going to cost us donnar considered this for a moment the tales on th house if ye buy somea mbeer at mhigh prices the restwell see eh depends on what ye want robin and jonny listened attentively as donnar described what had been happening and the measures people had taken to get around the new rules virtually all forms of public entertainment and pleasure had been forbidden no plays no public performance of music no fairetype gatherings taverns and inns were not permitted to serve anything stronger than small beer extravagance and ornamentation in dress were frowned upon the brothels had been closed and the whores guild officially disbanded so the guild and every other form of entertainment organization had moved to the warren and the houses had taken on other guises ye go off t shawna tailors fer instance donnar said an ye ask fer th personal fittings and personal is what ye get or theres bout a half dozen bathhouses where ye ask fer th special massage but it costs more it all costs more eh outside the warren ye gotta pay off th constables an the church guards ye gotta bribe th right people even the guild musicians had moved on to other cities with the exception of the few who had steady employment with wealthy or noble families or in the better class of inn the few independent musicians still in the city now played only at private parties or predictably in one of the houses taverns did not sell hard liquor they sold the use of a mug or glass and for a little more than the old price of a drink one could go to a stall located conveniently near the tavern and purchase hard liquor in tiny singledrink bottles the glassblowers were the only ones prospering at the moment these were the same kinds of bottles that had been used for perfumes and colognes if you wanted to drink with your cronies in the tavern you bought your evenings drinks outside and brought them into the tavern to drink them takes deep pockets though donnar sighed it all takes mortal deep pockets bribes evrwhere ye turn an i tell ye theres a morta folks who just canna understand why tis that last year they was good taxpayin tithemakin citizens an this year theyre criminals hellfires im onef em had me a tavern an didn have the means t build me a liquor shop moved in here he sighed and looked so depressed that robin reached out to pat his hand comfortingly he looked startled but smiled wanly well he continued advantage is i started out with rules here don care who ye be nor what ye doin here we got peace got th whole buildin rented out th upstairs t the heada th whores guild her girls work as m wenches when they aint on duty an f they decide t go on duty wi a customer tis all right w me eh padrikthe high bishop robin said after a moment with all the thieves and professional beggars in the warren you have to know those miracles of his are faked course we know donnar said in disgust trouble is we cant figger out how he does half of em so whats the good of tryin t expose im eh it aint no good fer us tdo anythin unless we cn show everthin is faked otherwise nobodys gonna believe us robin sighed and agreed that he was right she was going to have to wrestle with her conscience over this one and she wished desperately for a way to contact the chief of her clan there was no way that she could expose padrik as a fake without revealing how his miracles were performed which was in direct violation of her oath does anyone know whos helping him she asked hoping someone did if she could discover who the gypsy was that had given away the secrets she might be able to force him to confess publicly that he had helped padrik perform his miracles that would take care of the problem without revealing any gypsy secrets but donnar disappointed her shaking his head not a clue he replied wish we did we figger its got to be somebody in the priests mebbe they found summat in some book somewheres that tells em how t do all that stuff that was a possibility she had not even considered and if anything that made her quandary worse if there was no one to blame for revealing secrets if the gypsy secrets turned out to be something that had already been put in print somewhere did that make her oath invalid she shook her head this situation was confusing enough without making it more complicated than it already was well the last thing we need is something you can do for us better than anyone else she said we need more information than we have particularly on the priests and the best way to get that she paused significantly and donnar grinned is t go workin inna house acourse he finished the sentence for her i spect ye mean as musicians i tell ye what ill get ye an audition at th place i reckonll suit ye best rest is up t you he thought for a moment ye come by in two days same time as tday less i send ye a message at th bird ill have it set up fer ye a good house id say here cept i already gotta feller who aint bad an hes old th girls spoil im rotten robin returned his grin so now what do we owe you she asked he named a price she considered quite reasonable she slid the coins over to him and he pocketed them neatly that includes safepassage through th warren he said as an afterthought itll be rranged fore ye reach th door that means most wont mess with ye some will but th restll leave ye be cause if they mess w ye an i find out bout it well i got friends in here now he looked about his establishment and sighed pensively got so used to it when time comes i can go back t runnin a real tavern againwell i might not and on that odd note they left him and made their way back through the warrens noisome streets completely unmolested as promised chapter twelve there was one truism that kestrel had always found held up no matter what happened crisis might come and go war tempest disasterbut people still needed to eat and sleep and somehow business continued as usual and if they were to go on with their ruse no matter how they felt about the situation they had to act as if they were exactly what they appeared to be simple traders the next day was a repetition of the first getting up with the dawn in time to be in the square before prime selling godstars listening to another of padriks sermons and trailing into the cathedral to watch more of padriks fake miracles this time with robins demonstrations firmly in mind jonny was able to catch some of the trickery he also noticed that many of the same people showed up to be healed today as had yesterdayonly today they were suffering from entirely new ailments he had quite some time to study them as they lined up for their miracles there was definitely a similarity of features among them as if they were all related or are members of the same gypsy clan there were no demonpossessions today evidently padrik saved his more spectacular tricks to ensure that they didnt lose their impact and didnt perform them every day he did produce alms and heal three cripples two blind men a deaf woman five cases of gout a woman with palsy a man with a withered arm and a man with running sores on his leg today evidently was the big day for miraculous messages from angels he struck three different priests with rays of light one red one gold and one white they took turns relating messages from departed relatives to the grieving survivors the one thing these people all had in common were tales of misfortune and woe and they came seeking answers from those who presumably now had access to all of the wisdom of god kestrel should not have been surprised at the answers but he was a great many of these spurious messages claimed that the misfortune that had brought the relatives here to consult with padrik was due to inheriting tainted money and urged the survivors to take what they had inherited and donate it to the church padrik took the occasion to preach an extemporaneous sermon on the subject of the evil magic practiced by nonhumans and how it tainted even the lives and the goods of those who dealt with them only by giving selflessly can the taint be washed away he told the hushed congregation only the church has the power to cleanse and heal and although a scant handful of those who had come to padrik seeking an answer frowned or looked bewildered and walked away several dozen more began to weep with hysteria and rushed forward to the waiting priests presumably the priests were quite prepared to help them with the arrangements for transferring their inheritance into the hands of the church this time the angelic messages were very detailed relating the circumstances of the persons life and death enough detail was included to bring gasps from those grieving relatives they were directed to people the priests identified by name but jonny had been watching and listening to what was going on in the crowd waiting for prime service while he had sold their stars his feigned muteness had fooled padriks corps of priests into thinking he was deaf and probably feebleminded they had been out among the customers questioning those who had bought the red and blue stars for help in adversity they had worn ordinary clothing rather than the robes of their order but something about the way they had spoken had alerted jonny to the fact that these were no common folk he had made note of facesand lo here they were in white robes like padriks though not as elaborate so it was no word from angels that gave the three priests touched by the hand of god such detailed information on postulantsit was clever work beforetime by their fellow clergymen it was quite enough to make him sick to see all these innocent people defrauded and how could a man who was supposed to be protecting their souls who was supposed to be giving them good counsel be preying on them this way he left the cathedral as disturbed as robin had been angry the previous day they returned to their wagon in silence while she went back to her sales he took refuge from his confused feelings by taking inventory of the stars they had left both the wallstars and the miniatures he knew they had been doing well but when he opened the boxes and trays they were storing the stars in he was shocked it didnt take a mathematical genius to figure out that they had been doing much better than he had thought there simply wasnt that much left to count there was no question in his mind if they were to continue their mission here and maintain their guise as traders they would have to take a day or two off and make more stars for that they would need more materials fortunately just as the noon bells rang they got a break the ringing of the bells triggered hunger in the stomachs of those still in the square their customers finished their purchases and hurried towards the stalls selling hot pies and drinks sausages bread and cheese wwe nneed supplies he told robin in a soft voice as soon as he was certain they were not being watched wweve got enough ffor ttoday and ththats all she ran her hand through her hair looking tired and distracted already well at least it will give us a break do you realize that even after our expenses weve doubled what the ghost gave us we could make a fortune here untttil someone else sstarts making sstars and undercutting our ppprices he said sharply annoyed that she was thinking only how much money they were making and not what was happening to the poor people padrik was defrauding or the people who are the sacrificial victims to bring him to power but robin only shrugged then wed better make money while we can she said philosophically you know what we need so go get our supplies youll find the jeweler i made our bargain with easily enough its master tomas and his daughter juli at the sign of the three hearts in silver street and they know what you look like they can tell you where to go to get the yarn and things i have to stay here youre supposed to be mute and its going to look odd if you start telling people prices and bargaining with them she turned back to her task of hanging yarn stars on the side of the wagon leaving him to extract some coins from one of the little hoards in the wagon and get off on his errand he wasnt sure how to handle robins attitude toward all this she seemed so callous and indifferent the only thing that really upset her so far as he could see was the fact that gypsies had imparted some of their secrets to an outsiderand not what the outsider was doing with those secrets he simply couldnt reconcile that with the gwyna he thought he knew silver street the street on which all jewelers and goldsmiths had their businesses and workshops was not that far from the cathedral he met with the jewelers daughter juli currently in charge of the shop who did in fact remember him and also remembered her fathers promise business has been wonderful she said smiling her smile had already erased some of the little lines of worry hed noticed on her forehead yesterday and its thanks to your lady the other smiths havent figured out how to make proper godstars yet theyve been casting them and they just dont look the same you might as well try to make lace by cutting holes in cloth we stayed up all night working father me and his two prentices and this morning the first thing that happened was that our best patron came to ask if we had any star pendants we sold him one for every member of his family and he commissioned a chain of them for his wife it was nice to see someone happy for a change and their silver and gold stars certainly were beautifully made and impressive the silver stars they made were easily four times the size of the little ones that robin turned outbut then no one showing up at their stall would ever be able to afford a star that size master tomas workers made the silver stars of three different colors of silver wire created by alloying the pure silver with different metals the gold stars were also made of three colors of wirered gold yellow gold and white gold really quite beautiful enough to stay in fashion long after padrik was gone the young woman surprised him then she and her father were so pleased with the way things had gone this morning that she had gone out and obtained basemetal wire for robin as well as the silver that they had promised and she named him a price for all that was so low he saw no need to bargain this is at our cost she told him as he carefully pocketed the rolls of wire and i dare say that since father and i are well known here we got you a better bargain on the basemetal than you would have on your own i mmust agree jonny replied she had especially compared to the price theyd paid for the same stuff back at that inn in the hills ththank you vvery much she dimpled at him and sent him on his way again with directions to the weavers and lace makers street where he could expect to get his thread and yarn while business did seem to be picking up in silver street it was still not what he would call prosperous and once he got to the area where the seamstresses hat makers lace makers and weavers were the real impact of the new vogue for asceticism was only too obvious shops were closed the windows empty the doors themselves boarded up those remaining showed only the most sober of materials in their windows and even so there did not seem to be many folk here buying anything following his directions he came to a shopstill thankfully in businesswhich sold not only yarn and thread but glass beads and crystals the woman there looked at him askance when he asked for bright colors and beads but took him into her storeroom and told him to pick out what he wanted the room was lined on all four sides with drawers in sizes from the size of his shoe to the size of a breadbox one section contained embroidery thread in silk raime linen and wool one contained sewing thread on spools instead of in hanks like the embroidery thread and one contained wool yarn of varying thicknesses a tall chest of smaller drawers contained beads and the rest of the room was filled with racks of fabric fortunately he was limited by what he could carry because the temptations in that back room were tremendousespecially a scarlet linen he could easily picture robin wearing obviously the woman who owned the shop could not imagine what he was going to do with all those proscribed colors of embroidery thread the sparkling beads or the bright yarns but she was too politeor too politicto ask he paid her and saw her eyes brighten a little as she put the coins in her cashbox if only there was a way to help the whole city but there wasnt not short of revealing padrik for the fraud he was and they were certainly working on that he headed back to the wagon wondering how robin was faring the moment that kestrel left the vultures descended circling in on her when they realized she was alone at least that was how robin thought of them street preachers began to congregate in the vicinity of her wagon and no one elses when it appeared that she was alone it was then that she noticed that of all the stallkeepers and wagonvendors within her field of view she was the only single female and evidently single women were fair game although they wouldnt trifle with a woman with a male in evidence some of the preachers confined themselves to looking down their noses at her or giving her very superior looks particularly when she made a sale but the others were not so polite as that they took it in turn to set up impromptu pulpits and preach not only at the crowds coming to patronize her stall but at her specifically now she heard a fourth theme to the sermonizing a new one so far as she was concerned and one that was so clearly calculated to make her angry that she held her temper just to spite them women according to these sowise philosophers were by their very nature primitive lascivious and lewd this was as god had intended they said their function as childbearers made them prone to look no further than the acts that resulted in children after all that was what god had created for them to do womens bodies were created for one glorious purpose childbearing women were inferior to men in all other counts in morals in intelligence in the ability to reasonjust as their smaller weaker bodies made them inferior physically women were nearer to the state of the animal than the angel said the preachers and again that was as it should be god had created them to be dependent on their partners for the things they lacked it was up to men with their superior intellect and power of reason to rule women to keep their essentially corrupt natures from overcoming them men should make all decisions for a woman the preachers proclaimed pitching their voices to be certain that she heard every word men should control their every action women were not fit to govern themselves and would be seduced by any creature with a soft word and a clever tongue they think im alone she decided as she continued to smile thank those who purchased wish them well with their prayers and outwardly ignore the preachers they didnt do this when kestrel was here thats why there arent any other women out here alone i know what happens when one shows up they ring her and start preaching at her before she can even turn around her blatant and blithe disregard of their words only made them redouble their efforts and although she continued to ignore them outwardly she was becoming very nervous how long i wonder will it be before those words become law here how long before women in gradford are forbidden to practice trades hold property or do anything at all without the consent and guidance of a man what had happened to the nonhumans could only too readily happen to women and to increasingly broader types of men it was happening to musicians it had happened to mages once one group was eliminated padrik would need another group to focus on as the cause of all troubles why not women there were few enough of them in power most of whom could be eliminated easily enough why not indeed there was no doubt in her mind whatsoever that although padrik had said nothing like this in his sermons these words were his in the mouths of the street preachers one step at a time thats how you get people first you bombard them with the word from a lower source until they come to think that it might possibly have a littlemerit then you put it in the mouth of a lower authority so people become persuaded then last of all you put it in the mouth of the ultimate authority and their resistance crumbles in fact some of her customers were beginning to look at her askance as the meaning of the background hum of exhortation penetrated she simply put on her most guileless and innocent smile and hoped she could convince them that she had no idea that the street preachers meant their sermons for her when kestrel finally showed up she greeted him with such enthusiasm that the customers were startled flying to embrace him and take some of his burdens from him and as she greeted him with the words husband youre back i dont know how i managed without you the preacher who had been spewing forth a particularly vehement and vituperative version of the corruption and folly of women who attempted to manage themselves alone choked off his sermon in midword coughed violently and vanished into the crowd well she thought with satisfaction as kestrel returned her enthusiastic kiss with one rather startled but just as enthusiastic they wont make that mistake again i just made them look like fools and they would probably hold that against her too she dealt with the remaining customers then before any new ones could arrive she put the rest of the stars away and closed up the wagon waving off any potential customers with a smile and a cry of come back tomorrow jonny was already inside unloading his packages and she joined him there with a sigh of relief closing the door behind her and lighting one lantern to relieve the gloom of the interior the inside of the wagon was warm compared with the windswept square her feet throbbed with pain and she had been more nervous beneath the steady barrage of the street preachers than she had realized her shoulders ached with tension the corners of her mouth hurt from smiling so much and she had a headache right now all she wanted was a hot bath a good meal and bed the last with jonny in it jonny greeted her with a smile and a hug and went back to his work she took the materials for the miniature stars from him and put them neatly away in the trays theyd used to hold the finished products hed managed to get turned dowelrods for the larger stars and toothpicks and thin brass rods for the miniatures after they stowed the contents of his various packages away in the wagon they took another accounting of their stock we dont have enough for tomorrow she said reluctantly good gods and i thought wed made enough stars for a week bby ttomorrow therell bbe others out here with sstars jonny pointed out pprobably not the jjewelry ones though which is why you concentrated on jewelry supplies that was a good idea she told him standing on tiptoe to kiss his nose well i guess were going to have to make some more stock which means we take tomorrow off except ffor ggoing to ssee about that jjjob he reminded her a slight frown on his face im nnot sure i llike ththe idea of wworking in a hhouse just what i needed being brought up in the guild hall must have made him a prude she was exasperated but she knew that her temper was probably more than a bit short she decided not to say anything rather than retorting with a sarcastic comment which was rather a new thing for her but after her brief stint as a bird caused by flinging insults at a lascivious priest she had kept a closer curb on her tongue than she had even done before it only took one painful experience for her to learn her lessons instead she told him all about the street preachers who had surrounded her as soon as hed left and what theyd had to say ssounds to mme as if ththe next ttargets are wwomen he said when she had finished quickly coming to the same conclusion she had she nodded that was what i thought andim torn the money we are making here is amazing on the other hand weve already learned almost everything we needand certainly enough to warn harperus of whats happened if we return to him we can warn the free bards and he can warn the other nonhumans you heard what he said i really think that given enough warning to get out the deliambrens can protect all the other nonhumans who care to accept that protection and themselves im not sure we need to stay here she shivered as the shrill rants of one of the street preachers penetrated the wooden walls of the wagon and a chill went up her back in reaction i dont like it here love she said in a small voice it was a priest that caused me all that trouble before padrik has all of the church and the bishopric here behind him theres just the two of us shouldnt we leave kestrel looked down at her his eyes brooding in the halflight of the wagon yyou wwere ththe one who wwanted tto find out whwhat gypsies were helping him he reminded her wwe still dont knknow whwhy padrik is ddoing all thisand i ddont ththink hes even bbegun tto fulfill his pplans and whwhat about ththose gypsies shshouldnt ththey bbe dealt wwith we have responsibilities whether you like them or not his eyes said to her we have to live up to those responsibilities as soon as he mentioned the presumed renegades the heat of anger began to chase away the chill of fear and while she didnt have much use for people who were not free bards or gypsieswell this affected both those groups intimately she flushed and nodded they should she said firmly in fact they have to be first i cant just report a supposition to the gypsy clan leaders i have to have proof that im not just speculating and i do have to find out exactly who they are before i can bring punishment down on them or rather before the clan leaders do thats for them to order not me punishment kestrel eyed her inquisitively whwhat kind i cant tell you that she said with real regret butitll be appropriate peregrine will probably be the one to handle it hes done it before she saw by the widening of his eyes that she had said enough kestrel was only too aware that peregrine was a mage possibly the most powerful magician they knew he was an elffriend and he might be the ally of many more magical creatures so any punishment would be magical in nature at any rate we cant do anything about it all now she continued and sighed i guess we should be trying to stay focused on the things we can do and not worry about the things we have no control over im going to take things as lightly as i can otherwise id fret myself to pieces in this town she sensed his sudden relaxation as if she had answered some question in his mind that he hadnt even articulated well whatever it was there were enough mysteries to solve without trying to figure out what was going on in his mind i want a hot bath a good meal and a little time alone with you before we start in on making more stars she said firmly as she opened the rear door of the wagon and blew out the lantern which i guess she added acidly makes me just as primitive lascivious and lewd as these preachers claim i can oonly hhope he laughed and followed her down the stairs closing and locking the door after her and wisely very wisely he said nothing else practice made perfect and that was as true with handicrafts as it was with music they were much faster making this new batch of stars than they had been with the first batch gluing bright glass beads to the ends of the crossbars of the miniature stars was a good idea it made them look more like jewelry stringing them on chains of matching beads was another wonderful notion and the best partso far as robin was concernedwas that no one else would have anything like them in the market once again they would have a monopoly of sorts while they were not here to make money no gypsy worth the name would ever have turned down such a golden opportunity and if any of the street preachers questioned the presence of the beads she could blithely point out that there were no colors in the miniature stars to indicate what the owners intentionprayer was the beads served that function of course if they can use their twisted logic to prove that nonhumans are demoninspired i can use the same rules to my advantage she thought making the final wrapping on a miniature star of copper with red and gold beads let the rooster crow all he wants its the hen that lays the eggs not him they had gotten up early perforce awakened by the morning bells but theyd put the time between breakfast and lunch to good use and when they came down to lunch the innkeeper himself sauntered over to their table with a note in his hand he looked only mildly curious thiss from m old friend donnar he said it come this mornin he doin well as well as can be expected robin replied opening the sealed note she noticed with amusement that donnar had sealed it with a blob of candle wax and the impression of a coin a rather unusual coin it was in fact one of the silver coins shed given him in exchange for his information and help an ancient piece bearing a strange bird with two tails sometimes i wish ida followed his advice wylie said wistfully without elaborating on what the advice had been then he shrugged and took himself off the note said simply go to threadneedle street to the shop of ardana bodkin say ive come to order an alabaster alb and an ivory altar cloth dont bring instruments its been taken care of there was no signature which was wise on donnars part robin memorized the codephrase and burned the note in the candle at their table are you tired of making stars she asked could you use a break kestrel nodded good so could i she stood up and brushed her skirts off lets go for a walk he took her arm and paid their reckoning and they walked out into the street are wwe ggoing where i ththink wwere ggoing he asked cautiously well probably since you got to see threadneedle street yesterday and i didnt i thought it would make a nice walk she replied there might be something down there i could use that you didnt notice ah jonny made no other comment but his hand tightened on her arm but he looked a little relieved evidently he felt a bit better about visiting a house if it wasnt in the warren well so did she donnars protection notwithstanding she did not want to visit that place after dark there really was no such thing as honor among thieves and she did not trust anyone in that place once darkness fell ardana bodkin was the only seamstress prospering at allthe shop front was swept and newly painted the windows filled with color silk and satin and two young women stitching away at crimson velvet inside but that was only naturalsince from the window display ardana bodkin specialized in ecclesiastical robes the place was a feast for the eye after the browns and grays of the drab clothing outside the crimson satin robes of a justiciar sparkled with rich gold bullion embroidery the vivid blue silk robes of an intercessor boasted cutwork of impossible intricacy next to that the emerald green robes for the service of vernal equinox shone with lacework dyed to match and there were of course dozens of the white robes favored by high bishop padrik and his order all brilliant with embroidery lace cutwork and gems may we help you asked one of the young ladies a plainfaced blonde as robin gazed with hungry eyes on all the vivid soulsatisfying color she had not realized how much she missed her gypsy finery ive come to order an alabaster alb and an ivory altar cloth she said carefullyand a little regretfully a pity to have to leave all this color but the young woman smiled and said please follow me then led them both through the back room where a single woman stitched gold bullion to white satin to a small door hidden behind a swath of velvet she knocked twice paused and three times the door swung open and she motioned for robin and kestrel to go inside the moment they did robin swallowed somehow donnar had made a horrible mistake they were in the receiving room of a convent the room held about five or six lovely young women dressed in the robes of the sisters and novices of a religious order she didnt recognize the pearl gray and white of their habits but they were clearly religious robes the room itself was as stark as any in a convent a few benches plain white walls a single bookcase full of books the young ladies all turned to stare at the intruders i she gasped excuse us we the woman who closed the door behind them laughed she too wore the robes of the order whatever it was but her chestnut hair was left to stream unbound down her back like a maidens confined only by a headband you think you made a mistake yes she said in a rich contralto but you are robin and you kestrel you play the harp both and you come from donnar yes at robins dumb nod she laughed again you have made no mistake this is the house of the penitents and i am madamah rather i am sistermother ardana robin blinkedand then she took a second closer look at the habits of the putative sisters they were cut to fit like second skins down the line of the torso the robes left nothing and everything to the imagination and were certainly teasingly erotic butwhy all this she asked as ardana led them across the room to the door on the other side well it is very convenient for one thing she replied tossing her rich brown hair over her shoulder as she opened the second door if the authorities were ever to come to this part of the shop they would find that all of the ladies here are seamstressesor at least they can sew enough to convince a fool constable of the fact we have everything in place to make it at least look like a convent so long as we have time to clean the private rooms there are many convents in gradford these days many women establishing their own charitable orders which support themselves by a trade or a craft since the miracles began i have heard that one or two are even genuine the door she led them to opened onto a corridor as austere as the receiving room with doors on both sides why so many new orders robin asked puzzled i thought you had to get the permission of the church to establish an order ardana laughed again a goodnatured chuckle oh my dear no the church is indifferentso long as the orders find some means of supporting themselves if they do not attempt to appoint or ordain priests collect alms or usurp any of the privileges of the church the church permits them to do what they will so many single women in various trades have discovered it is a good thing to form an order they need not find convenient men to help them with their businesses if they do not choose to do so robin exchanged a knowing look with kestrel so it seemed that single women were already under a great deal of pressure here as she had suspected might happen and at least some of them had realized that it might not be too long before they lost the right to practice trades or crafts or to run a business without a man or without the blessing of the church very clever my last set of musicians was arrested for streetbusking and sent out of the city ardana said as she opened another door this time to a nicely appointed office furnished well and comfortably and decorated in a modest rosepink there were two small harps standing in the corner beside two chairs donnar said you were looking for a way to pick up information about padrik well many of my clients are either in his employ or in his order if any of them are likely to let information slip it will be here she gestured to the two harps consider this your audition she told them if i like what i hear i will hire you for a few hours in the evening to play in the chapel you may keep your ears as wide open as you like and i will tell my ladies to let you know if they hear anything she sat down behind her desk as serene as the statue of saint hypatia in the cathedral and with that same hint of an amused smile on her lips robin passed one harp to kestrel she plucked a set of strings experimentally but someone had done a good job of keeping them in tune she looked over at him and somehow in spite of the tension they both grinned ththe ssaucy ppriest he suggested ardana laughed kestrel had been very uncomfortable from the beginning about this when they passed their audition and ardana hired them on the spot he didnt lose any of that discomfort in fact it got worse it was worse still when ardana led them to what she referred to as the chapel a room furnished with soft couches and cushions in jewelbright satins and velvets and tiny marble tables where the sisters lounged about in semitransparent or very abbreviated versions of their habits this was where customers came when they wished some entertainment before or after themain event kestrel had never been in a house before and he frankly did not know where to look or not look and the ladies obviously noticed they whispered to each other behind their hands and cast measuring glances at him that made him flush uncomfortably he tried to confine his attentions to the harp that ardana had loaned him clever of her to know that carrying an instrument openly through the street would get us in trouble he thought staring at the ornamental birdhead carved into the supportpost of the instrument as he and robin put the two harps into perfect tune with each other forethought to the rescue again by mutual consent they had decided to play only instrumentals voice might give their identities away and they would try to avoid speaking if they could ardana had given them robes that matched the ones the ladies in the receiving room wore though not so tight across the body those robes were very effective disguises kestrel was so small and cleanshaven he might even pass as a very plain flatchested girl which is only fair since rune disguised herself as a boy to play when the harps were in tune kestrel started a tranquil calming piece fortune my foe robin joined in on the second verse playing a lovely descant he relaxed against the back of his chair and let himself forget his surroundings in the music so effective was his effort that he woke from his selfinduced trance with a start as one of the sisters touched his elbow and offered him a silverplated goblet of fruit juice he accepted it but could not help the blush that burned across his face at the sight of her she chuckled and he burned an even deeper and more painful red but then she put one hand on his arm and he raised his eyes to her face to see that her expression was one of sympathy and not mockery we assumed that this is the first time youve ever been in a house kestrel she said using his free bard name its perfectly fine to feel outofplace embarrassed in fact i did the first time i came here we would much rather see a charming blush than a knowing smirk you assume the best of us and you blush for our sakes as much as your own the man with the smirk assumes the worst of us and cant wait to prove it robin grinned at her and she grinned back a surprisingly gaminlike grin full of mischief both of you consider yourselves as one of us were glad to have you she finished im sister tera if i can help you in any way please let me know and with that she delivered the second waterbeaded goblet of fruit juice to robin and took herself out of the room entirely the rest of the ladies were clearly with someone offering them bits to eat filling goblets entertaining them with conversation somehow they had all come in without kestrel even noticing dont worry robin whispered to him you were off in your usual trance but ive been listening you wouldnt believe how many of these men are associated with the high bishop or the cathedral he gave the clients a second look they were a wellfed lot and wore selfsatisfaction as if it were a garment while that particular expression was not exclusive to the clergy it seemed the exclusive property of the clergy in gradford i gguess weve ddone the right ththing he whispered back finishing off his juice and setting the goblet down beside his chair i am very relieved to hear you say that robin replied with a sigh i was afraid youd think id gotten us involved with something really repugnant he shrugged im always wwilling tto llearn he told her philosophically now llets pplay promise not to go off into one of your trances again she countered were both supposed to be keeping our ears open remember he plucked the first few notes of my lady spy by way of an answer and grinned she returned it picked up the tune within the first bar and they were off again chapter thirteen their next several days settled into an odd routine a routine robin even felt marginally comfortable with so long as she didnt listen too closely to the high bishops sermons that is and avoided street preachers entirely they played in the chapel by night and sold their trinkets in the market square by day early in the week robin took note of the fact that kestrel had a shrewd business sense she would not have expected that from someone who had grown up in the bardic guild hall and had been born a prince his estimation that they would soon find others duplicating their godstars for a lower cost was right they sold off all their wallstars at the same price that the new folks had set and did not bother to make any more instead they concentrated on the miniatures few people had a delicate touch with the fragile wire and of those few no one made them with beads or crystals hanging from the webs or mounted as endcaps on the crossbars they began to see the more expensive versions of the stars on the breasts of wealthy folk in the cathedral they even began to see those same expensive stars coming into ardanas chapel at night many of them stayed with ardanas ladies gifts from grateful clients they were able to gather quite a bit of information about padrik and his special healing services simply by listening the most important bit of information came by accidentwhen one of the people robin suspected was a priest let it slip that padrik had some special helpers who were the only ones permitted to assist him in planning the healing services after that they attended every one of the healing services until they began to be able to recognize certain faces despite disguises they were even able to put a name or two to those faces by waiting at the entrance and listening carefully while these postulants talked among themselves that was when robin realized that the man who specialized in being possessed by demons was a regular client at ardanas she was certain enough that she was willing to put it to a test the fourth night that they played ardanas chapel but she waited until that morning so that she could confirm it with kestrel robin figured that they were due for another demon possession at the healing serviceprobably todayand she was not disappointed as they brought the man up to the front spitting and sweating and breathing fire she nudged kestrel in the ribs wasnt he the one with sister krystal last night she whispered kestrel narrowed his eyes with concentration and finally nodded i think so he whispered back but wait until i get a better look at his face it wasnt until the demon had been cast out that they both got a really clear look at the man but the smirk he wore as he was helped out of the cathedral only made the identification surer he had worn that same smirk last night the chapel was empty of clients a good time to consult the statuesque sister krystal the client last night sister krystal wrinkled her aristocratic nose with distaste his name is robere patsono is he one of padriks special helpers you were looking for at robins nod she grimaced i wouldnt be the least surprised to find out he was involved with padriks miracles hes always hinting about how important he is to the high bishop but he gets very coy about it when one of us tries to find out exactly what it is he does if his name is patsono then he is one of the ones setting up the miracles robin replied grimly someone lit a sweetscented candle and the smell of roses filled the chapel krystal tossed her long ashblond hair over one shoulder and pursed her lips with speculation do you think you might be able towellput a spike in padriks wheels she asked hopefully things were better when the houses and the guild were legal things kestrel asked he looked puzzled although robin had a notion what krystal was talking about krystals reply confirmed her guesses she sighed and closed her gray eyes for a moment now well things can happen to a lady and the only recourse we have is for ardana to ban them from the house she cant always do that even because if the client is important enough he could threaten to turn us over to the cathedral constables the guards of public morality robin said with heavy irony very nice as if they werent violating the laws themselves ive seen plenty of them in here too krystal shook her head and toyed with the silken folds of her robe of course you have but that wouldnt stop them from arresting us if they were ordered to they dont care why should they we arent important to them they can always find another house whwhereas you wwould wwind up in ggaol kestrel said for her or the workhouse where they make honest women out of people like me krystal tossed her hair but this time angrily that was new whats a workhouse robin asked sister jasmine chimed in its a place where theyre putting women convicted of something called immoral idleness basically its if they dont have a husband or father supporting them or work at a trade or a job they do plain sewing and laundry for the cathedral and the abbey here and get paid what robin wanted to know nothing jasmine said bitterly their socalled wages are confiscated to pay their fines and room and board ive heard other stories too about that socalled workhouse krystals eyes flashed with anger it seems the priests visit there very often ive heard they have all of the advantages of a house one reserved for the privileged few but they dont have to pay for any of them and not only that but the laundry and sewing get done for nothing too ththats sslavery kestrel said after a moment of appalled silence krystal shrugged and her hair slipped coquettishly over one eye thats the privilege of power she replied and its why so few of us have actually been caught in a raid we dont want to end up in the workhouse so we all have ways to escape if we have to she faltered then continued well one way to make certain padrik wouldnt want you is to make certain you arent pretty anymore she might have said more but ardana appeared with a client in tow a rather ordinary and dumpy little man dressed like a middleclass merchant with merry eyes there was nothing about him to fire the imagination and robin could not for a moment imagine why krystals face lit up with a truly welcoming smile when she saw him but the lady rose immediately and hurried over leaving robin and kestrel to pick up their instruments and resume playing but robin had everything she needed anything else krystal could have told her was of secondary importance and minimal value most of it robin had already deduced it made perfect sense to find the patsono clan mired up to their necks in this sordid business they specialized in being involved in sordid undertakings it had never been anything on this scale though mostly petty trickery and fraud even among the gypsies a patsono was watched carefully and valuables kept out of easy filching reach all gypsies tended to cheat ordinary housebound folkwho they called gajo or in the outsider tongues rootfeet from their habit of never leaving a place for as long as they lived it was not considered cheating so much as a combination of good bargaining and education if the rootfeet learned to be careful to watch their purse strings or to examine what they bargained for then they got a cheap lesson in the ways of real life sometimes that cheating extended to a bit of outright theft if the mark appeared to deserve such attentions robin had picked a pocket or two in her time she considered it justice not thievery those whose purses she lightened were either far too wealthy for their own good or they had been particularly noxious like the bullies in westhaven but gypsies as a rule never made fellow gypsies or free bards the targets of such thievery and trickery the patsono clan had fleeced or robbed both quite as often as theyd victimized rootfeet the only question in robins mind waswhy why were they doing this what were they getting out of it why had they suddenly decided to throw in with a rootfootand not just any rootfoot but a high bishop the gypsies had no shared interests with churchmen not even a common religion she had personal experience with a patsono or two if there was one trait besides dishonesty they all had in common it was a distinct aversion to cooperate with anyone there was only one way to find out that why and that was to do so in person kestrel isnt going to like this robin she told herself as she devoted half her attention to her playing while the other half was wrapped up in thinking up a way to get her into the black heart of the patsono clan so while youre at finding a way into patsono maybe youd better find a way to talk him into accepting this kestrel didnt like it not at all youre what anger had completely obliterated jonnys stutter he had listened to her careful explanation in relative calm but the moment she had told him that she was going into the clan enclave he had exploded im going to pretend im a distant cousin of one of the patsonos she explained again patiently thats not at all hard unless you go through a formal handfasting there are plenty of gypsies who dont bother with formalizing relationships not even when there are children there usually arent when theres no handfasting unless the woman is wealthy in her own right and wants a child gypsy women are all taught how to prevent conception so how would you be some kind of relation then he shot back eyes wide with emotion although she could not tell whether it was anger or something more complicated because sometimes a woman can choose to have a child and not care who the father is so long as he isnt a rootfoot she said trying not to show her exasperation at having to state the obvious and sometimes women are just stupid or careless it doesnt matter all i have to do is claim my father is one of the patsonos name some city i know the patsonos were in and give a vague description of the man patsonos have no imagination to speak of of the entire clan at least a quarter of the men are named robere another quarter are called tammio and the rest are a mix of berto albere and tombere if i say my fathers name was robere and i dont try to claim any special privileges or demand one of the roberes recognize me as his offspring there shouldnt be any problems or questions among the clans its basically up to you and maybe the clan chiefs to keep track of who youre related to if shed thought that would mollify him she was proven wrong shouldnt he scoffed lip curling in mockery shouldnt cause any problems or questions oh grand what if it does it wont as long as you arent with me she retorted her own temper fraying which you wont be you couldnt pass for a gypsy no matter how hard you tried and by now im sure there are plenty of clans whove heard of robin and her gajin vanderei but when i go in alone there wont be any reason to connect me with what he yelped again youre doing no such her frayed temper snapped how dare you you are not my master you do not tell me what i will or will not do she hissed i rule my own actions and with that she whirled yanked the door to their room open and stalked away down the hall down the stairs and out into the courtyard walking as quickly as she could and still preserve her dignity once she reached the courtyard she sprinted across it and dove into the street beyond evidently her angry defiance caught kestrel offguard if he tried to follow her he was too late about it for she quickly lost herself in the earlyevening crowds she wrapped her warm woolen shawl around her shoulders and her head and slipped through the slowermoving strollers with the agility of an otter in a stream she knew exactly where she was going now thanks to those evenings at ardanas according to the clients padriks special helpers had a little enclave of their own on church property there was a walled courtyard on the opposite side of the cathedral from the marketsquare a courtyard that had a guesthouse meant for groups of visitors that was where the special helpers and their wagons were so that was where robin would go moving at a brisk walk she kept herself warm and covered the distance between the inn and the cathedral in very short order she actually made better time than she had expected to emerging into the deserted marketsquare before she realized that the crowds had thinned to nothing she looked up and could not suppress a gasp she stopped dead in her tracks to stare she had never seen the cathedral at night its impact was as great as the first view by daylight had been the carvings were darker shadows silhouettes against the colored glass of the windows and every window shone with its own light the colors gave the illusion of floating in the darkness of the cathedral and now she saw what she had missed beforethat the windows themselves framed as they were by the carvings formed the simple shapes of stylized flowers and leaves the cathedral was a huge bouquet of flowers made of light a cold breeze whipped around her ankles then blew up her skirt and woke her to her selfappointed mission she shook herself out of her trance and hurried across the cobblestoned square the windows of the houses surrounding the square were also alight but this was familiar homey light and she concentrated on them rather than on the seductive and hypnotic beauty of the cathedral as they had peddled their godstars she had amused herself by imagining what lay beyond those windows now at least in part she was able to see how the wealthy of gradford spent that wealth it was often lovely certainly expensive but after spending time in the royal palace in birnam no longer impressive in fact the taste in this town tended towards the overblown overornamented many of those who had decorated the interiors of these houses seemed determined not to echo but to outdo the cathedral where one of the carvings of the seatower boasted a single strand of kelp the gilded ceilingmoldings featured a dozen intertwined strands in a fraction of the space and fish peeking through the kelp to boot where there was a pair of ribbontails in matingflight on the airtower the frame of an enormous mirror had three dozen all getting in one anothers way and looking less like a matingflight than an absurd crashing birdorgy it would surely have embarrassed tfyrr wallpaper or painted murals featured the same carvings as the towers but painted in lifelike colorwhich did not improve the composition any and made the paintings look overcrowded she sighed and shook her head sad that so much money should be squandered on such bad taste perhaps this new trend towards austerity would creep over into the furnishings and decorations in these homes if it did for once padriks influence would be of excellent benefit the wall around the buildings to either side and to the rear of the cathedral was an impressive one and quite blankwhich was in itself interesting no carvings which implied that the wall was newand no entrances so the only way into the compoundunless there were gates in the wall on the other sidewas through the single gate she had been told about and through the cathedral itself well if i wanted to keep an eye on the comings and goings of my underlings thats how i would do it she thought to herself in the robes that most of these fellows wear climbing the wall would be a difficult proposition getting in was going to be a difficult proposition as well unless the patsonos left the gate open and unless they were so incredibly stupid that they didnt bother to put a guard on it then again its the patsonos they may be crooked but theyre also idiots still even idiots could have a moment or two of shrewdness plenty of smart people became dead smart people because they forgot that but as she rounded the corner she was able to breathe easier the gate stood open wide with yellow light from the courtyard beyond spilling through it out onto the cobbles there wasnt even a token guard at the gate not even a child watching to see who came in oh aye its the patsonos all right she simply sauntered through and once inside rearranged her shawl as a gypsy would wear it tucked into her belt she loosened the strings of her blouse a little and turned her businesslike stride into a slow deliberately provocative walk she saw to her concealed relief that there were plenty of women hereand that like her while they might have adopted the mousebrowns and dustgrays of the townsfolk they still wore their clothing like gypsies the wagons were arranged around the wall with a communal fire in a great iron dish in the center of the courtyard the building formed the rear of the courtyard by the lights it was occupied and by the size there was nowhere near enough room in there for every patsono here it must be reserved for the elite of the clan then the chief his family his advisors and their families there were a fair number of people loitering about in all ways but the lack of color music and dancing this looked like a fairly typical gypsy camp situation most of those loitering were young and by their demeanor and lack of gold jewelry of fairly low ranking in the clan it looked as if she had guessed correctly the higherranked members were granted the greater comfort of the building while the underlings made do with their wagons on the whole this lot was cleaner and better kempt than the majority of the patsonos robin had ever been forced to deal with that made her job of fitting in a little easier if i dont stay around the younger and unimportant clan members i could get in trouble the clan chief might be smart enough to ask about my father and i would get tripped up by a chief unless i happened by pure accident to pick someone for my father who is dead or simply isnt here she strolled over to a loose gathering beside the fire someone passed a skin of wine in her direction and she squirted it deftly into her mouth thus passing the informal test that showed she was a gypsy no gajin had ever mastered the gypsy wineskins unless they were particularly deft free bards she let the fire warm her and tried to examine the faces nearby without really looking at them light enough came from the fire to see features clearly many seemed familiar they were perhaps the people who were healed without any outward evidence of being sick or crippled other than the canes and crutches those were simple deceptions that even a child could perform and in fact some children had performed them so whos on duty tomorrow asked a young woman with a remarkably large nose and slender build not me i know that much it sounded like the resumption of a conversation her arrival had interrupted little robere bald robere blind robere tammio blackboard mindy and berto lightfingers thats all i know of another voice said from the other side of the fire theres a special demonpossession up padrik has a point he wants to make and a woman he wants to get back at and people are getting bored with invisible demons anyway should be a good show and its going to be an impressive enough thing we dont need a big parade of victims oh good the largenosed girl said with a grin that means im off they keep making me play blind and my legs are black and blue from stumbling into things the bruises make it look good dearie said an old woman with a cackle now i remember when i played blind oh yes we know all about that granny a young man interrupted rudely weve heard it all a hundred times how you broke a leg just to prove you couldnt see a thing if i hear it again im going to choke the grandmother looked mortally offended and drew herself up with immense if flawed dignity well she exclaimed if me wisdom and experience are going to fall on deaf ears i will just go elsewhere that i will she limped off into the darkness muttering to herself the thump of her cane on the cobblestones punctuated her grumblings several of the younger gypsies around the fire snickered one of the young men looked at robin curiously for a moment and she was certain that he was going to ask her who she was but he only passed her the wineskin and after she took her mouthful of rather good wine from the high bishops cellars no doubt she realized why he hadnt confronted her with a demand for her identity whos special duty he asked instead any magic tricks tomorrow besides the new demon only the chief and that priest he works with no one else not even the peacock the nosegirl said robin laughed a little with a rueful grimace and he grinned and winced she passed the skin back to him he had seen herin the cathedral and since he was seeing her now here he simply assumed that she was one of the other special helpers perhaps there were patsonos coming and going all the timepatsono was a small clan but she had no idea of the true numbers perhaps there was not enough room for all of them here perhaps they were still collecting farflung members as word spread they were needed for whatever the reason she was accepted without question or qualm and she took instant advantage of the fact feeling a little smug kestrel had overreacted of course it was going to be satisfying to point out just how badly he had overreacted bishops got good wine remarked someone as the skin came around to him the boy nearest robin laughed drunkenly bettern ive ever had anyway the tipsy one said slurring his words a bit good food good wine an trickin the rootfeet thiss th best the girl with the nose laughed just as someone threw another log on the fire making it flare and casting a ruddy light on her face that made her seem diabolical she had the most unpleasant laugh it had ever been robins misfortune to hear it wasnt quite a scream and it wasnt quite a bray it was a combination of the two she sounded rather like the peacock maybe they ought to use her and get rid of the bird what i love she announced to one and all is that its usin their own religion to part em from everything they got you seen those sheep when them priests tell em they got cursed money they cant throw it at us fast enough she got a round of laughter at that like that old goat tday the fellow on the other side of the fire said had a bad minute with him i thought when the priest told him bout the curse that he was gonna fall over with a brainstorm went purple he did that unleashed another flood of anecdotes with the nosegirl lamenting that she wasnt a little child anymore since the children who were healed were often showered with gifts from the onlookers witnesses padrik calls em the nosegirl sniggered right tell em what theyre gonna see an they sure do see it i hear that the chief roberes working on a really big illusion the acrossthefirevoice offered itll make the demon looklike a fairetrick so they say padrik asked him says he wants a way to get the rootfeet to think they got to come up with the money for a hospice an angel as bigs the cathedral with like a big hospice in its hands thatll make em cough up the silver gold too for an angel the nosegirl mused the light of greed in her eyes how much of that do we get you reckon thatd be something whatever else she was going to say was interrupted by the arrival of a much older grayhaired man with a aura of selfimportant authority meetings running long he said without preamble were gettin hungry and thirsty an we dont want the bishops servants carrying tales so youre lookin for volunteers t keep the cups an plates filled huh the nosegirl sighed gray tombere i swear you think thats all we were born t do for you chiefs youd think we was servants he gave her a sharp look maybe thats all youre good for rosa he replied sharply i dont see you exertin yourself for the clan are you coming in or not she stretched ostentatiously and yawned i guess just as good as bein out here an its warmer in there robin waited until two more had volunteered before offering herself once again no one gave her more than a second glance not even the secondary chief whod come for the volunteers a moment later she was inside the guesthouse in a large room heated to semitropic temperatures by an enormous fire in the fireplace that was the only source of light either the clan chiefs enjoyed this attempt to get the feel of an outdoor meeting or else the bishop did not trust them around candles and the resulting waxdrips on his furniture and paneling if so he was wise at least so far as robin could tell the carpet had been treated as if it was a dirt floor the table was crusted with spills that had never been cleaned up and the sideboard was in the same shape the bishops furniture would never look as good as it once did and he might have to replace it all after this there were platters of food waiting on the sideboard and tall bottles of wine in the dim light it was difficult to tell just what the food was other than in the general sense of meat bread and maybe cheese she took the nearest open bottle and turned towards the table pouring it in any goblets that were less than full rosa took up a platter of meat slices and dropped them on plates with little regard for splattering sauces the other volunteers picked up platters at random and did the same but the owners of the plates didnt seem to care either they picked up whatever was on their plates in their fingers rolled it up and stuffed the rolls in their mouths without paying any attention to the food itself instead they leaned forward intently and only a few brushed briefly at the spills on their clothing before bringing their attention back to the words of their chief he was describing exactly the illusion that the boy outside had mentioned of the cathedraltall angel with a hospice in its hands with additions the angel was supposed to be real to the touch in case someone was brave enough to try and it was to exude an aroma of incense it was supposed to smile and nod as a disembodied voice described the hospice padrik was supposed to build so what does the clan get out of this one the grayhaired man asked as he sat down the demon ftomorrow was hard enough has he got any idea what hes asking for that scale of illusion isnt going to be an easy one to build or hold in place we get a quarter of the take the chief replied and as a storm of protest erupted he held up his hand let me finish will you padrik expects more than you realize out of this one our cut is a quarter of the take or three thousand silver whichever comes out the biggest he thinks were likelier to wind up with three thousand in gold not silver especially if he combines this with a big sermon about giving up adornments for the sake of god he thinks that the jewelry is going to fill the collection plates once the angel appears in fact his guess is that within two days there wont be a piece of jewelry left to anybody with any claim to piety there may not be a piece left in the city that isnt some sort of heirloom there was some grumbling but finally grudging agreement after the agreement there was a pause while the participants resorted to their wine robin made three circuits of the table emptying four bottles before they got back to business they emptied their platters too stuffing food in their mouths as if they did not expect to eat ever again and wiping greasy hands on their shirts and tunics she kept herself from wrinkling her nose in distaste it was just a good thing that the current vogue was for brown and gray dark colors that didnt show stains and grease as badly as the usual gypsy colors did then again it lookedand smelledas if their clothing had been clean before they sat down to this meeting maybe the high bishops servants were discreetly taking away their soiled clothing and replacing it with clean while they slept so that their appearance would not arouse suspicion that they did not belong here now gray tombere hows the house doing the chief asked whats new out there the old man grinned better since the guards closed down lady silks and the snow maiden sale of drinks been real good new gambling tables are doing well if we could just get a couple more houses closed down wed be making as much money as the miracles but the chief shook his head dont try to force the luck he cautioned most of the houses are down in the warren now you push the local talent down there and they may come out after us we cant afford that yet not until padriks got more than gradford dancing to his tunes robin listened and poured poured and listened there was more of the same rather as she had expected the patsonos had basically moved into gradford and set up their own little network of linked activities they smuggled in drugs strong liquor and anything that had been deemed illegal they dispensed these things at the house the chief had spoken ofand robin had a shrewd notion that if she were to trace the location of this house she would discover it was one and the same with the workhouse krystal had described they separated the gullible from their money at the gambling tables in the house and they used their knowledge of who the clients were to extort yet more money from those same clients on occasion they had abandoned the usual schemes of fortunetelling and petty pickpocketing they werent even involved in horse theft not here and not now they had tied the clans fortunes to high bishop padrik and his schemesfor just as the patsonos got their share of the donations resulting from padriks miracles the high bishop was taking his share of their income from the house and they were completely content with all of this it apparently had never once occurred to any of them that padrik and his priests were observant and clever and that once they figured out how to reproduce the miraclesor managed to find a mage they could coerce into doing the samethey would no longer need the patsonos with all the illegal activities the clan had gotten involved with it would be childs play to be rid of them no one would ever believe that the saintly high bishop was involved with running a houseand it was doubtful that anyone had anything likely to prove the case that assumed that the patsonos would ever make it to a trial of course and with the example of this gypsy clan to inspire them how long would it be before the high bishop persuaded the king himself to legislate against gypsies and free bards hey someone said suddenly breaking into her reverie and even as she turned away from the table wine bottle forgotten in her hand one of the men behind her grabbed her wrist and wrenched her around whatre you doin he demanded you been listening who are you reba she said quickly forcing an expression of vacant stupidity on her face reba chief gray tombere he said come pour wine rosa she say its warm inside so i come pour wine hey the man examined her for a moment closely dont i know you from somewhere she shrugged tasting the sour bile of fear but trying to keep any expression at all from showing hadnt she heard of a patsono that was hung for horse theft when she was a child could she remember his name she made a quick desperate guess born on road outside kingsford mams clan don like me much pappy was long robere ah she must be that brat long robere got on the ladras woman before they hung him one of the others exclaimed and laughed thats why you think you know her old manshes got that look of his as robin nodded vigorously the man pulled her a little closer peered into her face as he exhaled wine fumes into her nose then let go of her nodding with grudging satisfaction of course this was probably a fellow who did everything grudgingly robin breathed a small sigh of relief as he motioned to her to refill his goblet yah thats it girl you got your pappys look about you long robere allus was better looking than he was smart yah well i heard that he didnt get his name from bein tall guffawed another of the men and as the offcolor jokes and comments followed swiftly robin turned to get another bottle of wine too limp with relief to even think straight as she turned back to the table though the chief looked directly at her you reba girl he said you just get here tonight she didnt know what else to do besides nod presumably the patsonos had put it about that their clan was mustering here she had better pretend that she answered that call then you dont know the rules no hobnobbing with the rootfeet for girls specially not with the priests you get your tail down the hall to the girls room when were done here he said sternly no patsono wench runs around loose where gajin can find her some of these priests think our women are here for them you get yourself a bed where its safeyou rosa you show her where show her where the clothes is that kinda thing rosa nodded and robins heart sank but there was no help for it until she could get away she was a patsono kestrel would be frantic and hed say i told you so the meeting broke up shortly after that and rosa took her firmly by the elbow and led her down a long hallway to a huge room lit by a bare four lanterns and filled with cots most of them held young women and girls just past puberty obviously this was a dormitory the windows were small too small to climb through chief wasnt joking rosa told her in a whisper not unkindly these priests they seem to think were just like the girls in their own special house you just got whats on your back at robins nod she made a tsking sound not the first time other clans have turned patsono get out on the road with nothing rosa said well no matter theres clothes in the closet there we all share ugly but nice make servants here take away dirty ones we never have tdo no wash you gotta take a bath every three days though thats a rule why all the rules robin asked in a whine why the ugly clothes hey tmake us fit in cant look like gypsy or the high bishop might get in trouble rosa shrugged its worth it were getting real money for makin him look like a saint once you start helping with the services youll start getting the money too she led robin to a cot on the far side of the roomtoo far to get to the door without waking someone up there were blankets there already and a pillow she patted the cot and robin obediently sank down onto it trying not to show her dismay ill take you to services in the morning rosa said full of selfimportance youll see what we do trust me youll like it even with the rules this is the best oh yes robin mumbled as rosa went off to her own cot unaware of robins irony this is really the best chapter fourteen jonnys anger evaporated the moment robin flung the door open and vanished down the hall but his indignation remained he hadnt thought shed storm off like that but he stayed where he was at least in part because he was just as stubborn as she was and was not going to humiliate himself by running after her he was certain that she would be back in a moment in two at most she knew he was right she wasnt stupid once she got over being mad about the way hed ordered her not to go shed realize he was right the idea of trying to pose as some relative of these people was the height of insanity surely if the clan was as small as she claimed they knew every single member just because she was a gypsy that wouldnt make her a believable patsono she would come back he would apologize for trying to order her around that was his mistake and he should have known better once he got a chance he could explain that he was only worried about her that he was afraid that her bravery better not call it foolhardiness would be stronger than her fear and she would end up in trouble no that doesnt sound rightbetter say that she would be so intent on finding truth that she might find herself in some situation she hadnt expected he didnt even sit down he stayed where he was standing with his arms crossed over his chest waiting for her to come back waiting to hear her footsteps returning waiting for her to appear in the open doorway and kept waiting staring at the wood of the hallway outside the door when it finally dawned on him that she really wasnt coming back it was too late of course she was long out of reach he had no idea where this gypsy enclave was so he didnt even have a clear idea of where she was heading his initial reaction was a resumption of his anger he stormed over to the doorway slammed the door and threw himself down onto the bed and there he waited certain she would not be able to get into this gypsy enclave she has no sense of responsibility dammit the only people she thinks are important are free bards and gypsiesshe doesnt care about anyone else shes as bad as padrik he thinks nonhumans are nonpersons and she thinks the same of anyone outside her little circle hours passed the anger burned itself out fear replaced it turning him sick with anxiety for her by the time the bells tolled for midnight he was certain something terrible had happened to her maybe the gypsies had turned her over to the cathedral guards maybe they had taken matters into their own hands maybe she had been arrested for being out on the street after midnight maybe a common thief had knocked her unconscious or even killed her maybe someone had attacked her and she had used magic to defend herself and now she was facing a judge for that he sat on the bed until the candle burned out he was sleepless with tension waiting to see if dawn would bring her back his throat ached his stomach twisted and churned sending bile into the back of his throat his skull throbbed with headache and his eyes burned with fatigue and above it all was helplessnessthe knowledge that she was in a situation he couldnt discover with people he didnt understand and that his damnable stuttering speech would keep him from even asking a stranger about her when dawn came without her his heart plummeted further and he flung himself off the bed to stare at the rising sun with weary aching eyes there had to be something he could do too restless with anxiety to stay in the room any longer he tried to think where the best place might be to hear any news ardanas no she wouldnt be open for business yet the warren maybe but he didnt want to venture in there unless he absolutely had to finally he could only arrive at one answer the cathedral criminals were often displayed near there in the stocksthough what she could possibly do to get herself arrested as a common criminal she could manage just by not going along with a constable if he stopped her to question her i suppose there was always gossip the circulation of rumors among the merchants by now he and robin were a familiar sight and many of the other merchants were friendly with the two of them maybe one of them would have heard something but i am supposed to remain mute he changed splashed some water on his haggard face and hurried down to the stable to get the wagon the sooner he got to the square the better the sun was barely above the level of the rooftops the courtyard was still in shadow and frost covered the cobblestones he was too early for the stable hands and had to wait pacing in the frigid courtyard he could have gone back to the common room to eat while he waited but he could not even bear the thought of food at the moment his stomach was so knotted up he was nauseous he took the reins of the horses and mounted to the drivers seat as soon as they brought up the wagon it took all of his selfcontrol to keep from galloping the horses down the street to the marketsquare he wanted to be there so badly that it seemed to take hours for the horses to walk the short distance to the market and every momentary halt made him want to scream at those blocking the street it took as much control to set up when he got there as if everything was as usual to smile and mime prices and sell the godstars as if nothing was wrong and there were no rumors no gossip not even about a strange gypsy being arrested for vagrancy or resisting arrest nothing the other merchants seemed to think that robin was ill or restingseveral of them took the time to come up and tell him to give his wife their best wishes or to ask if anything was seriously wrong with her the only difference between today and all the previous days they had been here was the number of street preachers in the square itself they were multiplying like rats this morning and this morning their sermons all focused on the same subject the perfidy of women they were not preaching at kestrel not the way theyd preached at robin the afternoon she had been alone the description of him on their license said that he was deaf as well as mute and most of them read the description and gave him a bored glance before beginning their harangues usually the street preachers ignored him entirely but perhaps because the sun was concentrated here all morning making this little corner of the square marginally warmer than the rest there was never a moment between sunrise and prime service that there wasnt a preacher delivering a speech within earshot sometimes there were two or even three their speeches overlapping and creating aural chaos from kestrels point of view what was very different this morning was that their speeches were so similar that they could have been reading from the same prewritten script women are easily corrupted and spread their corruption gladly women are by nature treacherous and scheming women are weak and cannot resist temptation of any sort women have no grasp of true faith women are inferior and nearer to the nature of animals than of angels kestrel wondered why none of the women listening seemed disturbed or even insulted if it had been him or robin he would not have been standing there listening to some fool claim he was some breed of lesser creature and needed a keeper to prevent him from doing wrong why were they listening to this abuse and saying doing nothing did they believe it and why was all this poison specifically directed against women pouring out now what had happened to trigger it his anxiety mounted for a moment if that was possible as he wondered if robin could have done something to cause this outburst of venom but no why would they need to prepare people for the punishment of someone they had already caught in dubious activity they wouldnt more than that with someone as unimportant as robin theyd simply fling her into a gaolcell and walk away so it couldnt be robin it must be that something else had happened involving some woman of standing and importance or was there something about to happen as the sun rose and the square filled his questions remained unanswered and he began to wonder about something else could he have underestimated robin could she have gotten herself into the patsono clan after alland had she learned something that had made her stay there with them the more he thought about thatwell the more likely it seemed robin could well have been angry enough at him to punish him by not sending any word or she could have found herself in a position where she was unable to get away surely surely if shed been caught shed have been paraded like any other common criminal but he could not convince himself of that and he certainly could not convince his gut out of habit and for lack of anything constructive to do he closed up the wagon and trailed off with the rest to the healing service hoping that robin would come to their usual place under the statue of saint hypatia but hypatias pedestal was empty and as the usual show played out in its usual mockery he was tempted to leave then came a cry that rang over the murmur of the crowd and brought the healing service to a complete halt demon his head and everyone elses snapped around at the cry from the back of the cathedral no matter how often padrik staged these demonic possessions they always gave him a shock four cathedral guards struggled forward with robere patsonowho this morning sported clothing that made him look several pounds heavier than he truly was and a false moustache kestrel sighed with frustration the way the tension had been building he had thought for certain padrik was going to come up with some new revelation before the healing service was over but just as they reached the altar the expected scenario took an abrupt turn into something completely unexpected robere suddenly gave a great cry convulsed and went limp in the arms of the guards his head sagged chin against his chest eyes closed mouth hung slackly open and a thin stream of bluegray smoke issued from his open mouth but it didnt act the way smoke was supposed to instead of rising it snaked down his chest eeled towards the space between him and padrik and pooled there he stared along with every other person in the cathedral if only robin were here she could tell me how theyre doing thisit looked real very real so real that the hair on the back of his neck crawled and gooseflesh rose on his arms the cathedral was so silent that he wondered if anyone was even breathing the guards holding the man were whitefaced and trembling they certainly hadnt expected this to happen only padrik was unmoved he watched face stern one hand raised in a warding gesture the other grasping his staff of office then as more and more of the smoke gathered a vague shape rose up out of the pool of mist and kestrel heard a faint discordant music but not with his ears music like but unlike the music he always heard when rune or talaysen worked real bardic magic the music he followed on the rare occasions that he had done the same someone was working magic real magic in the cathedral and if its not to produce this demon ill eat every godstar ive made the shape shivered thickened grew opaqueand took on a clear defined form then more than a form it became a demon a real threedimensional being that looked exactly as the demons portrayed in so many church paintings and carvings pale gray the color of stone manlike but clearly not a man naked except for a loincloth clawed feet and hands huge batwings horns a raptors beak where a mouth should be strangely similar to tfyrr people nearest the demon screamed as it snarled at them then turned its attention towards the altar and hissed but before kestrel had any chance to wonder about that resemblance to tfyrr padrik spread both his arms wide and over his head his staff of office held between them a whitegold glow surrounded the staff and the hands that held it begone foul fiend he thundered his voice filling the cathedral and drowning the cries of panic from the crowd begone be banished and trouble us no more the fiend laughed and kestrel felt his knees turning to water with fear he couldnt have moved like everyone else in the building he was paralyzed with fright he shivered with cold drenched in an icy sweat he shook as if he was trembling with fever and started to sink to the floor in abject terror when he suddenly felt the internal music intensify and a new melody join it and realized that the fear he felt was not coming from within him but from the music once he knew that he was able to shunt the music away and fear vanished exactly like a soap bubble popping with it went the paralysis that had held him helpless he remained on his knees however if he had stood he would have been terribly conspicuous amid all the rest of the grovelers padrik was the only man standing now for even the guards had dropped to their knees leaving their prisoner to lie on the floor like a dead thing the high bishop glowed with hazy golden lightlight that was no more divine than the demon kestrel suspected in the name of god and his angels begone padrik cried again his voice rising over the demonic laughter begone lest the wrath of god be unleashed upon you the demons only answer was to leap upon the high bishop clawhands reaching for his throat padrik brought down his staff just in time the demons hands closed upon it rather than flesh the moment that it touched the wooden staff however the real show began the two combatants lurched in a bizarre circledance linked by the high bishops staff never once leaving the clear space before the altar coruscating lightnings of eyesearing yellow and bloodred lanced from the demon grounding everywhere except on padrik whose golden glow had hardened to a visible shield about him the demons shrieks of rage echoed through the cathedral further terrifying the congregation now that kestrel was no longer in the thrall of the artificially induced terror he was able to admire the artistry and wonder who among the priests or the gypsies was responsible as a show it was the best hed ever seen a truly professional illusion on the mages part and a truly fine acting performance on padriks it really looked as if he was fighting something at first the struggle appeared to be completely even but gradually the tide turned in padriks favor the high bishop was back in his former position where hed started when the fight began his back was to the altar with his face to the congregation and the demons back to them there he stopped and held his ground the demon cried out and for the first time there was something like fear in its voice his face shining with wellsimulated righteous wrath padrik forced the demon to its knees and with a tremendous shout wrestled the staff out of its hands and struck it across the head a soundless explosion of light covered the lack of any sound of impact it collapsed at his feet and he planted the tip of his staff firmly in the middle of its back it groveled on the marble before him whimpering a collective sigh passed through the crowd at the successful conclusion to the struggle kestrel was impressed robins disappearance momentarily forgotten this was going to enhance padriks reputation no end it was one thing to banish a demon no one could seeit was quite another to actually defeat such a creature in a battle anyone could see with his own eyes even if it is as phony as glass diamonds but surely now the show was over he expected the high bishop to banish the creature as he always had before though probably in a much more spectacular manner but once again the little play took an entirely different turn who sent you padrik demanded his voice booming and echoing in the silent cathedral who sent you to possess this man and to attack me what vile magician is it that you serve creature of darkness answer or you will feel the might of the weapon of god once again he raised his staff in threat and the demon groveled and wept and whimpered so convincingly that kestrel almost felt sorry for it lady orlina woolwright the demon hissed its voice harsh and hoarse that isss my missstresss the lady i sssserve kestrel started with surprise and he was not the only one to do so orlina woolwright he knew that nameand so did every native of gradford and every merchant who had been here more than a day or two she was one of the mayors councilors appointed by her guild for the mayor surely would never have appointed anyone as outspoken as she was on his own a few days ago she had made a public speech or two of her own in the cathedral square from the vantage of her own balcony concerning the rights of tradesmen with carefully veiled references to all the restrictions that padrik had been attempting to have signed into law she was beautiful wealthy a master in the weavers guild in her own right and perhaps not so coincidentally the only person on the mayors council with a sense of humor shed certainly been able to make a mockery of some of padriks more outrageous statements in those speeches of hers she hadunwisely now it seemedbeen flaunting the new wave of piety by dressing as a woman of refinement and fashion rather than a woman of the new gradford she had been too prominent a target for padrik to attack in the council or in any other conventional secular venue that was what the other merchants had said anyway she held too many debts knew too many secrets so has he chosen this way to bring her down orlina woolwright so be it padrik raised his staff above his head and gazed out over the heads of the crowd you have all heard it you have heard the testament of the witchs own creature sent to slay me i now denounce orlina woolwright as a sorcerer mage and witch of the blackest and darkest i declare her anathema in the sight of all good churchmen let no man aid her let no man succor her for the wrath of god is now against her a bolt of lightning lanced down out of the ceiling of the cathedral and struck padriks staff with a crack he pointed the staff down at the demon and another bolt crackled down to strike it this one was so bright it brought tears to kestrels eyes and when he blinked them clear again gasping all sign of the demon was gone padrik stood triumphantly before the altar alone was he the only one to notice that there was no sign literally of the demonnot even a blackened spot where the bolt of lightning just hit silence for a moment then a single voice rang out over the crowd as a single discordant chord of jarring music rang through his head get the witch before kestrel could blink the crowd had turned to a mob a raging maddened mob he tried to stay where he was tried to cling to the statue but the press of people surging towards the exit was too great and his grip was torn loose as the mob carried him away it was all he could do to stay on his feet and not be trampled now he was afraid really afraid frightened that he would stumble and fall frightened that the mobs anger might turn against him for no reason at all the brief glances he took at the faces of those around him only frightened him more there was no sense in those dilated eyes no sanity in the twisted mouths that spouted shouts of hatred he could only hold to one thought if i try to leave now theyll turn on me and tear me to shreds along with whatever they do to orlina woolwright orlina woolwrights home was one of the many fine houses on the square facing the cathedral the mob did not have far to go for their victim two burly men at the front of the crowd sprinted ahead and broke in the door just as the main body of people got there the house could never hold them all and only part of the mob surged inside the rest waited shouting for the first group to find their prey jonny could only watch helplessly as one poor servant who tried to stop them was beaten half to death and left beside the splintered remains of the door other servants ran for their lives some crawled away with the marks of more blows upon their faces and bodies within moments glass shattered as something was thrown out of a windowa beautiful silver candelabra a woman snatched it out of the air and screamed take the witchs wealth strip her as naked as she was born that was the signal for allout looting windows shattered as goods came tumbling out of them the mob surged forward and people snatched at anything that the righteous looters inside pitched out a windowlengths of fabric paintings furniture clothing and jewelrya fork a glass paperweight an ornamental letteropener people snatched their prizes and ran and no one did anything to stop them the city guard had vanished there wasnt even a cathedral guard to be seen jonny was quite certain that there was nothing left but the bare walls by the time orlina appeared herself bundled up like so much loot bound and gagged and carried in the ungentle hands of the two men who had first broken down her door and now the mob parted to let them through then surged along behind them as they carried her off to padrik strangely they had not stripped her literally that seemed odd in the light of their lack of restraint so farshe remained clothed in her fine gown of mulberrycolored wool not even the badge of master on its chain around her neck had been taken from her once again the mob surged forward somehow this time jonny managed to get to the edge near the front if he got a chance to bolt for the wagon he was going to take it the high bishop met them at the foot of the staircase in front of the cathedral doors his face the very essence of a grieving saint the two men tumbled the woman at his feet and forced her to kneel before him jonny could not see her face but her back told him that if she had one hand free and so much as a letteropener in it padrik would have been eviscerated before anyone could blink you are a witch orlina woolwright padrik thundered as the mob quieted you are a dark mage and a foul demonlover your own acts condemn you as should i and yethis face softened and his tone took on new sweetnessand yet i cannot do other than forgive you gasps came from everywhere and one woman began to weep jonny had been nauseated before but now his gorge rose and he fought down a wave of sickness yes i can forgive you for you are only a woman and by your very nature you are weak and need to be led in the proper path padrik continued magnanimously and i as man and as your spiritual leader failed to give you that guidance i shall remedy that lack now he took a pendant from around his neck a peculiar piece of jewelry that kestrel did not remember him wearing before it was made of iron black wroughtiron in a lacy filigree design in the form of a double circle or an orb that was all kestrel could see of itbut something about it made his stomach twist and he suddenly did not want to look any closer padrik put the pendant around orlinas neck removing the chain that held her masters badgeand that rigid unyielding back went limp she sagged forward in her bonds bowing her head before him padriks smug smile of triumph made the hair on the back of jonnys neck rise and he forced back a snarl here then is your only sentence you must make a pilgrimage alone and unaided on your own two feet without benefit of carriage or beast you must go to carthell abbey place this token of your obedience on the altar with your own two hands only then can you return and resume the proper duties of a true woman and a daughter of the church he expected the woman to fightor at least to defy the high bishop so orlinas submissive nod made kestrels mouth fall open with surprise the mob however was not going to give her any opportunity to display that submission on her own the same two men hauled her to her feet and halfdragged halfcarried her along the street of the inns to the city gates once again jonny was forced by the press of bodies to go along and so it was that he saw the end of the incident once the mob reached the city gates the two men who had carried her all this way cut her bonds and set her free shoving her out of the gates and onto the road leading downward she stood up shook off the bits of rope and brushed her hands absentmindedly across her hair and without so much as a glance behind her as if she was setting off on a stroll across the street she strode down the road that led eventually to carthell abbey robins stance not in the least submissive gave her away even though she wore the same drab clothing as every other woman in the square when jonny saw that familiar figure waiting for him beside the wagon he was torn between giddy relief and wanting to strangle her with his bare hands relief won easily he shoved his way through the crowd towards her at the very last moment though he remembered that robin was supposed to have been a little ill not missing and kept himself from running towards her and flinging his arms around her as if she had been gone since last night that did not however stop her from doing the same im sorry im sorry you were right i shouldnt have she babbledand before she could say anything that might betray them to listeners he stopped her the only way he could think of with a kiss and a hug that squeezed the breath out of her inside he whispered into her ear quickly preachers she started and took a quick glance around her eyes widening at the sight of all the street preachers around she nodded and followed him inside the wagon she waited until he closed the door before finishing her sentence im so sorryshe babbled as they threw their arms around each other and hung on as if they would never let go againill never be that stupid again i was an idiot you were right but nnot rright to act as if i ccould order yyou about he interrupted caressing her hair in the soft semidarkness yyou wwere rright ttoo im sssorry not half as much as i am she replied ruefully calming down and chuckling a little i was a little too convincing they thought i was a real patsono all rightand they put me up in the dormitory for their unattached women i couldnt get out all night and in the morning i had a selfappointed guide that glued herself to my elbow right up until that mob broke loose to go after that poor woolwright woman he shuddered he couldnt help himself he could all too easily imagine the same thing happening to himself or any of the free bards i sssaw it all he said locking both his arms around her to stop her sudden shivering ththe ddemon and everything sssomeone wwas using mmagic in ththere of ccourse how ddid you gget away she put her head against his shoulder until her shaking died down the girl who was watching me couldnt resist a chance at the loot and she left me as soon as those brutes broke down the door robin told him after a moment she put her head back a little so that she could see his face i didnt get any good looks at the demonshow he smiled wanly wwell i ddid he said and proceeded to describe everything he had seen and heard in as much detail as he could remember she shook her head in disbelief several times and her lips and chin tightened in anger long before he was done with his narrative she hugged him hard then pushed him away gently when he had finished thats it she said firmly thats all of this i can take i dont know about you but ive seen everything i need to i can tell the gypsy chiefs who is betraying our secrets we can warn the free bards the nonhumans and the gypsies about what is starting here now i want out of here before they do something like that to one of us kestrel nodded theres nnothing back in our rroom at the inn ththat ccant bbe replaced he told her wwe kkept everything important in ththe wwagon how abbout right nnow her face lit with a smile of relief thats the best idea ive heard in a long time she exclaimed but then her face fell what about orlina woolwright she said hesitantly shes innocentand we know that and we didnt do anything to stop them jonny paused for a moment hand reaching for the door then turned wwe ggo after her he replied and wondered if robin was going to argue with him wwe ccan take her tto one of the jjusticiars wren knknows one he expected robin to object but she nodded with enthusiasma change in her that made his spirits rise i know her too she exclaimed and i doubt shell have forgotten me that is the perfect solutionsurely what padrik is doing cant be legal even by church standards andwell the justiciar we both know is impartial enough that she has made judgments against priests before this all rright then kestrel agreed opening the door ththen lets gget out of hhere bbefore ssomething else happens chapter fifteen getting out was easier said than done robin noticed that the square was filling up with people as they readied the horses and headed for the street of the inns and that was odd because at this hour things were usually winding down and people were going home but the moment they maneuvered the wagon out of the cathedral market square and onto the street itself it seemed that everyone in the city was determined to go towards the cathedral while they struggled to move away one or two folk struggled against the growing flowtide of gradford citizens but most were trying to get to the very place she and kestrel wanted to leave a pity that they werent real merchants theyd have sold everything they owned with a crowd this big id be doing my best to stay out of the street in this part of town if i lived here robin thought grimly a headache starting to form in both temples id lock my door and not open it until morning it must be that theyve heard about the demon and all the rest of it and maybe theyre trying to stream in to show their piety come to evening services and prove that you arent a sorcerer what a clever way to make certain no we ever decides to oppose your will surely every councilor by now has seen the proverbial handwriting on the wall get in padriks way and hell see that you wind up being accused of demonsummoning and there would be no proper court of law for those who were so accused padrik had just set a precedent he was judge and jury for those he accusedand his mobs would see that punishment was dealt out with a heavy hand their wagon was forced to the far side of the street and kept there by the press of bodies a blind cripple would nave been able to walk faster than the horses could and every time there was an intersection there was a city constable there stopping traffic to let another stream of people onto inn street in the end it was full dark long before they reached the city gates and they had actually been able to retrieve their belongings from the singing bird after all robin simply hopped out and shoved and elbowed her way through the crowd when they were two buildings away by the time the wagon reached the opening to the courtyard she had gathered everything up and was waiting for him it had been easy and she hadnt even needed to give a parting explanation to the innkeeper for the singing bird was so full of people she couldnt even see him not that she thought hed be the loser in this he was going to have the money theyd paid in advance for their next week she was glad of that it made leaving a little less distasteful in fact the only thing she regretted was leaving ardana without entertainers with no notice whatsoever but if ardana had heard what had happened tonight well she would probably understand she might even be thinking about a swift relocation herself right about now what was the cost and difficulty of packing up and leaving when compared to waking up to find yourself accused and convicted of dark sorcery robin tossed the bags of their personal things up beside kestrel and climbed onto the drivers bench pushing open the doorway over the bed and shoving the bags in there quickly a good thing i went back too she reflected as they inched along both of them trying very hard to look relaxed and completely unconcerned about the press of traffic if padrik or someone in his train is working magic and he gets an inkling that we were something other than what we appeared to be any mage can use our belongings to find us or to send things after us i dont want to have to test bardic magic against that she took mental stock of what provisions were still in the wagon not a lot unfortunately they hadnt been planning on running and she had no notion what they were going to do when they finally got out of gradford camp at the bottom of the hill and hope that the area was safe probably poor planning next time they did this theyd have to make certain they were ready in case they had to make a run for it next time she thought suppressing an hysterical giggle if theres a next time like this im becoming a washerwoman they reached the gates just before they were about to close for the night there was no one else waiting to get out and a thin stream of people coming in at the last minute the guards there looked at them a bit askance usually people wanted to get into a walled city before the gates closed not out of the place but now that they were leaving robin didnt particularly care what they thought she didnt bother to offer any excuses or make up any explanatory story if luck was with her shed never have to visit gradford again in her life well luck was with them enough that there was a high full moon tonight the switchback road down to the bottom of the hill stretched out before them clear and pale gray in the bright moonlight the horses were able to make their way down the road to the bottom of the hill with very little difficulty and only a stumble or two over a rock or a hole once at the bottom though it was clear that it would not be possible to go any further tonight the valleys were deep in shadow and anything could be hiding there the horses could easily break legs over unseen obstructions so they made camp not a very satisfactory camp as robin had foreseen the provisions still in the wagon left a lot to be desired the horses had grain and water but not as much of the former as they wanted there wasnt much to eat for the humans either no lamp oil and only enough charcoal for the stove to warm the wagon and cook a scanty meal not enough to keep the wagon warm all night so robin made unleavened griddlecakes two each and generously loaded them with honey not enough to do more than tantalize then they went to bed still hungry with only the blankets and each other to keep them warm through the night that wasnt as bad as it could have been though they both had belated apologies to make to each other and a quarrel to mend it was an argument that had proven to bring misery to both of thembut the reconciliation made up for the horrible night before roosters high in the hills woke them at falsedawn stiff with cold and muscles aching there was nothing to eat and only work to warm them but they set off again as soon as the sun rose with jonny catching up on his missed sleep and gwyna driving knowing they would easily reach the wayside inn by noon the horses knew this road now and they remembered there was an inn on it which meant a real stable hay and grain they made very good time with no need for urging on robins part setting off at a brisk walk when she gave them the signal robin kept her eyes sharp for foot travelers she expected at any moment to see orlina woolwright limping along the side of the road the woman was wealthy and not used to walking after all she was afoot and they were in a wagon granted the advantage of the wagon was somewhat negated by the fact that they were in hill country and a man walking could make roughly the same time as any beast pulling a vehicle only a person riding would outpace either but as the hours passed and orlina did not appear robin began to wonder just what had happened to the woman the only foot travelers she saw were a couple of shepherds and a farmer or two where can she be she wondered aloud as the inn appeared on a hilltop in the distance and there was still no sign of orlinas mulberrycolored dress surely the woman hadnt just dropped out of sight robin hadnt heard of any robbers on this road the local sire kept it as wellpatrolled as it was tended and if she had fallen over from exhaustion she should still be on the grassy verge but jonny didnt answer her he was still asleep she swallowed and glanced back at the closed door behind her feeling rather guilty his redrimmed eyes had told her more than he himself had about how he had spent the previous night well she hadnt exactly enjoyed herself but she had known where he was and that he was safe enough in their room in the inn hed had no idea where she was or what had happened to herand likely if they both hadnt been mistrustful of anything that passed for an authority in gradford hed have had her name and description up with the constables before sunrise that bewildered her a little and touched her a great dealand made her feel horribly guilty for making him so miserable she wasnt used to having someone worry over where she was and where she had gone or at least not since she was old enough to leave the family wagon and go out on her own and to have someone worry himself sleepless over her but if it had been the other way aroundhmm i think id have done the same if i hadnt known he would stay where he was i still might have fretted myself into a lather she shook her head and gave up on it she had promised she would never be that stupid again and she meant to keep that promise too much going on and not enough time to think about it all that was the problem too many things happening too fast and they had completely neglected to make plans together next time theyd do better werent they partners that was one meaning of vanderei partners on the road partners didnt leave one another in the dark he never forgot that it was time she started remembering and where on earth was that woolwright woman surely no wealthy rootfoot could have walked this farsurely she wouldnt have walked all night but that assumed she was walking of her own will she might not be hadnt jonny said something about how the woman had looked after padrik put that curious token around her neck yes he had hed been adamant about it spellstruck that was what he said as if something had just thrown a spell over her and had taken over her body mind and will if padrik really didnt care if she returned or not casting a spell on her mind to make her keep walking until she reached carthell abbey would be no great problem what would it matter if she walked herself into exhaustion and collapse what would it matter to him if she walked over a cliff why should he care any misfortune that befell her would clearly be the will of god so the least he had done probably was to make certain she would walk straight to the abbey with no pause for rest for a moment robin felt guilty againthey hadnt done anything to stop padrik and they could probably have used bardic magic to cancel the spell on that token had they stood by and condemned an old woman to deathbyexhaustion maybe not when she made that speech she didnt look very frail to me shes a master in the weavers guild thats a lot of hauling walking lifting even for a master with a shop full of apprentices she could be more fit than i had thought she could in fact have the reserves to walk a full day and a night without collapsing and if that was the caseshe would be a full day ahead of them by now robin sighed with resignation her guilt lost in a moment of selfpity last night had not been very comfortable and she had been hoping to intercept the woman and enjoy a good rest at the inn but this meant no warm bed in the inn tonight and no supper cooked by someone else only a brief stop to properly reprovision the wagon at inn prices she winced while she was hardly parsimonious a gypsy was never happy without a bargain there were few bargains to be had at inns as remote as this one so it had to be done once they had restocked they could go on and hope to catch orlina before she actually reached the abbey and try to figure out what sort of spell they have on her and how to break it she realized as the horses mounted the final hill and quickened their pace with the inn in clear sight they knew what was up there otherwise if we dont break it shes going to keep right on walking to the abbey no matter what we do the innkeeper was very happy to see them again as she pulled the horses into the dusty yard in front of the door he came out himself beaming a cheerful greeting in the thin winter sunlight well my travelers he called out you return and did you prosper in gradford ai robin said sadly and made a long face as she halted the horses everywhere one turns there are hard times and everyone is a thief how can any honest craftsman prosper in times like these how indeed the innkeeper wiped his hands on his apron and made a mocksober face himself the times are hard but you have come to stay surely his face truly fell when she shook her head with custom already thin along here the coming of winter must be hitting him hard no she replied regretfully but we will have to reprovision here we will need everything horsefeed oil charcoal foodwe are down to nothing but a handful of meal and a few cups of oats and i dont suppose your cook has any of those little meat pies that keep so well his expression regained its former look of cheer why he made a batch this very morning and for you of course my prices on provisions will be so tiny i shall make no profit at all im sure she told him dryly then settled down for a serious bargaining session jonny slept all through the stop he didnt even wake up when she entered the wagon to store everything she had bought nor when the innkeepers workhands clambered atop the wagon to store waterproofed sacks of charcoal up on the roof the horses might not have gotten their warm stable but she did see that they each got a good feed of grain and bought more to store under the wagon their profits for their godstars paid for all of it would in fact have paid for it all three times over but she wept and wailed and claimed that the innkeeper was cheating her he blustered and moaned and swore she was robbing him and in the end they both smiled and shook hands satisfied he had been able to unload some stocks that he clearly wasnt going to need this winter and she was at least as satisfied as she was ever likely to get buying provisions at an inn set out in the middle of nowhere the innkeeper hadnt seen anyone even remotely resembling the description of orlina woolwright neither walking nor riding none of his stablehands and servants had either and robin wondered then if they had gone off chasing a phantom still she reminded herself that their main reason for leaving hadnt been to run off to her rescueit had been to escape while they still could if they couldnt find her they couldnt help her and there was no getting around it but as robin set the horses on the road again reins in one hand meatpie in the other that rationalization felt rather flat the woman isnt a gypsy or a free bard she told her uneasy conscience we dont owe her anything were doing our best for her but how can we do anything until and unless we find her we cant and thats it except that both she and jonny knew padriks demon was a fraud his accusations completely groundless theyd had the proof at the time and they hadnt done anything to stop him robin had been in an even better position to do so than jonny she had after all been among the patsonos she could have done something to disrupt the illusion or drugged the chief participants wine or or something i probably would have gotten caught but i could have done something she bit into the flaky crust of the pie pensively licking a bit of gravy from her fingers as the horses plodded up the slope of yet another hill the fleeting fragile beauty these hills had held only a few short weeks ago was gone now the trees were bare gray skeletons in the thin sunlight the grasses sere and brown only the evergreens provided a spot of color and even their greens seemed washedover with a thin film of gray dust she wore her coat and a thick knitted sweater woolen mittens and a knitted hood and still she was cold she wondered how harperus was faring and tfyrr the winged haspur hadnt seemed equipped to take the cold then again neither do hawks and falcons and they do all right unless the hard weather came early there wouldnt be any real snow yet for weeks but by the time it came the ground would be as unyielding as stone and the ponds frozen over she made soothing sounds at the horses and longed for summer or at least a good weathertight room somewhere with a big cozy bed and a fireplace and hot meatpies and wine or a great roast of beef nicely rare and fresh bread or a roast goose with stuffing or better still a duck and yams and while she was wishing why not servants to wait upon her and comfits and cream and she shook her head at her own folly uphill and down uphill and down the horses plodded onward in resignation while the sun westered and the trees cast everlengthening blue shadows across the road the air grew perceptibly chillier finally the little door behind her slid back and kestrel poked his tousled head out he blinked at the light are wwe ththere yet or cclose how llong ddid i ssleep he asked yawning weve been there and gone its late afternoon she told him i got supplies at the inn but you were so tired you slept right through it all were on the road to carthell abbey and i expect to get there about sunset at the rate the horses are going theres no sign of orlina woolwright though and no one at the inn saw her kestrel frowned ththere might nnot bbe he said if shshes bbespelled shshe mmight nnot sstop for anything if shshe ppassed the inn at nnight of course gwyna replied disgusted with herself she would have passed the inn last night about midnight if she just kept walking nno reason nnot to jonny pointed out if shshes under a sspell she wwont bbe able tto sstop even if she ffeels ttired and llast nnight was a ffull mmoon plenty of llight tto walk by nnot likely shed ffall off the rroad he crawled out over the sill and into the seat beside her hed fallen asleep coat and all and looked rumpled head to toe how llong ttill ssunset he asked she squinted at the sun three hours she said roughly want a pie she pulled a pie out of the sack under her seat it was cold now and not as tasty as it had been when it was warm but the pies were still good even cold and far far better than the bannocks theyd eaten last night and he must be ravenous jonny took it with a nod of thanks not quite snatching it and devoured it in a few moments she handed him another and took one herself so this time we make a plan first and stick to it a plan we can both agree on how are we going to approach the abbey she wanted to know the last time they werent very friendly to us and i dont think thats going to change but if thats where padrik sent orlina woolwright shell probably be inside or at least they should know where she is ive bbeen ththinking about ththat kestrel replied around a mouthful of pie i have a ppplan if yyou llike it ttoo that is she grinned they must have been thinking identical thoughts just so its better than one of my plans she teased going in there in disguise as a brother for instance is probably not a good idea the last thing i need to do is have to rescue you from an abbot who thinks youre one of his novicesor have him discover that im not a boy id ththought of ththat he admitted it wwould sserve you rright after all tto bbe on the other sside of ththe wwworry she slapped his knee with the ends of her reins by way of an answer so whats the real plan she asked he finished the last of his pie and licked his fingers ththere is a ddisguise bbut nnot a ddangerous one it seemed to take forever to reach their destination though perhaps that was anxiety and not reality finally the road dove down into the valley that contained carthell abbey it was just before sunset and the sky above the western hills glowed flamestreaked and glorious too bad the valley did not match the viewbare trees on either side of the road stretched riblike limbs toward them a clammy spectral mist rose from stagnant pools of water as they passed through the beguilers swamp it was very cold and damp here and the deep shadows of the surrounding hills made it colder still but at least by now the treekies and the beguilers would have gone into hibernation for the winter now just so that there arent any gellens or varks in this valley as well robin thought kestrel must have felt the same way urging the horses to a faster pace be just our luck that there are nocturnal winter monsters here as well as the ones that hibernate kestrel had taken over the reins shortly after he awoke he stopped the horses well out of sight of the abbey and robin climbed down off of the passengers seat she was dressed in her warmest and drabbest and she only hoped that brother pierce the surly gatekeeper hadnt gotten a good look at her the last time they were here right now she looked like a very respectable young woman straight out of gradford and that was what she wanted him to think she was a very respectable very wealthy and very assertive young woman the kind brother pierce would have to answer whether he liked it or not they unhitched one of the horses and threw a blanket over it hoping that in the semidarkness it would look like a saddle she trotted up the road to the abbey afoot leading the horse for she did not know if it had ever been broken to ride and now was not the time to find out the brisk pace warmed her thoroughly her breath puffing out in front of her in clouds of white there was going to be a hard frost here tonight and perhaps a light sprinkling of freezing rain not ideal weather for camping there wouldnt be a choice however not tonight far safer to camp than trust to the safety of any shelter offered by the church assuming they would offer it not bloody likely the abbey loomed up around a bend in the road lanterns beckoning with a promise of warmth that she already knew would not be kept she hurried her pace a little the horse tugged on the rein in her hand and whickered poor thing it thought she was taking it to a stable if there were varks out here she wanted to get back to the wagon as fast as she could she stopped a few paces away from the door to compose herself the horse pawed the ground with impatience when she had caught her breath she rang the bell with an imperious hand hoping to sound like the sort of person who was not used to being kept waiting when brother pierce did make his appearance he gave no sign of recognizing her as anything other than a female and thus a major intrusion into his life he frowned at her his face taking on all the look of someone who had bitten into an unripe plum what do you want he asked rudely be off we dont house vagabonds im no vagabond you insolent knave robin said with shrill indignation if this were gradford id have my servants horsewhip you to teach you manners she had heard enough of the wealthy women of gradford and the way they spoke to underlings who offended them to enable her to produce a pretty fair imitation of their mannerisms she drew herself up tall and proud as he gaped at her clearly taken aback by her rude response i am rowen woolwright sister to master orlina woolwright of gradford and i demand to know what you have done with my sister that cur of a high bishop sent her here on some fools errand and brother pierces wizened face flushed as she began her harangue but a sly smile crept over his features when he heard who it was robin claimed to be he made an abrupt gesture startling the horse and cutting off her torrent of words shut your mouth woman before it condemns you to a fate like hers he snapped interrupting her now it was her turn to stare at him in simulated surprise that he should even dare to interrupt her well have no truck with the agents of darkness here nor heretics either shes not here the sorcerous bawd she conjured a demon and sent it to destroy the holy high bishop but he was stronger than her dark magic and the hand of the sacrificed god protected him he defeated the demon as a hundred witnesses can attest and the demon itself betrayed its mistress robin hoped that she looked appropriately stunned evidently she did for brother pierce smiled nastily high bishop padrik had every right to condemn her but he forgave her and sent her on a pilgrimage of penance to this abbey he said his voice full of glee shes been sent to a holy shrine in the hills by our abbot as is his right and duty she was unrepentant when she came and he has sent her on to be judged the sacrificed god himself will be her judge once she reaches the holy shrine of the hills if she returns from the shrine well and good she will be restored to her former position by the high bishop himself and if she doesnt robin asked sharply what then how will you protect her he smiled displaying large yellowing crooked teeth god will protect her if she is innocent if she doesnt return well then she is clearly a witch guilty of the charge the blessed high bishop laid upon her and the god has sent her where she belongs her property will be confiscated since all witches are traitors and it will be turned over to the cathedral and carthell abbey she did not have to feign the shock she felt no wonder padrik was a wealthy man able to give an entire clan of gypsies silver and even gold if he was getting monies this way as well as from the gifts of the faithful the shrine she said gasping out the words where is this shrine brother pierce grinned again overjoyed to see her so discomfited and obliged with a description ye follow this road here he said pointing to the old road that led on to westhaven not the newer route but this un ye take it into the hills till ye come to a baretopped hill if ye get to a village called westhaven yeve gone too far on top of the hill thats the shrine but i wouldnt go there he added as she turned to go why not she asked belligerently he laughed the first time she had heard him do so it sounded like an old goose honking because woman if you go there yell be judged too and be sure if you dont return to your home and the duties of a proper woman itll be because demons have taken you like your sister she turned away from him as he slammed the gate shut feeling chilled and not by the wind the old roada baretopped hill between here and westhaven there was only one place he could possibly mean skull hill she ran back to the wagon as fast as her legs would carry her the horse running alongside but looking back over its shoulder with longing there was a painful stitch in her side before she got there they sent her to skull hill she said panting as she harnessed the horse up again and flung herself into her seat i dont think shes very far ahead not if they wanted to time her arrival for midnight rright kestrel didnt waste any words he simply slapped the reins against the horses backs to get them moving again it was terrible they wanted to gallop the horses and knew they didnt dare it only took a single hole in the road to send both horses downand at a gallop that would mean broken legs and dead horses for certain and if the wagon overturned as well they could wind up dead it took a few moments for the pain in her side to leave she breathed the cold air in carefully holding her side and waited before the pain eased enough that she could speak again now we know what the ghost meant she pointed out about people being sent from here yyes jonny replied urging the horses to a faster pace than a walk until they were moving as fast as even gwyna considered safe pput one of ththose ppendants on an enemy it mmakes them ccome here and it identifies ththem tto ththe ghost hell kill her of course robin replied offhandedly he wont even hesitate he told us that himself but jonny only turned and flashed her a feral grin teeth gleaming whitely in the moonlight nnot if wwe ffind her ffirst he said robin returned his grin but uncertainly then peered through the darkness ahead of them she was hoping to spot orlina woolwright quickly for at this pace they could defeat their own purpose by accidentally running her down through the valley of carthell abbey they raced and out the other side into the hills robin could hardly believe that a woman on foot had come so far so quickly it seemed impossiblebut the road was wet and muddy here and they kept coming across the tracks of a human pressed into the mud and visible even at a distance they both knew how seldom anyone used this road so who else could it be they were deep in the hills again before robin realized it and now she had the answer to another questionwhy tend this road so well if no one used it to make it as easy as possible for your victims to reach the place of ambush she thought grimly it isnt the sire who tends this road its the abbey id bet the ghosts silver on it but they were very very near skull hill now one more hill and orlina would be within the ghosts grasp there she is kestrel exclaimed his stutter gone in the tension and excitement he slapped the reins over the startled horses backs they jerked into a canter and she finally saw what he had seen a fastmoving shadow ahead of them a shadow that fluttered near the ground with a flurry of skirts it was orlina indeed and she paid no attention whatsoever to the horses bearing down on her kestrel cracked the whip startling the horses into a dangerous gallop the wagon lurched as the horses bolted a few yards more and it would be too late heedless of her own danger robin launched herself from the seat of the wagon as kestrel pulled the horses to a halt the wagon slewed sideways with a rasping screech of twisting wood and grinding stone blocking orlinas way robin flew through the air and tackled the woman knocking her to the ground the song of the pendant rasped like an angry wasp in her mind as soon as she touched orlinas flesh they tumbled together into the underbrush the thick and springy bushes alone saved them from broken limbs together they tumbled back into the road and robin yelped with pain as her shins and elbows hit rock she didnt even think she simply grabbed the pendant and jerked breaking the chain before the woman could get to her feet again if orlina ran they might not be able to catch her before the ghost took her the song in robins head whinedthen faded orlina woolwright sat up slowly blinking as if she had been suddenly awakened from a deep sleep moonlight poured down upon her as she frowned looked quickly and alertly about her and focused on robin who was sprawled in the dirt of the road beside her what am i doing here she demanded in a strong deep voice what has been happening jonny came around the front of the wagon first pausing long enough to soothe the bewildered mares he reached down his hand with a courteous grace robin had seldom seen in himexcept when he had been in his uncles palace in one heartbeat he had gone from the vagabond to the prince in disguise a useful ability orlina woolwright recognized that grace for what it was and took his hand he helped her to rise she accepted that aid and when she next spoke her voice was softer less demanding i last remember being hauled before that dog of a high bishop she said her words clipped and precise what happened its a llong sstory my llady jonny said carefully he helped robin up she moved carefully but although she felt bruised all over and had her share of scratches there was nothing seriously damaged jonny gave her a quick hug then led orlina over to the back of the wagon and opened the door for her she got in as gravely as if it had been a fine carriage wwell ttell you all if yyou have the ttime as he lit the lantern inside and robin climbed up the rear steps she saw orlina woolwright smile as she took a seat upon their bed it was not a condescending smile and she took her place in their wagon as if they were both royal and she was honored to be there high bishop padrik has left me little but time young sir she replied and i think he tried to take that too she gestured for the two of them to join her i would be very pleased if you would tell me the whole of it chapter sixteen robin was glad they had reprovisioned with the stove going the wagon seemed a cozy island of safety in all the darkness she made hot tea for all of them served up the last of the meatpies and tended to her own scratches and bruisesor at least the ones that she could get to without disrobing orlina did not seem to notice hers perhaps some of the numbness of the spell that had been on her still lingeredor perhaps she was tougher than even robin had thought she was certainly younger than robin had assumed given her rankin early middle age at most it was the ladys leanness that had fooled her into thinking orlina was older there was not even a single strand of gray in her hair and the muscles beneath the dress had been as strong as an acrobats but she ate like one who had been starving for a day and drank so much tea robin had to make a second pot the tale was a long time in the telling and it was well past moonrise before they finished it they had a great deal of explaining to do the lady believed them but robin had the feeling that if she had not found herself on a road in the middle of nowhere with no memory of how she got there she would not have she examined the pendant with interest but did not touch it a nasty thing that she said then looked thoughtful guild lore has it that silk will insulate magic gypsy lore too robin told her id like to wrap it up but we dont have any allow me orlina said and pulled a silk handkerchief out of her sleeve like a magician robin accepted it with gratitude and quickly shrouded the pendant in its folds at last the annoying mental whine of the pendants music stopped only one thing orlina had no trouble believing that the high bishop had such a convenient way for disposing of those who caused him trouble ive long suspected something of the sort orlina said grimly there were dark circles under her eyes and a bruise on one prominent cheekbone but she showed no other outward signs of weariness or damage except of course for her dress which was as muddy and brushtorn as robins and her disheveled hair he rose to power in the church with amazing speed and those who opposed him or were simply in his way found reasons to take themselves away from gradford her lips compressed to a thin angry line straight to the skull hill ghost i would guess robin replied but the immediate question is what of you have you anywhere you can go ththe abbey isnt ssafe kestrel told her quickly ththe abbots in ththis hes probably waiting for a messenger from gradford to tell him what his share of the loot will be gwyna added if you go back there hell just find another way to be rid of you and blame it on the beguilers or the treekies orlina looked down at her hands other than my office of master weaver i have nothing she said softly but she did not sound vulnerable she sounded detached padrik took it all from me with a few moments of lies and some shoddy magic tricks she looked up again and there was fire in her eyes i should go back there and confront the dog i do that and another mob will get you robin said firmly you havent a chance against him and you do i suppose she lifted one ironic eyebrow kestrel shrugged ssome ccontacts ppeople whwho wwill bbe interested in hearing ththe ttruth orlina looked as if she was about to give them an argument then looked down at her hands again they were shaking with the fear she would not show and this outward sign of her weakness must have convinced her for she abruptly collapsed in on herself i have nowhere to go she said a new hesitancy in her voice a few relatives that i havent seen in years decades then go to them robin urged petition the king for justice from a position of safety or mmove tto another kkingdom kestrel added flatly if wwe ccant ddo ssomething about the ssituation in ggradford ssoon ththats whwhat wwere ddoing it wwont bbe safe here for anybody well that was news to robin but it was news she agreed with he who flees lives better a live fox than a dead lion youre still a master of the weavers lady robin continued as another idea occurred to her he didnt take that away from you because he cant your guild isnt one of the ones supporting him in gradford it should give you shelter that youre entitled to you earned it by your own work some of her color returned some of her pride as well thats true young lady she said after a moment the fire returning to her hazel eyes and the guild does take care of its own she sat in thought for a moment i think i have enough gold and jewelry on my person to purchase transportation to the nearest guild hall she smiled slyly and what that fool doesnt know is that the masters pendant does not identify the master at least in our guild the ring does made for the masters hand she held out one of her trembling hands to display a ring gold with an inlaid carbuncle featuring the weavers shuttle anyone who sees this will know me and the guild will protect me good we can do that robin affirmed as jonny nodded ill tturn the hhorses he added wweve a llong rroad ahead of us fortunately the lady didnt ask him to elaborate they left her at the door of a shepherds homeone which providentially housed a member of her own guild as designated by the shuttle burned into the wood of the door the family welcomed her with sleepy enthusiasm and some hearty curses for anyone who would dare damage a guild master they left the entire group listening to orlinas tale after first making certain that these people had no great love for the abbot of carthell abbey greedy and grasping i call it the weaver said with a snort a bargains one thing but he cheats with short measures got so we make special trips up the road to trade rather than trade with him and that padrik was no better when he was at carthell abbey they offered a good place to camp and jonny headed back in the direction they indicated are you thinking what i think youre thinking she asked after the silence became unbearable ssomething hhas tto be ddone he said flatly ill bet ththeres ssomething at the abbey ththatll ttell us hhow tto gget rid of ththe ghghost are you planning on breaking into the abbey she asked softly he gave her a sideways look ggot a bbetter idea not at the moment they drove on in silence for a while longer the horses weary hoofbeats clopping dully along the dusty road the worst that can happen is we can pretend to be looking for holy books that weve been overcome with a terrible case of religion his sudden bark of laughter released the tension in both of them tomorrow night she replied not tomorrow during the day were both tired and so are the horses we can sleep as much as we need to get rested and get into the abbey tomorrow night she tilted her head toward him coaxingly hmm for answer he turned the horses off the road as soon as they reached the camping spot that the weavers had offered just beyond a small bridge over a stream the mares were more than glad to stop and so was robin nnot afraid of ttreekies he teased as she jumped down to unharness them and get them hobbled for the night not treekies nor beguilers nor varks she replied her hands full of leather straps but i am afraid of your food and its your turn to fix dinner sso it is he laughed and went around to open up the back of the wagon presently she smelled lamp oil and bacon by the time she finished with the horses and came around to the door hed warmed the wagon completely and had hot tea with sausages wrapped in bacon slices waiting for her and something else as well which left her too weary to ask him anything more about his new plan before she drifted off to sleep jonny had moved the wagon to a point just outside church lands and hidden it in a thicket off the road they were still within easy walking distance of the abbeyand more importantly from here they could hear the bells as they rang for the various holy services of the day it isnt mmuch of a pplan jonny told her the next day as they waited rested arid fed for the sun to sink bbut i used tto bbreak into chchurch bbuildings all the ttime when i wwas on my own only pplaces they gguard are ththe ttreasury and ththe kkitchen i wwas llooking ffor ssafe pplaces to ssleep nnobody gguards the llibrary robin took up the mass of her hair to braid it so that she could bind it around her head out of the way she gave him a puzzled look the treasury i understand she replied but why the kitchen bbrothers are always hhungry he told her nnovices are always sstarving they were both wearing dark breeches closefitting sweaters and soft boots all clothing they had gotten for gradford so all of it a drab charcoal gray gray was better than black for hiding in shadows as jonny well knew they waited after the sun set until the bell for sixte the last of the days holy services rang then they waited another hour or so for the abbey to settle just before they left jonny impulsively picked up the silkwrapped pendant he had the feeling it might be useful although he wasnt certain how he recalled noting certain trees beside the abbey easy to climb with boughs overhanging the wall they were just as easy for the two of them to climb as he had thought the abbey itself was dark with not even the single lantern at the gate alight that was both inhospitable and unusual but he reflected as he inched along the bough he had chosen that he already knew that carthell abbey was both with luck they could come and go and never leave a sign that they had been here they took their time no point in hurrying and possibly giving themselves away with an unusual sound or worse still a fall kestrel straddled the bough he had chosen lying on his stomach and pulling himself along with both hands while both legs remained wrapped around it if he lost his grip he would still be held by his legs gwyna was behind him he hoped she had chosen a similarly safe way to cross excitement warmed him now they were filially doing something it felt good after all this time of simply sitting back and watching things happen the bulwark of the wall lay below himthen behind him if this had been summer this would have been a bad place to come in for the soft ground would have betrayed him by holding his footprints but the ground was rockhard and any tracks he left in the frost would be gone with the first morning light bits of bark caught in his sweater and the bough sank towards the ground good that meant less of a drop but now he would have to carefully gauge the strength of the treelimb he was on if he went too far he was in danger of snapping it the limb creaked a little as it bentthen it came to rest on the top of the wall enough it wasnt going to get any better than this he clung with his hands and slowly lowered his legs until he was hanging from the limb then let go flexing his knees for the fall he landed on turned earth a tumble of frozen clods that made footing uncertain and gave him a bad moment as his ankle started to twist but he managed to save himself by flailing his arms for balance and a moment later gwyna landed beside him he tapped her on the shoulder she followed him to the building where they crouched in shadow for a moment listening intently nothing all was silent there were some advantages he reflected to trying to break into a building in a place where there were treekies at night no such place would ever have guard dogs or sentinel geese the treekies would happily make a meal of them this was probably the kitchen garden the rear door into the kitchen itself would be to his right but he didnt want that doorfor as he had told gwyna the kitchen might well have a guard on it he wanted a side door preferably one that led into a meditation garden he went to the left with robin following he left one hand on the wall to guide him and tried to feel how the ground changed under his feet here in the kitchengarden it would be gravel between the plots and the building once he reached the meditation gardens the gravel should give way to grassy lawn from time to time his hand encountered the frame of a window when that happened he warned robin and crouched down below the level of the sill crawling on hands and knees to get past it all it would take would be one sleepless brother staring out at the stars and seeing a manshaped shadow pass between him and them and it would all be over finally his foot encountered grass thick welltended grass by the feel of it in the summer it must be like a plush carpet very difficult to achieve and maintain that effect now he knew what the poor novices here spent their disciplinary time doing praying and weeding praying the weeds dont come back he smiled a little but it was a smile without humor what need had an abbey for a lawn like that he wondered if the surly brother pierce was permitted to walk in this garden such a lawn would make a barefoot penance into a sensual pleasure two more windowsthen his hand encountered a frame that did not mark a window but a doorway exactly the place he wanted the door was unlocked and swung open at a touch without the creaking that the kitchen door would likely have emitted a tiny vigillamp burned beside it on the inside wall he slipped inside robin followed and they closed the door lest a draft give them away this doorway gave out on a short hall they followed it to the end where it intersected with a much larger hall he thought for a moment trying out the pattern of most abbeys in his mind the library was always next to the scriptorium where the manuscripts and books were copied the scriptorium needed very good light which generally meant a southern exposure the library demanded much less lest the manuscripts fade he thought that the wall they had come in on faced south there were two doors to the left none to the right he went left and opened the one to the room that had an outside wall the smell told him it was the scriptorium wet ink and paint drying so the room across the hallway should be the library he tried the door it was locked he smiled to himself in great satisfaction he knew from all his other clandestine forays that if the library was locked it would definitely not be not guarded or watched locked because every library had some forbidden work in it that the novices spent their entire novitiate trying to get at to read but it would not be guarded because of course novices would not dare to remove the treasured tome lest they be caught with it in their possession but the locks of libraries as he had reason to know were built to impress not for efficiency gwyna might be skilled at picking pockets but he was a master of library locks it was a matter of heartbeats with the help of a long slender wire and a bit of wood the lock fell open and the door swung inward to his relief there were more of those tiny vigillamps burning here they would not have to work blind as gwyna closed the door behind him softly he studied the bookshelves and suddenly realized with dismay that he had no idea where in all of this to start there were hundreds of books in here not the mere two or three dozen he had expected bookshelves filled the room reaching from floor to ceiling and all of the shelves were full if they were cataloged in any way he didnt know what it was the key to all this probably resided in the librarians head as he gazed at the wealth of books in an agony of despair he shoved his hands down into the pockets of his breechesand encountered a small hard lump wrapped in silk the pendant in a heartbeat talaysens lessons on the laws of magic flashed into his mind what once was one is always connected things that are related are connected things that are similar are connected it was the second law that he needed to use now things that were related were connected and under the proper circumstances they would attract or resonate with each other since the pendant had something to do with the ghost it followed that the pendant could lead him to something else that related to the ghost he hoped as gwyna watched him curiously he took the pendant out of its silk wrapping wincing a little at the discordant music and held it in his hands tuning his mind to find more of the same music there was music of various sorts all around him many many of these volumes had something to do with magic some of it was pleasant some absolutely entrancing the kind he could get lost inside for hours but he didnt have hours and he wasnt looking for anything pleasant then he heard it a thin evil trickle that could not by any stretch of the imagination be called a melody a discordance of which the pendant was only a small part he turned and followed it it led him to a panel on the back wall to one side of one of the enormous bookcases it was a panel like many others in the room but when he tapped it slightly he thought it sounded hollow the only trouble was he couldnt open it he tried everything he could think of pressed anything that looked like it might be a release and all to no avail gwyna took her turn at it but her skill was not in this and she was no more successful than he was he was about to make another attempt this time at forcing the panel open when he felt a presence behind him he turned gwyna whirled at the same instant brother reymond stared at them in dumb shock his mouth agape with surprise robin didnt wait to see what hed do she muffled his mouth with both hands as kestrel grabbed his arms together they wrestled him around and stuffed him in a corner he looked at her she looked back at him now what she mouthed at him he shrugged we ttry to convince him he whispered back then looked into the frightened eyes of the brother robin only rolled her eyes skyward and tightened her hold on brother reymonds mouth afterwards jonny wasnt certain how long it took him to convince reymond simply to stay quiet until he had heard them out it felt like forever and he was certain that robins arms were aching with strain by the time reymond nodded a frightened agreement things went a little faster after that she told him in detail about the skull hill ghost and the curious exception he had insisted on making to his promise then kestrel told him about padrik and his healing services reymonds eyes grew larger and larger the more they spoke but his mouth betrayed not fear but dismay when robin related her little stay with the patsonos his brows drew together in angerbut when kestrel finally told him about the demonsummoning and the fate of orlina woolwright he could hardly contain his agitation dear and gracious god he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper when they were done i never thoughti didnt want to thinkbut this explains all those visitors to the abbot the ones who seem to be in a trance and who disappear never to be seen again they all wear pendants like that onehe indicated the wroughtiron pendant in kestrels handand that alone would convince me that you are telling the truth but i have learned other things since you were last here like what robin asked harshly as his voice trailed off he flushed with shame about your ghost he said unhappily i have found manuscripts that told me he was bound there by the first abbot some fifty years ago or so i also learned that there are other manuscripts that would tell me more much more if only we could find them what do you mean robin asked her face puzzled are they lost were they taken away he shook his head growing more and more distracted with every word no they were hidden somewhere in this library but i cannot for the life of me find them and i have been trying jonny cleared his throat very delicately and brother reymond started ccould they bbe bbehind this ppanel he asked touching the offending bit of wood brother reymond looked at the panel curiouslythen suddenly lost all his color he reached out with trembling fingers and did something complicated among the carvings the panel swung open behind it was a deep recess in the recess was a bound manuscript they all reached for it at the same time but brother reymonds reach was longer and he got it first he removed it from the recess hands shakingbut he did not hold it as if it was something precious but as if it was something vile that he did not wish to contaminate them with he took it to a reading stand and lit the lamp from one of the vigillights as the steady flame illuminated his face he began to read scanning the contents quickly this is what i was looking for he whispered this is the journal of the first abbot of carthell he was a mage as well as abbot but he had been rejected as a justiciar and the rejection made him an angry and bitter man he saw this appointment as an exilei have read his first journals and they are full of bile in the guise of piety he turned away robin moved belatedly to stop him but he was only relocking the door now we will not be disturbed he said there may be some other restless souls abroad tonight he returned to the manuscript and scanned a little further ah here it is i have uncovered a new spell one that will bind the spirit of a being to a particular place and make it to do the will of the binder there thats what we were looking for i must have a living being for this for the spell will not work on the dead not even the newly dead dear and blessed god he is contemplating murder here there are many travelers upon this road who are not human i mean to use one of those it would indeed be a grave and mortal sin to kill a human but these monsters and monstrosities are beyond the church pale and law and therefore it is no murder to do one to death reymond was so white that kestrel feared he might faint at any moment but his voice was strong enough as he turned the pages here is the spell itselfno i shall not read it i had rather burn it here he selects his victim i have succeeded my spell has worked beyond the wildest of my dreams i drugged the creatures food and carried him out to bare hill upon my own donkey there i wrought the spell which slew and bound him all at onceand the spirit arose a hundred times morepowerful and deadly than the monster had been alive reymonds eyes flickered across the pages as his voice filled with agony here he tells how the ghost he created killed at his command destroying sinners he sent to it for penance here he tells how it also began to kill anyone who dared to cross its hill after sundown look here is the list of victims that the abbot sentand here the list of those who died accidentally one of them is the priest of westhaven who tried to banish the poor creature and he saysoh monstrous horrible horrible now his voice broke and he buried his face in his hands for a moment kestrel dared to place a hand on his shoulder trying to offer some sort of wordless comfort reymonds shoulders shook and when he removed his hands his face was wet with tears but his voice was strong again this fiend wrote here in his own hand that he told the priest only some things were better left to the hand of god and the priest ignored his warning his warning that was no warningthat was not even an attempt at a warning this man was a monster a demon in human guise he shook his head violently and to not only leave that abomination in place but to continue to use it this is not the church i joined these are not the deeds of a good and godloving man this man was a monster of the basest sort and the current abbot is no better cloaking his crimes using what the other created robin broke the silence that followed his outburst was padrik educated here she asked quietly reymond nodded we thought it a matter of pride that he should rise to be high bishop he whispered brokenly and now i find it to be not a cause for pride and rejoicing but for shame my people have a proverb that two bad grapes dont mean all grapes are badbut two spoiled grapes contaminate the whole bunch robin told him he and the abbot together are doing terrible things in gradford and if they are not stopped those terrible things will spread reymonds back straightened and his expression went from horrified to determined we must put this right the three of us he said finally and firmly i am not a mage myself but i have studied magic in the course of my work for some time i may be able to free this poor spiriti must study the binding spell vile as it is if there is a physical link i need only break it to break the binding spell if the spell can be broken at all i can do so within the next two days i can wait here for those who padrik may send and free them once they reach the hill by taking their pendants as you took orlinas and if i can i will go with further victims to the justiciars at kingsford lay this before them and ask them to deal with padrik kestrel silently applauded the mans couragehe knew that the ghost had killed dozens of people and yet he was willing to dare its anger to free it and then not content with that alone he would go petition the justiciars as well a long and uncomfortable journey in the heart of winter his regard for reymond rose and he tried to put his admiration into his eyes for he knew that his words alone would not convey it poor and limping as they were now this was a man of the church who could restore his faith in the churchs honor yyou are a ggood man bbrother rreymond he said warmly as ggoodas the ffirst abbot was evil reymond blushed and smiled shyly thank you for those kind but inaccurate words he said softly i dont know if anyone could be good enough to counteract this evil ddont ever bbelieve that please eever robin had gone into the scriptorium for pen and paper when reymond made his declaration she had been scribbling furiously ever since now she blew on the ink to dry it folded the note and handed it to brother reymond give this to the first gypsy you see on the road and tell him it has to get to a gypsy named peregrine immediately she told him ive left notes in other places for him but you may be my fastest courier when he reads it hell deal with the clan that is helping padrik with his frauds reymond nodded gravely and put the note carefully inside the pouch hanging on his belt beside the keys to the library and what of you he asked faltering just a little he clearly wanted to hear them say they intended to do something but he also was obviously afraid that they werent going to robin smiled a smile that dazzled the poor man were going to do the obvious she said simply an abrupt turnaround from her earlier attitude that took kestrel completely by surprise and left him openmouthed with amazement were going back to gradford to see if we cant expose him as a fraud without getting ourselves thrown in gaol or hung if you can free the ghost thats the least we can do reymond blinked and well he might that was a tall task for anyone can you do that he asked robin shrugged we can try she replied jonny grinned with a combination of relief and approval that made him want to cheer one ththing wwe ccan do he said is mmake sure as mmany ppeople as ppossible learn ppadrik is pplaying ttricks and wwe ccan pprove it by sshowing that anyone can ddo them oh now that is an excellent idea brother reymond applauded thats probably one reason why hes forbidden public entertainment robin mused if some sleightofhand artist duplicates one of his miracles people are going to start wondering out loud she frowned at that its a pity we couldnt arrange a show hhe mmay have fforbidden ppublic entertainment kestrel said slowly bbut he cant sstop ppeople from ddoing a ttrick or two tto amuse ththeir ffriends in ppublic robin visibly brightened and snapped her fingers now there is an idea and by the time any constable gets there well the party has broken up and theres no one to arrest i can think of a lot of people who would like to be in on that plan so can i jonny thought remembering ardanas girls and wondering if any of the unofficial houses would welcome a trickster as entertainment instead of a musician for that matter a party made up of a few of the young ladies and their favorites could well wander the inns every couple of nights or better yet every couple of afternoons so the ladies would not be losing any income with all the lovely ladies in such a party eyes would naturally be drawn to it and when someone offered to do a trick for the amusement of the group oh yes that would work very well indeed very well he was so lost in his own musings that he missed part of what robin was saying well leave at dawn and we should reach gradford in a few days she was saying to reymond i know where we can leave the wagon so we arent recognized coming in a second time and i will do my part as soon as i believe i have mastered the binding spell reymond said solemnly that will be two days at the most i will work this release by daylight i am not brave enough to face your deadly spirit by night then he blinked you are braver than i friends the only foe i face is one who will likely help me if he can when he learns my task you face an entire city i wouldnt place any money on the odds of the ghost helping you kestrel thought and shrugged ththat mmany ppeople ccan work against each other he only observed may it be so brother reymond said making the words into a benediction go with the blessing of god my friends i shall see you to the kitchen gate no one will question my walking about so late thank you brother reymond robin said then grinned from a good heart the blessing of your god is worth a thousand from anyone elseand i have the uneasy feeling were going to need all the blessings we can get chapter seventeen this place is worse than it was when we left robin muttered under her breath as they waited in line at the city gate for a constable to get to them and i didnt think that was possible there was one advantage to returning to a city you knew something about you also knew where things were and the best way to disguise yourself as harmless they had entered this time with a crowd of farmfolk carrying simple packs the wagon and horses had been left at the inn along with most of their possessions it had been a long time nearly six months since robin had been forced to walk to get where she wanted to go and shed forgotten what a luxury it was to ride now her legs and back ached and so did her arms the last part of the journey taking the switchback road up to the gates of gradford had nearly done her in but the shock of seeing the changes in the city they had left only a few days ago was enough to make her forget her aching legs it started at the gates they were informed as they entered that their packs were going to be searched for unspecified contraband robin suspected that contraband included money and was very glad that she and kestrel had hidden the horde of coins they had brought with them in the hems of her drab skirts and petticoats that was where they had hidden the silkwrapped pendant as well it was a good thing they had taken that precaution as it turned out even the clothing in their packs underwent an examination one woman was found to have a pair of breeches in her bag and was informed that decent women are to be clothed decently in gradford the guard gave her a long lecture on what a decent woman was and was notand that if she were found dressing against her sex she would be thrown in the stocks for it the poor woman was in tears before he had finished with her she was a simple farmwife here to see the great high bishop and visit a sister who had just given birth and it had never occurred to her that the wearing of breeches to do the heavy chores could possibly be considered immoral by anyones standards well she wasnt alone it hadnt occurred to robin either now she was very glad that she had left her breeches in the wagon she was even gladder that they had left the wagonnearby a simple farmcart had been stripped down to the bed in a search for contraband and she did not even want to think what kind of inspection their wagon would have gone through but these guards were oddly reticent about touching women although that reticence did not extend to their baggage they never even laid a finger to her sleeve they shied away from her as if simple contact might contaminate them fortunately this very prudery concerning women kept them from searching robin as they did kestrel he submitted to the humiliating search with a bored look on his face and they found nothing more incriminating than a handful of mintak copper coins which were confiscated for bearing the images of nonhumans upon them portraits of unbelievers they were called to be fair they did give him a chit for the supposed value of the coins which could be redeemed at the cathedral which they did not intend to do for the guard made it very clear that only those whose piety was in doubt would do such a thing the rest would consider their lost coins a donation to the church so much for the honest men of gradford robin wondered how that particular guard the one who had refused a gift of a godstar was doing now did actions like these bother himor had he been persuaded like the rest of them as they waited for the endless questions and inspections to be over robin watched the street of the inns beyond this guardpost there were guards and constables everywhere one was posted at the entrance to every inn taking down the names of everyone who came to stay there the street preachers had real podiums now erected beneath the street lamps from which to harangue the passersby there were rules now endless rules so many they made robins head swim then ache things that could not be worn eaten drunk said or done and they were informed that there was something called a curfew that once the bell had rung from the cathedral signaling that sixte was over they had one hour to get inside after that only folk with emergencies or official passes had leave to be on the streets public gatherings were prohibited public parties were prohibited gathering in an inn for the purpose of idleness was forbidden only those living in an inn were permitted to eat and drink in the inn strong drink was prohibited as were gambling and music except in that special house that padrik owns and women must not be forward must always be modest and unassuming in word deedand thought there were more rules about the proper conduct for a woman robin let them all wash over her without really noting them if she did take note she knew she would become so enraged she would give herself away forewarned by the lecture to that poor hapless farm woman robin let jonny do all the talking which he did in very slow monosyllables constantly pulling on his forelock and mumbling yessir and nossir their story was as simple as his words he was jon brede she was jen brede they farmed their purpose in coming to gradford same as them jonny said nodding at the rest of the group visit the cathedral not a lie not at all only a tiny part of the truth there was another new innovationa little piece of pasteboard with their name occupation reason for visit date of entry and description written on it she and jonny made no pretense of being able to read or write and made a pair of marksa scythe for him a flower for herwhere they were required to sign these papers besides the physical description robins said she was meek and wifely jonnys described him as simpleton it was not very difficult to keep her face straight she was so knotted with tension she could not have smiled if she wanted to probably they would have to present these papers anytime anyone demanded to see them people in authority would know where they stayed where they ate what they did had it only been a week since they left what could have happened in the interim they made their way down the street of the inns but robin had absolutely no intention of staying here not with guards at every doorand if they were only farmers there would be questions about where they had gotten the money to stay in a good inn there couldnt be guards everywhere that wouldnt be feasible only people with good money would come herepoorer folk went elsewhere and padrik would have no real interest in poorer folk this was where the knowledge gleaned from their previous visit was invaluable they did not have to search for lodging they knew where to go elsewhere was all the way across the city in a section not far from the warren a place robin had noted against future need inns there sold sleeping space on the floor of the common room they would have two or three large chambers above where people would sleep in rows of cots and perhaps four or six tiny chambers hardly larger than closets for those who wished a little more privacy their coins would go a long way in this section of gradford all things considered though it was a good thing that their silver all bore the stamp of the king and not of any nonhumans otherwise those coins would go straight to the coffers of the church robin rather doubted that anyone in this town would accept a coin with the nonhuman stamp her stomach was already in knots and she had the feeling that things were going to get a lot worse they had to cross the cathedral square in order to get there it appeared that padrik had decided that business was too good for the small merchants who had been setting up there there were small stalls set up facing the cathedral selling the same merchandise as before but they were all manned by young men in novices robes there was even a stall selling godstars both the pendants and the walldecorations but robin noted that the workmanship was distinctly inferior and from what she could see so were the materials a small victory and a petty one but this was the only bright spot so far i guess the licenses werent enough for him she said in a low voice after a quick glance around showed no one close enough to overhear a careful conversation aye kestrel replied sardonically llook at the hhouses ththough something about the square had struck her as odd though she couldnt put a finger on just what was different about it but once he said that she took a closer look at the fine mansions that faced the cathedral the outsides looked the same as beforebut the windows were black and empty it was getting dark and there should have been lights in those windows curtains across them there was nothing and there was no sign of life about them only bare blank windows like the empty eyes of a madman staring at the cathedral theyre deserted she exclaimed keeping her voice to a surprised whisper my gguess jonny confirmed she could only wonder why had their wealthy owners decided that what had happened to orlina could all too easily happen to them and cut down on their households and visibilityor had they decided that gradford itself was no longer a healthy place for them and gone off elsewhere or had padrik decided that where orlina had gone others could follow were the prisons full of other heretics waiting to receive their own pendants if so padrik was going to get a big surprise eventually when all of them surfaced to testify against him in kingsford always providing of course that the justiciars at kingsford did not consider high bishop padrik too dangerous a man to cross robin was glad to be out of sight of the cathedral and away from a place where so many guards and constables were patrolling the far shabbier quarter where they found themselves had fewer figures of authority in itand even the street preachers were the kind they were familiar with the disheveled illkempt nearlunatics they found the class of inn they were looking for as full night descended and the lamplighters made their rounds giving the street preachers light to see and be seen by it was small nondescript with the barrel that signified an inn hanging over the door in a building flanked by a shop and a laundry both of those were for a miracle still open robin stopped in the shop long enough to buy candles sausage cheese and bread and despite jonnys obvious nervousness and impatience went to the laundry as well for a spirited bargaining session it was nice to do something as normal as bargain for a moment she was able to forget her tension and stop watching over her shoulder for church guards when she came out she had several old but clean blankets folded over her arm and it was obvious from jonnys expression that he did not understand why she had bought them if they give us any bedding in here its not going to be much and itll be full of fleas she said very quietly this is stuff that was sent to be cleaned but never picked up we can get clothing that way too thats why i wasnt worried when we didnt have much appropriate clothing well be able to buy things that already look worn not new his eyebrows rose and he nodded shortly they went in the common room had a bare earthen floor pounded hard and covered with rushes with the only light coming from the fireplace at one end that fireplace evidently served as the rude kitchen as well since there was a large pot of something hanging over it that smelled strongly of cabbage and a stack of bowls over the mantle furnished with crude trestletables and benches that had seen a great deal of hard use it held two or three dozen people who looked to be the same class of farming folk that gwyna and jonny pretended to be as robin had expected there were no guards at the door here but the innkeeper perused their papers reading slowly and painfully with his finger under each line and his mouth moving as he spelled out the words then he required them to make their marks in a book copying their names beside the marks before he would rent them their room a scrawny boy summoned from his station beside the fireplace led them to it it lay on the third floor at the top of a steep and rickety stairway in a narrow corridor with seven other rooms and was lit with a single lamp the lamp did not give off much light which was probably just as well robin wasnt certain she wanted to see just how derelict the place was they were allotted one tiny stump of a candle for light given to them by the boy who flung open the door and vanished after shoving the candle end at kestrel the room was barely large enough for the bed as robin had expected it was nothing more than a thin mattress on a wooden platform jonny lit the candle stub at the lamp in the hall and stuck it on top of a smear of waxy drips on a small shelf by the door robin closed the door and looked around in the better light from the candle it seemed that her worst fears had been groundless the place was clean the thin pallet held no fleas or bedbugs the floor wasnt dirty just so worn that there wasnt even a hint of wax or varnish and gray with age and use there was one window large enough to climb out of that was good if they ever had to make an unconventional exit she dropped her pile of blankets on the bed and opened the shuttersthere was of course no glass in the window itself the window overlooked a roof and a bit of the alley in back of the inn a raingutter ran beside it up to the roof and the roof of the laundry was just below she smiled tautly in satisfaction curfew or no curfew here was a way to come and go at night without being seen she closed the shutters again and turned back to jonny it isnt the singing bird she said apologetically its also nnot ththe ggaol or a ddry sspot under a bbridge he replied and it sseems cclean very true she bent down for the blankets but he beat her to them unfolding them deftly and helping her make up the bed well have to take everything with us whenever we go out openly she told him or it likely wont be here when we come back he turned to pull the latchstring in barring the door to anyone who wasnt willing to break it down i ttake it wwe wwont bbe ddoing a llot of ththat probably not she spread out her purchases on the bed the food here is going to be pretty dreadful thats why i bought all this since neither of us can afford to be laid up with a flux and cramps wed better buy our dinners elsewhere they tend to buy rather dubious foodstuffs for these places well look at the candle they buy these stubs in lots from the cathedral and the homes of the rich who wont burn a candle down to the end the foodll be like that there wont be any facilities here other than a privy in the alley the laundry has a bathing room we can rent she sliced up bread while jonny dealt with the cheese and sausage one of us should stay in the room when the other leaves officially that probably ought to be you he nodded bbetween ththis ststutter and ththe ffact ththat you mmight nnot bbe ssafe here alone i ththink youre rright jjust ddont let any ppatsonos sspot you she winced but he had a perfect right to remind her of that and a few weeks agoi would have been angry that he had now it simply seems practical right well it looks as if our plans just got thrown right out we cant take pleasure parties around to the inns doing magic tricks and im not sure that any of the houses are still in operation except in the warren itself she frowned with thought ill have to go in the warren and start spreading the word about how padrik actually works his miracles maybe the people in there can do something ill start with donnar and see if theres anywhere i can go from there he ate several bites before replyingand as their candlestub threatened to flicker out took one of the new candles and lit it from the last flame of the old pushing the unlit end down into the melted wax from the stub i ddont llike you ggoing in ththere alone bbut ththeres nno chchoice then he smiled shyly bbesides youre pprobably more ccompetent in there ththan mme she glowed briefly with pleasure at his words but then sighed and ate a piece of cheese pensively i only hope we arent too late to do anything at all donnar was willing to see her but as she shared a jug and a plate of fried doughbits with him he listened to her brief explanation and shook his head yere too late donnar said flatly theres not a thing ye can do now she glanced around his establishment which was only halffull the customers drank with one eye on their liquor and one on the door the guards and constables had not yet cleaned up the warren but rumor had it that they were getting ready to do so and those rumors had every petty thief and freelance whore jumping at shadows no one had molested robin in any way on her way in no one had any time to worry about one small drab female when there was so much more threat from other sources what happened she asked feeling desperation creeping into her voice has everyone here gone mad donnar shook his head yed think so he sighed padriks got the mayor an the whole damn council in is pocket couple three days ago all of a sudden like comes all these new rulesan all these new guards an constables tenforce em an the mayor an council just back em right up padrik musta been plannin on this fer a while mosta these clods aint from gradford i heard they been in trainin since summer off on church land somewheres but whether thats true he shrugged i dunno where th copper came thire em but id bet its from church coffers an not the towns so even if i could tell you not only how padrik does all his miracles but who showed him how it wouldnt do any good she asked tension and fear putting an edge to her words how could this have happened never for a moment had she thought that there would be nothing they could do donnar stared at her for a moment then said slowly evrone in th warren is a lawbreaker either he started out like that or th church an th law forced im into it whos gonna listen to us he had a point and she stared at her mug utterly deflated and all in a single moment no one she replied dully he nodded thas bout the size of it hes got evthing but th warren an now theres rumors hes gonna take it too i dunno if padriks really gonna clean up th warren or not thing is i kin think f one way he could do it if he didn give a fat damn what happened tnobody an didn have th men t do th job she stared across the table at him how she whispered rather certain that she was not going to care for the answer she didnt burn it down he replied succinctly and a chill left her frozen in her place an thas why im leavin soons i can tomorrow mebbe next day at th latest out through the back door what i tol you about the back door was a way out of the city via the sewers only the desperate took it but it did avoid the guards at the gates who were stopping not only those going into gradford but those trying to leave if things had gotten bad enough that donnar was going to take the back door out then they were bad indeed and the average citizen is probably pleased with all the new constables to guard him and his propertyso pleased he doesnt realize hes been locked into a prison he cant escape she thanked him in a daze and went back out into the street she still had a few errands to run things to buy like a couple of sets of lock picks she hadnt wanted to bring any into the city there was only so much she could fit into the hems of her clothing but there was certainly a locksmith here in the warren and in the warren he wouldnt be selling just locks hed be selling the means to open them it took her a while to find the man she wanted but for once in gradford her sex worked for her in convincing him that she was not an agent of the guard or constables apparently no woman would ever be considered by padriks people for any important job the lock picks were expensive but some of the finest she had ever seenand if it turned out that they needed them they would have been worth any price those she hid under more prosaic purchases of food and drinkas she had expected the food in the inn was dreadful and the beer was worse awful beer to start with now gone flat and stale while she walked back to their inn donnars last words kept coming back to haunt her he was right if padrik didnt care about how much damage was wrought or how many people died that would be the easiest perhaps the only way to cleanse the warren all he had to do would be to set guards in the streets to arrest anyone boiling out of the district then set fire to buildings in a ring around it with real mages working with him the fire could probably be confined to the warren and perhaps a few buildings nearby padrik could even have the fire set accidentally and the guards stationed there coincidentally or for that matter he could have one of the mages create that cathedraltall angel and this time give it a sword of flame and make it appear that the sacrificed god himself had set the blaze going and the average citizen would think him a hero for clearing out all the criminals it wont occur to the people that the same weapon could be used to threaten his home his family if he ever opposes padrik she shivered inside her shabby warm coat padrik had already proved many times over that he cared for nothing except the path to power she could only hope this scheme had not yet occurred to him that he was whipping up a state of panic in the warren by spreading rumors with no substance behind them and meanwhile now that their best plan for uncovering the high bishops fraud had gone awry she and jonny would have to think of something else there had to be something some solution there was always something else that you could do wasnt there in the next several days they spent most of their time in their room trying to think of that something else in the meantime the rumors of the cleansing of the warren had not yet come true but the cathedraltall angel put in his appearance right on schedule neither of them was there to see it but while the vision had many people who had seen it speaking of it in awe there were some who were just a trifle less than enthusiastic this was the first time that robin had ever heard padriks devotees speak of him and his works with a little less than full enthusiasm and belief evidently padrik had overstepped himself this time for the angel only called to mind other illusions that these folk had seen put on for the purposes of spectacle at festivals and other citywide celebrations and when they were asked to describe what it had looked like they told the tale in just those terms kinda like that red an green dragon th mayor had conjured up fer the midwinter faire ten fifteen years ago one grizzled oldster said in answer to gwynas questions yah thats what it was like like that big ol dragon ye could see through it ye know an it didn seem t see anythin just smiled an waved its wings lazylike contributions to the hospicefund were reported to be disappointing although attendance at the healing services remained high but gwyna took a little more heart if people would only start to think instead of simply following along like so many sheep there was no sign of whether or not brother reymond had managed to free the ghost but then there probably wouldnt be the spirit had no interest in staying around after all in all probability the only interest it had was in getting rid of the men who had kept it bound all this time the abbot and padrikthe former was within reach but how would the ghost know how to reach the latter if robin had learned anything on skull hill that night it was that the spirit bound there was a great believer in expediency as well as revenge by now hes gone she thought more than once but with only a feeling of relief for even if padrik was sending poor victims outbound with spellladen pendants reymond was waiting at the other end of the road to free them she decided that it was time that the two of them started attending the healing services again perhaps if they studied what was going on they could get some notion of how to disrupt one of the services hopefully without getting arrested afterwardsthey wouldnt do any good stuck in a cell after all jonny agreed im ggetting ttired of sitting around hhere ddoing nnothing he told her at lleast if wwe ggo wwatch wwell bbe ttrying so they tucked all their belongings into their packs wearing what wouldnt fit and rolled up the blankets and tied them atop the whole the cathedral was not heatedit would have cost more than even the church had to heat such a huge stone barn in the dead of winter they would be glad of the extra clothing before the service was over gwyna put the lock picks where she could get at them quickly just in casein a pocket in the side of one of her boots jonny slipped the silkwrapped pendant into his own pocket they set off for the cathedral joining a growing stream of people who trickled out of the inns and hostels along this street with their belongings on their backs but they had the advantage of knowing the way and knowing where to go when they got there they beat most of the crowd to the cathedral itself and wormed their way very near the front by working along the side wall coincidentally enough they found themselves in their old places beneath the benevolent eye of saint hypatia gwyna took that for a good omen jonny had told her that hypatia was the patron saint of knowledge and of truthseekers maybe shed look kindly on their current task we can certainly use any blessings we can get she recalled uneasily as she and jonny took their places on either side of the saints pedestal although they didnt plan on doing anything tonight she was still nervous and distinctly jumpy she kept looking out of the corner of her eye at their neighbors were there patsonos who could recognize her nearby or guards that would take exception to the way they acted there was a large draped object on the platform near the altar very bulky and covered with a heavy dark cloth robin wondered what it was some new construction perhaps a new pulpit for padrik to speak from it was bigger than the old one perhaps the old one wasnt grand enough anymore finally after every last bit of space had been filled by an eager observer padrik made his usual dramatic appearance from behind the altar resplendent in his white robes with an even bigger train of priests following along behind than hed had before and even though it was not appropriate for a holy service the assembled crowd began cheering and applauding as soon as he appeared they behaved more as if he was some sort of popular entertainer perhaps deep down inside some of them did realize that was all he really was a showman a fraud he smiled graciously nodding his thanksand long past the time when he should have tried to quell the outburst he finally raised his hands for silence he got it the cheers cut off immediately leaving only the echoes of voices playing among the spires my friends he said his beautiful voice making a melody of his words my children in godi can see that there are no doubters among you this day which only proves hes not infallible robin thought wryly and that he cant read minds no matter what other magic hes using didnt find us and were doubters for sure that was something of a relief anyway padriks smile faded replaced by an expression of deep sorrow i have heard rumors thoughterrible rumors there are stories in the town that the vision of the hospice angel was no vision at alland that if the angel is an illusion then so are all the rest of the miracles you have witnessed here this grieves me deeply more deeply than i can express robin kept her face stonystill but she was astonished that he would have brought the subject up at all much less addressed it so directly the crowd began to murmur uneasily and with the same surprise as robin padrik continued to look out at them gently benevolently oh do not deny that you have heard those rumorsand perhaps have been tempted to believe them but i say unto you that not only are those tales the basest of lies but the temptation to believe them was indeed a temptation a snare set by dark forces to lead you into disbelief there are those out there among the unbelievers who only wish to spread dissension and lies so that the truth will be obscured there are those who would wish you to think that what is truth is a lie and lies are truth his voice rose just a little and today i have the means to show you the agent of those rumors he gave no sign that robin could see but suddenly the heavy drapery fell away from the construction near the altarand it was not a new bit of building at all it was a cage a hangingcage to be precise with a loop on the peak of its domed top clearly meant to receive a hook spaced around the cage were iron loops where bindings could easily be attached and manacles and closedhooks already hung from them there was something inside the cage huddled on the floor one of the guards prodded it to stand with the butt of his spear and as it did so both gwyna and jonny stifled gasps of recognition it was tfyrr robins heart stopped and kestrel went completely white never in their worst nightmares could they have imagined this this vile creature this halfdemon was sent to spy upon the godly people of gradford and to lead them astray with false tales and rumors padrik proclaimed as tfyrr pulled himself up to his full height and glared at him through the bars of the cage his beak had been clamped shut with some iron and leather contraption he looked halfstarved he was sent by the evil and decadent deliambrens who seek to destroy us and all humankind to make us into their pets and slaves for their lusts and their amusementsand here is the proof one of the guards brought out a couple of bewilderedlooking rustics who twisted their hats in their hands and said yes that they had seen this birdman with a deliambren oh they knew it was a deliambren theyd seen the fellow before and besides only a deliambren would have such a mucking great wagon with all manner of strange things hung on it theyd seen the two talkingand then the birdman had flown off padrik nodded wisely and cut the last one short the priests hustled the puzzled men out discreetly as padrik turned back to his audience so you see he called in stentorian tones those honest toilers of the earth would not lienor would they produce such things out of their fantasies but this creature is not only a halfdemon himself he is a mage a mage of dark and terrible evil and look cried someone in the audience pointing at tfyrrs cage a demon appeared in a puff of black smoke a demon that looked a great deal like tfyrr it shot a bolt of red lightning at the lock on the cage door as if trying to free the haspurthough why it would do so now in full view of hundreds of people did not make any logical sense but then these people were not thinking logically tfyrr didnt move didnt flinch robin wondered if perhaps he couldnt see the illusion if it was meant for the eyes of those in the congregation alone but the demon only got off the one shot padrik whirled in an artistic swirl of white robes that made part of his costume stand away from him for a moment like a pair of great white wings unfurled he raised his staff of office over his head and a beam of light shot from the top of it to strike the demon who vanished without even a pop the cheapest illusion there is done with mirrors for heavens sake you dont even need any magic to pull it off only good for a few secondsthe type of illusion that anyone with any experience has seen at a dozen big fairesbut this lot is eating it up you see padrik exclaimed you see how he summons his evil minions to aid him but they are not proof against the power of the sacrificed god there were shouts now of kill him and destroy the beast robin went cold with fear they had to get to tfyrr to free himbut how could they get past a mob in a killing mood but padrik held up his hands and the crowd calmed instantly we are not animals we are not monsters to tear apart our enemies in the heat of anger he proclaimed as robin added nausea to her fear the power of god is sufficient to hold this evil vile creature in his bonds nor shall we permit him to disrupt the work we are truly here for gods own work of healing we brought him here only that you might see the true face of your enemies and know them for what they are ggive me one of your ppicksets kestrel whispered under cover of the speech i ththink i can gget ththem tto him and then what she thoughtbut she handed him the set of lock picks anyway he slipped off into the crowd and if she hadnt seen him vanish she wouldnt have known he was even there in the first place while padrik continued to pummel the congregation with examples of his benevolence and the nonhumans perfidy she kept a watch on tfyrrs cage and in a moment she heard that little thread of melody that meant someone was using magic this was familiar enoughmagic meant to rivet the attention to the speaker and make his words seem the acme of truth she was ready for it and she was not caught like the rest padriks sermon had mesmerized his audience to the point that no one not even the guards was watching tfyrr and jonny had taken advantage of that hed taken advantage of something else too there was another thin thread of mental music weaving with padriks siren song free bard kestrel was invoking bardic magic dont look at me the song ordered dont see me im not here ignore me and since it not only didnt interfere with padriks spell it actually worked with the high bishops magic no one noticed it except her she added her power to his humming under her breath following that melody in her mind with a real melody meant to reinforce the magic once again if she hadnt been watching she would never have seen that shadow slipping among the statues of the saints the movement down near the floor as something was tossed into the bottom of the cage and tfyrrs quick bend to retrieve what had been thrown in as padrik wound down kestrel reappeared on the pedestal of saint hypatia looking as calm as if he had never been gone but he was breathing carefully hiding the fact that he had been exerting himself and he looked very very tired just about as tired as she felt he flashed her a quick glance and a hidden gesture of approval she gave him a strained and nervous smile in return well now tfyrr had lock picks hidden in his feathers whether or not he could use them was another story entirely whether he would get an opportunity to but padriks priests were assembling those in the crowd who felt in need of healingand with a quick glance and a nod they both slid down from the pedestal to crowd up a little further to the front she bit her lip as her mind accelerated through plan after plan shuffling bits of foolhardiness with honest fear wasnt there something they could do suddenly jonny grabbed her hand and whistled a soft phrase of melodythat of the skull hill ghost she stared at him in puzzlement for a moment completely baffled as he shook her hand with impatience and whistled the chorus then as if dawn had suddenly broken over her she knew what he was trying to tell her if the ghost was freeoh surely it was by nowit would be only too happy to see padrik again and if it was free well couldnt they call it theyd called an elf before just by thinking about bardic music and magic and wanting to have an elf answer them how could it hurt to try she nodded frantically and began to hum runes tune under her breath concentrating very very hard on how much she wanted the ghost of skull hill to appear right now faintly she heard kestrel do the same and as his melody joined hers the internal music that sang of the power of bardic magic took on life and strength the line to the altar was long but the two of them were so short that the priests might have mistaken them for children somehow they found themselves in the first rank when padrik began the first healing robins teeth chattered unexpectedly and the melody she hummed broke for a moment they hadnt expected to be up here oh nowhat am i supposed to be sick of she thought in a panic tfyrr momentarily forgotten what can i fake infertility maybe padrik had his hands on the head of a cripple one of the patsonos of course who stared up at him in carefully simulated admiration while the high bishop prayed and just as robin decided that infertility was probably a good choice every light in the cathedral suddenly blew out then the windows darkened abruptly as well plunging the interior of the cathedral into thick gloom there were screams from outside as padrik stopped in midsentence and looked up at the windows a most unsaintly expression of annoyance on his face what is going he began but before he could complete his sentence his final word was obliterated as a bolt of lightning struck the roof of the cathedral directly over his head the thunder that accompanied it flattened everyone to the floor glass shattered and showered the people with tiny slivers and specks robins eyes swam with tears of pain from the burst of light and she tried to blink away the spots obscuring her vision now there were people screaming inside the cathedral as well as outside but only the loudest could be heard above the ringing in everyones ears the thunderclap had caused the crowd surged towards the exit she stayed where she was trying to move in any direction at all could get them trampled something made her look up as soon as she was able to see anything at all the lightning had torn an enormous hole in the roof she glanced at padrik only to see that he was just as surprised as everyone else so this isnt one of his miracles is thiscould this be the ghost she hardly had time to do more than frame the thought in the next heartbeat a terrible chilling wind rushed in through the hole in the roof a wind that chilled the soul as well as the body and howled like all the nightmares that had ever walked herded together it formed into a whirlwind in front of the altar picking up bits of everything from within the cathedral and sucking them up into itself the debris began to glow with a spectral greenishwhite light and the whirlwind spun tighter faster forming a column oh dear gods ive seen this before and then into a manlike shape a shape that wore a deeply cowled robe a robe that had never contained anything like a human form but this time the shape was five times the height of a man and the posture of the ghost of skull hill said without any need for words that he was not happy and that he saw and recognized his enemy padrik made a hasty motion and a ring of fire sprang up around the ghost confining it momentarily at least robin couldnt hear anything above the screams but she saw padriks lips moving and she didnt think he was praying so he is a mage the ghost looked down at the ring of flames surrounding him and moved towards them but the bottom of his robes flared and flickered as he advanced the barrier held against him padriks expression brightened for a momentbut in the next instant the ghost made a gesture of his own and the whirlwind formed around him the wind whipped the flames and the flames thinned threatening to die away altogether padrik gestured again shouting now words and incantations that robin didnt understand but which hummed in the back of her head like a hive of poisonous wasps the flames rose up again with renewed strength the ghost spun his whirlwind faster still staring at padrik across the barrier of fire and wind his hatred a thing so real and palpable that it too was a weapon behind the more dramatic action tfyrr worked frantically at the lock of his cage with the lock picks kestrel had passed him robin noticed himat the same time as the only one of padriks guards to remain standing fast the guards mouth opened in a shout that simply could not be heard over the howling of the ghosts eldritch winds he ran towards the cage with the keys in his hands tfyrr looked up at the movement and froze dropping the picks before robin had blinked twice the guard had reached the cage and had put himself into tfyrrs reach tfyrrs taloned hand shot through the bars and grabbed the hapless guard by the throat plucking the keys from his hand and tossing him aside like a discarded doll in a moment the haspur had the cage unlocked and kicked open the door but the guard was not giving up on his responsibilities so lightly the guard rose to his feet drew a sword and charged the open cage door the haspur didnt even pause his eyes were red with hungermadness and he was quicker than she would ever have believed he slashed out with his clawed hands using them as his weapons before the man could even bring his blade up to guard position he caught the guard across the throat tearing it open with a single blow robin turned away sickened as blood sprayed across the white altarcloth and the man collapsed with a gurgling cry there was a thunder of wings and when she looked again it was to catch sight of tfyrr in flight vanishing up through the hole in the roof fighting the magicbrought winds a moment later and he was gone movement at her side caught her attention and she glanced back over at jonny just in time to see him rumble at his belt and drop the pendant he had carried out of his pocket along with a few coins it fell out of its silk handkerchief and onto the floor although there was so much noise that the sound it made hitting the marble was completely lost he snatched it up cocked his arm back and flung it with all of his might hitting padrik square in the chest it struck hard enough to distract padrik and broke the high bishops concentrationand it caught in all the gold embroidery decorating his robe becoming entangled there padrik froze in midgesture staring openmouthed down at his chest the ring of flames vanished blown out as easily as a candle and the ghost reached forward with a howl of triumph and seized padrik in both clawlike hands the sound of the ghosts laughter did notquitedrown out padriks screams blackness as thick as a moonless night descended on the cathedral and the crowd went utterly mad gwyna and jonny simply huddled on the floor for a moment then slowly crawled towards the altar hoping in that way to avoid being trampled but before they reached that haven light returned pouring through the shattered windows padrik was nowhere to be seen the screams died and robin looked up witches someone cried out in despair that evil creature slew the high bishop she saw the face of a nightmare a crowd ready to tear anything and anyone apart in sheer unadulterated panic in a moment they might very well remember seeing jonny fling that pendant at the high bishop theyd kill him and herand then do exactly what donnar had feared run wild through the streets looking for evil mages killing and burning theyd certainly run rampant through the warrenand if they found tfyrr theyd tear him to pieces too they werent going to listen to her youre a man she shouted at kestrel theyll listen to you say something stop them jonny knew the face of the mob when he saw it hed already had a taste of what they could do they were poised to actand someone had to give them direction or it would turn into hate fear and destruction someone had to say or do something before one of them pointed him out as the one whod broken padriks defenses and let the ghost through but him he could hardly say two words without stuttering fear held him paralyzed for a moment then in his mind he heard harperus you cant say it so sing it he did not even waste a moment on consideration he leapt to the top of the altar and held up both his hands and gathered reached desperately for the melody he needed for the magic stop he criedsang his voice ringing out like a trumpet the mob obeyed people froze in place staring at him mouths agape with astonishment words poured from him as if from some supernatural source he told them everything as their faces gazed up at him expressions dumbfounded how padrik was a fraud working his miracles with the help of criminals how he had truly used their donationsthe house he ran the luxuries he enjoyed and before anyone could challenge him he signaled to robin who began to reproduce some of those miracles she started with bursts of flash powder and then magical appearances of the altardecorations by sleight of hand she worked her way around the altar and made a couple of quick movements kestrel heard a muffled thump she then found the mirrorrig and used it to reproduce the demona puppet hanging slackly among the sculptures of angels up above the altar out of sight of the congregation he told how padrik had bound the spirit of a poor nonhuman murdered by an evil abbot of carthell to become the high bishops own personal executioner he stretched the truth a little describing reymond as a holy mage of the church who had discovered this and had freed the ghost sending it to take its own revenge on padrik he poured his heart into his words falling into the same kind of trance he invoked when playing his music behind his words he heard another strand of melody as robin wove her magics in with his she was singing an accompaniment to his rhapsody steadying his lips giving him strength beyond his own as if the words came from someone else he heard himself eloquently describing how padrik had taken over all the trade in the cathedral markethow padrik confiscated the goods of those he sent off to be slain by the ghosthow he had been collecting more and more money and doing less and less for the poor the sick those to whom it was supposed to go somewhere in the back of his mind part of him gave an astonished cheer as the crowd began to pay more and more attention to himand as their mood staring at padriks chosen priests turned uglier and uglier go he heard himself urge as his voice rang out in a triumphal calltoarms go and look in his quarters see what luxuries he has hidden there see the place where those vagabonds he consorted with are living how they eat from silver and drink from crystal these things were bought with your money and with bloodmoney he has been living off of you and off the stolen goods of the innocents he has sent to their deaths and all falsely in the name of god a long silence filled the cathedral for a moment it was broken by a single whisper of sound the rustle of robes as one of the priests tried to edge his way out of the cathedral ducking behind the statue of saint tolemy theyre running away get them someone shouted the false priests broke and ran holding up the skirts of their robes in order to run faster fleeing into the church buildings behind the cathedral robin plastered herself up against the altar as the mob flooded past her storming after the fleeing priests brushing aside the guards kestrel just watched them go sinking wearily to the surface of the altar padriks quarters were in there somewhere and he had no doubt that they were as luxurious as he had described the mob was going to have something to vent its rage on after all when they had all gone their shouts fading as they passed into other parts of the complex he looked over at robin and held out his hand she smiled exhausted walked over to him and took it sunlight poured down through the hole in the roof to pool around the altar kestrel saw that there was someone lying behind the pulpit quite unconscious next to an obviously broken and jammed trapdoor the back and the clothing of the figure seemed oddly familiar robin grinned and turned the body over who is it he asked she straightened the clan chief of the patsonos she replied her voice filled with glee come give me a hand with him she had grabbed one arm and tugged him nonetoogently across the marble floor why he asked taking the other arm and blinking in bafflement what do you want to do with him they hauled the gypsy up the altar stairs as she panted out her answer someoneought to be hereto answer questions she said her voice and face brimming with malicious enjoyment and we havea nice big cage hereto make sure he is the one to answer them and not us kestrel supplied in complete understanding and agreement good idea they locked the gypsy in the cage that had held tfyrr first making sure that the haspur had not left his lock picks behind that the patsono chief did not have a set of picks on his person andwith a judicious thump on the head with the pommel of kestrels daggerthat he would probably not wake up until after there was someone here to deal with him that should do it robin said as they slammed the door shut on him prey for peregrine she looked around the ruined cathedral thoughtfully you know things are going to get very interesting here for a while she said nibbling her lower lip and they just might be looking for more people to blame ive always wanted to see trevandia kestrel declared even though he had no such longing until just that moment but trevandia was the farthest place he knew of from gradford that still had welcomed gypsies and free bards why so have i robin exclaimed you know another kingdom seems like a very good place to be right now they looked at each other for a long momentthen broke into only slightly hysterical laughter trevandia it is kestrel said when they could catch their breath as soon as we get the wagon there was a growling sound in the distancegrowing nearer it was that of an angry crowd returning how about now robin asked innocently he did not bother to reply only seized her hand together they ran out into the square and did not stop running until they were past the gates of gradfordand they did not once look back
