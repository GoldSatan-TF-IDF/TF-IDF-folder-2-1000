harry turtledove thessalonica i george was hunting rabbits in the hills not far from thessalonica when he spied the satyr his first thought when its brown eyes peered out of the ugly snubnosed face and met his was to make the sign of the cross and frighten it away he didnt act on his first thought he was the kind of man who commonly thought three times before he did anything his build matched his character he was stocky and strong thick through the shoulders by no means someone who moved quickly but hard to stop once he did get moving instead of crossing himself he raised his right hand and rubbed his chin whiskers rasped under his fingers he should have shaved yesterday or maybe the day before he thought about growing a beard they were coming back into fashion though many romans perhaps most still plied their razors as they had since the days of constantine the great when he didnt drive it off the satyr cautiously came toward him picking its way along the rocky ground with surprisingly delicate graceful strides he supposed getting a rock in its hoof would cause it as much trouble as that would for a horse which the satyr resembled from the waist down it was certainly hung like a horse its phallus juttingly erect the old stories said satyrs were hard all the time till now george had never had a chance to put the old stories to the test satyrs were rare these days almost six hundred years after the son of god came down and was made flesh what a trophy to bring hack to town george thought bishop eusebius would probably bless him from the ambo of the basilica of st demetrius he could all but hear the bishop going on about another turn being given to the winding sheet christianity was wrapping around the corpse of paganism eusebius was a good man but one who sometimes had a distinctly mortuary cast of mind he didnt pluck an arrow from his quiver and set it to his bow any more than he had signed himself he stood quiet and let the satyr approach up in an oak tree a blackbird trilled the breeze sighed through the leaves of the tree the satyr made no sound at all maybe being a creature of wood and forest that was its way and maybe being more than an ordinary creature it had ways on which christian men were wiser not to speculate for the sake of their souls it paused almost within arms length of him nervously it stroked its erection with one hand as a flighty woman might have played with a lock of hair while hardly noticing she was doing it then as if making up its mind the satyr pointed to the skin george carried on his belt wine it asked its voice a plaintive baritone it spoke in greek of course being native to this soil george had grown up with latin his birth speech but like most thessalonicans he was fluent in both tongues yes its wine he answered water up here in the hills was mostly good but still who would drink water by choice drink some please the satyrs syntax was rusty as if it wasnt used to speaking with men it probably wasnt these daysthese centuriesfew would welcome it or even tolerate it as george was doing as was georges way he hesitated before replying drunken satyrs were supposed to do all sorts of appalling things but the wineskin he carried wasnt that large to begin with and hed already drunk from it the satyr could hardly get drunk on what was left besides it sounded so sad he unfastened the skin from his belt and handed it to the satyr the creatures homely features became almost beautiful for a moment as joy lit them it fumbled with the cord that held the skin closed obviously it wasnt used to dealing with any manmade things even ones as simple as that but it managed and sighed with ecstasy as it poured wine into its open mouth considering the quality of the wine george was glad hed given it to the satyr which was taking far more pleasure from it than he ever could have he would have been miffed though had the creature guzzled the skin dry he was about to say so in no uncertain terms when the satyr figured that out without his help after wiping its mouth on its hairy arm it held the skin out to him thanks he said and swigged from it himself the wine tasted better than it had maybe being touched by the satyr had improved it being touched by wine had certainly improved the satyr it seemed bigger stronger younger and even more ithyphallic than before it had lost its hangdog air its eyes flashed its large nostrils dilated as if to taste the wind that good it said almost crooningly glad you like it george answered polite as if he were talking to a monk he cocked his head to one side studying the satyr didnt know your kind came so close to thessalonica anymore he remarked looking back over his shoulder towards the city not like to come so close the satyr answered a moment later it added hard to come so close saints almost everywhere to keep me away george nodded half matteroffactly half sympathetically as christianitys hold on the land tightened the old creatures found it harder and harder to approach holy men or holy places the satyr hadnt had any trouble approaching him he shrugged he was just a man just a sinner he knew it where have you been living he asked up in rough country the satyr pointed off to the north and east rough country sure enough well away from the via egnatia that stilltenuouslylinked thessalonica with the adriatic and italy on the one hand and with constantinople on the other the satyr went on villages not so bad not so much being what he was he couldnt make the sign of the cross but george got the idea he nodded to show the satyr he followed bishop eusebius was always talking about doing a better job of evangelizing the little upcountry villages it wasnt only satyrs that hung around them bacchus still came around in the fall when the grapes were being crushed for wine up in the hills pan had a festival too though even there some said he was dead why didnt you stay up in the rough country if it was easier there george asked the satyrs eyes got wide it stroked itself again as if for reassurance breathing wine fumes into georges face it answered not easier there not so good no people all right even if some again he would have crossed himself if he could but new things in woods what kind of things george tried to put the same kind of dread into the word as the satyr had but knew he didnt come close lots new things in the woods the satyr looked back toward the northeast as if expecting those things whatever they were to burst from the woods and tear it to pieces up and down up and down went that hand after a moment it added wolves worst yes wolves it nodded to itself it might have been comparing the wolves to something else almost as dreadful george scratched his head for one thing you heard wolves howling outside the walls of thessalonica every winter for another i wouldnt think ordinary wolves would be the sort of things to worry you he remarked satyrs werent what they had been back in the days before christianity came to this land they were a long way from diminishing to mere flesh and blood though not ordinary wolves the satyr said not ordinary no it seemed grateful to george for having given it the word to describe the wolves even if only in the negative ah george said new sorts of powers trying to come down here is that what you mean the satyr nodded head moving in rhythm with its hand george shrugged i expect the priests will drive them away the satyr made a noise like none hed ever heard before after a moment he realized it was half moan half giggle i watch priest go out to wolves the satyr said he not see me or he once more it indicated the sign of the cross without actually making it and i have to run away but he not see he find wolf he go up to it he do that thing thing make me run yes george said when the satyr didnt go on what happened then again that strange mixture of mirth and terror burst from the satyrs throat it was an appalling sound one that made the little hairs on georges arms and at the back of his neck stand up as if he were a wolf himself priest do that thing the satyr repeated he do it not at me so i see safe and wolfeat him up really george said it was he realized a foolish response he consoled himself with the thought that it was better than making the sign of the cross which would have routed the satyr it had been a long timea lot longer than hed been alivesince powers that could stand up against christianitys most potent symbol had come into this part of the world he nodded slowly to himself fitting puzzle pieces together like mosaic tesserae in the church of st demetrius they must belong to the slavs slavs the satyr spoke the word as if it had never heard of the people so named whowhatare slavs georges nose was long and beaky admirably made for exasperated exhalations they and the avars have only been raiding the roman provinces south of the danube for the past generation he said his tone perfectly matching the irritated sniff ah only one generation the satyr said in some relief no wonder i not know only one george fell silent he studied the satyr hed shot that only one generation as if from a catapult propelled by sarcasm rather than twisted cords the satyr though had taken him literally and why not he realized what was a generation to a being essentially immortal the satyr was speaking with him now it might have spoken with st peter when he traveled through greece not long after the incarnation had it so chosen and had the saint not driven it from his presence by overwhelming holiness it might have spoken with alexander the great george shivered it might have spoken with achilles before he sailed for troy no wonder it took mere generations lightly this wolf thing eat up priest the satyr repeated it ran a tongue as long and red as its phallus around its mouth imitating a wolf licking its chops then it look over to where i am it not blind and stupid like priestit see me it think about eat me up too i see it think then it decide i full i see that too wolf get up go away george wanted to say kyrie eleison or christe eleison but didnt for fear the holy words would make the satyr flee he looked at it with an emotion hed never expected to feel toward its kind sympathy youre in a hard spot arent you if you come down to places like this the priests and holy men will get you if you stay where you have been staying though the wolves will do the same not wolves only the satyr said other things new things neverseen things frightening things frightening because theyre new or frightening because theyre frightening george wondered to an immortal that had grown used to the ways of its part of the world change of any sort had to seem like the end of that world what must the olympians have thought when christ overcame them the satyr hadnt been so strong as all thatbut the other side of the coin was lesser threats were dangerous to it what i do it mourned now what i do its eyes bored into georges as if it was sure he had the answer he wished he did but he was a christian himself somemanywould have said hed already shown too much tolerance for this creature of the old dispensation as far as he was concerned though the good samaritan made a better model than the pharisee who went out of his way not to help lest he be defiled and in purely pragmatic terms what hed learned was worth knowing not only for his sake but for thessalonicas none of that did the satyr any good it made another strange noise this one full of despair and started for the trees wine sweet it said as if suddenly remembering and then it was gone george strode into thessalonica through the northwestern gate close to st catherines church he carried a couple of hares and a couple of partridges not a great days hunting but not bad either he and his family would eat well tonight and tomorrow too calm washed out of catherines as he walked past it unlike demetrius she was not a warrior saint very much the reverse she had been martyred in alexandria after besting several pagans in debate when her head was struck off for her temerity milk flowed from the wound instead of blood feeling her holy influence eased george s worries for a little while with such spiritual strength behind it to say nothing of the imperial soldiers and the popular militia to which he belongedthessalonica could surely stand up against anything the slavs and avars might do whether with their soldiers or with their gods and demons most men would have let the rationalization satisfy them in spite of catherines calm george could not make himself forget the satyr had said a slavic wolf had devoured a priest who tried to banish it you should pray more he told himself and think less hed been telling himself the same thing for a good many years he did pray frequently and sincerely he never had been able to make himself stop thinking though he brought the game he had killed into the shoemakers shop where he hadnt worked that day having gone hunting instead that did not mean the shop had stood idle with his wife irene his daughter sophia and his son theodore to help with the work things got done whether he was there or not he sometimes suspected things got done better when he wasnt there hed never voiced that suspicion aloud for fear irene would confirm it she looked up from the undyed leather boots she was making for peter the miller who lived down the street her eyes brightened when she saw the game george had brought home she had a few years fewer than his thirtyfivehe wasnt sure how many but then he wasnt sure whether he might not be thirtyfour or thirtysix himselfand looked younger still her hair was still dark her skin unlined and despite three pregnancies she had almost all of her teeth she said you did well thereprobably better than if youd stayed here like him she made such calculations almost as second nature their parents had arranged the marriage of course but it had proved good not just because of the properties and families it joined they thought alike which made them enjoy each others company shall we stew them with cabbage and leeks mother sophia suggested she was fifteen nowgeorge was sure of that because shed been born in the year maurice became roman emperor her face was long and thin like her mothers but she had most of his nose in the middle of it he worried that it looked better on him than on his daughter that sounds all right to me irene said she looked at george he nodded she looked at theodore he pulled a sour face he was a couple of years older than sophia and at the age where he pulled a sour face at anything his parents suggested irene chose to make the best of that she could i know youre not fond of leeks will you put up with them tonight because everyone else in the family is i suppose so he mumbled sometimes soft answers from george and irene were harder for him to take than furious shouts would have been george though was not long on furious shouts hed had a bellyful of them from his own father and didnt see that theyd done much good in making him behave irene carried the hares and partridges upstairs like a lot of artisan families georges lived over their shop before too long a delicious smell floated down into the work area no customers had come in since george showed up with the game and it was getting dark outside so he felt no hesitation about shutting the front door and letting down the bar he didnt expect anyone would need new boots or to have a sandal repaired so badly as to come to the shop with a torchbearerand in the unlikely event somebody did do that he could always open the door again he and the children went upstairs after his wife it was lighter up there than down below safer to put windows in the second story of a building because they were harder to break into there even so irene had lighted a couple of lamps the smell of burning olive oil was part of the characteristic odor of thessalonica along with woodsmoke garbage and manure george paid no attention to the smell when he stayed in town but it forcefully brought itself to his attention when he came back after some time away as with his day of hunting irene ladled the stew into earthenware bowls sophia carried them and horn spoons to the table irene brought in bread and honey to go with the stew before the family began to eat they bowed their heads george said grace thanking christ that they had enough to fill their bellies when he was done he glanced toward the heavens though all he saw were the beams of the roof he knew god watched over him the blessing reminded him of what had gone on in the woods earlier that day i saw a satyr this afternoon he remarked after hed taken his first bite and then in much the same tone of voice good stew theodore gaped at him sophia made the sign of the cross they and their mother all exclaimedthey knew george too well to let that calm casual tone lull them irene not surprisingly was the first one to put words to her thoughts i hope it was from far away and that the creature didnt bother you it didnt bother me george took another bite deliberately he chewed deliberately he swallowed i gave it some of my winenot too much i didnt want it drunk you should have driven it away father now theodore crossed himself to show what he meant those nasty demons cant stand against the sign of the true faith i know that george hid his smile in going against what his father had done theodore hadno doubt altogether without intending tobecome perfectly conventional george ate some more stew then went on as things worked out im glad i didnt he told of what the satyr had said about the slavic wolfdemon and what that demon had done to the priest his wife his son and his daughter all made the sign of the cross then to turn aside the evil omen for good measure theodore also pulled at the neck opening to his tunic and spat down it an apotropaic gesture older than christianity and one a priest might have frowned to see what are we going to do sophia asked if these barbarians and their horrible demons come against thessalonica how shall we be saved we have strong walls we have soldiers we have priests we have faith in god george answered if all those arent enough what will be sophia nodded reassured irenes eyes met georges neither of them said anything he knew what his wife was thinking that all the things hed named might not be enough and it was true not long before sophia was born sirmium a city perhaps as great as thessalonica had fallen to the slavs and avars life in the roman empire was hard these days and no one could say it might not get harder after supper irene and sophia washed the dishes in a basin of water by the time they were done full darkness had fallen against its almost palpable presence the flames from the lamps and the flickering light they cast seemed tiny and weak the next thing to lost george thought of the slavs and avars moving down toward the aegean and of thessalonica a christian light in a sea of pagan darkness he went to the window and looked out most of thessalonica was dark now with a glow of candles and of holiness coming from the churches more lights up on the walls and here and there one moving through the streets as prominent people undertook to travel through the night footpads traveled through the night too but did not advertise their presence close the shutters george his wife said yawning lets go to bed few peoplemostly the rich who could afford the lamps and candles they needed to turn night into daystayed up long past sunset nor was darkness the only reason for that when you rose with the sun and worked hard all day you were ready to go to bed by the time night came the room to the left of the hall as you walked up it had been shared by sophia and theodore these days since theyd come to puberty it had a wooden partition down the middle that turned it into two cubicles george kept telling himselfand anyone who would listenhe would enlarge the doorway one day soon hed been saying it for so long he didnt believe it himself anymore he used a lamp from the kitchen to light one that rested on a stool by the bed in his own bedchamber then in orderly fashion carried the first one back to where it belonged blew it out and used what glow came through the doorway from the second to guide him up the hall by the time he returned irene was already in bed he used the earthenware chamber pot took off his shoes undid his belt and took it off and got in himself still wearing the long tunic hed had on all day the straw of the mattress rustling under him he leaned up on one elbow and blew out the lamp on the stool the bedroom plunged into darkness despite that darkness irene did not want to go to sleep at once a satyr she said in a low voice one that with luck the children would not overhear i know of them of courseeveryone knows of thembut i never heard of anybody meeting one before not even in the stories my old grandmother told me when i was little neither did i george said not around a city thats been christian as long as thessalonica but up in the north its all helterskelter things are bubbling like porridge in a pot over a hot fire the roman soldiers and the avars and slavs keep going back and forth and round and round but every year in spite of what the soldiers do there are more pagan slavs settling on land that ought to be roman i know irene answered from what i hear in the marketplace the roman generals spend more time quarreling among themselves than they do fighting the enemy ive heard the same thing george said it worries me irene caught her breath at that her husband was a man who worried a good deal but hardly ever admitted it out loud he went on and when the slavs settle on land that ought to be roman their gods and demons settle on land that ought to be christian that wolfwhat it did to the priest on top of a wool blanket she had woven herself she shuddered satyrs now and the other creatures from the old days george said musingly people believe in them yes but not the way they used to so no wonder the true faith of christ is stronger than they are but the slavs they believe in their powers the same way we believe in the power of the lord that makes the wolfand whatever other things they have like himdangerous to us christians do you think the slavs will come down as far as thessalonica irene asked farther west bands of them have pushed deeper into greece than we are he replied irene was not the sort of woman to be fobbed off with vague reassurances especially when those were likely to be false so yes they could come to thessalonica taking the city is another question god surely guards us here yes surely irene agreed but less confidently than he would have expected from her she was worried too then she lay on her left side facing him he lay on his right he set a hand on her hip partly to reassure her partly as a sort of silent question hed learned early in their marriage not to take her when she didnt feel like being taken the anger and arguments following that lasted for days and were far more trouble than brief pleasure was worth she on the other hand had learned not to deny him unless she was emphatically uninterested for the most part the compromiseabout which theyd never said a word not out loudworked well if shed flopped down onto her belly he would have rolled over too and gone to sleep instead she moved toward him sliding across the linen of the mattress cover he held her for a while then peeled her out of her tunic and took off his own her body was warm familiar friendly in his arms they seldom surprised each other in bed these days but they made each other happy as far as george was concerned that counted for more afterwards he and irene both used the chamber pot again then redonned their tunics the night was warm enough to sleep without those but neither of them felt like startling their children in the morning george fell asleep almost at once breakfast was leftover stew along with more bread irene sighed then said i wonder how many women have prayed for a way to keep food fresh longer than a day or two god has bigger things than that to worry about george said evidently his wife answered leaving him with the feeling that hed been punctured even if he couldnt quite tell how he didnt have time to worry about it long with the rest of the family he went downstairs and got to work whenever they didnt have anything else to do they worked on heavysoled sandals in assorted sizes some farmers outside of town would make their own but those were usually crude rawhide affairs and didnt last george had spent years building up a reputation for solid craftsmanship when you buy from george you get your moneys worth people said once a couple of years before theodore had remarked you know father if we made the leather thinner it would wear out faster and people would have to come back sooner to buy more hed obviously thought he was being clever because of that george had been gentle when he said the trouble is son if the leather wore out faster people would have to come back sooner yes but they wouldnt come back to us theyd pick another shoemaker one who gave them sandals that didnt fall to pieces in a hurry and sure enough the first customer of the morning was a farmer named felix good to see youre still here he said to george in backwoods latin im not fixing a hole this size i dont think he held up a sandal the sole was mostly hole what wasnt hole was bits of leather some tanned some not that had been sewn on over the course of years george wouldnt have wanted to walk around in a sandal like that even without the latest hole but held his peace what felix did withor toshoes was his business george did take the ruined one to remind himself how big a foot felix had we made a pair about that size a few days ago i think he said and looked on the shelves set against the back wall sure enough he held out the sandals try these onsee how they feel felix did his gnarled hands had a little trouble with the small bronze buckles but he managed he walked back and forth inside the shop a smile came over his weathered face thats right nice he said id forgotten walking doesnt have to feel like youve got a sack of bumpy beans under each foot glad you like them george said starting off the day with a sale always struck him as a good omen felix all at once looked less happy than he had a moment before guess i shouldnt have said that now youre going to charge me more on account of it he cast an apprehensive eye toward george what are you going to charge me thats a good pair of sandalsyou did say so yourself george answered i was thinking six miliaresia half a solidus felix exclaimed he made as if to throw the shoes at george i figured youd say something more like two after an argument they both enjoyed they split the difference felix also promised to bring a sack of raisins to the shop the next time he was in thessalonica maybe he would and maybe he wouldnt the four silver coins he did pay were enough for george to turn a profit on the deal how are things treating you these days the shoemaker asked to make sure no bad feelings lingered after the haggleand because life would have been boring if he let people out of his shop without finding out what they knew not bad not bad felix answered always a lot of fairies and such about there away from town its quiet here god be praised everybody inside the walls believes in him pretty much not like that out in the country you know old ways hang on thats so george agreed i saw a satyr myself yesterday as a matter of fact oh yes ive seen them too felix said i chase my daughters into the house when theyre about just on account of you never knowyou know but these i saw a few days ago they werent like anything i seen before pretty women they looked like with long yellow hair and with wings on their backs not angel wings with feathers and allmore like beetle wings all clear and shimmery i made the cross at them like a good christian ought to but they stood there and smiled at me it was like they never seen it before maybe they hadnt george said and told him about the wolf new people on the move new gods and demons moving with them felix clicked his tongue between his teeth hard times sure enough he said well god will protect us i expect i hope he will anyhow he headed out of the shop then turned back the sandals feel good george i thank you for that with a wave he was gone george turned back to his son there do you see theodore do a proper job and your customers come back to you yes i see father theodore grinned mischievously make four miliaresia every five or six years from a farmer and you can use it to buy gold plates to eat off of the shoemaker didnt know whether to smack the youth or start laughing he let out a strangled snort which satisfied neither of those impulses if god did protect thessalonica he thought it would be either because he ignored the younger generation or because he was even more merciful than the holy scriptures said as george pondered those two choices he realized one didnt necessarily exclude the other he was delicately tapping an awl to produce a tooled pattern on a boot for a prominent jurist when dactylius stuck his head into the shop archery practice this afternoon the little greek jeweler exclaimed he carried a bow and had a quiver on his back have you forgotten ill bet you have youre right i did forget george admitted i start doing this fine workhe pointed to the boot and i dont think about anything else go on dear irene told him germanus wont be expecting those boots for at least another week youll have plenty of time to finish them youre right he didnt know why he bothered saying that irene was generally right to dactylius he said ill go get my bow and arrowsbe right back he hurried upstairs grabbed the bow off the pegs where hed hung it and picked up his own quiver he slung it over his shoulder as he returned to the ground floor dactylius was hopping from foot to foot as if he needed to visit the latrine he seemed all the more excitable when paired with stolid george come on he said rufus will yell at us if were late one of georges eyebrows quirked upward hell yell at us if were not late too you go to church to pray you go to militia practice to get yelled at taking no notice of that dactylius grabbed him by the sleeve of his tunic and dragged him out into the street behind him he heard irene laugh softly he was never late enough to matter and most of the time his punctuality had nothing to do with dactylius for that matter he kept the jeweler out of trouble more often than the other way round the practice field was just that a field in the southeastern part of the city not far from the hippodrome and fairly close to the sea in the time of george s greatgrandfather a grandee had had a mansion there but no one had ever rebuilt the place after it burned down a scrawny brown dog sprawled in the grass and watched the rnilitiamen at their exercises the commander of the regular garrison up in the citadel on the high ground at the northeastern comer of thessalonica would either have laughed or suffered a fit of apoplexy to see it the amateur soldiers were indifferent archers poor spearmen swordsmen longer on ferocious spirit than skill george knew hed never use his bow as well as a professional soldier even if he did bring back game when he went out hunting dactylius shot straighter than he did though his own bow had a stronger pull after he missed a shot from a range where he should have hit he yanked a new arrow out of his quiver and made as if to break it over his knee another of his fellow rnilitiamen a gangly curlyhaired man named john not only had the gall to hit the canvas target but then said you might as well shoot that arrow george after its gone wild someone who knows what hes doing may find it if you break it its gone for good ill have you know i bagged two rabbits and two birds yesterday george said with dignity aye and if the bunnies carried bows theyd have bagged you first john retorted you didnt want to get into an argument with him he made his living such as it was by going from tavern to tavern telling jokes people said hed come from constantinople that hed been run out of town when some of his jokes there got too pointed to suit the men in power in the militia though your mouth would take you only so far rufus the squadron commander was a grayhaired veteran whod fought the ostrogoths in italy under narses the eunuch he had one blue eye one brown eye and one nasty disposition lets see you hit it again john before you make like youre the second coming you couldnt have your second coming till a month after the first one john muttered but he made sure rufus didnt hear him george blamed him not at all for that rufus had to be nearing his threescore and ten but george wouldnt have wanted to fight him with any weapons or none john nocked his next arrow drew the bow back to his ear let flyand missed almost as badly as george had done rufus laughed raucously john muttered again this time not even george could make out what he said the shoemaker decided that was probably just as well somebody shot an arrow at the dog the shaft thumped into the ground six or eight feet away from the beast the dog never moved hes in the safest place he could be rufus said and laughed again i would hate him if only he werent right dactylius said we have to get better his face was probably more intent than when he was setting a ruby into a golden necklace he aimed shotand missed you lugs are all hopeless rufus rolled his eyes come onall together now a ragged volley followed by jesus the virgin and all of the saints what will you do if the slavs and avars ever do come down on thessalonica probably something like this john said shivering as if he were about to freeze to death or maybe this he gave an alarmingly realistic impression of a man suddenly seized by diarrhea or this now he mimed jumping onto a horse and galloping away as fast as he could go george was a sober serious fellow most of the time he found himself laughing helplessly at johns antics he would have felt worse about it but everyone else was laughing too rufus had a soul as flinty as any this side of a tax collectors but he guffawed with the militiamen he commanded youre a funny fellow all right he said to john id like you better though if your work with the bow werent so funny johns next arrow not only hit the target it pierced the center of the bullseye how about that he said triumphantly thats even funnier than when you were doing the fellow shitting himself rufus said leaving the comic for once altogether at a loss for words on their way back to their places in the workaday world several of the rnilitiamen george among them stopped in a tavern for a mug of wine maybe even for two mugs of wine george said liking to spell things out as precisely as he could beforehand maybe dactylius sounded nervous he might have been a trooper in the militia but his wife claudia whose gray eyes and fair skin spoke of gothic blood was larger and brawnier and of a sharper temper than he the taverner a longfaced swarthy man named paul seemed gladder to see the rnilitiamen than was his wont he filled their mugs up to the top and didnt scrutinize the coppers they passed across the bar as if certain every other one was a counterfeit are you feeling well host of ours asked a plump fellow named sabbatius as well as a forest when the birds fly south for the winter paul answered in a gloomy croak aye the birds are flying sure enough are you making riddles sabbatius asked swigging at his wine he was liable to stay for more than a mug or twoor three or four i dont think he is george said he studied paul i think hes heard something you have heard something havent you good thing you make shoes instead of asking the questions when the torturers doing his job the taverner said aye ive heard something and if its so you militiamen are going to be all thats in the way between us and trouble for a while what do you mean four or five of the amateur soldiers asked the question at the same time paul shrugged my line of work you do hear things some of the things you hear you wish you hadnt if you know what i mean this is one of them if i did hear right most of the regular garrison is heading out of town christ have mercy sabbatius said beating george and several others to the punch why do they want to go and do a fool thing like that dont know that they want to paul answered when youre a soldier though you dont do what you want to you do what they tell you to way i hear it is priscus the general is in trouble against the avars and the slavs somewhere off in the back of beyondhe pointed vaguely toward the northeastand he needs soldiers so off theyre going to go thats not so good george said he looked around the tavern then back to paul would you want thessalonica defended by the likes of us if i say no to that you people will throw things at me paul replied a smile stretching his face in unfamiliar directions but if i say yes ill be lying what am i supposed to do about that i will have two mugs of wine after all dactylius said as if that were a matter more important than the regular garrisons leaving thessalonica while the taverner filled his mug with a dipper george pondered the question hed asked in due course he told paul maybe you ought to join the militia too then youd have no one but yourself to blame for whatever might go wrong aye maybe i ought to at that paul said i dont have forty years on me yet and if im no hercules im no tun of suet either like some people i could name he looked pointedly toward sabbatius the chubby militiaman glared right back step out into the street and well talk some more about that he offered paul reached under the counter and pulled out a stout club studded with nails he set it on the bar if i step out into the street i do my talking with this he said sabbatius sword was a better weapon but he didnt push it peering down into his mug of wine instead paul grunted and put the club away you do join the militia join our company george said and bring your friend there he tapped the bar to show what he meant rufus sees that club he wont just let you join hell try to steal it from you maybe i will the taverner said again most of the time that meant not on your life but im polite about it this time george thought it meant he probably would dactylius gulped down that second mug of wine and hurried out of the tavern georges opinion was that he shouldnt have poured it down so fast he was walking at a slant if he was working on anything delicate it wouldnt turn out so well as it might have claudia would notice tooas far as george could tell claudia noticed everything whether it was there or notand make dactylius regret it although sabbatius liked to drink he was next to sidle out the door hed been staring down where paul had stowed the nasty club he was bold enough shooting at targets in the field and at practice with swords too george got the idea though that hed found the notion of having nails pounded into his own personal precious flesh distinctly unappealing george left the tavern a few minutes after sabbatius he hurried back toward his shopthis was news more important than having seen a satyr no one could know for certain what the latter portended but anybody this side of an idiot was able to see the garrisons leaving thessalonica meant trouble when sophia saw him coming up the street she ran out of the shop exclaiming father guess what youll never guess what i dont know george said agreeably what once youve told me i have something to tell you too i was in the market square buying some parsnips for mother sophia said her eyes snapping with excitement and people were saying the regular army is going to march out of town to go help with the wars god knows where isnt that important isnt that worth hearing well yes it is he admitted he was never a man who got very excited about anything his stolidity this time though irked his daughter you must be angry at me for telling you my news and not waiting to hear yours she said what was your news anyway it doesnt matter he set a hand on her shoulder youve already heard it whats your mother going to do with the parsnips bake them with some snails shes gathered over the last few days sophia answered she finally has enough to cook that sounds good george said lets go back to the shop dont you have some work to do i know ive got plenty and i spent longer at practice than i thought i would he didnt mention going into pauls tavern what point now the rumor had to be all over thessalonica by this time he consoled himself by remembering rumors werent always true the garrison marched out of the city three days later they wore their mailshirts and helmets which struck george who stood watching as they headed out of cassanders gate east down the via egnatia and away from thessalonica as a bad sign a sign they expected to have to fight at any time many of them had painted either the cross or the labarumon their shields to help ward off whatever gods or demons the slavs and avars might call up the labarum replaced the old pagan eagle atop their standards too bishop eusebius stood just outside the gate blessing the soldiers as they filed past him may you go with god and may god go with you he said his silk vestments more splendid than the cloak of the general commanding the garrison gleamed in the sunshine in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit go forth and defend the roman empire against its enemies defend our christian folk against all traps and tricks of the devil eusebius put on a brave show his long lean face was lit by a pious certainty george sometimes wished he could match the shoemakers broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug he was as he was as eusebius was as he was after eusebius was done the city prefect a rotund fellow named victor came forward to make a speech of his own he and the bishop eyed each other warily neither altogether certain of his own power or trusting the other very far victor cleared his throat a couple of times then began glorious citizens of the equally glorious city of thessalonica we remain strong we remain steadfast we remain courageous we we remain bored george thought victor not only liked to talk he liked to hear himself talk eventually he might come to the point meanwhile george could stop listening for a while he admired a pretty girl not far away the wind was blowing her tunic tight against her body so that she might almost have been naked looking with lust in your heart at a woman not your wife was a sin george knew as much he also knew that had irene been standing there beside him and caught his eye straying toward that girl she might have stuck an elbow in his ribs but she would have been laughing while she did it he sometimes thought she had more forgiveness for human frailty than the church did he started listening again on the off chance the prefect was getting around to anything importantassuming as might or might not have been justified that he ever did get around to anything important at the moment he was saying our magnificent metropolis guarded by god certain of protection from our patron saint warded by our walls not being in the mood for alliteration george daydreamed a little while longer victor began to shift from foot to foot that either meant he was coming to the point or that he needed to break off and run for the jakes hoping it was the former george began paying attention once more his optimism was rewarded for the prefect declared and so citizens of thessalonica my delegation and i shall travel to the imperial city there to petition his imperial majesty the splendid roman emperor maurice to send from elsewhere in the empire from lands less threatened by barbaric inroads a new contingent of soldiers to take the place of those who have gone to fight in the meanwhile of course i am certain our militia will continue to offer complete security for thessalonica had he been truly certain of that what need would he have had to go to constantinople to ask maurice for replacement troopers there were times when george thought he should have become a priest his mind was made for logicchopping as usual at such times he shook his head he enjoyed the trade hed learned from his father a logical shoemaker might be an uncommon beast but by no means an unnatural one such musings did not keep him from joining in the applause victor got being a member of the militia himself he recognized its shortcomings professional soldiers were bound to know their craft better than amateurs like himself the sandals he turned out after all were better than the ones rustics made for themselves had that not been true he wouldnt have been able to feed his wife and children the way theodore ate these days george needed to be good at his trade bishop eusebius face was a study in mixed emotions he took victors getting applause almost as a personal affront his model was his predecessor ambrose who had made the emperor theodosius do penance for a massacre his men had carried out in the hippodrome of thessalonica on the other hand with victor and other secular notables departing for constantinople eusebius would be the most important man in thessalonica for a while that he liked fine victor said i am certain the holy bishop here will pray for the success of my mission and for my safe return what the prefect had succeeded in startling eusebius like george the bishop must have figured out that much of what victor said wasnt worth listening to eusebius did recover quickly yes of course i shall pray for your safe journey your success and your eventual safe return did he place a little extra stress on that eventual george wasnt sure the ceremony broke up after that some people went up onto the gray stone walls of thessalonica to keep an eye on the departing city garrison for as long as they could george would have reckoned that an insult to the militia if he hadnt noticed that a fair number of those wistful spectators were militiamen he wondered if he ought to go up himself the militia would be keeping watch for the city now in the end he decided not to bother he expected hed have plenty of chances to do actual patrolling why bother with rehearsals in that case on the way back to his shop he passed under the triumphal arch of the emperor galerius celebrating his victory over the persians galerius was three hundred years dead more or less the persians were still very much around maurice had finally won a long war against them five years before george looked at the arch galerius arrogant in stone stared back at him it does make you wonder what the point of all that fighting was george murmured galerius didnt answer hello father theodore said when george came through the front door how does it feel to be a leading defender of the city strange the shoemaker answered how does it feel to you that im a leading defender of the city his son grinned at him is there any way i can get out of town like the prefect is doing children have no respect for their elders these days george said if id told my father something like that he paused he had told his father things like that and a good many times too most of the time the old man had thrown back his head and laughed like a loon you started to say something asked theodore who was if you resisted the temptation to strangle him a fairly good specimen maybe i did george said but whats the use you wouldnt listen anyway in a different tone of voice that would have been wounding but george sounded somewhere between resigned and amused theodore grinned again and went back to the boot hed been mending the shoemaker went back to work too those fancy tooled boots wouldnt get done by themselves and hed never heard of a spirit or fairy that would make shoes for you while you lay in bed he went back to the boots tapping the awl one careful stroke at a time with his light hammer he had to bend close to the last to see what he was doing a day spent at uninterrupted fine work like that left him with a pounding headache one of these years before too long if god let him live his sight would lengthen and then the fine work would be beyond his power then theodore would have to take over the lead in the shop and george would do whatever his sight let him do and would probably take a hand in training up his grandsons in the trade when the sun went down and shadows filled the shop the family ended their work and cleaned up i wish we had a slave sophia said that would make life a lot easier your mother and i have talked about buying one now and again george said setting the tools hed used back onto the pegs hed set in the wall to hold them each tool had its own set of pegs on which it hung neatly have you really sophia sounded surprised youve never done it when i was around could we afford to buy a slave theodore asked probably george said irene nodded now both their children looked surprised george went on i dont expect well get one any time soon though his wife nodded why not if we can afford one sophia said it would save us a lot of work and besides she paused uncertain how to go on at last she said if youve got a slave if you dont have to do all your own work that means youre better off than a lot of the people around you before george could answer irene spoke with great firmness i cant think of a worse reason to buy a slave than social climbing thats right george said knowing he couldnt have put it so well himself sophia and theodore let out simultaneous identical disbelieving snorts they were at an age where social climbing mattered intensely george remembered that hed got over it he expected they would too besides irene said the work wouldnt disappear as if a priest had exorcised it the slave might do the housework so we didnt have to but wed have to make more shoes and fix more shoes and sell more shoes to buy the food and clothes and medicines and whatnot wed need to give the slave thats right george said again its not what you pay to buy a slave that counts its the upkeep we could afford to buy one but i dont know how long we could afford to have him here wed find a way theodore said with the innocent confidence of youth thats not the only problem you know george said most of the slaves in the market these days are gepids or slavs they dont speak latin they dont speak greek and god only knows if they understand anything about work if they run away youre out everything you paid for them with no chance of getting a copper back from the dealer some people must manage in spite of all those troubles sophia said or nobody would have slaves some people george said pointedly must raise up children who dont talk back to them come to think of it though ive never heard of any when you can afford a slave theodore or when your husband can sophia then well see what you do meanwhile meanwhile irene broke in we still have a lot of work to do and not much light left to do it in mostly because a couple of people i could name have been grumbling instead of doing what theyre supposed to she picked up a sandal and made as if to clout theodore in the ear with it he got to work but he didnt stop grumbling that satisfied george who remembered doing a deal of grumbling in his own younger days rufus lined up his charges and gave them their orders walk your stretch of the wall try not to fall off and break your fool neck the challenge is st demetrius the answer is st nicholas if somebody cant give you the right answer hes got no business up on the wall at night what do we do then dactylius asked nervously it depends the militia officer answered if you can tell its just some cursed fool from inside the city just send him down if its anybody sneaking up onto the wall from outside try and kill the bastard and yell for help like the devils about to drag your soul to hell anything else no all right first shift up onto the wall second shift will relieve you about the start of the fifth hour of the night george had firstshift duty tonight along with dactylius the two of them climbed to the battlements near the litaean gate george peered west in the deepening evening twilight the via egnatia was a gray stone ribbon heading west toward the sea some days journey away beyond the sea lay italy past that georges knowledge of geography faded fast the moon full or near enough rose in the southeast in capricorn with the bright silver lamp of jupiter not far away even after night fell there was enough fight to see where to put your feet and to see shapes moving out beyond the wall there was in fact enough light to see shapes moving out beyond the wall whether they were really there or not i wish we could carry torches dactylius said that would be fine george said if there are any slavs out there sneaking up on us theyd know where to aim when they started shooting urk dactylius said a sound that made no word in either latin or greek but one full of meaning nonetheless i hadnt thought so far if to see i am more easily seen ill do without the torch and gladly good fellow george liked dactylius though he wondered what had prompted the jeweler to join the militia a less warlike man would have been hard to imagine mosquitoes buzzed as the two militiamen patrolled their stretch of wall one of the bugs bit george behind his left knee he said something pungent hed learned from rufus dactylius laughed then a mosquito bit him and he said something even more sulfurous he laughed again this time selfconsciously you wouldnt let claudia know i talk like that among my fellow warriors would you perish the thought george said maybe dactylius was a militiaman because rufus left him feeling less henpecked than claudia did something moved out beyond the ditch george saw it so did dactylius what is it he hissed its a man george said that was better than naming it a demon or a pagan god but not much his hand closed over the hilt of his sword the leather grip comforted him even if it wasnt shoe leather besidehim dactylius started to say something but stopped perhaps because his tongue was cleaving to the roof of his mouth george didnt say anything he knew better than to try if he opened his mouth with his heart pounding the way it was all of thessalonica would hear the noise he went to the edge of the wall and peered down into the night sure enough that was a man what was he doing down there away from the monastery to the west of the city spying out the land was the first answer that leaped into the shoemakers agile mind then the man came out from the shadows of some bushes into moonlight that moonlight gleamed off his tonsure he looked up toward the wall with complete uninterest and began to sing loudly and offkey in greek christ have mercy george exclaimed his voice an explosive whisper its a drunk monk thats all youreyoure right dactylius spoke in tones of wonder as if hed seen a revelation straight out of the apocalypse of st john the monk wandered away hed developed a list from the wine hed taken on as a ship would list after taking on water anger washed through george sweeping away fear after a moment the anger flowed away too replaced by a more characteristic sour satisfaction i dont even have to think up things id like to do to the bastard for giving me such a start he said to dactylius why not the jeweler asked i was thinking of things like that georges smile was broad almost beatific because before long that fellows going to have to go back to his monastery and the abbot there will take care of everything we could dream up and more besides oh my dactylius said almost as if hed had another vision but this one of the pleasant sort they paced back and forth along the wall for most of another hour nothing happened that suited george fine he would have been delighted to go home after his turn was up slide into bed next to irene and if he woke her up say nothing happened she would be happy and relieved he was already happy and relieved the monk having turned out to be a monk he wondered when he would be relieved in a different sense of the word the moon was a good way up in the sky hours were hard enough to gauge during the day let alone by night but he thought the men who would replace him and dactylius should be climbing to the top of the wall soon he promised himself he wouldnt tell them about the monk a moment later he too forgot about the poor sot from out of the blackness of the woods to the north and west of thessalonica came a long cold fierce hungry howl all the adjectives formed in georges mind as the howl echoed and reechoed in his ears none of them described it hed heard wolves before when winter came down hard they often drew near the city to see whator whomthey could take he did not believe for an instant that this sound had anything to do with any wolves hed heard during hard winters though beside him dactylius jumped and crossed himself george did not blame the excitable little jeweler in the least thats not a wolf dactylius said as if someone had declared it was he seemed to realize as much after a brief pause he went on but what else could it be it was a wolfof sorts george spoke with an odd certainty as if his mouth had adjusted to the horrid hunger of that sound faster than his wits had after a moment his wits caught up it must have been one of those wolfdemons the satyr was telling me about when i went hunting a few days ago christ have mercy dactylius exclaimed such an oath would have been plenty to drive away any of the old pagan greek spirits who heard it for a moment george hoped it had had the same effect on the slavic demon but then the wolf howled again and was joined a moment later by another the two howling together were more than twice as bad as one howling alone they made george feel as if he up on the walls of thessalonica were on an island of faith and piety in the middle of a dark sea and that the sea was rising threatening to wash over him and his little island as if they did not exist and were of no account devils dactylius whispered george did not argue with him george knew he could not argue with him those were devils out there instead he said devils dont prevail against god thats what the scriptures say he did a better job of reassuring his friend than he did for himself he believed hed told the truth but it was a longterm kind of truth how many christians had been martyred for the faith before it prevailed in the roman empire if god chose for his own reasons to give thessalonica over to the foe who knew him not he would do that george could only hope that was not what he had in mind no that wasnt the only thing he could do he could also do everything in his power to keep the barbarians out of the city god might offer the way but men had to provide the means st demetrius at first george thought that was only in his own mind seeking intercession with the divine then he realized the call had come from someone else st nicholas he answered thought you were asleep up here sabbatius said advancing to take his turn on sentrygo did you hear the wolf a few minutes ago george looked at the tubby newcomer i thought it was your stomach growling he said but he could not stay jocular long yes we heard it he and dactylius descended from the wall and lighted torches at one burning down there by the base so they could find their way home they carried their weapons home with them too which was enough to repel any thieves who might have skulked through the streets of thessalonica in the darkness irene had thoughtfully left a lamp burning downstairs george carried it up to the bedroom he tried to slide into bed as quietly as he could but woke her those horrible wolves she said drowsily i didnt dream them did i no he answered truthful before he wondered whether a lie might have served better irene nodded and went back to sleep some time later george wished his own rest would have come so easily ii sophia came running back from the market square with turnips in her hands and excitement on her face come quick everybody she called as she hurried into the shop theres going to be a procession out to the monastery of st demetriusyou know the one with the healing spring george looked up from the fancy boots he had almost finished ornamenting what kind of procession he asked remember menas the nobleman sophia said the one who hasnt been able to use his legs since his horse threw him a few years ago yes i remember menas george said beside him irene nodded too he went on hes lucky hes rich to have bearers put him in a litter and take him wherever he wants to go weve all seen him in church irene nodded again this time so did both their children a poor man he finished a poor man would probably have to stay in his bed the rest of his days and those wouldnt be long either will you let me tell you sophia burst out she pretended to throw a turnip at him now he nodded she said st demetrius sent him a dream he said that if he goes out to the monastery and bathes in the spring hell be able to walk again irene crossed herself may it be so she said aye may it be so george agreed his spirit was not quite so broadly generous as his wifes though so he could not help wondering why god and the saint had chosen to give that dream to menas rather than to some poor and wretched paralytic whose state as hed suggested to his daughter was liable to be far worse than that of the nobleman his shoulders went up and down when god needed a shoemaker to advise him on how to run the world no doubt he would inquire in the meantime he would do as he pleased not as pleased george theodore said if st demetrius promised a miracle that would be something worth seeing wouldnt it father you see a miracle whenever you take bread and wine and communion george said what i see is a young scamp who wants some time off from work he put down his awl i wouldnt mind a little time off myself lets go theodore whooped sophia set the turnips on the counter what shall we do if a customer comes in while were away irene asked resisting even after her husband had given up what shall we do well miss him thats what george said which while literally true earned him a glare from irene he went on a lot of the people who might come in you know will be parading along with menas too i suppose so irene weighed it like a judge considering evidence and in the end gave a nod george would have described as judicious yes i suppose so the decision made she brightened that will be exciting wont it if the saint does work a miracle for us yes it will george said that was also true if it left him imperfectly satisfied with the way the world was arranged he had no one to blame but himself maybe god had some special reason in mind for restoring to menas the use of his legs and maybe menas would bathe in the spring without having the use of his legs restored till the event you couldnt tell satan might have sent the dream deceiving the nobleman to weaken not only his faith but also that of everyone who watched him bathe or he might have had the dream all on his own imagining he saw st demetrius because he so badly wanted to walk again once more no way to know till the moment come on sophia said theyre not going to wait for the likes of us before they start if we dont hurry now well have to hurry to catch up or we wont be able to see a thing she and theodore waited for no more discussion from their obviously stodgy parents they headed out the door george and irene looked at each other started to laugh and followed george closed the door after them they were far from the only people hurrying toward the market square seeing that the shoemaker caught his wifes eyes and gave her his best itoldyouso look she did her best job of pretending she hadnt seen it which left the match a standoff oh good sophia exclaimed when they got to the square he hasnt left yet sure enough there in the middle of the crowd sat menas utter the poles above the seat where he reclined supporting a brightly dyed canopy that kept the sun off his noble head also there gorgeous in his vestments stood bishop eusebius if this was a true miracle he intended to wring from it every grain of advantage he could not everyone in the market square had come to join the procession some people remained intent on doing the business of an ordinary market day and others detecting outoftheordinary opportunities to turn a profit appeared in the square when they ordinarily would not have there stood paul the taverner for instance with a jar of wine and a dipper selling drinks for a couple of folleis apiece he was doing a brisk business george waved to him calling i thought you were talking about joining the militia where have you been ill get there never fear paul said im a busy man you cant expect me to do everything at once have it your way george answered maybe the taverner would come maybe he wouldnt george hoped he would he liked paul and anyone who could run a tavern and keep it from being a place where men went at each other with knives a couple of times a daywhich pauls emphatically was nothad the makings of a pretty fair underofficer in him besides if paul joined his company he might offer his fellow militiamen discounts on his stock in trade george liked that idea quite a lot look sophia said theyre starting we got here just in time the sniff following that comment spoke volumes on her opinion of parents who had almost made her late for such a spectacle the canopy shielding the limplimbed menas from the sun rose several feet as his bearers lifted the litter in which he lay eusebius preceded it on the way out toward cassanders gate by which the soldiers had left a few days before the bishop sang the trisagionthe thriceholyhymn holy one holy mighty one holy immortal one have mercy on us many voices swelled the hymn as the procession passed under the arch of galerius and out through the gate george sang as loudly as anyone and not much less musically than most a god who would not have mercy on poor but sincere music sent up to glorify his name would have been a hard and unmerciful god indeed for a wonder no one in the crowd added the monophysite clause who was crucified for usto the trisagion that probably would have led to cries of heresy and touched off a brawl if not a lynching and would hardly have been an auspicious way to advance toward a hopedfor miracle singing still the bishop and menas in his litter led the procession toward the monastery of st demetrius the monastery stood near the top of cedrenus hill north of the via egnatia it looked as much like a small fortress as a place of contemplation and worship having been built in the days when the goths rather than the slavs were sniffing around thessalonica those strong stone walls might come in handy again the track up to the monastery was steep and winding and full of rocks someone complained blasphemously about breaking a strap to his sandal george dared hope the fellow would come in before long to have the damage repaired then such notions left him as the procession drew near the spring which bubbled forth from a cleft in the rock of the hillside the setting in the middle of a wooded glade with the monasterys walls visible through the trees off to one side did not seem appropriate for any but prayerful thoughts something was carved into the stone not far from the origin of the spring george curious as usual pushed his way through the crowd so he could read the inscription which was written in square oldfashioned greek letters glory to the shrine and to asclepius who cured my illness here i gaius thynes write this in the second consulship of the emperor trajan he whistled softly this had been a healing place for a long time he didnt know exactly how long trajan had been dead but he knew it had been hundreds of years back then asclepius had ruled the spring sometime in the centuries since st demetrius had taken it from him but the saint had kept it as a place of healing menas bearers undid the side curtains that kept the curious from staring into the rich paralytics litter two of them bent reached inside and brought out their employer who kept one arm around each of their necks menas had a tough fleshy face arms as big and strong as a stonemasons and a broad powerful chest his legs though were pale and shriveled and useless bishop eusebius anointed his forehead with purified oil sketching a cross there that gleamed in the sun the bishop raised his hands in prayer declaiming myrrhexuding great martyr demetrius heal your servant menas in the name of godfather son and holy spirit amen amen george said along with everybody else here in the glade by the hillside spring he no longer doubted menas had had a true dream why st demetrius had chosen to aid the noble rather than some other cripple remained beyond the shoemakers understanding but the saint seemed to have done just that the very air felt pregnant with possibility put me in boys menas said to the bearers his gruff voice matching his appearance but then he spoke in tones of wonder its almost like being baptized again isnt it in no way eusebius answered baptism seals your soul where the spring even if god is kind will heal only your body menas bowed his head outwardly accepting the bishops correction george though could still see his eyes eusebius might speak slightingly of the body but eusebius was not imprisoned in his put me in menas said again even more urgently than before grunting a little under his weight the bearers obeyed placing him in the little pool the spring formed before its water flowed on down the hill eusebius called once more on st demetrius like everyone else george sensed the moment when the healing began maybe the bishops prayer had brought it on george though was more inclined to feel it happened of its own accord or rather that st demetrius would have interceded whether eusebius had been there to pray or not power thrummed in the air in the ground and most of all no doubt in the water in which menas lay and which poured over him out of the cleft in the rock george breathed deeply as if hoping he could suck some of that power into himself and bring it down out of this place and into his daytoday life in thessalonica menas splashed about in the pool as if he were bathing that reminded george he ought to visit the city baths himself one day soon they werent so busy as they had been before thessalonica became a christian town or so the bath attendants said whether to drum up business or from a genuine tradition handed down with their strigils but they were open bishop eusebius started to send up yet another prayer to st demetrius he had hardly begun when menas gasped it took a good deal to silence a bishop in the middle of a prayer but that gasp did the job it was as if all the power immanent in that place had sprung forth in a single awesmitten inhalation of breath menas stood up in the pool for a moment george simply accepted that menas strength and agility seemed so natural he took them for granted then memory caught up with vision half a man had gone into the pool but a whole man came out water dripping in sparkling streams from the hem of his tunic his legs which had been thin and wasted were now as thick and solid as his arms thank you st demetrius he said bless you st demetrius he turned to the men who had borne him in the litter for so many years take that cursed thing back to my house and burn it im never going to get into it again nobles often traveled through the streets in litters not least to show those who werent nobles how important they were george though could understand why menas was willing to forgo that particular kind of aggrandizement let us thank god for the miracle he has given us this day eusebius said george gladly thanked god for letting him witness a miracle miracles were by their very nature rare had they happened every day they would hardly have been miraculous how will you celebrate this miracle someone called to menas the burly noble mulled that over but not for long i am going to celebrate it with my wife he declared a reply that made george realize menas legs had not been the only parts of him that did not work a good many other people realized that at about the same time as the shoemaker their ribald whoops echoed through the glade that had been full of the sounds of prayer only moments before eusebius looked furious he raised his eyes to the heavens perhaps hoping divine wrath would follow hard on the heels of divine mercy if so he was disappointed the day remained bright and warm and clear and no lightning bolt came smashing down on the people in the grove he is going in unto his wife someone behind george said and the scriptures do tell us it is better to marry than to burn menas has been crippled a long time george observed so i wouldnt be surprised if hes burning now with determined stride the noble headed away from the spring the procession back to thessalonica was a lot less orderly and less united in purpose than the one that had led to the sacred spring some people still hymned gods praise bishop eusebius remained incandescently angry the men who had carried menas about for so many years looked worried and george understood why with the noble walking again would he still have work for them but most people like the shoemaker were chiefly concerned about getting back to the city so they could return to work come on he said gathering up his family miracles are all very well but you cant eat them no sophia said what about the loaves and fishes and manna from heaven theodore put in all i know about them is that they didnt happen in thessalonica george returned and this wasnt our miracle it was menas the only way it can do us any good is for him to want to buy shoes from our shop irene sighed that would take another miracle i fear songs rang out in the city when word of the miracle came paul did a brisk business selling wine to the people returning from the monastery of st demetrius several other taverners came out to try to do the same george hoped paul who had been thoughtful enough to get there ahead of everyone else reaped the reward for his cleverness after the cool freshness of the glade around the sacred spring after the power that had manifested itself there at the spring going back into the cramped dark shoemakers shop stinking of leather made george sigh then he shook his head if i wanted to work outdoors all the time i would have to be a farmer or a woodsman he enjoyed the woods and the fieldsbut not that much talking with sheep or partridges is not my idea of spending time in good company and what is your idea of good company theodore asked with a glint of mischief in his eye halfdrunk militiamen better than sons who dont show their fathers proper respect george shot back which won him a giggle from irene and better yet sudden silence from theodore that was rare enough to come close to being a miracle in and of itself but george did not bask in the warm glow of victory for long picking up his tools was anything but delightful all at once no matter how skillfully he punched a pattern into leather he had trouble believing any of it mattered what was the point why did he bother and then when he was feeling at his lowest the rich man who had ordered the boots came into the shop those are splendid germanus exclaimed much better than i thought theyd be not only did he put them on and wear them out of the shop he paid george a couple of miliaresia more than the price on which they had agreed george stared after him the weight of the money sweet in his palm do you know he said slowly looking down at the coins in its own little way that may be a miracle as wondrous as the one god worked for menas through st demetrius neither his wife nor his children argued with him on the practice field near the hippodrome john put down his spear and pointed up the street may i be sent to eternal damnation if that isnt paul he exclaimed in delight georges opinion was that the profane tavern performer risked eternal damnation whenever he opened his mouth that however did not seem a helpful comment the more so as john was all too likely to agree with it the shoemaker contented himself by saying it does look like him doesnt it dactylius whose trade had left him a trifle shortsighted peered in the general direction from which the taverner was coming yes that is paul isnt it he said a good deal later than he should have rufus set hands on hips and awaited the new arrival so you think you can be a soldier do you he growled i dont see why not the taverner answered if you can do the job it cant be too hard the veterans smile was fierce and predatory god will punish you for thatand if he doesnt i will his sword slid out of its scabbard with a sound like a snakes hiss lets see what you can do in the practice that followed rufus could have killed paul a dozen times over everyone saw as much but paul refused to let it worry him and after rufus finally resheathed his sword the taverner did well not only with the bow but also with the spear rufus rubbed his chin considering at last he said as long as you keep them away from you you may live if they get close run for your life like youve got satan on your tail how does that sound see what kind of wine you get served the next time you stick your nose into my tavern paul said which made rufus let out a carefully rationed grunt of laughter john greeted the new volunteer with a sour expression you were supposed to be funnier than that he said pauls face glistened with sweat he looked down his nose at the other militiaman people were saying the same thing about you the last time you came and did your routine in my place shall we get back to drill dactylius asked eager as usual to spread oil on troubled waters we all need to get better has anyone heard anything about what the city garrison is doing not a word george said and everyone around him nodded he didnt let it worry him he hadnt expected news so soon he wondered whether any word would get back to thessalonica before the soldiers came home to tell the tale themselves with so much disorder south of the danube maybe not rufus came striding over he was an old man yes but a tough old man a frightening old man when he transfixed dactylius with a glare it was as if hed shoved a spear into him heres something for you to think about he rumbled suppose youre a scout in the woods you make a noise or some fool thing and about twenty different slavs all start running right toward where youre at what do you do then run dactylius exclaimed turning pale at the prospect george snorted then tried to pretend he hadnt the little jeweler had given an utterly honest answer if it wasnt the one rufus was looking for though dactylius was going to be in trouble george wasnt the only one laughing either and some of the others didnt try to hide it rufus turned that fearsome gaze on them run is the right answer he said youre outnumbered like that what else can you do but what should you do while youre running pray to god for a miracle like the one he gave menas dactylius said pray to god you dont shit yourself while youre running john said one case of long odds one case of a big mouth rufus remarked he turned to george as he often did when he wanted a question answered in a particular way what should you do while youre running if you can you should probably lead the slavs back toward the main body of your force so you wont be so outnumbered when they catch up to you thats the right idea rufus said approvingly dont just run think while youre doing it your wits are as good a weapon as your sword he glowered at john thats true for most people anyhow the tavern funny man blew him a kiss as if hed paid him a compliment the look rufus sent up toward god was as grim as the ones he gave the militiamen dactylius said but what if you dont want the enemy to know where your main mass of troops is what do you do then for once rufus sour features uncurdled thats a good question he said in tones implying a good question was the last thing hed expected he turned to george again what are some of the things you might do george thought before he spoke the answer here was less obvious than the other for which rufus had asked him at last he said one thing you might do is try to make the enemy think you have a lot of soldiers close by even if you dont thats right rufus big gray head went up and down up and down a friend of mine saved himself from the gothsor was it the franksback in italy doing that very thing you got to think fast when youre fighting on account of you dont usually get the chance to think slow now lets get back to work so you dont have to think about fighting at all the more you think in handtohand the worse off youre going to be john looked around at his fellow militiamen his gaze finally fell oil sabbatius were in good shape there by the mother of god some of us have trouble thinking even when were not in handtohand sabbatius pudgy face reddened are you practicing your jokes on me youre not as funny as you think you are ill tell you that he would have sounded more impressively angry though had he seemed more certain john was really insulting him in truth sabbatius wasnt so bright as he might have been despite that george said enough he was looking at john as he went on the idea is were all supposed to be on the same side if you make people hate you they wont help you when we really have to fight johns eyes widened in spite of everything he didnt look to have realized that the militia might have to fight he lobbed insults as automatically as he breathed to underscore the point george threw back his head and did his best to imitate the fearsome howl of a slavic wolfdemon before john could say anything insulting or otherwise rufus nodded again george has it right he declared i remember in italy when one part of the army didnt get along with the rest you couldnt trust them at your back so you were more afraid of them than of the goths works the same way here if you get in trouble you have to know your chums are going to come and pull you out of it if you cant be sure of that you might as well give up and go home before you ever start george nodded that made sense rufus commonly made sense though he had such a rough tongue that you sometimes wished hed keep quiet more often if you could stand to listen to him though it usually repaid the effort sabbatius did his best to look sly it put george in mind of a public woman trying to look chaste but that he kept to himself turning to paul sabbatius said you see youd better keep us in wine if you expect us to take care of you no thats not what rufus meant dactylius said earnestly we dont help each other from hope of reward we help each other because thats what we need to do when we go fight most of you lugs understand what im talking about rufus said the ones who dont his shoulders moved up and down in a shrug all we can hope is that god will have mercy on them when they see him on account of we already know theyre going to see him pretty fornicating quick that comment left the militiamenperhaps even including sabbatiusthoughtful when they returned to their exercises mosquitoes buzzed in the night crickets chirped somewhere not far outside the walls of thessalonica an owl hooted since it was nighttime george knew the pagan greeks would have taken that for a good sign a sign athena was nearby even he good and believing christian though he was got nervous on the rare times when he heard an owl calling by daylight he looked out from the wall west toward the woods and toward the monastery of st matrona which was a little fortress in its own right it was far enough from the city that it disappeared from view or nearly so at night or during the misty days so common by the sea beside george sabbatius whistled while he walked the shoemaker glanced over at his companion in some annoyance though sabbatius was only another dim shape in the darkness cant you put a stopper in that george said if there are barbarians lurking in the bushes theyll know just where we are so what sabbatius answered cheerfully you cant shoot a bow for anything during the night and i like to whistle id like it more if you did it less often or if you did it better george told him that seeming likelier to have good results than something like if you dont quit making noises like a starling with its tail caught in a door im going to sew your lips shut he might as well have said exactly what he meant for sabbatius grumbled youre as bad as john and subsided into hurt silence since it was silence george had no trouble putting up with the hurt that informed it when he didnt apologize that only hurt sabbatius more somewhere out in the woods a wolf howled sabbatius gasped and tried to yank out his sword and nock an arrow at the same time thereby succeeding none too well at either task i think thats only a wolf not one of the slavs demons george said hearing it doesnt make your blood turn to water no eh sabbatius was breathing hard the howl had given him a good fright well i think it was one all right george said i might be wrong he didnt feel like arguing about it for one thing he had no way to prove he was right for another arguing with sabbatius wasnt usually interesting enough to be entertaining he yawned the two of them had the middle watch this time eventually he would be able to go home and go back to bed at the moment eventually felt a long way away sabbatius in a touchy mood decided to be offended because george wouldnt passionately insist he was correct you must not think you know much he said loftily next time by the virgin ill bring needle and thread and i will sew his lips shut one thing he did know though was not to quarrel with a fool we are supposed to be on the same side he reminded sabbatius well yes his comrade said with the air of a man making a great concession but he stopped suddenly with a wordless exclamation of dismay flailing his hands around his head gah a bat it almost flew into my face they eat bugs i think george scratched a mosquito bite im in favor of anything that eats bugs this one looked like it wanted to eat me sabbatius returned didnt you see its glittering eyes i didnt see it at all that was true but it had the effect of offending sabbatius all over again as if george had called him a liar george had done nothing of the sort but trying to convince sabbatius of that would have been more trouble than it was worth he sighed and kept quiet and then suddenly the bat was fluttering in front of him hed never paid bats much attention they skimmed through the night when he mostly stayed indoors he was sure though hed never seen one like this sabbatius might not have been bright but he knew what hed seen the bats eyes did glitter red as blood its teeth glittered too as if it wanted to sink them into something larger and more flavorful than a moth or a mosquito of itself georges hand shaped the sign of the cross the bats eyes no longer glittered just for a moment they glowed as if torches had been kindled behind them then the creature flew away or for all george knew it simply disappeared at any rate it no longer flapped its wings in front of his face he turned to sabbatius you were right that was a large bat what you mean you did see it too now sabbatius sounded amazed i dont know whether it was the same one you saw but i saw a bat yes when george changed his mind or found hed made a mistake he said so straight out he never had quite figured out why that caused so much surprise and even consternation among his fellow human beings but it did more often than not it was a nasty sort of thing wasnt it sabbatius said soberly he said ive had visitors i liked bettereven my motherinlaw come to think of it that was a slander upon irenes mother before helena had died of the plague in the epidemic a couple of years earlier she had been as pleasant a woman as anyone could want to know you can be a funny fellow georgeyou know that sabbatius said and youre not mean when youre funny the way john is oh i dont know the shoemaker replied my motherinlaw god rest her soul would have thought you were wrong he let a judicious pause stretch but irene would be angry if i called her a bat heh hehif you called her a bat heh heh sabbatius shoulders shook with laughter thats good i wish id thought of that so i could have said it for myself very likely sabbatius would be saying it at any chance he got people who hadnt heard it before might be impressed for those who had heard it it would soon be one more cliche in sabbatius arsenal george sometimes wondered howor ifhis companion thought when he didnt have a maxim handy the shoemaker strode along the wall looking out into the darkness beyond the city with fresh intensity looking availed him little for all he knew a vast army of large bats with glittering red eyes and glittering white teeth flapped and flew out there just beyond where his eyes could reach all at once he turned and strode to the opposite side of the walkway atop the wall the side that let him see down into thessalonica in the middle of the night though the city was nearly as dark as the rough and overgrown country beyond it what are you doing sabbatius asked its almost like you think the bats are spying on us or something george hadnt thought that no george hadnt fully realized he thought that but once sabbatius said it he knew it was true he wished the satyr hed met had mentioned these bats along with the wolves then he would have had a better idea of whether he was shying at shadows with the notion firmly planted in his mind he was going to worry till he found out about them one way or the other he shook his head no again if he found out about the bats one way he would stop worrying if he found out about them the other hed worry more than ever he kept on staring into thessalonica though he knew it was likely to be futile with so few lights burning he wasnt likely to spot a bat if one was there to be spotted and even less likely to recognize it for what it was no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than something flew in front of a torch burning outside a little church in the heart of the city it was gone almost before hed seen it and even if it had been there it might well have been a nightjar swooping after insects drawn to the light of the torch so he told himself again and again he wished he would have had an easier time making himself believe it when rufus and dactyliusas odd a pair in their way as george and sabbatius were in theirscame up to take the beforesunrise shift on the wall george told them of what he and his partner had seen i dont know what it means he said but you ought to know about it if the sign of the cross will make the creatures run uh flyaway we should be all right dactylius said rufus drew his sword from its scabbard this has the shape of the cross too he said holding up the weapon if we cant drive off the cursed things we can always kill them he lived in a simple world not the same sort of simple world as did sabbatius for he clearly saw more facets to it than did the rather stupid militiaman but simple in the sense that he firmly believed every problem possessed in uncomplicated direct and usually obvious solution george wished he could believe something as satisfying is that anything else rufus asked george and sabbatius shook their heads the veteran went on well i expect a hero like dactylius and mell be able to keep any giant bats from flying off with the city till the sun comes up why dont you boys go on home and get some sleep that was uncomplicated direct and obvious so far is george could see it overlooked no hidden difficulties some problems were simple george descended from the wall and headed back to the dwelling above his shop he kept looking for bats all the way there though that he saw none relieved him only a little george peered back toward thessalonica though hills hid it from view he liked living in the city but he also liked escaping from it from time to time with luck hed bring back some game for irene to throw in the pot or some mushrooms to make a stew more interesting without luck he shook his head here he was in the fresh air away from city stinks if that wasnt luck what was he looked around somewhere not far from here he had met the satyr that had started him worrying about the slavs and avars and their gods and demons he hoped he would meet the creature again or another of its land bishop eusebiusany priestwould have set a penance on him for entertaining that kind of hope his broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug for one thing he hoped he might learn more from the satyr than he had at their previous meeting and for another he was curious he tried not to admit that even to himself but he had never been much good at such mental games so long as he stayed on the roadthe track really he was unlikely to meet up with the satyr or any other supernatural creature almost all the men who used the road these days were christians they carried the power of their faith with them making areas they frequented uncomfortable for lesser powers not only that rabbits were easier to find off the beaten track and so george plunged into the woods he had a bow and an arrow in his hands a full quiver on his back and a knife at his belt if brigands wanted him they would have a busy time of it before they finally pulled him down he moved as smoothly and quietly as he could he was no great scout to slip among the trees with neither animals nor men having the slightest notion he was anywhere nearby he knew thatand if he hadnt known it rufus would have got the idea across to him in no uncertain terms but he seldom came home emptyhanded when he went out hunting so he supposed plenty were worse at the game than he too something behind a bush moved george nocked the arrow he carried then settled into immobility out from behind the bush came a mouse george let out a silent sigh if he hit the little animal with an arrow there wouldnt be enough left to take home i should have brought along a cat he thought smiling at the conceit in a leather sack on his belt he had some cheese some bread a little flask of olive oil in which to dip the bread and a fine fat onion he also had a wineskin on his belt he knew he could drink water instead but that didnt mean he wanted to besides the sweet scent of wine might help lure a satyr his way as it had before when shadows and his belly both said it was more or less noon he sat down on a log to eat the food irene had packed for him the mouse was the nearest thing to game hed seen all day if he didnt come across somethingor even that patch of mushrooms hed thought about beforeby evening his wife would have some pungent things to say to him when he got back to town he shrugged that had happened before it was sure as need be to happen again he had bread in one hand and the little flask of oil in the other when a hedgehog perhaps disturbed by his sitting on the log came out and scurried over to a nearby drift of leaves in which it took refuge he knew people who ate hedgehogs when they caught them he didnt get up and go after this one he wasnt any of those people he tore off a piece of the loaf irene had baked put oil on it and had just taken a bite when a couple of men came out of the woods they froze when they saw him he froze when he saw them tooall but his eyes which flicked this way and that till hed made exact note of where hed set down his bow one of the newcomers had a bow of his own the other carried several javelins those might have been good for hunting deeror for hunting men both of them wore long wool tunics with fierce beasts embroidered in bright colors at the chest and shoulders george had never seen tunics like those before after a moment he realized the strangers were slavs but for the tunics they didnt look outstandingly peculiar true they wore beards but some roman rustics wore beards too they were stocky and fairskinned with light brown hair shiny with grease of some sort one of them had light eyes the other dark they wore he noted excellent boots they seemed as nonplused to encounter george as he was on meeting them he didnt want to fight unless he had to holding up the bread he called in latin come and share i have enough he didnt not to satisfy three men but a little hunger was supposed to be good for the soul the slavs didnt come forward they didnt go back either he called to them again this time in greek they spoke back and forth to each other in a coughing guttural language george had never heard before at last when he was wondering whether he ought to grab for the bow they did approach him both of them held right hands up palms out either they meant peace or they were trying to lull him into thinking so one of them took out bread of his own a lumpy looking dark brown loaf nowhere near so fine as the one irene had given george the slav tore off a chunk and handed it to the shoemaker in return george offered him some of his own loaf the slav took a bite and looked pleased george held out the little flask of olive oil the slav took it sniffed made a face and passed the flask to his comrade that fellow also looked disgusted the two of them spoke emphatically in their own language george didnt understand a word of it but odds were it meant something like how can you stand to eat that stuff as far as he was concerned bread by itself was boring that went double for what the slav had given him it was dense and chewy and he guessed made from a mix of barley and wheat it would no doubt keep a man alive for a long time although after a while he might not want to go on living on such rations then the slav with the dark hair took out a flask of his own it proved to hold not olive oil but honey with honey the bread definitely became more palatable george shared out his cheese the slavs approved of that they gave him some sundried pears and plums in return he untied the rawhide cord around the neck of the wineskin and handed the skin to the blueeyed slav the fellow swigged his larynx working he passed the skin to his darker friend who also drank courteously though he made sure he did not empty the skin before returning it to george after everyone had finished eating the slavs tried talking with him some more the effort was vigorous but useless they spoke their own guttural language and fragments of another that sounded even strangermaybe it was the avars tongue whatever it was it made no sense to george he gave them latin and greek the only two languages he knew as hed already concluded they didnt understand those by signs he showed them what hed been doing out in the woods they laughed at his impression of a hopping rabbit he laughed too as he bounded about but he was careful not to let them get between him and his bow when he was done bounding he did his best with gestures and questioning looks to ask why they were here they looked at each other and talked for a couple of minutes in their own incomprehensible language before trying to reply when they did their gestures were anything but clear maybe that was because they werent very good at sign language on the other hand maybe it was because they didnt want him to understand why they had suddenly appeared only a few miles outside of thessalonica maybe they were hunting for animals from the way they leapt and crept and shaded their eyes with their hands that was possible and maybe they were hunting for thessalonica itself that was as plausible an interpretation they didnt ask george where it was had they done so he might have told them it wasnt as if a city that size was hard to find face to face with two veritable slavs he decided to learn what he could from them even if they had not a word in common pointing to them to get their attention he threw back his head and imitated as best he could the howls he had heard from the woods the howls he believed to have come from the throats of the slavic wolfdemons the satyr had described he hadnt known he owned such a gift for mimicry the wailing cry that burst from his throat was almost as frightening as those he had heard on the walls of thessalonica he did not judge that merely by his own reaction to the noise he made the woods around him grew suddenly still as they might have at a real wolf s or a real wolfdemonshowl and the two slavs after starting when he first began that cry nodded and grinned to show they recognized it and to show they understood he meant a spirit of their folk rather than a mere fleshly beast of prey they spoke several incomprehensible sentences once more though he followed not a single word he assigned meaning to the whole something like yes those are ours pretty impressive arent they he wished he really could have talked with the barbarians so he might have learned more and brought it back to thessalonica that he was thinking of getting back to his home city again was a sign he didnt believe the slavs intended to try murdering him but he still stayed wary enough to remember exactly where his bow was then one of the slavs clumsily made the sign of the cross george didnt think for a moment that meant the fellow was a christian and indeed the barbarian followed the gesture by pointing and saying something that was plainly a question thats the god you follow isnt it yes im a christian george said first in latin and then in greek the two sentences sounding very much alike he crossed himself slowly and reverently showing the slav how it should be done having done so he looked up into the heavens but not at the sun not wanting to give the barbarians the mistaken notion that it was his god they asked him something else he couldnt figure out what it was the one with brown eyes pointed roughly in the direction of thessalonica and made the sign of the cross once more he crossed himself over and over again then raised an interrogative eyebrow at george oh i see what you mean the shoemaker said yes everyone in thessalonica is a christian he nodded vigorously about then he realized he wasnt being fair to the jews in the city but people were hardly ever fair to the jews so he felt no great urgency about redressing the balance now the blueeyed slav crossed himself then strutted around looking fierce and dangerous then looked another question at george what the question was supposed to be puzzled him he scratched his head a moment later he had the answer yes god is a strong god god is the strongest god god is the only true god the words meant nothing to the two slavs george crossed himself then flexed his biceps then nodded back at the barbarians he wished the lord would give him a miracle like the one he had granted to menas no miracle came though or perhaps one did the slavs understood him not the least of concerns when he and the barbarians had no words in common george glanced heavenward again art thou so subtle lord he asked silently and got no answer he did get what was if not miraculous at the least a display of gods loving kindness having shared with him food and drink and such conversation as could be carried on with hands and bodies and faces the two slavs picked up their weapons and instead of trying to use those weapons against him waved nodded and went back into the woods hail and farewell george called after them in latin when they had disappeared among the oaks and beeches he allowed himself the luxury of a long sigh of relief meeting them had been far more dangerous than encountering the satyr as beasts long hunted grew leery of men so the satyr rightly feared the superior power of the christian god but the wild slavs were unfamiliar with his might and so it held no terror for them george shook his head no time for philosophy now he said out loud whatever else its good for it doesnt fill your belly he got to his feet set an arrow in his bowstring and went on looking for rabbits he made sure he walked in a direction different from the one the slavs had chosen lest they think he was following them and decided theyd made a mistake by not picking a fight with him in the clearing maybe god having worked a small subtle miracle if he had worked a small subtle miracle and it hadnt been skill at pantomime or blind luck for george was keeping a closer eye on him than he had before or maybe george was keeping a closer eye on the terrain around him than he had before or maybe the shoemaker had simply wandered into a country more richly stocked with rabbits than that through which hed been going during the morning whatever the reason in the space of a couple of hours hed killed five and would have had a couple more if hed been a better archer he recovered one of the shafts with which hed missed the other hit a rock and splintered and he couldnt find the iron point no matter how hard he looked he wondered if he ought to hunt more while his luck was so good but decided against it he was not the sort of man much given to pushing anything to extremes moderation was not the only thing that made him decide to head back to thessalonica also in his mindin quite a prominent place therewas that having encountered two slavs in these woods he might come on more and one happy outcome was no guarantee of a second even the gate guards were militiamen these days though not from his company he showed them the rabbits they congratulated him he said not a word about the two easy kills hed missed he didnt say anything to irene about the kills hed missed either as best he could he downplayed his confrontation with the two slavs he knew perfectly well his best was not good enough and that he would hear about it later from her for the moment in front of the children she matched his restraint theodore was excited by the meeting you should have fought them father he made cutandthrust motions with an awl as if it were a sword rufus would laugh at you george said id laugh at you myself if i werent worn out when one man goes out looking for two to take on its most often because hes drunk his wits away his son let out a loud sniff it was george thought no wonder they recruited soldiers from among lads of about his sons age they were strong aggressive and most of all stupid if their superiors ordered them to rush out and get themselves killed theyd do it and thank the officers for the privilege sophia said somebody besides us should know the slavs have come so close to the city yes i think youre right george answered with a sigh he touched the rabbits hed set down on the counter i wanted to bring these home first of all so your mother could start dealing with them but as soon as id taken care of that i figured the best thing i could do was pay a visit to bishop eusebius getting to see the prelate of thessalonica would not have been easy for an ordinary shoemaker at any time getting in to see him when he was not only prelate but also de facto prefect of the city would have been doubly difficult but when george went to the basilica of st demetrius he knew the magic words that got him past the lesser priests and scribes those lesser worthies hustled him past the silverdomed ciborium topping the saints tomb past the basilicas brilliant wall and ceiling mosaics and straight into the little office adjoining the church wherein the bishop labored when not performing the divine liturgy in that office eusebius looked more like a bureaucrat than a prelate the desk behind which he sat was piled high with papyri ink smudged the fingers of his right hand he was scribbling a note when george came in and set down his reed pen with every sign of relief whats this i hear he asked in a greek so educated and archaic george had trouble following it is it accurately reported to me that you met two of the revolting barbarians in the woods earlier today yes your excellency i did george stuck with his latin the tongue in which he felt most at home eusebius understood him and motioned for him to go on the bishop probably thought him on the uncultured side that didnt bother him by eusebius standards he was on the uncultured side he described the meeting with the slavs and his attempt to explain christianity or at least its potency to them well done the bishop said making the sign of the cross en touto nika as if making a great concession he turned that greek into latin in hoc signo vinces then he returned to his own preferred language very well you shared your food with the barbarians what beyond their mere presence prompted you to report all this to me you understand their presence is of some concern in and of itself with the garrison gone which is why i had you admitted to my presence but ive come to bring this to your notice for two reasons your excellency george said one is that the slavs as best they could without using words made it plain to me that they were looking not just for supper but for thessalonica bishop eusebius attention had wandered now it snapped back to the shoemaker that is not good he said with the war that has gone on between us romans on the one hand and the slavs and avars on the other i do not want to hear reports that the barbarians are seeking our godguarded city he held up a beringed elegantly manicured hand do not mistake me by that i do not mean i am ungrateful for your having brought this word to me only that i wish you had no need to do so i understand george assured him he studied the bishop with an odd mixture of distaste and admiration the word that came to mind for eusebius was slick slick as fine olive oil or an icy pavement slickness could be wonderfully useful or unexpectedly dangerous depending on circumstances george gave a mental shrug thinking as if i have the power to pass judgment on those placed over me aloud he went on the other reason i thought i ought to bring them to your notice is because they admitted the wolfdemons that have been howling outside the walls belong to them did they eusebius said softly yes george had his attention now what did they say of them tell me everything you remember george got the distinct impression that if eusebius was dissatisfied with his report he would go after more detail with lash and rack and heated pincers they didnt say anything your excellency since we couldnt talk with each other the shoemaker replied he detailed the exchange then added ive heard your excellency that these demons can attack a priest even after hes made the sign of the cross is that so eusebius eyes went hooded unfathomable george knew what that meant the bishop was figuring out whether to he to him and if so what sort of he to tell but at last eusebius answered yes it is as a matter of fact though ill thank you for not spreading it broadcast through the city i also remind you that evil is no less evil for being powerful only more deadly i understand that george saiddid eusebius take him for a lackwit well maybe eusebius did you did not hear of the vicious power of these demons from the slavs you encountered today eusebius asked he answered his own question no of course you did not for by your own statement you and they had no words in common his gaze sharpened where then did you hear this about them george abruptly wished hed kept his mouth shut he didnt know whether lying to the bishop or telling him the truth was the worse choice eusebius had told him the truth or at least he thought the bishop had he decided to return the favor a satyr told me the last time i was out hunting in the woods eusebius hadnt been looking for that his eyebrows climbed up toward his hairline and he let out a hiss that made george wonder if he were part viper on his mothers side then he crossed himself as if the shoemaker were himself a relic of a creed outworn when george failed either to vanish or to turn into some loathsome demon the bishop regained control of himself that is abold admission to make he said picking his words with obvious care why george asked stolidly without the satyr you wouldnt have had this news and i think its important dont you on that we do not disagree eusebius said on a good many other matters i suspect such a statement would be as false as any from ananias lips maybe george said stolid still but i didnt come here to tell you about anything else underneath that impassive shell he was troubled once a bishop started worrying aboutand worrying atyour theology he generally didnt let go till hed made you sorry you ever crossed his path and eusebius being more aggressively pious than a lot of his fellows had a worse name for that than most the inspirationif not divine certainly convenient struck george because youre prefect now your excellency or pretty much prefect anyway i was sure you wouldnt want any danger to come to thessalonica of course not eusebius said at once protecting the city is the most important thing i can do the garrison being gone and the secular leaders away petitioning the emperor maurice sure enough george had managed to distract him to make him think of thessalonica rather than satyrs how can we fight demons that defeat even holy priests the shoemaker asked wanting to keep eusebius mind away from him and on the bigger picture thats only proper george thought remembering the mosaics that made the basilica of st demetrius so splendid if you look at one tessera you dont see anything in particular but if you look at what all the tiles do when theyre working together hed also chosen the right question to ask eusebius the bishop said we canwe shallwe mustdo two things first we must reconsecrate ourselves and bring our lives into closer accord with gods will so that other powers will be less able to get a grip on us and second we must make certain the walls of thessalonica remain strong and the militia alert for have you not seen how such sorceries seek to weaken not just the spiritual but also the material defenses set against them and those who make them yes i have seen that your excellency george answered surprised now in his turn he hadnt figured eusebius would reckon material defenses as important is he obviously did the bishop said what else have you learned of the powers the slavs in their ignorance prefer to the holy truth of god he did not ask where george had learned whatever else hed learned the shoemaker took that as a tacit promise not to raise the issue of satyrs anymore he didnt mention his source again either replying i hear they have other powers nearly as strong as the wolves i cannot really speak about that because of what ive seen with my own eyes though when i was on sentrygo one night i did see a bat or maybe two bats that werent like any natural bats ive spied before are you certain of this eusebius asked no your excellency george said at once plenty of people must know more about bats than i do but i cant think of anyone who knows less who pays attention to bats who indeed the bishop said well god willing perhaps we shall yet be able to keep thessalonica from being interred in a bloodfilled barbarous sarcophagus if this be so you george shall have played no small part in the preservation of the city thanks to this information you have brought me i am grateful and no doubt god is grateful as well he started fiddling with his pen a sure sign hed given george all the time hed intended george rose and after bowing to eusebius made his way out of the prelates office as he strode up its central aisle he paid more attention to the basilica of st demetrius than he was in the habit of doing just being inside the church dedicated to the martial saint made him feel stronger and braver than he did anywhere else in the city more like a real soldier than a militiaman after walking past the ciborium and then out of the basilica he turned back toward it and sketched a salute of the same sort as he might have given to rufus if st demetrius could extend his influence over all of thessalonica if he could make everyone feel stronger than without his intercession that might help if the two slavs george had encountered outside the city were as he feared the harbingers of more but as george walked north and mostly west back toward his shop his home his family and away from the shrine the feeling faded until he was only himself again and oddly diminished on account of that he forced his shoulders to straighten and his stride to lengthen even without the saint s beneficent influence close by he remained himself bloodfilled barbarous sarcophagus he muttered under his breath which made a woman walking in the other direction give him a strange look and move a little farther away from him he didnt blame her he would have moved away from anyone mumbling about a bloodfilled sarcophagus too it s eusebius fault he thought the bishop pulled out funereal images at any excuse or none george glanced toward the walls of thessalonica surely they would not be the walls of a stone coffin to enclose the corpse of the city he shook his head hes got me doing it he said which made someone else give him a sidelong glance irene rounded on him when he walked in the door i thought you werent coming back she said indignantly i thought eusebius wouldnt let you come back you told him about the satyr didnt you she didnt wait for him to answer i knew you were going to tell him about the satyr why did you go and tell him about the satyr it was either that or tell him lies george answered would you rather i told a holy man lies of course i would irene answered with the same certainty and lack of hesitation george used when imparting what was with luck wisdom to theodore or more rarely sophia how could you be so foolish as to think otherwise her tone demanded george usually accepted such rebukes from her because he knew he usually deserved them when he got them today though he balked i went to tell the bishop about the slavs and about their demons he said it was only natural for him to ask how i knew what i knew when he did ask me that i didnt see what choice i had but to tell him the truth so he could know how seriously to take the news i was giving him irene muttered something under her breath george thought it was men but felt disinclined to inquire more closely as with theology some of the more subtle points of marriage were better taken on faith than examined under the piercing lamp of reason in any case irene had a good deal to say that wasnt under her breath if he had taken you seriously george he might have felt he had to do something like ask questions about how you came to be talking with a satyr not chasing it off with the sign of the cross the look in her eye said she still wondered the same thing she was more pious than he she went on would you really have liked say a couple of years penance for doing that no i wouldnt have liked that he admitted but i didnt think he would do anything to me because the news was more important than how i got it before she could interrupt he held up a hand and i was right remember thati was right he felt no small sense of pride in an argument with irene he seldom got to say that as things turned out it did him no good even when he did get to say it it was a foolish chance to take irene retorted what you gained by doing it wasnt worth the risk i thought it was george said but that took the argument out of the realm of fact and back into opinion he tried a slightly different tack its done now and it worked out all right irene thought that over then grudgingly nodded that meant the argument was over too which suited george fine iii more people began encountering slavs in the woods a couple of men who went out hunting didnt come back george was on a search party that went out after one of them he found no trace of the missing hunter he found no trace that the man had fallen foul of the slavs but nothing to prove the fellow hadnt either whatever had happened to him he never showed his face in thessalonica again george along with most other people suspected the worst the roads from the north grew crowded with farmers fleeing the evergrowing presence of the slavsand presumably their avar overlords though the slavs were the folk on everyones lips some of the peasants took refuge in the city others kept going hoping to find lands he barbarians would not penetrate with the peasants came priests and monks driven from churches and monasteries by the inroads of the barbarians the monks many of them took refuge in the monasteries surrounding thessalonica the priests came into the city itself to help serve its churches while theirs lay under the control of the slavs and avars suddenly the divine services had far more officiants than were needed so that the holy men had to take turns performing them when the refugee priests were not celebrating the liturgy they gathered in the market square and told their harrowing tales to whoever would listen and perhaps toss a follis or two into the begging bowls they put out in front of them george wondered whether the copper coins they collected would go to the ravaged churches from which they had fled to the churches of thessalonica in which they sheltered or into their own pouches he did not know whether others had that same doubt people who were clever enough to have the question occur to them were also clever enough not to voice it the priests drew considerable crowds george listened along with everyone else but kept his money to himself as long as the priests talked about the merely human destruction they had experienced or seen the world was a harsh place and war unceasing unfortunate certainly but also unsurprising but then one of the refugees a man who by his theatrical gestures and carefully balanced sentences had had more than the usual share of rhetorical training said nor is the energy from this vicious and brutal plunder and rapine derived from this world alone for the slavs and avars bring with them a new host of barbarous powers against whom the true god and his son jesus christ shall have to contend and whom they shall have to overcome by virtue of their superior prowess someonenot georgecalled out doesnt the lord cast out all demons after a moment the shoemaker recognized johns voice not content with scoring points off people in the taverns he frequented and off his fellow militiamen now he was trying to get a priest angry at him if john lived to be old george would be astonished the priest however took the question seriously answering in the end the triumph of the lord is inevitable so it has been written so it shall be but the path to that end is not known and much misery surely lies along it until it be traveled to the fullest george waited to hear what john would make of that the tavern comic made nothing whatever of it falling silent instead as silently george wished his friend would show such good sense more often for now the spirits attending the slavs and avars being puffed up with arrogance on account of the victories those folk have won over us christians vaunt themselves and exult in their strength and are difficult even for pious folk to withstand successfully the priest said which was not only true but explained to his audience why he and his fellows had had to retreat from the slavic powers instead of easily beating them as the old pagan greek spirits were beaten these days we must do not what we want to do but what god wants us to do his audience murmured in approval but then unfortunately john started up again asking the priest what does that mean what god wants us to do should we be more fierce so we can beat the barbarians and make their powers weaken or should we be more pious so god will take better care of us the priest gaped at him if hed just answered both he would have done well and probably made john shut up an act of virtue in itself but john had asked whether it meant one or the other and the priest whose wits were excusably perhaps not at their swiftest then took it that way and that way only any reply he gave then was but half a truth and worse contradicted the other half after tossing the priest a couple of coppers george elbowed his way through the crowd and caught john by the arm the tavern comic whirled he started to grab for the knife on his belt before he saw who had hold of him just in case he didnt feel like stoppinghis temper could turn nastygeorge squeezed a little harder he had large strong hands come along with me he said in a pleasant tone of voice suppose i dont feel like it john said he wasnt going for his knife but he wasnt coming along either george started walking he did not let go of john since he was bigger and stronger than his fellow militiaman and sometimes friend john got moving too he yelped then he cursed if he did try to take out that knife george figured hed kick him where it would do the most good if that didnt distract john he didnt know what would turn me loose john said it was not an angry shout and did not seem like a threat george considered will you come along if i do he asked john did not say yes but john did not say no either george chose to take that as assent and let go of his arm john did keep walking once they reached one of the little side streets that opened onto the market square george stopped turned to him and said do you want to know a secret getting a priest going in circles is cheap sport i liked it well enough john answered priests always pretend they know everything that makes them more fun to baitsame with drunks in taverns baiting a drunk is one thing george said nobody but him made him drunk but its not that priests fault hes here all he did was keep from getting murdered by barbarians or eaten by wolfdemons you cant blame him for not knowing which end of the awl to hold right now who says i cant john demanded and if hes not to blame for the way he acts who is if john couldnt play logicchopping games with the priest hed play them with george the shoemaker however didnt feel like playing why dont you ask the khagan of the avars ill bet hed give you a better answer than that priest could john glared at him george looked back steadily that look didnt abash theodore anymore but john hadnt been exposed to it so often he shuffled his feet like a boy caught stealing grapes sometimes youre too serious for your own good he grumbled yes thats probably true george said which only made john eye him with even more annoyance than he had before george could make no sense of that when he realized he could make no sense of it he started laughing he didnt explain what he found funny john got angrier still the next time george went out hunting he saw neither satyrs nor slavs that suited him fine he also saw one rabbit and missed it which pleased him and his wife not at all look on the bright side he told her i dont have to go tell anything to bishop eusebius thank god for that irene said you got by with saying too much to him once doing it twice would be tempting fate this was the first time shed admitted george had got by with telling the bishop about the satyr he decided to accept that and gladly and not worry too much about the rest of what shed said concentrating on the good and not letting the rest get under his skin was one of the reasons his marriage went along as well as it did dactylius came in just then sure as sure he was carrying bow and arrows and had a sword on his belt sure as sure he said youve forgotten again i dont know what difference it makes george answered sourly i cant hit anything today anyhow but he got his own weapons and headed down to the practice field with the jeweler they went past st demetrius basilica along the way the broad doors were open the hexagonal silver roof of the ciborium not far inside the entrance glittered catching a little of the slanting lateoctober sun the reflections drew georges eyes to the church his glance was wary as if he expected bishop eusebius to burst out and rush toward him with either more questions or just possibly with redhot pincers nothing of the sort happened the only person who did come out of the church was a grayhaired woman wearing black who had probably gone in to pray for the soul of some recently deceased relative george did hit the mark a few times no one harassed him for not shooting better because paul the taverner seemed unable to frighten the targets let alone hit them next time you dont want to drink up all the wine in the place before you take your shots rufus told him i did no such thing paul said indignantly its only that other people have had more practice than i have well in that case go gather up your arrowsif you can find them all god only knows where some of them have got toand shoot off another quiverful this time at least try to shoot em toward the targets rufus pointed at the bales of hay you dont want to give him too hard a time or hell cut you off at his tavern john said stirring up trouble he got it rufus expressed in great detail what he would do if paul presumed to take so rash a course cutting it off was one of the milder things he came up with his bloodthirsty bellowing formed the background to pauls search for his missing arrows the taverner took a long time to find them despite or maybe because of rufus running commentary no wonder jesus had nasty things to say about publicans john remarked that got him back in rufus good graces but made paul send him such a dirty look george wondered if hed ever be welcome to perform at the taverners place of business again sometimes paying attention to something more than the moments joke was a good idea by the time paul did stick the last arrow into his quiverand by the time rufus counted them all counted them twice in fact when he lost track on his fingers the first timedaylight was fast draining out of the sky i think you did it on purpose the militia commander said now all you lugs get off with less work than you might maybe we could get enough torches to keep on practicing even after sunset dactylius said maybe we could light you up instead sabbatius muttered for once we get off easy and you want to spoil it rufus fortunately did not hear that itd be too expensive he told dactylius bishop eusebius if its for the church hell pay whatever it takes but if its for anything else you got to cut the coppers out of him with a knife youd think so anyhow way he bellyaches he stretched and grunted and pointed northwest back toward the part of the city where most of the militiamen lived to hell with it tonight we go home not even dactylius argued with him after that george for instance knew irene would be glad to see him home carrying his gear with him he trudged off the practice field whos for some wine paul asked when they neared his tavern after a moment he added everyone can come on in rufus kept walking paul sighed he was more worried about profit than about the insults hed taken from the veteran sabbatius did go in knowing him he would be there well into the night and wake up with a thick head in the morning what about you george dactylius asked the shoemaker shrugged not tonight i dont think he answered i have some work that could use finishing he shook his head i always seem to have some work that could use finishing ah wellif you intend to keep eating better to be too busy than the other way round thats true dactylius nodded several times rapidly a man who isnt doing anything cant sell anything and a man who cant sell anything isnt going to eat as they drew near the basilica of st demetrius george sniffed the air in thessalonica always smelled smoky what with so many fires going to cook food and heat homes still the militiaman came round a corner george pointed sure enough a black cloud was pouring out of the open doors of the church for a moment everyone simply stared in dismay as in any city fire was the great fear in thessalonica once every generation or two a great blaze would level whole districts again the shoemaker thought of all the fires burning all the time lamps cookfires hearths smiths fires potters ovens no wonder the flames got loose every so often its the saints ciborium burning dactylius said priests were dashing out of the basilica past the sixcolumned dome erected over st demetrius tomb layfolk from nearby buildings came running those who had buckets of water splashed them onto the blaze george could see at a glance that that was like trying to hold back the ocean with a spoonthe fire was far past putting out if god was kind it would not spread to the rest of the church or to any other budding in thessalonica not much wind rufus said sparks wont go flying all over the place hed been thinking along with george then something anyhow he grunted dactylius who spent his days working with precious metal eyed the silver dome of the ciborium it wasnt solid silver but silver laid over woodwood now burning thats going to melt he said it will run just like water and splash down onto the floor above the tomb itll be where anyone can grab it you mean rufus said and dactylius nodded rufus transformed himself from a tired old man walking home with his companions back into a militia officer well have to form a perimeter around it then and keep people who dont have any business inside the church from getting too close till the priests can gather up the metal he drew his sword and advanced on the ciborium george dactylius and the rest of the militiamen in the group followed him dactylius had known what he was talking about already melted silver was dripping down from the dome of the ciborium smoke rose from the marble on which it landed how much silver had been in the dome it had to be hundreds of pounds god bless you the priests called as the militiamen took up their stations around the monument to st demetrius i want to tell you hed better rufus said grimly george would gladly have echoed the officer the church was filling rapidly and not all the people were those the shoemaker was delighted to see the smoke and the outcry the fire had created combined to bring out gawkers of every sort from the merely curious to those who appeared at disasters to see what profit they could make from them when this latter sort saw the silver melting and dripping down to where they might get their hands on the lumps and globules their expression reminded george of the look dogs wore in front of a butchers shop hed never seen so many hungry avid hopeful faces all together why dont you go home he suggested to some of them nothing here belongs to any of you not yet a skinny man said his friends laughed priests and militiamen together lacked the numbers to keep the swelling crowd from doing as it would the priests were not even armedno some of them had makeshift bludgeons not that those would amount to much george did not want to draw his sword for fear of turning crowd into mob many of the thessalonicans staring at the silver had weapons no worse than his when it gets a little darker theyll likely rush us rufus said that way nobody will be able to tell for certain who does what i think youre right george said and it gets dark a lot faster this time of year than it did a couple of months ago say when i get home irene will yell at me for being seven different kinds of fool for letting myself get caught in whats likely to be a riot that was his first thought only after it had gone through his mind did he think to wonder how and if he would get home once the riot got rolling through smoke still thick enough to make him cough and force tears down cheeks no doubt sooty the stretch of sky he could see got darker and darker color seemed to leach from the bricks of the basilica of st demetrius and the other nearby buildings in the gathering gloom someone hissed come on lets get it they cant hardly spy us now the serpents voice must have sounded like that when it was tempting eve in the garden of eden only a few feet away from george rufus suddenly jerked as if hed been hit by an arrow for a moment the shoemaker thought that was what had happened then he felt the power in the air strong enough to make the hair stand straight up on his head he looked around wildly wondering if lightning was about to strike but it was not lightning or not mere lightning rufus eyes were wide and staring whatever he saw had nothing to do with the burning ciborium or the thieves gathering around it his mouth started to move at first no words came from it as if the power about to speak through him had trouble matching its needs to those of his flesh and blood then it did speak in a voice that would have made georges hair stand on end if it hadnt been doing that already men citizensbarbarians around the wall after a moment rufus or whoever was using him as a channel cried out again theyve appeared unexpectedly but all of you all of us well hasten with arms for our homeland rufus repeated himself twice more using so far as george could tell the identical words each time by the time he fell silent staggered and almost fell as he came back to himself the basilica was nearly empty almost everyone who had heard him had rushed to obey he turned toward george who was having all he could do to keep from rushing to the walls at that very instant himself the saint rufus began and then tried again the martyr he shook his head something happened he muttered but what he might have been the only person in the basilica of st demetrius who did not know what hed said george started to explain but a cry of wonder from behind him made him stop before hed got out more than a couple of words a priest was pointing at the wreckage of the ciborium wreckage it remained but it was no longer burning we did not put out this fire he exclaimed his eyes almost as round as rufus had been god put out this fire christ and god helped us with the intercession of the glorious martyr rufus said again in a voice not quite his own the fire is quenched and nothing here destroyed by it where before he had given orders to the crowd now he commanded the priests shut the doors to the church and gather up the silver in peace and quiet and remember that this place remains in good order because of what the martyred saint established the veteran shivered like a man coming out of a warm house into an icy wind gently cautiously george touched him on the arm come on the shoemaker said the slavs are attacking the walls they are rufus exclaimed what are we wasting time here in the church for then now he was himself again and no one else lets get moving well teach the whoresons a lesson theyll remember one cursed long time he trotted out of the church at a groundeating lope george followed along with the handful of other militiamen who had resisted the call that came through rufus and stayed by the man himself behind them the doors to the basilica slammed shut with their bars thudding down to hold them so inside the priests would be collecting the spilled silver in peace and quiet people were running through the streets of thessalonica brandishing the spears and bows and swords and knives and occasional axes they had snatched up from their homes this is marvelous rufus said i wouldnt have thought even the barbarians at the gates would get everybody moving this way i wonder what did it it was you george said but rufus now paid little attention to him when he tried to tell what had happened power had not only filled him but filled him to overflowing so that he had neither memory nor even great interest in what he had set in motion so at any rate it appeared to george who was viewing it from the outside he wondered what being filled with the power of the saint felt like he doubted he would ever know many of the townsfolk not being part of the militia had no assigned place on the walls they went up anyway and shouted curses and abuse at whoever was on the far side george supposed that would do thessalonica no harm if any of those curses stuck to the slavs it might even do some good his own place on the wall was on the western stretch where he and his comrades in the militia had taken their turns as watchmen near the litaean gate that meant traversing most of the city as st demetrius church stood over in the northeastern part of town here we are rufus said when they reached their proper section of the wall the old veteran sounded winded george did not blame him and contented himself with a nod by way of reply when you made shoes you sat or stood in the same place all day which did not do wonders for your endurance georges heart thudded like a drum climbing the stairs up to the wall made it beat even harder and faster he wondered if anyone had fallen over dead rushing to the defense of thessalonica they gained the walkway and looked out into the gathering dusk his heart pounded harder still now not from exertion but from astonishment and alarm beside him rufus murmured sweet mother of god its a whole swarm of them the word was better than any george had found to apply to the slavs thousands of men milled around outside the city all of them carrying weapons of one kind or another some looked to be mounting attacks against the monastery of st matrona leaning ladders against its walls and trying to climb up them the monks overturned some of those ladders as george watched and threw stones down onto the heads of the slavs down below do you know he said discovering he had breath enough to speak again i think they think theyre attacking the city wall they couldnt be that stupid rufus said but then after hed watched them for a couple of minutes he shook his head in wonder i take it back maybe they could be that stupid its getting dark george said theres a little mist in the air they must have taken the long way round to get at thessalonica from the west because everything weve heard about the fighting is that its been off to the east and north so here theyve come theyve never been anywhere near the city before and what do they do they see strong walls so they think theyre doing the right thing by storming them you make sense rufus said a compliment that delighted the shoemaker his superior went on now how long will they take to figure out that a citys bigger than a monastery the slavs did not take long some of them kept on assailing the monastery more though drawn by the more distant walls and the people on them came on and discovered thessalonica no sooner had they discovered it than they began to try to take it they flung javelins and shot arrows at the militiamen and simple citizens on the wall an arrow slammed into the stonework not far from georges head he heard the shaft snap much as he did when he broke one of his own arrows hunting rabbits but the slav whod shot this arrow had not been out for game hed had killing george in mind or if not george then rufus or someone else nearby he wanted to kill me once lodged in georges mind the thought would not leave he did his best to kill me this was not practice shooting at a target this was not chill the slav had meant it this was war more arrows flew one zipped past georges head hissing like a snake the first realization he was a target had shocked him the second he pulled an arrow of his own from the quiver nocked it and shot it at one of the barbarians down below he didnt know whether he scored a hit or notthe slav was running around among several others and they were hard to tell apart growing harder by the moment too as the light failed he also had other troubles we should have practiced shooting from the top of the wall he said to rufus its a different business from shooting on the level aye youre rightit is the veteran answered have to talk to the city prefect about that or maybe to the bishop you should talk to the bishop george said if he wont listen to the man the saint spoke through whom will he hear nobody maybe rufus said having dealt with eusebius not long before george thought that had a chance of being true eusebius he suspected listened to himself first and everyone else afterwards but with thessalonica being in his hands more than anyone elses this side of st demetrius he might well pay attention to anything that would help him defend the city sabbatius and paul came up onto the wall then paul was somber and selfcontained sabbatius reeked of wine the contrast did not particularly surprise george a taverner who got too fond of the goods he sold would not stay a taverner long his business would fail and hed end up drinking at someone elses sabbatius stared down at the slavs mother of god he muttered how many of em are out there must be ten or twenty myriads easy even if youre seeing double there arent that many not anywhere close rufus said he scratched his chin i dont know if therere ten myriads of people inside thessalonica let alone twenty three four thousand slavs out there five at the most there have to be more than that sabbatius said rufus gave a single scornful shake of his head if george had to choose between a guess by a drunken militiaman and another by a soldier whod been gauging the size of armies most of his life he knew which one he preferred anyway rufus said the point isnt how many of em there are the point is how to make there be fewer of em why dont you stop jawing and start using that cursed bowor dont you remember you have it along sabbatius did start shooting at the slavs george could not tell what effect his arrows had a lot of missiles were flying out from the wall somebody said if the jawbone of an ass was good enough for solomon to fight with why not for sabbatius too hullo john george said without turning around he loosed another arrow himself then went on i thought id see you up here its the place to be right now john said in affected upperclass greek george snorted pity the slavs dont speak any civilized languageyou could slay them with laughter me john said considering the way you shoot making them laugh themselves to death would be your best chance he let fly then grunted in satisfaction there you see i got one im funnier than you are and im a better man with the bow too to say nothing of more modest george murmured thats ri john began and then stopped sending a chilly glance toward the shoemaker george felt a moments pride not everyone could trade words with john and come off the winner he knew he couldnt do it himself very often but then his small satisfaction was swept away for out of the woods rode four or five men who sat their horses as if they were the centaurs that might still linger in the remotest valleys of the most rugged upcountry but centaurs wore no armor neither the man half nor the beast and these men and their horses were both clad in scalemail that would ward them against anything but a direct and lucky hit they rode up to and through the slavs who parted before them as the citizens of thessalonica might have parted before the roman emperor had he come to worship at the church of st demetrius they halted within bowshot of the walls under their iron helmets their faces as well as george could make them out in the fading light were flat strong impassive avars rufus muttered under his breath as soon as he spoke the name george knew he had to be right no wonder the slavs treated them like lords they were the slavs lords calm as if they had come to visit rather than to attack the avars studied thessalonicas works for a minute or two then turned their horses away from the walls and rode back into the gathering darkness once more the slavs stood aside to let them pass shadows reached out for them and they were gone neither side started up the fighting again for some little while after that those men had a power in them and not a small one george said quietly i wish bishop eusebius would have been here on the wall with us to show them we have a power that can stand against theirs rufus surprised him by shaking his head the less the enemy knows about you the better off youre going to be the veteran said thats true every which way not just with plain weapons after a little thought george nodded youre probably right he said then he pointed to the slavs who were beginning to resume the racket they had abated when the avars appeared among them weve found out about them thats for certain but rufus shook his head again not yet not hardly not so it matters he too looked out toward the barbarians they were starting to light fires out there on the cleared ground between the city and the woods me ive got the feeling were going to have plenty of time to find out more the strangest thing about the early days of the siege of thessalonica was how close to normal everything felt the only difference in his life george noticed was that going out to hunt had become impossiblewhich was he realized just as well for it would have been decidedly unwise he did not think the slavs would share bread and honey with romans they chanced upon in the woods not anymore not even his times up on the wall changed much he still served his usual fourhour shifts sometimes during the night there was always the chance the slavs would mount an assault against thessalonicas formidable curtain of stone but after st demetrius had warned the townsfolk of their presence and kept them from coming up over the wall by surprise they contented themselves with shooting occasional arrows at the garrison indeed as time went by many of them left the immediate neighborhood of thessalonica so that the city hardly seemed under siege at all sometimes looking out from the walkway atop the wall george could not set eye on a single enemy warrior theyre out there rufus said one afternoon when he remarked on that oh theyre out there never fear if they werent out there wed have traffic on the via egnatia getting into the city from east or west seen any no george said i wish i had he lowered his voice as if passing on a secret and in fact he wanted no one but rufus to hear his next words if we dont get some traffic well be hungry by and by thats so rufus answered also discreetly constantinople now constantinople gets grain from egypt an enemy can besiege constantinople till everything turns blue and it wont do him any good at all we arent so lucky weve had a few ships in from southern greece but not many and not much in em maybe we should sally try to drive them away george said then traffic could start moving again probably nothing to move right now anyhow rufus said gloomily if the slavs are here theyre in the farm country and backwoods villages stealing their wheat and barley and wine no best thing to do is wait em out maybe god will send them a plague that happens in a lot of sieges happens in towns too george remembered the outbreak of bubonic plague in thessalonica not so long before hundreds maybe thousands had died after a while dactylius and john came up onto the wall george hurried back to his shop he was convinced his being away from it so regularly would make it founder irene was convinced he was out of his mind theodore on the other hand was convinced a soldiers life was far more exciting than that of a shoemaker one day george intended to sit him down with rufus to see if anything resembling sense would penetrate his head george had just finished nailing a new heel onto a boot not a boot hed made he was pleased to note when claudia came into the shop carrying a pair of sandals hello george said setting aside the newly repaired boot what can i do for you today have you seen my husband claudias voice throbbed with melodrama she was one of those people who found daytoday life too dull to be readily tolerable and spiced it up with imaginary worries when no real ones were handy and when real ones were handy i live in dread of the day when the messenger will tell me my beloved dactylius has died a heros death for his city she clasped both hands to her bosom it was a fine wellrounded bosom the gesture might have belonged in a pantomime show but for the inconvenient sandals sophia excused herself and hurried upstairs theodore coughed and coughed irene kept her face utterly expressionless she worried about george and made no secret of it but made no production of it either and george did not tell claudia that the likeliest way for dactylius untimely demise to occur at the moment was death by boredom instead showing restraint he felt sure st demetrius would have praised he said i think hell be all right the wall is very strong so they say claudia answered as if they were notorious liars for myself i wish dactylius would just stay in the shop with me given a choice between closing himself up in a shop with claudia all day and going out to fight the fierce barbarians george would have taken on the slavs even without a sword to hold them at bay that was something else he couldnt tell her he was wider through the shoulders but she overtopped him by two or three digits whats wrong with the sandals george asked hoping to turn her away from morbid worries about her husband and toward something simple i broke a strap on this onesee she showed him the problem yes i can take care of that he told her and then to make conversation added how did it happen he realized that was a mistake the moment the words were out of his mouth claudia drew herself up to her full formidable height her gray eyes flashed it wasnt quite so impressive a manifestation as when st demetrius had spoken through rufus but it wasnt supernatural either it was only her temper coming out that stupid slut next door kept throwing her garbage in front of my place and so i hit her with the shoe she explained i dont think you sewed the strap on very well george examined it again it hadnt broken at a sewn seam shed hit so hard shed torn the leather from under his eyebrows he glanced up at her no getting on her bad side was not a good idea she might well have been more dangerous to the slavs than a good many militiamen on the wall her husband included ill take care of it he said again with almost anyone else he would have pointed out in nouncertain terms that the problem was not of his making but claudia was his good friends wife and even if she hadnt been he suspected hed have kept his mouth shut instead of sewing the broken strap back together he took it off the sandal and replaced it with a new one that took a little longer but meant the sandal wouldnt rub claudias ankle when she wore it again she tried it on after he gave it back to her after a judicious pause she nodded yes that will do i hope it holds together though it should george answered of course the next time you hit your neighbor you might want to think about using something like a brick instead claudia considered the joke with such drilling seriousness that george once more wished he had the words back hed wanted to make her smile not to make her murder the woman next door but at last she said no a brick would have hurt her more than i intended then i would have to be truly angry to use a brick she took a couple more steps in the repaired sandal and nodded it does feel good george ill tell dactylius ive been here you know you can drop by the shop she wrapped her mantle around her and swept away what will you get me at dactylius father sophia asked as eagerly as if she were a little girl rather than a young woman the shoemaker and jeweler did not charge each other money for their services but traded them back and forth i dont know george answered some bit of polished brassa ring maybe or a thin bracelet fixing a sandal strap isnt enough for me to bring home gold inset with rubies and pearls you know nothing he was likely to do was enough for him to bring home gold inset with precious gems hed long since resigned himself to that that woman irene shook her head she reminds me of a jar with the stopper in too tight left in the fire too long one day it will burst and hurt half a dozen people with flying potsherds and yet dactylius dotes on her of course he does george said do you think hed dare not to theodore chuckled sophia giggled and irene wagged a severe finger at her husband you are a wicked man all the time youve been spending in the company of the militia is making you sound like john i got the better of him the other day up on the wall george boasted and recounted the exchange hed won thats funny papa theodore said clapping his hands together now will you tell us all the ones where he bested you if you want to hear those you can go ask john the shoemaker replied with dignity then he gave his son a cuff on the side of the head not hard enough to hurt not soft enough to be ignored to remind the youth to preserve at least some vestige of respect for his parents its all right george irene said i know it is he answered i want to make sure it stays that way as long as only slavs were besieging thessalonica george didnt worry much about the ultimate safety of the city they hadnt impressed him as being particularly dangerous fighters that was as well he and his fellow militiamen werent particularly dangerous fighters either the ones who bother me are those avars he said to dactylius as they waited for relief so they could return to their shops and homes after a morning stint on the wall we havent seen much of them since that handful the first night of the siege but if they werent real soldiers therere no such animals they were fiercelooking all right dactylius said but i dont think you worry enough about the slavs there are so many of them look at the way their powers are coming in and doing things the ones that have been here forever wouldnt even try in the face of christian men thats so george admitted unhappily i wish it werent but it is i hope that satyr i saw up there in the hills is all right hes not a christian power true enough but hed been here a long time like you say dactylius made small disapproving noises as a good christian man myself i say we should have nothing to do with the old powers his voice was prim the sooner we forget all about them the sooner theyll vanish from the earth in principle george agreed with him in practice he found the supernatural powers still lingering in the land that had once been theirs interesting in the same way he found old inscriptions and old coins interestingrelics of what had once been of great import to people he said i wish the slavic powers would vanish from the earth if i forgot about them trouble is theyre too much in the minds of the slavs for that to happen what we need to do is convert the slavs and avars to christianity dactylius said then their powers will vanish away as they deserve to do that would be wonderful george pointed out to a couple of slavs sitting on the yellowing grass out beyond archery range they were passing a wineskin back and forth after a while one of them rolled over and went to sleep they dont look ready to convert right now worse luck thats so dactylius said maybe in the time of my childrenif god blesses claudia and me with children who live george thought about making love to claudia she was a wellbuilt woman and far from homely all the same had she been his wife divine intervention would almost surely have been necessary for them to start a family on the other hand she might simply seize little dactylius and have her way with him when the mood took her george turned a snort into a cough he didnt want his friend to know what kind of thoughts were running through his mind the slavs did not try to break into thessalonica during the rest of their watch when the sun had swung through a third of its arc across the heavens paul and john ascended to the wall to take their places john peered out at the slavs most of whom seemed utterly uninterested in the siege another day of martial combat he cried and now to rush at the foe with a fearsome after a look of intense concentration he broke wind there you go george said if the breeze were blowing in the right direction youd save the city singlehanded that wasnt my hand you blockhead john said after a little more chaffing he and the taverner began patrolling their stretch of wall while dactylius and george went down into the city as usual a crowd of women had gathered around the cistern in the neighborhood thessalonicas water came from nearby streams and rivers through underground pipes the slavs and avars had not yet discovered or tried to destroy it still filled all the cisterns and flowed unhindered from fountains not only on street comers but also in several churches among the chattering women stood irene spotting george she lowered the water jug she carried from her shoulder and waved at him he waved back looking around to see if she had sophia with her sometimes it was hard to tell them apart from a distanceand sometimes not from a distance too but no sophia wasnt there this time just then the roof of the cistern flew off concrete chunks some of them as big as a man spun through the air one of them smashed a house more by luck or providence came down on empty ground but some landed with horrible wet squashing noises the women near the cistern screamed and scattered irene george cried and ran toward them he had almost reached his wife when the power that had hurled the roof off the cistern stood up inside and looked around it was roughly manshaped but five or six times as tall as a man it looked old old its hair what there was of it was mossgreen and its long straggling beard was also made of moss its skin hardly seemed skin at all but rather wet bark maybe georges shout deep among shrill had drawn its attention to him whatever the reason it turned his way its eyes were red like burning coals when he looked into them he felt his will dripping away like olive oil out of a cracked jar it reached out a handno more a misshapen paw toward him as a drowning man will reach for anything his fingers touch so the shoemaker made the sign of the cross a satyr would have fled in terror this horrifying apparition kept right on groping for him but the holy sign had not been altogether without effect he had his wits back and his will he snatched an arrow from his quiver set it in his bow and took aim at the gigantic slavic waterdemon or demigod he supposed the thing was irene whose presence of mind he often admired had not dropped the water jar shed filled at the cistern a smaller version of the greenbearded thing popped out of it and grabbed georges arm spoiling his aim the touch of the power was clammy and piercingly cold dactylius smote the smaller waterdemon with his sword what might have been mist or might have been ichor sprayed out from the wound irene did drop the jar then water splashed up and out from it the small apparition of the demigod went from a single one to a multitude of tiny ones spread out in the bigger puddles among the cobblestones george started stamping the tiny ones as if they were so many cockroaches they crunched under his sandals like cockroaches the great demigod in the cistern roared and bellowed as he crashed its smaller simulacraor perhaps they were all part of the same entity so that the big one felt the pain he inflicted on the others as if on itself more waterdemons began springing out of the jars of other women who hadnt dropped them george and dactylius shouted for the women to do just that crockery crashed on cobbles and george and dactylius and irene fled away from the cistern as fast as they could run do you suppose dactylius panted these horrible thingsare in everycistern in the city i hope not george answered just as short of wind i hadntthought of that i wishyou hadnteither their flight carried them past the church of st elias the church nearest their homes and shops it was close enough to the cistern for a couple of priests to have come out to try to learn what the commotion was about irene stopped and gasped out an explanation the priests exclaimed in dismay heathen powers loose in our godguarded city one of them father luke said well exorcise them forthwith have a care george told them still trying to catch his breath these things are strong your reverence you didnt see the roof go flying a roof is a material thing a thing of this world the priest replied in matters of the spirit the power of god shall overcome all others did not he through the intercession of st demetrius our patron vouchsafe a warning that our city was about to be attacked yes he did no doubt about it i was there and i saw it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears george said but the slavs are such raw pagans their powers are strong in the world of the spirit too as he had so many times by now he warned them of the wolfdemon that had slain a priest one of the men who had come out of st elias church turned pale and made as if to go back inside father luke remained unperturbed this means only that our own faith shall have to be stronger come father gregory if we fear the pagan spirits we give them power over us father gregory looked anything but delighted at the prospect of facing a waterdemon of the might of this one but facing a waterdemon was liable to be as nothing when set against facing father luketo say nothing of facing bishop eusebius muttering something that might have been a prayer or a curse gregory followed his colleague up the street toward the cistern go back to the shop george told irene let the children know youre all right what are you going to do his wife demanded he pointed to the priests you never can tell what sort of help they might need or who might be able to give it to them he still didnt know what an arrow might do to the demigod or whatever it was on the off chance he might have to find out he started after father luke and father gregory dactylius followed him so did irene he wondered for a moment why she chose such inconvenient times not to listen to him he had no time to argue and the only way to force her to go back would be to drag her which would mean he couldnt help father luke resolving to take it up with her later a wasted resolution if ever there was one as he knew even at the time he hurried to catch up with the priests then father luke confusing things further spun around on his heel and ran back into the church he emerged a moment later leaving george mystified lets go he said and go they did the open square by the cistern was almost bare of people of living people at any rate a couple of women were down and not moving under shards of what had been the roof others writhed and wailed the liquid puddled around them was red and sticky and of no interest to demons concerning themselves only with water by she who bore god father gregory gasped when he got his first glimpse of the waterdemon looming out of the cistern a few smaller copiesor partsof the demigod still stood in puddles left by shattered water jars they were hideous too but hardly worth noticing with the great one about those red eyes swung toward the newcomers the demigod made a strange wet bubbling noise something that sounded as if it might be a question about what people were doing coming toward the cistern rather than running away from it a good question george thought he wondered what he was doing too but he kept doing it each foot kept going in front of the other father gregory shouted in the holy name of god go back to whatever accursed place spawned you he made the sign of the cross he must not have been listening when george warned of what the slavic powers could do or possibly he hadnt believed george who was after all only a shoemaker a power from the days of the pagan greeks would have been routed a power from the days of the pagan greeks though could never have made its way into thessalonica in the first place not when the city was warded by god through st demetrius far from being routed the waterdemon roared angrily and reached out for father gregory as it was several times longer than a man it had a correspondingly longer reach george shot an arrow into its arm a slight mist sprinkled down onto him other than that the shaft had no effect dactylius aimed for the things torso in what might have been the shot of his life he sank an arrow that should have pierced the demigods heart it seemed however not to have a heart at any rate his arrow did no more good than georges had run george shouted he didnt know whether he meant it more for father gregory on whom the waterdemons hand was closing or for irene no that wasnt true he did know he wanted his wife away from the power the first denial must have sprung from embarrassment at putting her safety above that of the holy man it didnt matter neither his wife nor the priest listened to him the huge hand closed on father gregory he screamed like a lost soul considering his circumstances that seemed fitting enough he called on god and the virgin and on christ using the holy names as if they were curses they did no good against the slavic demigod george in the midst of his own terror was saddened but not surprised revenge and reverence were not the same father luke ran toward the cistern the waterdemon reached out its other hand toward him george and dactylius both sent arrows into that arm the shoemaker never knew for certain whether that did any good what he did know was that when the demigod snatched at the priest it missed instead of grabbing again at once it chose to pay attention to father gregory whom it had already seized it raised him high then threw him down onto the cobbles of the square blood splashed out from his body when it struck as if he too were a shattered jar he screamed no more that brief hesitation though had let father luke reach the side of the big concrete basin with the wrecked roof he pulled a small jar out from inside his robe yanked off the stopper made the sign of the cross over the jar and tossed it up into the cistern the demigod reached down to treat him as it had his colleague father luke waited unafraid a moment before those great hands grabbed him george heard a small splash the jar had gone into the water the demon disappeared silence slammed down in the square silence punctuated by distant screams george realized hed been hearing those with the back of his mind for some time which was a good argument in favor of the notion that the water demigod had appeared in every cistern in thessalonica as he stood there still halfstunned by his escape those screams changed in tone from terror to amazement which was a good argument in favor of the notion that whatever father luke had done whatever force he had called upon had rid every cistern in thessalonica of the demigod in the same instant on legs still wobbly with fright george walked up to him taking a few steps around the smashed horror that had been father gregory bless you your reverence he said most sincerely bless you for your courage the priest answered sounding as shaken as the shoemaker felt without courage and faith i fear we shall be lost in the dark days that he ahead george nodded he looked back toward what was left of father gregory the other priest had proved not to have quite enough of either there when the ultimate test came george suspected father luke would have found a way to prevail even without whatever hed thrown into the cistern georges bump of curiosity always easy to excite began itching furiously now what was in that jar your reverence he asked water from the baptismal font father luke answered fighting fire with fire is as ancient a proverb as i know here i thought it better to fight water with water george interrupted an enormous smile stretching itself across his face the priest showed himself a man of enormous charity as well as piety he did not get angry with george for stepping on his line dactylius and irene came up then george put an arm around his wife she shivered against him for a moment but then said ill have to buy a new jug to replace the one i broke here more than jugs had been broken in the square along with father gregory several women lay there some might be helped one was groaning and shrieking and clutching her leg which streamed blood out onto the cobbles a big chunk of concrete from the roof the demigod had destroyed lay by her george used his sword to cut a strip from the bottom of her tunic to bandage the leg she screamed abuse at him all the while as if the tunic were more important than anything else he took no notice of that the lower part of the leg was out of true with the rest a bandage isnt all she needs he said pointing that leg is broken ill fetch a physician dactylius said this could have been claudia as easily as not george might not have bet on the waterdemon against claudia but he knew the little man was right dactylius hurried away father luke came up to the woman and prayed over her his entreaties might have eased her pain a little but no more than that routing the slavic demigod was a matter of power against power something as mundane as a broken leg wasnt barring a miracle barring pity we cant take her to the healing spring outside the city george said but the slavs have to be prowling there nowadays it is the will of god father luke said we are in his hands he believed that with every fiber of his being not least because of his strong faith hed been able to vanquish the waterdemon but had he not had the wit to bring with him water from the baptismal font all his faith would have done him no good george shorter on faith tried to be sharp of wit he had trouble understanding how gods purpose included things like a broken leg inflicted so far as any man could tell at random father luke would have called him presumptuous for wanting gods purpose to make sense to a mere man he supposed the priest would have had a point too some of his own purposes didnt make sense to theodore and sophia who were in essence his equals not inferiors as he was an inferior to god even so he waited by the woman till dactylius brought back the doctor who took one look at the leg nodded and began the business of setting it i told him it was broken dactylius said so he brought the boards for splints good george said he turned to irene do i remember rightly wasnt i on my way home from a stretch on the wall he glanced at the sun to gauge the time not very long ago either he shook himself like a dog coming out of a pond only seems a years gone by since then i guess bless you father luke said again as he and his wife left the square weary and worn as he was he walked straighter when a priest like father luke blessed you you felt blessed he wondered what the priests of the slavs and the avars were doing now that their effort to make it impossible to draw water inside thessalonica had failed wading and gnashing their teeth with any luck at all but they probably wouldnt go on wailing and gnashing their teeth for long theyd probably bring more of their gods and demons to bear against the godguarded city he shrugged the thessalonicans couldnt do anything about that till it happened if and when it did not only did they have god guarding them they also had the militia george had got almost to his own street before he wondered whether that counted for or against them irene put her hand in his you were very brave she said i was what george said father luke had praised his courage too he had trouble following that if i hadnt done what i did i figured something worse would happen if thats courage then im someone who talks too much irene said firmly he was about to make an indignant denial she could truthfully have accused him of a good many things but not that after he opened his mouth though he shut it without saying anything if his wife thought he was brave and he went around denying it didnt that count for talking too much when he and irene walked into the shop their children looked up from the shoes theyd been repairing wheres the water jar mother sophia asked irene and george looked at each other and started to laugh sophia spluttered in annoyance how dared her parents share what was obviously a joke when she had no idea why it was funny theodore said whats been going on out there anyway people have been running back and forth and shouting things that dont make any sense and a while ago it sounded like a budding fell down or something like that are the slavs throwing rocks he paused stood up and set hands on hips i said are the slavs throwing rocks at us his parents were laughing harder than ever which irritated him and sophia both after a while george stopped laughing when he did he felt as if he ought to start shaking instead laughing was better little by little he and irene explained to their children what had in fact happened by the time they were through theodore had turned very red and looked about ready to burst all that was going on not three stadia from here and we didnt know anything about it he exclaimed in what to his credit tried very hard not to be a shout but didnt quite succeed if id been there id have he made cutandthrust motions that merely betrayed how little he knew about handling a sword thank god you werent there george said which only inflamed his son further the best adventures are the ones that happen to somebody else believe you me this isnt a story son the priest and the women who are dead theyre dead and they wont come back to life till judgment day the woman with the broken leg she may be crippled for as long as she lives and any one of them could have been me or your mother as easy as not he saw he wasnt reaching theodore who was at the age to believe nothing bad could ever happen to him george turned to irene for support only to discover she wasnt there to support him shed gone upstairs while he was talking and he hadnt noticed he might as well have been victor the city prefect who liked to hear himself talk irene came down a moment later carrying a cup of wine in each hand she gave one to george who gulped it down faster than was his usual habit instead of scolding him she drained her cup too george took it from her and went upstairs himself when he returned with both cups filled she took one from him and drank it as fast as she had the first as she had not been behind him on that first cup he was not behind her on the second her eyes were a trifle glassy as she looked toward sophia and said you can fix supper tonight she spoke with unusual emphasis all right mother sophia had enough sense to know when not to argue she went on that will be easy anyhow because we dont have much besides bread and beans and oil and some prunes you can live a long time on bread and beans and oil george said people only a little poorer than we are live on them their whole lives through he spoke more loudly than was his usual wont too so much wine drunk so fast made the world seem a very certain place thats true theodore said but the world would be a boring place without some meat every now and then he smacked his lips george was fond of meat too he sighed cant go out hunting cant hardly keep cows or sheep inside the walls pigs some pigs and chickens they eat anything ducks maybe and fish the slavs cant keep us from fishing in the sea he sighed again anything like that would cost plenty even now pretty soon oil will cost too after a while beans and bread will cost bishop eusebius wont let that happen he wont let the merchants make beggars of us all irene said confidently she had more faith in the bishop than george did he didnt want to do complicated thinking right now but after a moment decided she might well be right eusebius was too good a christian and too good a politician both to let a handful of men aggrandize themselves at the expense of the rest theodores thoughts meanwhile had gone off on another tack everything you said about how strong the slavs powers are must be true father he said a sentence to warm the cockles of the heart of any father of an adolescent male for that waterdemon to show up in the middle of this city its a worry george agreed he tried to imagine a satyr strolling into the marketplace of thessalonica he couldnt such a thing might have happened when galerius was emperor but three hundred years had gone by since then and those powers overpowered by a greater power this is the first time theyve tried anything so horrid irene said what will they do next the question hung in the air george looked out the door all he could see was the shop across the narrow street he couldnt see the wall let alone what lay beyond it not with his fleshly eyes his minds eye reached further somewhere out there the chieftains of the avars would be deciding what to do next if they and the slavs they led succeeded with it whatever it was the city would fall that was very simple for once george wished things might be more complex iv axes rang in the woods around thessalonica george watched an oak tremble sway fall a crew of slavs began lopping off branches and cutting the trunk into lengths they found useful not far away a mounted avar watched his subjects hes working hard isnt he john said pointing out from the wall to the horseman who but for occasionally pointing wasnt doing anything much not so youd notice george answered but the slavs are working harder because hes there the noble comes round to see how his building is going up youd best believe the carpenters work harder john said me im funnier when i know the fellow behind the bar at the tavern is listening to me if he doesnt like what hes hearing i have to try to find someplace else to work the next night carpenters build buildings george said what do slavs build they cant be making a village out there can they i know what theyre making john said theyre making trouble theyve already done that george looked along the wall instead of out from it no sooner had he done so than he stood more erect and gripped his bow more firmly out of the side of his mouth he said here comes rufus think of him as the fellow behind the bar john obviously did think of rufus that way for like george he did his best to project an air of martial ferocity like georges his best left something to be desired rufus surveyed diem with his brown eye with his blue eye and with both eyes together he looked dissatisfied all three ways god must be watching over thessalonica he said if it hasnt fallen with the likes of you two holding off the slavs and avars george didnt argue with the veteran on the whole he agreed with him and john surprised rufus by putting an arm around him and kissing him on the bristly cheek thank you great captain he said in a voice gooey with counterfeit emotion youve made us what we are today rufus wiped his cheek with the back of one hand the good news about that is that its true he said and the bad news about it is that its true another tree went over with a crash the slavs started trimming it as they had the oak theyd felled a few minutes before what are they doing out there george asked rufus the veteran clapped to his forehead the hand hed just used to wipe his cheek god help all of us if youre as i made you he said anyone with enough sense to rub his fingers on his tunic after he blows his nose can see that theyre cutting the timber they need for siege engines siege engines george and john spoke together john went on theyre barbarians they dont have any cities what are they doing with siege engines they dont have cities no rufus said thats not the point the point is we have cities if they want to take them away from us they have to get inside the way to get inside a walled town is with siege engines they know that they may be barbarians but they arent stupid by the way he said it his opinion was that the two militiamen were stupid georges ears got hot righty or wrongly he prided himself on his wits having rufus scorn them was bitter as wormwood to him he said all right they know what they need to do to break into our cities but how do they know siege engines cant be easy to make anything is easyif you know how to do it rufus said and they do his face darkened with anger the avars were besieging some town up near the danube way i heard the story i forget the name of the place this was oh i dont know ten years ago something like that they caught a soldier outside the walls fellow called called bousas that was it they learned to make siege engines from us romans george said appalled did this bousas tell them how rufus nodded thats what he did all right they were going to kill him he told them to take him back to this town whatever its name was and the people there would pay ransom to get him back johns chuckle was cold and cynical didnt happen eh sure didnt rufus agreed one of the nobles there was either screwing bousas wife or else wanted to screw her i misremember which and he persuaded the people not to give the avars even a follis for bousas and bousas paid them back george said thats what he did all right rufus repeated with another nod said hed give em the town if they let him live and then went on to teach em how to make stonethrowers he scowled thats how theyve taken so many towns since and thats how they know about engines george was a man who liked to get to the bottom of things what happened to bousas and to his wife and to the noble who kept the people from ransoming him if bousas isnt dead hes still with the avars rufus answered i dont know what happened to the woman or the other fellow whatever it was my bet is that it wasnt pretty ive seen what happens to towns in a sack his lined face went very harsh for a moment george wondered what pictures he was watching inside his head and hoped thessalonica wouldnt find out john said if the slavs do break in nice to know its on account of our sins and not theirs isnt it maybe we should sally and break those engines or else burn them before the barbarians can bring them up against the walls george said rufus studied the ground outside the wall after what must have been a couple of minutes he regretfully shook his head i wish we could but i dont think we can too stinking many slavs out thereslavs here there and everywhere they can afford to waste whole great stacks of men holding us off and we cant afford the ones wed have to spend anybody says the militia ought to try it im going to say no as loud as i have to to make people listen if we had some regulars now regulars would have armor to match the scalemail the avars and their horses wore and most of them would be mounted too if the militiamen fought the slavs out in the open they would lack the advantage in weapons and position and be outnumbered to boot george decided rufus was right then the veteran looked thoughtful wouldnt want to send militiamen out against the slavs in broad daylight i sure wouldnt not unless things were different from the way they are now sliding a postern gate open at night though and going out and seeing what we could do then his eyes didnt match but they both saw clearly so george thought at any rate john hopped straight up in the air a motion startling enough to make a couple of slavs look up from their carpentry and point his way at night he said with anger that sounded genuine youre going to try to take my audience away i like that dont worry about it pup rufus set a hard muchscarred hand on his shoulder nobodyd be listening to you anyway he tramped on down the walkway atop the wall leaving john for once speechless behind him more and more slavs came down from the northeast more and more avars came with them to make sure they stuck to their work with alarming speed a variety of siege engines took shape under the avars direction george who knew plenty about shoes but had never been besieged before needed help telling one sort from another rufus gave it you see the ones on the broad bases he said the ones that taper up till theyre thinner on top those are the stonethrowers theyll try and knock the wall down so the barbarians can swarm through the breach thats what all those things are for isnt it george said well of course it is but there are different ways of going about it the veteran answered tossing his head in annoyance at the shoemakers naivete those hidecovered sheds shaped like triangles theyre going to hang battering rams from those you see that log with the pointed iron beak thats going to be a ram theyll bring that little present up to the gate or try and fill in some of the ditch in front of the wall so they can come right up close and pound away and the shields all piled over there george looked out to the very edge of the forest even from that distance the shields were obviously not of the ordinary sort they were bigger than those either militiamen or regulars carried and extravagantly faced with iron tortoises rufus said the slavsll stand under em and try to dig out the stones at the bottom of the wall so the ones above em fall down of course life gets interesting under a tortoise ive been under one a time or three and its something i could do without interesting was not the word george would have used the thessalonicans already had piles of stones waiting along the walkway they also had stacked firewood and collected a goodly number of iron pots in which to boil water all of the stones and the boiling water would come down on the slavs maybe the shields would hold off the rocks could they hold out scalding water what we need john said is st demetrius coming down and working another miracle i mean a miracle besides talking through a homely old sinner like our captain here for a follis two at the outside rufus growled id go and tell bishop eusebius to lower your worthless carcass down in front of the wall and use it to pad the stonework against the boulders the barbarians are going to fling at us any boulder that bounced off your hard head would be gravel the next instant thats certain sure youve got your nerve running down miracles george said to john what do you think god would do to you for that john flashed his impudent grin god is a god of mercy right that means hell forgive me i hope now theres a doctrine that would get bishop eusebius hopping mad george said john did have his nerve george as often with his friend didnt know whether to be admiring or horrified whos running down miracles a deep voice behind them demanded george turned there stood menas solid and blocky and altogether cured of his paralysis the noble had a helmet on his head and a stout hammer in his hand he looked like a man with whom no one sensible would want to trifle where would i be today without gods kindness john started to answer him afraid of what the answer would be george stepped on his fellow militiamans foot john hissed like a viper george didnt care about that to menas he said im sure you must fit into gods plan for saving thessalonica what menas snapped that thought plainly hadnt occurred to him all hed worried about was gods plan for saving menas he had a fine glower one that no doubt struck terror into the souls of everybody who owed him money youre the shoemaker arent you thats me george answered evenly ill remember you menas rumbled he strutted off chest out thick legs striding along as if they hadnt been useless sticks for years maybe that strut was what made a couple of slavs shoot arrows his way the shafts missed but menas moved a lot faster and with a lot less selfconscious magniloquence after they zipped past his head john whispered you dont want to get important people angry at you george he spoke with unwonted sincerity i know about that why do you think im not living in constantinople anymore i dont know george answered theyre supposed to have good taste back there that probably has something to do with it rufus gave him an admiring look the slavs shoot poisoned arrows every now and then i wonder what they did for poison before your tongue came along you people dont need me john said i think ill go off into the garden and eat worms thessalonicas not that hungry yet rufus told him and besides your stretch on the wall here isnt up yet either were stuck with you a while longer but out beyond the walls the sounds of logging and carpentry went on and on people filed into the church of st demetrius to pray for the salvation of the city and to listen to what bishop eusebius had to say both about divine aid and about what mere men needed to do to save thessalonica well meet you across the square from the church after the service is over irene said george nodded his wife and sophia took the stairs up to the womens gallery he and theodore walked on down the central aisle of the basilica to get as close to the altar as they could not only did that give them a more concentrated feeling of the saints warlike power it also let them have a better chance of actually hearing eusebius george looked up toward the filigreed screen intended to keep men at prayer from being distracted by looking at and thinking about women in a way it did exactly what it was supposed to do in another way it faded for he kept trying to spot irene and sophia through the screens ornately patterned holes chanting priests swinging thuribles advanced toward the altar from either side clouds of incense drifted up from the censers fragrant frankincense and bitter myrrh like any church st demetrius was steeped in those fragrances even without their reinforcement when george smelled them his thoughts automatically went to holy things and here came bishop eusebius gorgeous in silks encrusted with pearls and precious stones he made his way to the altar and celebrated the divine liturgy with a zeal that matched the meaning of his name in greek pious as he usually did he conducted the services in greek george did not mind that even if latin was his preferred tongue maybe the powers that had lived in this land before christianity might also hear petitions in greek had he spoken that thought to eusebius the bishop would no doubt have berated him but then being a bishop eusebius was no doubt on intimate terms with god george was just a shoemaker and not inclined to be picky about which powers helped thessalonica against those of the slavs and avars when the service was completed eusebius addressed the congregation brothers and sisters under god we must remember always that we are in his hands and we must remember always that our fate is in our hands as well as his if we do not prove ourselves worthy of his aid we shall not receive it instead we shall be chastised for the multitude of our sins the instruments of his chastisement lurk beyond our walls i have heard it said the pagans number a double handful of myriads a hundred thousand men i do not know if this be true but it would not surprise me our own numbers are not so large but numbers alone i do not fear for is it not written and written truly how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had given them over and the lord had delivered them up for their rock is not as our rock the rhetoric was strong and heartening and lifted georges spirits but then he wondered as he had once or twice before what the men who talked with the powers and gods of the slavs and avars were saying to their followers they had no holy scriptures of course but he would have been surprised if they told their fellow barbarians anything much different from eusebius words all men believed their gods the mightiest till the test came then george had a truly appalling thought one that had not crossed his mind till now what if the men who talked with the powers and gods of the slavs and avars were right and bishop eusebius mistaken he shivered like a man out at night in a cold rain the avars and the slavs who did so much of their fighting for them had beaten the romans at least as often as they had tasted defeat what did that say about the relative strength of the powers involved he did not care for what he thought it might say brooding thus he missed some of what eusebius was saying his attention returned to the bishop in midsentence is because god demands much of us romans if we sin he punishes us as we deserve if we want him to stay his hand and not bring his flail down upon our backs we must live our lives in holiness showing him we deserve to be saved a hum of approval ran through the basilica how many people would give up gambling and blaspheming and fornicating because of the bishops words though bishops had been inveighing against sin since the beginning of christianity yet sin remained loose in the world and loose in thessalonica eusebius said we are men we are sinners we are imperfect god does not expect all of us can be saints he knows our hearts too well but he does expect each of us to do all he can if all of us together do enough our foes shall not prevail against us george always felt clever when he thought along with someone especially with someone who was clever himself as eusebius undoubtedly was as alarm had a little while earlier pride made him miss a few of the bishops words pray that we shall be brave enough to withstand the barbarians onslaught which cannot now long be delayed and we shall also pray that the measures we take against the foe both on the walls and in the spiritual realm shall be crowned with success amen the response came loud and strong george joined in along with everyone else nobody in thessalonica was crazy enough not to want to be delivered from the slavs and avars even the jews were probably praying for that deliverance the slavs and the avars wouldnt hate them for being jews but would hate them for being romans the jews got a poor bargain any which way eusebius stooped and picked up something that lay behind the altar he held up a large iron grappling hook with defenses such as this we shall turn aside the engines of the barbarians let us pray virtue into them amen the worshipers cried out again the lord god shall see that we do all we can in our own behalf and being merciful toward us and filled with loving kindness shall grant us a measure of his strength as well eusebius waved the grappling hook about if hed gone fishing with it he might have snagged a whale but whales were not its intended prey it was made for catching rams and their sheds just for a moment george thought the grappling hook glowed with a light that did not spring from the candles and lamps in the basilica of st demetrius before he could be sure he hadnt imagined it bishop eusebius set down the hook with a clank of iron and held up another again he and the thessalonicans prayed again george thought he saw a glow surround the hook with light apparently not from any natural source again he admitted to himself that he couldnt be sure another clank of iron heralded eusebius setting down the second hook and picking up a third all in all the congregation must have sought to pray virtue into at least a dozen grappling hooks george wondered how the bishop kept track of which ones had been prayed over and which hadnt did one of them by some mischance have a double dose of divine power prayed into it while another went without or could eusebius sense the difference between a grappling hook the lord had been invited to fortify and one he had not when the enemy attacks we shall all stand fast eusebius declared the liturgy is accomplished go in peace but knowing you shall be tested in the fire of war well smash them wont we father theodore said eagerly as they walked out of the church god will help us i hope so georges eyes went to the ruins of the ciborium and to the smoke stains still blackening the columns and ceiling nearby god had helped then dousing the flames and speaking through rufus to get the people up onto the walls when the slavs first appeared in large numbers but even as he walked across the square to the meeting place on which hed agreed with irene he heard drums thundering outside thessalonica not drums calling men to battlealarms would have come from the wall had that happenedbut more likely summoning the gods and demons of the slavs and avars to fortify the onslaught that was to come men against men walls against siege engines god against gods theres mother theodore pointed george waved to irene theodore having spotted her cast his eyes on some of the other womenyounger unmarried women coming out of the basilica some people might have disapproved of such concupiscent thoughts on the heels of the divine liturgy in theory george disapproved of them too in practice he remembered having done the same thing when he was a youth and for that matter he still looked at pretty girls when he got the chance even if he had no intention of doing anything but looking he remembered the one hed seen when the garrison marched away that unfortunately made him remember the garrison had marched away something he would sooner have forgotten the militiamen had kept thessalonica safe so far but the slavs and avars hadnt yet seriously assaulted the walls soonmaybe as soon as tomorrowthey would having a couple of thousand professionals in place alongside people like him would have made him rest easier of nights well lets go home irene said when shed made her way through the crowd to georges side then she spoke to sophia in a low tone george didnt think he was meant to hear dont stare at them that way dear youre supposed to bereserved mother sophias reply hit the indignant high note every young woman seems to find by instinct her ears turned pink george knew young women eyed young men too he smiled to himself by the way irene addressed her daughter that was supposed to be a secret of sorts he shrugged one of these days if he found the right chance maybe hed tease his wife about it i always feel better coming out of church after the liturgy irene said it reminds me of how much in gods hands i am yes bishop eusebius said the same thing george answered and let it go at that his own faith while real was harder to kindle but after a few more paces irene said while bishop eusebius was praying over those hooks though i couldnt help but wonder what the slavs and avars were doing at the same time yes george said again this time in an altogether different tone of voice he set a hand on his wifes shoulder im glad our parents thought we were a good match for each other they were right in more ways than they knew i was thinking the same thing myself were you irene walked on a little farther well you wouldnt believe me if i told you i was surprised not after all those years you wouldnt and since im not surprised anyhow they both laughed easy and happy with each other theodore and sophia looked at them not quite as if theyd suddenly sprouted second heads but certainly as if they were peculiar maybe they were george thought about dactylius and claudia he would have been astonished if they knew this camaraderie but then a lot of things about that marriage astonished him do you know irene observed i think dactylius and claudia would have been happier together if one of her babies had lived youre righthes said as much george let it go at that had his wife been watching theodore and sophia watching them too if she had her thoughts had gone from there in exactly the same direction as had his coincidence george didnt believe it it had happened too many times whatever it was he liked it george and sabbatius had the dawntomidmorning shift the next day as was his habit george reached the stretch of wall near the litaean gate a quarterhour or so early that gave him the chance to shoot the breeze with rufus and paul whod been up there to watch the slavs and avars through the late hours of the night and to see for himself what the besiegers might be up to he also saw something new one of the grappling hooks bishop eusebius and the congregation had blessed in the basilica of st demetrius attached to a good length of chain it lay on the walkway above the gate rufus said theyll try and break in where its easiest same as we would they wont try knocking down stones if knocking down timbers will do the job for them that makes sense george agreed he peered out toward the encampments of the slavs and avars a light mist kept him from telling what they were doing he turned his head back toward the east here came the sun rising red through the ground fog before long it would bum the fog away george wondered whether he really wanted to see the full range of the barbarians armaments after all paul yawned im for bed he said footsteps sounded on the stairs leading up to the wall and here comes sabbatius since im not leaving us shorthanded the taverner started for the stairway wait rufus said he spoke rough armylatin which paul who used greek by choice didnt follow at once rufus ran after him and grabbed him wait curse you he said shouting now he still spoke latin dont you hear theyre moving out there they were too in a way they hadnt done since the earliest days of the siege shouts and clankings and the sounds of heavy things being dragged along the ground came out of the thinning mist all at once george understood why rufus seemed to have forgotten his greek latin was the language hed used when he was a soldier and he thought he was about to be a soldier again the mist thinned a little more and the people and things moving through it came closer to the city as they did so cries of alarm and horn calls rang out up and down the wall this would not be another quiet day too bad george thought hed grown fond of quiet days do you think theyre going to attack sabbatius asked staring out at the battering ram moving slowly toward the gate and at the swarms of slavic archers who ran along beside and in front of it no sooner were the words out of his mouth than an arrow hummed past his head and shattered off the stone behind him rufus clapped a hand to his forehead no fool i think theyve come to get drunk with us and dance the kordax he kicked his legs high in a couple of steps from the obscene dance then apparently deciding sarcasm was wasted on sabbatius he pointed to the grappling hook lets throw that over the side and show the sons of a thousand fathers they arent going to have everything their own way what if they try to run up ladders too george asked you sound like dactylius rufus said with the horns screaming like that well have more men on the walls soon enough first things first since that was good adviceadvice hed given a good many times himselfgeorge took it he trotted with his fellow militiamen to the grappling hook as soon as he grabbed the chain he knew the prayers in the church of st demetrius had been effective he felt strong and brave and able to overcome anything as a man touched by the power of the military saint should have felt rufus himself handled the hook he said well show it to em let em know we have it ready and waiting he looked tough and confident too if they come on anyhow ill hook the shed like i was fishing for bream and then we all pull hard as we can and shout for help too god willing we lift the shed up and twist it so the ugly lugs under it get what they deserve everybody ready when no one said no he tossed the grappling hook over onto the outer surface of the wall the iron rang off the gray stone george stood right behind the militia officer ready to do whatever he ordered the shoemaker stared out toward the shed advancing on the litaean gate against the massive construction of timber and hides against the ironheaded log inside the grappling hook seemed small and unreliable but although the slavic archers kept swarms of arrows in the air the shed halted outside archery range from the wall a couple of slavs came out of it and pointed toward the gate no george realized joyously they werent pointing to the gate but to the hook hanging over it if it worried them it stopped worrying george an avar rode up to the shed on his armored horse and shouted to the slavs gesticulating angrily george didnt need to know any of the barbarians languages to understand what he was saying something like why dont you pick that thing up and get it moving again the slavs answering gestures were every bit as emphatic as those of their overlord the avar looked toward the gate himself he made a sign with his left hand when nothing happened he jerked his horses head around hard and rode off at a gallop weve beaten them sabbatius exclaimed not yet george said paul agreed that fellow on the horse is heading back for friends the business im in ive seen that kind of thing more times than i can count one chap loses a fight he goes off he comes back with some friends and they have another go at it aye thats how itll be here i think rufus said they havent gone to all this trouble to quit before they use their toys they werent going to use them right away though rumor raced round the circuit of the wall confirming what george had hoped all the rams the slavs and avars had built were now halted what are they waiting for paul asked as if his comrades could see into the mind of the khagan of the avars i think were going to find out george said pointing to the avar who now walked up toward the ram stalled in front of the litaean gate instead of wearing scalemail like all the other avars george had seen this one was fantastically decked out in furs and feathers and fringes hes an ugly customer isnt he sabbatius said with a scornful curl of the hp if thats what the avars wear when they arent in armor no wonder theyre in armor so much hes one of the people who treat with their gods george said wondering what kind of gods or powers the avars had unpleasant ones probably the shoemaker went on you can see it in how he carries himself you can feel it too the way you can with the bishop i still say hes ugly sabbatius said since george was a long way from finding the avar attractive he let that go sabbatius had a gift for fixing on the least important aspect of almost any matter and clinging to it as if it were at the core of the question the avar studied the grappling hook george watched him rub his chin in consideration as a physician might have done while evaluating a patient with a fever whose nature he did not immediately recognize whatever the fellow saw did not satisfy him he walked past the shed holding the ram and up toward the wall shoot the son of a whore rufus shouted as soon as he came within arrow range the command while eminently sensible was also to some degree wasted for the archers on the wallmore of them now than had been there a little while beforewere already sending arrows at the avar none bit george could not see any of them swerving aside or disappearing or bursting into flames they all simply missed the odds of that happening by itself struck him as somewhere between astonishingly poor and astonishing sure enough the avar had powers of his own christ with me john shouted drawing an arrow back to the ear when he thought he needed divine help he called for it george wondered what god thought about that maybe god decided he wasnt going to answer johns prayer considering some of the other things john said and did maybe the avars own gods protected him and maybe his arrow would have missed with or without invocations of god and godsjohns archery like that of most of the militiamen was not all it might have been whatever the truth there the avar remained uninjured on ground that had enough shafts sticking out of it to resemble a porcupines prickly back he drew his sword and waved it at the gate through the chain attached to the grappling hook george sensed the power in that sword at war with the one the prayers of bishop eusebius and the people of thessalonica had imbued into the hook hes strong paul whispered feeling that same clash of forces and then whats he doing now the avar in the outlandish costume raised the sword high and then stabbed it deep into the dirt the wall shivered as if from a small earthquake the avar caperedangrily if george was any judge he must have expected more one of the other avars called a question to their priest or wizard or whatever he was he shook his head yes he was angry his whole body seemed to radiate fury he capered some more in slackjointed style that would have won him applause as a mime he pulled the sword free and stabbed it into the ground again the wall shook once more but not very much the wizard shouted in his unintelligible language he waved his arms the fringes and furs and feathers sewn to his fantastic tunic fluttered and flapped nothing else happened he turned to the avar in scalemail and shouted again the warrior made as if to argue with him whereupon the fellows shouts turned into screams george didnt know what he was saying but wouldnt have wanted it said to him reluctantly the avar captain accepted the rebuke and the instructions that had led to it he shouted something himself the slavic archers in range of his voice trotted away from the walls of thessalonica and back toward their encampments all around the city the same shouted orders went out to the avars subject allies george could not see all around the city as far as he could see though the slavs were giving up the fight for now thats done it sabbatius cried gleefully weve shown them theyve got no business messing with good roman men his words were almost lost in the cheers that rose from the wall as the defenders of thessalonica watched the slavs withdraw despite those cheers rufus shook his head they dont think the attack will work nowthats plain enough he said but they havent done all this work so they could go off and leave it theyll be back but paul for once sounded as confused as sabbatius that crazy fellow out there whatever he was he saw that the power we prayed into the grappling hook was stronger than anything he could do against it no like rufus george had caught the distinction his other comrades were missing he saw that what he tried now didnt work that doesnt mean he cant try something else doesnt mean he wont try something else either i wish it did sabbatius scowled like a child learning he would have to go to school not only on the first day hed just survived but also for months to come why the dirty cheating son of a poxed ewe he exclaimed george looked at rufus rufus looked down at the ground looking down at the ground didnt help the veteran and the shoemaker both started to laugh and then started bleating out at the slavs and avars sabbatius and paul joined them the bleating spread along the wall more than a few feet away from the people whod started it the militiamen had no idea why they were making noises like sheep but any derision aimed at their foes seemed worth sending the slavs stared up at the romans on the wall some of them made peculiar gestures george stopped bleating and started laughing again they think were cursing them he exclaimed good rufus said and bleated louder than ever so did george wishing the bleats really would do something to the slavs and avars even more suddenly than it had begun the bleating died down george looked around to find out why and saw bishop eusebius coming down the walkway in his shining vestments he waited for the bishop a somber sort to make some cutting remark about the racket the militiamen had been creating but eusebius surprised him in a great voice he cried sing out you lambs of god george didnt sing out not at first he cheered instead along with most of his companions but then he did bleat and hoped that with eusebius blessing the sound would gain potency in the spiritual realm the words of the psalmist ran through his mind make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands bleating probably wasnt the sort of joyful noise the psalmist had had in mind but george didnt fret about that eusebius came up to rufus and said i see it is the same here as it is all along the circuit of the wall they have not dared attack us feeling the power of the lord our god he pointed to the chain from which the grappling hook hung down over the litaean gate rufus cleared his throat dont like to contradict you your excellency but it looks to me more like they havent attacked yet this avar i dont know priest i guess he tried to overthrow the power in the hook he didnt do it but i wouldnt swear he cant do it you know what im saying i do eusebius answered i wish i did not but i do we shall be tested in all ways i pray only that we shall not prove like belshazzar the king of babylon who was weighed in the balances and found wanting may our city not be given to the slavs and avars as his kingdom was given to the medes and persians the persians george muttered off in the distant east the persians still contended with the roman empire when god gave a gift he gave a longlasting onethough who heard anything of the medes these days as the avar wizards preposterous costume had drawn roman eyes to it so eusebius bright silks stood out among the drab wool and linen tunics the defenders of thessalonica wore the slavs who had been standing around dejectedly after their overlords spells failed to beat down the power in the grappling hooks now took fresh spirit and began shooting arrows at the bishop none of them touched him his holiness shielded him from them as the avars power had kept roman shafts from piercing him however holy eusebius was though george and his comrades could not match him they ducked down behind the outer wall of the walkway be careful with those arrows rufus said to sabbatius when one rebounded back near them remember the slavs sometimes poison the points i wasnt going to touch it sabbatius said and gave himself the lie by jerking his hand away again he reminded george of a schoolboy though schoolboys commonly drank their wine well enough watered to keep from getting drunk bishop eusebius said by my presence i am bringing you brave men into danger i shall withdraw he went over to the stairway and back down into thessalonica the storm of arrows died away indeed but for the short advance of the battering rams it was as if the efforts of the slavs and avars had never been paul laughed nervously does it usually get so quiet so fast he asked a lot of things about this siege strike me as peculiar rufus answered when i was fighting the goths now and then the lombards it was christian against christian oh they were heretics but thats a small thing their saints had the same powers as ours near enough with the slavs and avars its like they arent sure what their powers can do to us or about what god and the saints can do against them theyre feeling us out as they go i dont want any avar feeling me sabbatius said emphatically everyone else tried explaining that it was a figure of speech regretfully george saw again that he didnt need to be drunk to be stupid as the sun crossed the sky romans went down from the wall and resumed their normal occupations georges shift on duty was long past but he didnt feel like descending while rufus stuck to his post and the sudden slackening of the assault in which the avars had apparently put so much effort and so much faithin several senses of the wordstruck him as being as odd and suspicious as it did the veteran if something was about to happen he wanted it to happen while he was here to see it and to try to do something about it not to hear about it after it was done now the light shone in his face not at his back he wondered if the slavs and avars would renew the attack because of that he didnt think so the sun still blazed high in the southwest casting only fairly short shadows it wouldnt interfere with the roman archers aim hello rufus said suddenly here comes that cursed wizard or priest again what sort of deviltries does he have in mind now he made the sign of the cross to rout whatever demons or powers might be lurking to aid the avar if the gesture bothered the fellow he did not show it he was not alone this time a couple of fairhaired shaggybearded slavs accompanied him reading the attitudes of the three of them as best he could across a furlong or so george guessed the avar was doubtful and the slavs to either side of him more confident what are they doing the shoemaker asked leaning out over the wall to get the best view he could the slavs were still shooting arrows but only every now and then he ignored them although the slavs overlord the avar wasnt doing anything to speak of he stood there while his minions labored if they succeeded he would reap the benefit one corner of georges mouth twisted in a rueful smile barbarian in funny clothes though he was the avar had a lot in commonmore than he knew no doubtwith a good many roman nobles the slavs magic like their costumes was less showy than what the avars practiced they simply went to work as if as if theyre making shoes george thought pleased with the comparison what are they doing this time paul said it not george had george heard it back in the taverners place of business it would have meant something like are they making so much trouble ill have to throw them out snap george didnt hear that he felt it through the soles of his shoes what the he said and peered all around nothing seemed out of the ordinary his comrades must have felt the same strange sensation for they were looking around too seeing nothing amiss on top of the wall he looked out over it the slavic wizards seemed delighted with themselves one of them was holding what looked like a twofoot length of darkness george tried to convince himself he was seeing a snake or a length of lead pipe or something of the sort but he couldnt it looked like a length of darkness where had it come from somewhere close to him he judged or he wouldnt have felt that curious snap he looked down had the slavs sorcerously severed the chain that held the grappling hook he thought he should have noticed the clank as the hook fell to the ground to say nothing of the lessened weight he and the others were holding but nothere was the hook with chain intact most men having seen that would have looked no further but georges nature and his trade both impelled him to examine things carefully the chain was intact but about two feet of its shadow were missing the sun shone on that piece of the wall of thessalonica as if no stout iron links impeded its passage see what theyve done he exclaimed and pointed out the stolen shadow to his fellow militiamen i see what rufus said scratching his head i dont see why i dont either george said but they wouldnt have done it for no reason he was as certain of that as he was of sunrise tomorrow morning one of the slavic wizards kept hold of the piece of shadow they had seized the other heated a sword in a fire before long the blade glowed red the slav had no trouble keeping a hand on the hilt though more magic george thought his suspicions already wild grew wilder the slav with the sword drew the blade from the blaze the other one the one with the shadow held it out in front of him a hand at either end the slav with the sword brought it up then slashing down with one swift stroke sliced the shadow in two once cut it vanished george looked to see whether it reappeared on the wall at the same time it didnt that gap remained he pursed his lips something had changed after a moment he realized what it was he still had a hand on a length of the grapplinghook chain all he felt beneath his fingers now was sunwarmed iron the protective power st demetrius had given the grappling hook when so beseeched in the basilica dedicated to him was gone cut off as abruptly as the shadow had been before george could do anything more than note that sabbatius said somethings wrong here and then the hook its justa hook that was inelegant but it had more accuracy than sabbatius usually managed nor were the romans the only ones to note the change the slavic wizards leaped in the air in delight at what theyd accomplished the avar who had used their service patted them on the shoulder as if they were a couple of horses that had hauled his cart faster than hed expected he shouted back toward a couple of mounted avars his voice as harsh as a ravens caw the men in scalemail shouted too george could not understand what they said but their tone spoke for them now we can get on with it was what they meant moments later their signal drums started booming that meant now we can get on with it too up on the walls of thessalonica horns called the militiamen to alertness did their brassy music sound faintly alarmed george hoped that was his imagination but he didnt think so he said id bet the slavs took our protective magic off all the grappling hooks on the whole circuit i never thought of that sabbatius exclaimed the only thing past the end of his nose he was in the habit of thinking of was his next cup of wine rufus nodded soberly im afraid youre right he said to george and then coughed a couple of times well well just have to beat them he pointed down over the wall on our own hook george stared at him youve been spending too much time listening to john he said as if passing sentence after a crime maybe i have the veteran said that doesnt mean im wrong though look he pointed out beyond the wall the slavs have decided its time to go back to work the slavs have decided the avars will slaughter them if they dont get back to work george said it amounted to the same thing arrows get back shouts rang out up and down the wall warning any of the defenders who werent so alert as they might have been cries of pain rose too as some of the arrows found their mark the militiamen shot back here and there a slav crumpled but more warriors took the place of those who fell the besiegers seemed to have an unlimited store of missiles they made the defenders keep their heads down most of the time rufus did not enjoy the luxury of being able to take cover here comes the cursed ram he announced and shouted for more men on the chain come on friends this is how we earn our pay what pay someone said nobodys paying us a halffollis and were all losing money because we cant work at our proper trades youre getting paid rufus answered you do a good job here and the bastards down there wont cut your throat like a sheeps rape your wife bugger your little boy and burn down your house with your old toothless father in it you dont think thats pay enough the fellow who had complained kept very quiet after that here came the shed sheltering the battering ram it was heavy and could not move very fast george would have been glad had it moved even slower every foot the slavs inside made it lurch forward brought it so much closer to the gate above whose housing he stood if the slavs and avars got into thessalonica that complainer and his family wouldnt be the only ones who suffered rufus jerked the chain back and forth the grappling hook clanked against the stonework over the gate when they get close enough im going to try and snag em he said then everybody on the chain pulls like a madman we throw rocks down on the slavs heads and our bowmen fill them full of arrows he grinned showing off the few worn teeth left in his mouth sounds easy doesnt it everything sounds easy george said its only when you try doing it that it gets harder youre learning rufus said george risked another glance out over the wall as the shed with the ram advanced it left behind the corpse of a slav whod taken a shaft in the neck most roman arrows though either glanced off the hides of the roof or were turned by the big shields the barbarians at the front of the shed carried wont be long now rufus muttered come on there logfish let me get my hook in you nearer and nearer to the gate crawled the shed george could hear the panting of the men who hauled it forward peeking out between the slavs with the big shields was the ironfaced head of the log that would try to break down the litaean gate all right rufus said let me have some more chain boys enough to do what i need to do the big rough iron links some of them blushing red from a light coat of rust paid out through georges hands rufus leaned over the edge of the wall as if he were all alone the slavs sent a blizzard of arrows at him none of them stuck it was either incredible luck or the lingering protection of st demetrius the veteran maneuvered with the hook trying to snag the front end of the roof pole the slavs were maneuvering too the ram thudded against the gate which groaned like a wounded man thud another groan of timbers and bars and hinges now rufus shouted before the ram could strike again george pulled with everything he had in him the chain swiftly moved up a couple of links worth then stuck as it lost its slack and took on the full weight of the shed down below the slavs shouted in anger and alarm george pulled again along with everyone else on the chain they gained a quarter of a link he set his sandals against the rough stone of the walkway and kept on pulling the slavs tried to free the hook from the shed george could feel the chain twist a little in his hands but it was taut now and gave the barbarians nothing to work with a quarter of a link half a link a link at a time he and his grunting cursing comrades gained other militiamen flung stones at the slavs under the shed then dropped bigger stones the defenders of thessalonica also popped up to shoot arrows at those slavs quickly ducking back to escape the shafts slavic archers aimed at them pull rufus bellowed pull and bear to the left that way youll he didnt need to say anything more with a rending crash the shed tipped over on its side some of the slavs inside screamed as the log with which they had intended to smash through the litaean gate smashed them instead those who could picked themselves up and fled for the woods some of them helping wounded comrades along shouldnt we get out there and burn that shed george asked rufus that way they cant sneak back at night to try to drag the thing away repair it and use it against us again before rufus had been set against any sally now he pursed his lips and looked thoughtful out through the postern gate he muttered half to himself wouldnt take long wouldnt be much risk he smacked fist into palm in sudden decision well try it he told off a dozen men george and paul among them take torches and take oil you want to make sure that when you set the fire it sticks and spreads youll only have the one chance the militiamen got what they needed and hurried down the stairs rufus came with them and outshouted the militiaman in charge of the postern gate who seemed in no mood to risk opening it for anything if you dont bet you cant win george told him thats right thats exactly right rufus said we can hurt the sons of whores but not if we stand around here flapping our jaws instead of going out there and doing something about it he set a hand on the hilt of his sword as if to challenge the postern gate commander that worthy though hardly half his age wilted rather than responding george and his comrades drew their swords the gate opened they dashed toward the tumbled shed the slavs shouted some in excitement more in alarm they had not expected the romans to rush out at them some fled others stared only a few had the presence of mind to start shooting at the newcomers george slashed at a slav standing between him and the shed the slav turned the blow with a large clumsy shield he cut at george they traded swordstrokes the shoemaker got him on the forearm he dropped his sword running for the woods and shouting in his guttural language george did not pursue him past the shed though he might easily have caught him first things first he reminded himself he smashed ajar of olive oil against the timbers paul thrust a torch into the oil flames and thick black smoke rose not only there but elsewhere along the length of the shed weve done what we came to do george called to his comrades now we go back back they went running bent low to the ground to offer the slavic archers the smallest target just before they reached the postern gate though one of them cried out in pain and crumpled an arrow through his calf the slavs had helped their woundedhow could romans do less george heaved the fellow up and helped him limp into the city the postern gate slamming shut was one of the sweetest sounds hed ever heard militiamen slammed bars into place to keep the gate secured some of the bars were gray and weathered having stood up to sun and rain for years some though were of fresh newcut timber and rested on shiny rustfree iron brackets george was heartily glad theyd made the postern gate stronger he and his comrades all but the wounded man hurried back up to the top of the litaean gate i want to watch that shed burn paul said stressing the last word you were right george now theyll have to build another one if they want to attack us here yes george said but less happily than he would have thought possible before theyd burned the shed and the ram lots of slavs swarmed out there running up another shed wouldnt take them that long and besides he looked south then north along the wall i dont think theyve broken into the city anywhere else but they havent rufus said if they had youd hear the screaming in constantinople it couldnt have happened without our knowing about it i suppose youre right george said thats good they the wind shifted and picked up a little coming now from out of the west that meant it blew the smoke from the shed straight into the faces of the defenders atop the litaean gate george broke off and started to cough his eyes stung tears ran down his face if he looked anything like the rest of the men up there the soot was turning his face black too and not only his face either john came up to rufus and said if you wanted your hair dark again why didnt you just dye it instead of going through all this ahh to the crows with you rufus said and then he had a coughing fit too he spat his saliva was black he stared at it in disgust by the saints maybe burning the shed wasnt such a good idea after all if the slavs put ladders against the wall now theyll be up here with us before we know theyve even started climbing like a lot of what the veteran said that had truth mingled with the jest through streaming eyes george tried to peer through surging smoke to see what the slavs were doing he couldnt see much he hoped that meant they werent doing much if it didnt hed get more practice using his sword cheers rang out off to the north he didnt know what that meant but he had hopes when the cheers werent followed by cries of alarm he decided the hopes were justified i think we just threw them back up there too he said and then coughed some more eventually the shed burned itself out by the time it did george felt like a smoked sausage in a butchers shop the westering sun shone red as blood through the last few puffs of smoke from the fire wearily rums said i dont think theyre going to come back for any more tonight and if they do its going to be somebody elses worry not mine with that he went down into thessalonica george stayed on the wall till he saw enough men were coming up to replace those going down once he was sure of that he went home too a lot of grimy smokedarkened men walked through the streets of the city some men george had heard had skins naturally that color hed never seen any but it might have been true irene gasped when he walked in through the front door of the shop whats the matter he asked in genuine she pointed to him youre black and youve got blood all over you he looked down at himself sure enough blood had sprayed onto his tunic his right handhis sword hand was bloody too along with being filthy dont worry he said its not mine his wife dipped a rag in a pitcher of water and handed it to him i dont know whether that tunic will ever come clean she said but you can wash yourself obediently he scrubbed the blood and soot from his skin the rag turned a color halfway between rust and gray you missed a couple of places irene told him pointing to his cheek and to his left shin when he scrubbed at those he discovered they hurt he also discovered he hadnt been altogether right he had cuts in both places cuts that started bleeding again when he got them wet wonder how i picked those up he said bemused irene looked more horrified than ever theodore on the other hand seemed struck with awe you mean you got wounded father and you didnt even know it he exclaimed i guess i did george answered irene started to cry george put his arm around her theyre not really wounds darling hed seen wounds he knew that was true theyre just scratches like what you called something could be as important as what it really was what you called something for that matter could determine what it really was names were powerful irene said the slavs were trying to kill you he recognized the astonished indignation in her voice hed felt the same thing when he first realized the difference between exercises and war well they didnt he said and squeezed her tighter and i helped bum one of their battering rams and the shed it came in that made theodore look not just proud but jealous it did little to reassure irene though you mean you went outside the wall she said and shivered when he nodded when you didnt come home after your regular shift on the wall was done i knew something was wrong no i knew it before then when men started running through the streets shouting about an attack waiting and praying and praying and waiting come very hard let me tell you we threw them back george said they couldnt sneak into the cityst demetrius stopped that and they couldnt batter their way into itwe stopped that ourselves his chest puffed out with what he hoped was pardonable pride sophia came into the shop through the back door in time to hear him in tones of reproof she said the blessings of the saint on the grappling hooks couldnt have hurt father couldnt have hurt george admitted but they didnt help either sophia and irene and theodore all stared at him he had to remind himself that they hadnt been up on the wall he explained the slavs and avars found a magic to cut through the power in that blessing his family exclaimed in dismay how can we beat them if they defeat our power sophia said we managed just now george said his daughter looked puzzled he went on powers or no powers were still men and so are they it was a straightup fight on the wall today and we won it and outside the wall too theodore said i wish i could have been out there instead of you instead of no george said alongside methat may happen son you havent got much practice with weapons but you dont need much practice to fight from the wall theodore looked about ready to explode with joy and excitement irene looked about ready to puncture george with an awl she hadnt been delighted to hear her husband had gone down and fought outside the wail to hear her son sounding so eager to imitate his exploits left her shaking her head about the male half of the human race sophia sniffed not scornfully but in a practical sort of way i think supper is about ready she said and went upstairs to check her voice floated down to the shop come eat everyone supper was a porridge of peas and beans and onions with bread and salted olives alongside good george said good as anything we could have had before the slavs and avars came it would have been a plain supper then and was rather a fine one now but that didnt mean he was wrongnot quite it tasted all right and filled his belly in the end what else mattered daylights twelve hours were short as autumn drew on toward winter while those of night stretched like clay in a potters hands george hoped the slavs and avars wouldnt use the long night hours for deviltry he intended to use every last moment of them for sleeping with a yawn he said im turning in fighting a war is harder work than making shoes a lot of warfare hed discovered up on the wall consisted of doing nothing the moments when he wasnt doing nothing though he knew hed have those moments printed on his memory till a priest chanted the burial service above his corpse no one argued with him but what hed said didnt mean making shoes was easy his wife and daughter washed the supper dishes in the last fading glow of twilight when full darkness fell everyone went to bed lying there beside george irene asked have we beaten them back for good then for the first time in all the years since theyd wed he got the feeling she wanted him to lie to her try as he would he couldnt do it i dont know he answered but i dont think so theyll try something else or maybe he same thing over again to see if it works better the second time oh she said in a small voice all right it wasnt lot by the way she said it but he didnt hear her hed heady fallen asleep v some nights george did not want to go straight to bed after the noble germanus gave him a good price for a second pair of embossed boots like the ones hed bought before the siege of thessalonica started the shoemaker coins jingling in the pouch he wore on his belt went over to pauls tavern to spend some of his profit as enjoyably as he could he was glad to duck inside close the door someone yelled even as he was doing so it was chilly outside but fire kept the tavern cozy he looked around for people he knew sabbatius sat at a table by the wall not far from the fire he didnt see george he was already slumped against the wall half asleep in the couple of years theyd been in the same militia company george had never found out what he did for a living drink mostly as far as the shoemaker could see paul was frying in olive oil some squid a customer had brought in fishing boats still sailed out onto the gulf of thessalonica to help keep the city fed they didnt go far from shore though not when autumn storms could blow up almost without warning the hot meaty aroma of the sizzling squid sent spit squirting into georges mouth he made his way toward the taverner who used wooden tongs to take one of the squid out of their bath of bubbling oil and pass it to the fellow whod given them to him to cook hot the man yelped sticking burned fingers in his mouth paul gave him the other fried squid he burned his fingers on that one too but then began to eat red wine george said paul filled his mug he lifted it in salute a pestilence on the slavs everyone who heard that toast drank to it george poured down the wine tossed another follis on the counter and held out his mug for a refill this time he sipped instead of guzzling he was a moderate man sometimes even in his moderation somebody waved george pointed to himself no i dont want you john said im trying to talk that dipper on pauls wall over there to sit by me shaking his head george plunked himself down on a stool by john are you going up there tonight he asked pointing to the little raised podium where entertainers performed easiest way i know to earn my wine john said it wouldnt be for me george said id sooner have the slavs shooting arrows at me than stand up there and tell jokes in front of a big crowd of people yes well when they dont laugh theyre meaner than the slavs too john said a faraway expression on his lean facehe was george thought probably remembering times when they hadnt laughed after a moment one of johns eyebrows rose almost to his hairline theyre generally drunker than the slavs too he added you can joke about making jokes george said what do you do when they dont laugh die john said succinctly it happens if it happens too often you have to go out and work for a living ive done that too telling jokes is more funand besides im no good at anything else oh i dont know george said you could work in a stable because he didnt get away with it not this time because i already know everything about horseshit john finished for him ha ha stage fright isnt the only reason you dont go up there pal im not going to argue with you george said i tell jokes the way you make shoes i admit it he looked sidelong at john of course when i make shoes i dont run the risk of having to get out of town in a hurry because ive made somebody with more money than me angry what you mean you didnt tool germanus likes pretty boys into those fancy boots you made for him john said im disappointed in you maybe you did it in tiny letters or in fancy ones that look like part of the design till you see them just right george coughed which wasnt a good idea because hed taken a swig of wine a moment before i dont know that germanus does like pretty boys he said once he wasnt trying to choke to death neither do i john said cheerfully that wouldnt stop me from telling jokes about him though he took a sip of his own wine making a point of doing it neatly a moment later though he looked glum which added close to ten years to his apparent age of course thats why i dont live in constantinople anymore which i suppose proves your point a barmaid came around with a bowl of salted olives before the slavs came a big handful had cost only a quarter of a follis they were up to three quarters of a follis now but that was still cheap george bought some and ate them one by one spitting the pits onto the rammedearth floor by the time hed finished them and licked his fingers clean he was thirsty again he called for another cup of wine the wine was where paul really made his money john ordered more wine too when the girl brought it to him he slipped an arm around her waist and said after i get done tonight why dont we go someplace quiet and she twisted away shaking her head ive heard about you if you dont like me in bed youll call me names so nasty theyll make me cry and then youll tell jokes about me tomorrow night and if you do like me youll sweettalk me till i dont know up from downand then youll tell jokes about me tomorrow night no thank you either way she went off her nose in the air george had heard john tell a lot of jokes about a lot of different women which made him think the barmaid was likely to be right john peered down into the cup of wine the girl had given him harsh black shadows from the hearthfire and the torches on the wall kept george from reading his expression after a while paul thumped his fist down on the bar in front of him once twice three times the racket in the tavern faded though it did not vanish paul said now folks heres someone who can keep us laughing even with the slavs all around come on tell john what you think of him not that john exclaimed as he bounced to his feet and seeming like a builders crane all built of sticks with joints in curious unexpected places made his way up to the little platform that might at another time have housed a lyreplayer or a fellow with a trained dog most of the people in the tavern clapped for him a few did tell him what they thoughtlikely those whod been his butts in the recent past he ignored them with the air of a man whod heard worse being a funny man is hard work you know that he said swigging from the cup of wine hed brought with him i was trying to talk a girl into bed with me and she turned me down just on account of im a funny man who says youre a funny man a heckler called john turned to paul who was dipping up a mug of wine behind the bar youve got to stop feeding your mice so much they keep squeaking for more while im doing my show he waited to see if the heckler would take another jab at him he disposed of such nuisances with effortless ease when the fellow kept quiet john shrugged and resumed like i was saying she told me that if i didnt like her id insult her and then tell jokes about her but if i did like her id say all sorts of nice things to herand then id tell jokes about her he waited for his laugh then went on so you see friends this isnt easy work george looked around the tavern till he spotted the barmaid whod turned down johns advances she stood with both hands pressed to her cheeks she hadnt said yesand by the same token john hadnt waited till the next day to tell a joke about her even if it was the same joke shed told about him george envied the comic his ability to take something from everyday life and incorporate it into his routine as if hed been using it for years thinking about the way john told jokes kept him from paying attention to the jokes john was telling he started listening in the middle of one so the persian king had this new woman brought in before him and he looked her over and she was pretty enough so he said well little one tell me are you a virgin or what and she looked back at him and she said may it please you your majesty i am what about three quarters of the people in the tavern got the joke and laughed what several people said at the same time some of them smugly showing they understood others sounding bewildered enough to prove they didnt day after tomorrow john said i promise you an angel of the lord will come in here and write it out in letters of fire but it probably wont do you any good because if you cant figure that one out its a sure bet you cant read either oh john george said softly this was how his friend got into trouble when he started insulting his own audience they stopped thinking he was funny george instinctively understood how and why that was so clever though he was john had never figured it out but tonight john steered clear of that danger at least for the moment talk about your miracles now he said with a wry grin isnt it wonderful how god gave menas back his legs just in time for him to run away from the slavs that got a laugh too but a nervous laugh some people were probably nervous about johns questioning the will of god others about what menas would do to john if the joke got back to him george who prided himself on being a thorough man was nervous about both at once its all right john said soothingly i saw another miracle too when st demetrius told rufus to let the rest of us know the slavs were attacking old rufus didnt swear once if thats no miracle what is george looked around again and saw he wasnt the only one doing so he didnt spy rufus in the audience which meant nothing would happen to john right away sooner or later though the veteran would hear about the joke that was the way life worked rufus had been around a long time he might laugh it off if he didnt being a shoemaker would have nothing to do with why george wouldnt have cared to stand in johns sandals if john knew hed skirted trouble again he didnt let on but then he never did he went on with another story did you hear about the fellow who got an audience with the roman emperor by claiming he was god the emperor told him youd better think about this because last year a man came before me saying he was a prophet and i ordered his head cut off and the fellow looked at him and said your majesty you did the right thing because i did not send that man more people groaned than laughed over that one but john didnt mind if anything he looked happy the silly story let him slip away from the dangerous ground on which hed been treading listening to him tell more tales george fully realized for the first time that he wasnt just spinning one story after another they all fit together in a pattern as elaborate as any a mosaicist could make with colored tiles and partmuchof the art here lay in concealing from the audience that a pattern existed one more reason george thought i couldnt match what john is doing do you know john said our friend sabbatius there he pointed to sabbatius who seemed to have slept through his entire performance has never seen a drunken man in his life oh come on now several people said that or words to that effect at the same time nobody who came regularly to pauls tavernor to any of a good many others in thessalonicacould fail to know sabbatius was a tosspot of epic proportion but john only grinned his lopsided grin its true he insisted he drinks himself to sleep before anybody else and he doesnt wake up till long after everybody else is sober again deny it if you can no one could he got an appreciative hand instead raising his voice to a shout he called isnt that right sabbatius the plump militiaman thrashed and almost fell off his stool wuzzat he said thickly before sliding back into deeper slumber isnt he wonderful john said more quietly now he looked out at the people packing the tavern and arent you all wonderful and dont you wish you could be sure your name would never ever show up in one of my stories best way i can think of is to make me too rich and happy ever to think of you in an unkind way he nudged with his foot a plain earthenware bowl up there on the platform with him quite a few people made their way over to him and tossed coins into the bowl george watched their faces as they went back to their seats or to the bar some looked pleased theyd rewarded a man whod entertained them more though wore a tight intricate expression almost as if theyd made up their minds to have a tooth pulled to end continuous pain they were the ones who feared john would mock them next how does it feel to be a blackmailer george asked when money stopped rattling into the bowl and john carried it back to the table dont know yet the comic answered let me count the take first he dumped the bowl out onto the tabletop shuffling coins into stacks his fingers were as quick and deft as a money changers he let out a little happy grunt at spotting silver among the bronze ah isnt that nice somebody gave me a miliaresion and heres another good goodone would be lonely by itself in a couple of minutes the reckoning was done tonight john declared being a blackmailer feels pretty good dont go away folks paul called in half an hour or so the special duo of lucius and maria whove sung in sicily and illyria will give you old love songs and some new ones all their own im sure youll want to stay and hear themtheyll send you home in a happy mood now i know when to leave john said scooping his take into a leather pouch ive heard lucius and maria by god theyre funnier than i am the only difference is they dont mean to be george hadnt heard them he said if theyre that bad how have they been able to perform in all those places are you kidding john rolled his eyes they stink up a town once they get ran out and they bloody well have to go somewhere elsein a hurry and so before they come on ill bloody well go somewhere else too good night but before he could escape the barmaid whose intended insult hed turned to his own purposes came up to the table that wasnt very nice what you did there she said hands on hips john said the best stories come from what really happens anybody silly enough to tell me not to use one would probably marry a eunuch she glared at him is that all that matters that i gave you a story you could use to make people laugh of course not he answered which with john was as likely as not to mean yes he leered i told you beforehand i had something else in mind confronted with a line like that george would have poured or maybe broken a jar of wine over johns head like anyone else he judged other people by his own standard and so was astonished when the barmaid said thats right you did in a purr that announced she suddenly had something else in mind too she and john left the tavern together muttering to himself george got another cup of wine from paul the barmaid having disappeared and settled down to see whether lucius and maria were as bad as john had claimed they werent they were worse after a stint on the wall early the next morning george went back to his shop to get some work done he wasnt working so much as he would have liked these days not with the siege people were still buying shoes hed sold several pairs to refugees who hadnt bothered putting on any before fleeing the slavs and avars having sewn the last strap onto a sandal he looked into the box where he kept little bronze buckles it was empty when he made an exasperated noise theodore said im sorry fatheri used the last ones in there a little while ago havent we got any more no those were the last george answered ill have to walk down to benjamin and buy some new ones he grumbled something inaudible even to himself more time when he wouldnt be able to get anything useful done theodore must have figured out what that grumble meant you could send me father he said i could george considered not without a certain amount of regret he shook his head no id better not hed skin you alive on the price hell skin me too but not so bad im not afraid of him theodore said just because hes a jew im not afraid of him because hes a jew george answered ive got the better of plenty of them im afraid of him because hes benjamin like most of thessalonicas jews benjamin lived and had his shop in the southwestern part of the city the whole street echoed with the taps and clangs of hammers on metal jews dominated the bronze and coppersmithing trades benjamin looked up from his work when george walked into the shop the bronzeworker was a few years older than george lean and wiry and dark ah good morning good morning he said in greek i thought you would be one of the bishops men and that order is not yet ready george scratched his head if you dont mind my asking what would bishop eusebius want from you arrowheads of course the jew answered holding up a file with which hed been sharpening one im supposed to deliver another five hundred day after tomorrow but if they wanted them today i couldnt do it arrowheads i should have thought of that george said iron points are harder of course but when youre in trouble you use everything you have benjamin said and george nodded the bronzeworker gave him a tired smile of sorts you though i do not think you have come for arrowheads wellno george said and smiled back ive finally gone through that last batch of buckles you sold me and i wanted to buy some more i have a few benjamin said but not many youre lucky you came in today george after i finished this order im working on now i would have melted them down for the next one i am lucky then george said hed been dealing with benjamin for a long time the man did good work finding someone else who had buckles or could make them would have been an annoyance at least and with bronze going into arrowheads might have been impossible lets see what youve got benjamin showed him the couple of dozen buckles hed made they were without a doubt up to his usual standard of quality the jew coughed apologetically i am going to have to ask more for them otherwise melting them down would pay me better how much more george asked warily he didnt think benjamin was lying to him he wished the bronzeworker were lying that would have made the dicker easier for most people i would double the price the jew said for you half again as much weve been doing business a long time and youve always been fair with me he looked thoughtful and besides dont i remember that you did something brave when the city had trouble with the cisterns a while ago i did what needed doing you dont think about things till afterwards praise made george nervous he turned the subject at least to some degree how did this part of the city come through the attack from the slavs water god or whatever he was the lord be praised we had no trouble here benjamin said the demon did not show itself at the cistern that serves us us jews he meant george stared not at all he asked not at all benjamin said again george didnt think he was lying he leaned his chin on his hand and thought about what that might mean maybe the slavic demigod had experience dealing with the powers of christianity and had never run up against anything jewish before maybe the jews a minority everywhere in the roman empire and an unhappy minority to boot prayed harder than most of thessalonicas christians and so averted trouble one other possibility occurred to him not one that made him happy but one he thought he could not ignore either maybe the jews held on to a bigger piece of truth than did his own coreligionists why do you suppose that was he asked benjamin curious to hear what the jew would say why i dont care about why benjamin said with complete and utter sincerity all i care about is that it did not happen for which i praise the lord george had trouble understanding anyone who didnt care about why but he hadnt come down here to understand benjamin hed come down to buy bronze buckles from him half again the usual price wasnt outrageous not with the way everything had shot up in thessalonica but a day without haggling was like a day without sunshine maybe a third again as much george began tentatively benjamin shook his head half again keeps you even with the arrowheads anything less and im better paid to melt down the buckles dont do that ill pay you ill pass it along to my customers so they can grumble at me the same way im grumbling at you george laid money on the counter in front of the bronzeworker if we run out of other copper we can melt down folleis no profit in itnot yet benjamin answered george had meant it for a joke but the jew had plainly made the calculation the shoemaker took the buckles and started out of the shop he almost ran into a youth coming in the youngster showed clearly what benjamin had looked like at about twelve his dark stare wasnt aimed at george for having almost collided with him but at everyone not a jew for everything that had happened to all the jews for the past two thousand years benjamin said its all right joseph george is a very good customer all right father the youth said and bobbed his head to george tm sorry sir i didnt mean to bump you he sounded as if he meant it his eyes thoughgeorge did not fancy facing those eyes no harm done joseph george said speaking to him as if he were a man joseph nodded polite but distant suddenly george wished with all his heart that benjamin had called him a good man not a good customer no help for it the jews didnt have it easy and they saw no point in making it easy for anyone else he didnt suppose he could blame them buckles jingling in his belt pouch he left the bronzeworkers shop the lord keep you safe benjamin called after him he waved to show hed heard but feared hed gone too far for the jew to see the gesture hed intended bringing the buckles straight back to his shop and getting to work but found himself waylaid when he walked past dactylius place the little jeweler dashed out the door toward him as fast as if hed had a swarm of slavs on his tail come on in george he said grabbing his friends arm your wife and daughter deserve some prettiesclaudia told me you fixed her sandal id almost forgotten george said listen dactylius i really ought to dactylius wasnt listening to himor letting go of his arm either come come come he said it was either come or pry him loose with a stick george came as soon as he walked inside the jewelers shop he sneezed that happened about every other time he went into the shop which smelled of hot metal and of the abrasive powders dactylius used to shine it and to polish his precious stones here let me give you these while i still can dactylius said presenting him with thin bracelets of bright bronze from the back room claudia asked in indignant tones what goes on what are you giving away now dactylius the whole shop most likely but when she came out to see what was going on and found the shoemaker there her manner changed oh its you george thats all right then george hefted the bracelets more ordinary ornaments he had never seen why wouldnt you be able to give me these later he asked why because they wouldnt be here later thats why dactylius said as if that were selfexplanatory seeing it wasnt he motioned george over to his worktable there now do you understand oh youve gone into the arrowhead business too george said well yes all right that does make sense benjamin the bronzeworker is doing the same thing for the same reason dactylius nodded yes i can see how he would be claudia though let out an indignant screech from the doorway to the back room they have my husband my brilliant artist of a husband doing the same thing as a noaccount jew darling you have to tell the bishop youre quitting and right this minute the insult i want to think about that before i do it dactylius said what george wanted to say to claudia was are you out of your mind what he did say was an arrowhead doesnt care who makes it thats not true claudia said advancing on him so she could argue nosetonose with anyone presumptuous enough to disagree with her how is the holy bishop eusebius supposed to bless an arrowhead made by some nasty jew instead of a good christian man it was a good questiona better question in fact than george had looked for from claudia after discarding two possible answers he came up with one he hoped might satisfy her since the bishop gave benjamin the work he doesnt seem worried about it claudia sniffed thats his foolishness a moment before hed been the holy bishop eusebius now he was a fool had she been born a man claudia might have had a fine career in the law courts she went on i still say its a shame and a disgrace for dactylius and a jew to both be doing the same thing were all inside the city together dear dactylius said hesitantly maybe if we gave the jews to the slavs and avars claudia began i dont think that would be a good idea george said with what he thought of as commendable restraint it probably wouldnt satisfy them claudia agreed mournfully that wasnt what george had meant or for that matter anything close to what hed meant he supposed he should have been happy hed got her to reconsider whatever the reason after thanking dactylius again for the bracelets he beat a hasty retreat sophia smiled when he gave her the bangle but said couldnt you have found something nicer not the way things are now george answered and explained what both benjamin and dactylius were busy doing he added claudia isnt very happy that her husband has had to come down in the world so claudia isnt very happy irene said with an air of finality im just glad you managed to get the buckles some buckles george said fewer than i would have liked he shrugged you do the best you can with what you have when ive used all these ill make boots for a while if we havent got rid of the slavs and avars by then well were liable to be down to eating leather by then instead of turning it into shoes sophia made a face youre making that up she looked at him real worry replaced playacted disgust no youre not you do the best you can with what you have george repeated if you dont have much you do the best you can with what little you do i hope it wont come to that irene said so do i george said but that doesnt mean it wont we all hoped the plague wouldnt come to thessalonica againbut it did he looked around the shop well if it comes down to eating boded leather well have a better supply than almost anyone else thats true irene said with a smile sophia giggled id like to see dactylius eat his stock in trade he couldnt do it george agreed solemnly but do you know what i wouldnt be a bit surprised if claudia could dactylius pointed out from the wall what are they doing out there he said they ought to be trying to get inside the city every moment of the day and night he sounded indignant as if the slavs and avars were falling down on the job you work all the time yourself george said and dactylius nodded vigorously i work all the time myself or i did before this siege turned everything topsyturvy even if he was almost out of buckles again with no great prospect of getting more he still wished he were back in the shop but the slavs and avars dont seem to do things the same way we do they make a push and put everything they have into it if it doesnt work they loll around for a while till theyre ready to try something else lolling around they certainly were for the time being anyhow they sat around campfires days were chilly now nights frankly cold passing wineskins back and forth some of them shot dice some sang songs whose music echoed in georges head even if the words were unintelligible if rufus saw them like this hed scream for a sally right now dactylius said the thin little jeweler seemed to puff himself out into the shape and choleric aspect of the veteran george clapped his hands it was a fine bit of mimicry but applause or not he shook his head hes seen them this way and hes all for sitting quiet they may be idle but they havent forgotten what theyre supposed to be doing see how they have sentries round all the engines ready to protect them if we do stick our noses outside the gates i wouldnt be surprised if they were trying to lure us out maybe so dactylius said not sounding as if he believed it he hesitated then went on quite as if he wasnt changing the subject i am still making arrowheads you know no i didnt know george said but i thought you would because you have too much sense to do anything else then it was his turn to hesitate i hope your wifes not too upset over what youre doing i managed to persuade her it was necessary the jewelers smile was wry every now and then i do win an argument good for you george said wondering whether to believe it wondering whether his friend fully believed it nobody should win all the time unless its us romans over the barbarians and thats not the same thing claudia now claudia was as fierce as any avar ever hatched but dactylius undoubtedly knew more on that score than he did a troop of avars came by armored men on surprisingly big armored horses just by the way they rode they gave the impression of owning everything they surveyed and owning it beyond hope of challenge george hadnt seen many of the nomads since the siege began compared to the numbers of their slavic subjects he didnt think there were many avars but every time he did see a few he understood why the slavs obeyed them i wouldnt want to go up against those fellows in the open field he said not even if i were betting a copper follis to win a gold solidus not even a halffollis dactylius agreed but were not in the open field and so he plucked an arrow from his quiver set it to his bow drew it back with a sweet swift motion and let fly george started to chide him because he thought the avars were far out of range especially for a small man like dactylius who couldnt pull a strong bow but the arrow kept going and going and going good shot george exclaimed oh good shot dactylius cried out in exultation when the shaft hed launched struck one of the avars in the side he cried out again a moment later this time in anguish when it rebounded from the fellows scalemail shirt the avar looked down at the arrow then up at the wall he shook his fist and kept on riding i had him dactylius moaned by st demetrius i had himand he got away he sent another arrow at the troop of nomads this one fell twenty cubits short as george had expected the other to do it was as if thessalonicas patron saint had helped that first arrow alongonly to see it fail in the end if that was an omen it was one for which george did not care he set a hand on dactylius shoulder you couldnt have done any better he said you did better than i thought you could if you shoot like that against the slavs when they come to shoot at us a lot of them wont go back to their encampments i know the jeweler said i hope i can but for a few seconds there killing that avar seemed like the most important thing in the world i thought id done it and then he shook his head its not fair no george agreed its not but for their part the avars would no doubt say it wasnt fair that god and st demetrius had watched over thessalonica and kept them from sacking the city fairness like beauty was in the eye of the beholder when no two people could agree on what it meant did it matter george had trouble seeing how the avar dactylius had shot but not wounded made his horse pull up and looked over toward thessalonica again as if deciding he wouldnt brook the insult after all he shouted something george wouldnt have understood it had he heard it clearly which he didnt hello the shoemaker muttered under his breath he might not have understood the shout but he understood what sprang from it out of one of the avars tents near the woods came the priest or wizard who had tried to ruin the holy power in the grappling hooks on the walls of thessalonica but had succeeded only in causing a minor earthquake whats he carrying with him dactylius asked looks like a mirror george answered hes in an even uglier getup than he was the last time we saw him isnt her instead of looking like some weird animal half furry half feathered the avar now resembled nothing so much as a tree all shaggy with moss he even wore a great untidy wreath of leaves on his head he came trotting up to the horseman who had called for him they talked together for some little while the mounted avar kept pointing back toward the wall and toward that portion of it where george and dactylius stood dactylius let out what could only be described as a giggle i dont think hes happy i almost let the air out of him the jeweler said id say youre right george answered the next interesting question is what can he do about it to turn any harm aside george made the sign of the cross the avar wizard had shaken thessalonicas wall even if he hadnt toppled it george didnt want that kind of power aimed at him aloneor come to that at him and dactylius together the mounted avar having said his piece rode on to rejoin his comrades the priest stood staring at the wall even across a couple of furlongs he seemed to be staring straight into georges face george stared back unable to take his eyes away he felt the weight of the avars persona pressing on him and pressed back as strongly as he could that seemed to take the avar by surprise abruptly he turned away and went back into the tent from which the horseman had summoned him dactylius tapped george on the forearm did you feel that the jeweler spoke in a whisper though the wizard was far away yes i did george said i didnt know you did too some of his pride in resistance faded if the avar had set that mental grip on more than one roman at once he was stronger than any single foe of his what do you suppose hes doing in there dactylius pointed to the tent into which the avar had returned i dont know george answered but i think well find out he hardly thought himself worthy of being compared to elijah or jeremiah as a prophet but that prediction was soon borne out the avar emerged from the tent carrying not only the mirror but what looked like a wooden pad of water he set the mirror on the ground as he did so the sun angled off it for a moment the flash proving to george what it was he began to dance around it every so often water splashed out of the pail onto the ground and onto the mirror clouds crowded the sky which moments before had been sunny though pale what had been as good a day as any thessalonica might expect in november quickly changed to one warning of storm magic george exclaimed nothing natural could make the weather turn so fast cold rain began pelting down onto the wall almost as soon as the word passed his lips dactylius pointed look he exclaimed its not falling on the slavs out there he was right the rain seemed confined to thessalonica alone past twenty or thirty cubits beyond the wall the weather remained as it had been george started to say something but thunder crashed deafeningly loud right above his head he staggered and almost dropped to one knee another crash came even louder than the first george stared up into the sky hed never heard thunder like that were those just cloud shapes or did they look like avars thumping great drums when the thunder rang out again he was convinced of what he saw those shifting shapes all thirteen of them were real after yet another peal of thunder rumblings continued for some time like aftershocks from an earthquake the rumblers were cloud shapes too little men or gnomes with enormous feet all made of mist avar rain and thunder spirits george shouted pointing up into the heavens he hoped dactylius would perceive them too before he could find out whether his friend did an utterly mundane arrow hissed past his face he reached for his bow to shoot back at the slavs then cursed the avar wizard as foully as he knew how no rain fell on the slavs their bowstrings were dry those of the men on the walls of thessalonica though were soaked and useless the thunder spirits thundered the smaller less fearsome rumblers rumbled the slavs out beyond the walls kept on shooting george and the other defenders were powerless to reply wheres bishop eusebius dactylius shouted he could put a stop to this wherever bishop eusebius was he was nowhere close by peering through the curtain of rain all around thessalonica as if through a glass darkly george saw more avars come out to confer with their priest i dont know why theyre wasting time talking he said theyll never have a better chance to attack the walls than now look dactylius pointed not to the cloud creatures in the sky not to the slavs and avars beyond the rain but to the head of the stairway leading up to the wall its father luke that made george feel as good as seeing the bishop might have done father luke was of lower rank but george and dactylius had already seen what his holiness could do george said you beat the one water demon father can you beat these new ones as well he pointed at the thunderers and rumblers up in the sky i dont know the priest replied putting a hand up over his eyes so he could see the avar powers without raindrops continually blowing in his face you dont know dactylius sounded horrified are we just going to stand here and drown the way people did in the great flood he looked about ready to drown the drumming rain made his hair run down over his face like so many wet snakes and plastered his tunic to him so tightly george could count his ribs in a way father lukes answer horrified george too in another way it pleased him a more arrogant priest would have claimed abilities he lacked and tried to do more than he could as father gregorythe late father gregoryhad done by the cistern if nothing else father luke had humility a virtue in any christian man and all the more vital in a priest god provided in the flood telling noah to build his ark father luke said i have faith god will provide for us now if not through me then surely through someone else again george did not quite know what to make of the response admiring the depth of father lukes faith he had trouble sharing it he knew he had not the temperament of a man like job to go on unceasingly praising god regardless of the misfortunes befalling him instead of criticizing the priest though he tried to nudge him into action you routed one water demigod with water of your own from the baptismal font can you do the same with these before he could say things the thirteen thunder spirits let loose with another crash one so enormous he thought it would split his head open father lukes shrug was not encouraging they are there he pointed up into the sky while i remain down here i see no way for the sanctified water to come in contact with them as it did with the slavic demon in the cistern all right you cant do that george said following the logic without liking it what can you do you have to be able to do something and youd better do it soon too dactylius added he sounded both insistent and frightened neither of which george wanted the shoemaker aimed to make father luke figure out what he could do and then to have him do it not to alarm and rattle him father luke fortunately seemed neither alarmed nor rattled i can pray he answered it was after all what a priest was good for even so george would have preferred a response somewhat more aggressive he was beginning to feel as much like a drowned rat as dactylius looked well if thats what you can do youd better get to it he said roughly the slavs out there arent going to be content with shooting at us up here on the wall not for long they wont pretty soon theyll try knocking it down again youre right of course father luke looked up to the heavens again now he paid no attention to the thunder spirits or the smaller rumblers nor to the rain beating into his face i take my text from the book of genesis and god said let there be light and there was light knowing the priests piety and knowing also how he had beaten the slavic water demigod george expected the avars sky powers to be routed and the sun to break through that did not happen the rain kept falling more thunder boomed as if those powers were laughing at father lukes effort to disperse them dactylius let out a cry of dismay that showed how much confidence he had placed in father luke george glanced over toward the priest father lukes long face was set in thoughtful lines seeing georges eyes upon him he nodded slightly it is as you have said all along he remarked the powers of the slavs are strong and now i see that the powers of the avars are stronger still since the avars rule the slavs i suppose i should have expected as much what can you do about it george demanded another shattering roar from the heavens emphasized the thunder spirits strength more than the priests words could have somewhere not far down the wall a militiaman screamed when an arrow pierced him caught in the tightly defined circle of rain the defenders could offer no reply what can i do suddenly despite building catastrophe father luke smiled for a moment george thought he saw in that smile the sun hed hoped the priest would be able to restore father luke said i could not make those powers quit this place against their will they were too strong for that suppose instead though i give them everything they want through drumming rain through rumblings and thunderings above dactylius hissed to george hes gone mad i dont think so george answered though he had not the slightest idea what the priest intended as father luke had before he stared up into the sobbing sky as he had before he chose words from the book of genesis but words of different import perhaps inspired by dactylius on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered whats he doing dactylius said fretfully is he trying to drown us all no i dont think so george said the rains no worse than it was before saying anything more he paused and looked out from the wall something had changed he was sure of that but had trouble identifying what it was and then all at once he laughed with glad surprise and bowed to father luke you did it your reverence did what dactylius squawked and then a beat behind the other two he understood he too bowed before the priest god gets the credit not i father luke said it was too wet for george to be sure his eyes twinkled but he thought so it was too wet all around thessalonica not just in the narrow circle to which the rain and lightning and thunder and rumbling had been confined now like any proper storm this one spread over the whole land give them what they want george said musingly they must have been angry penned up in such a narrow space father lukes voice was amiable rainwater splashed off the tonsured crown of his head now they can do as they like where they like and if the slavs and avars dont care for itwhat a pity george laughed out loud even standing here soaking wet in the chilly rain being alive felt monstrous good he vastly admired cleverness and what could be more clever than turning the avars powers against the priest who had loosed them in the first place that father luke had done the storm of arrows that had joined the rainstorm to assail the militiamen on the walls of thessalonica now died away archery with wet bowstrings was as impossible for the slavs as for the romans if the barbarians had planned anything more than sweeping the walls bare of defenders who could not shoot back the sudden extension of the rain made them think again george peered out toward the avar wizard who had summoned the thirteen thunder spirits and their lesser nimbler cousins to torment thessalonica he could see even less now than before what with the rain extending all the way from him to the wizard was that angrily dancing figure the avar or just a slav irked at having his sport spoiled the shoemaker could not be certain lightning crashed out of the heavens striking near the dancer whoever he was the thunder that followed almost at once made george clap his hands to his ears he felt as if he were standing inside gods biggest bass drum lord have mercy he gasped he has had mercy on us father luke said without his help our city would have fallen but that wasnt what you meant was it not exactly george said his head still ringing i hope the lord had no mercy at all on that cursed avar dactylius exclaimed i hope that lightning bolt burned him to ashes and i hope the ashes wash into the sea and are gone forever thats what i hope he stuck out his chin daring the other two to disagree with him i hope the avars leave off attacking us and accept our faith father luke said george snortedthat was a pretty sentiment but how likely was it father lukes eyes twinkled again after a moment he went on that failing dactylius hope sounds good enough for me do you think the lightning did cook the avar priest george asked what i hope and what i think are i fear two different things the priest replied those are the powers with which he is intimately familiar i think he will be able to bring them back under his control george sighed that made more sense than he wished it did and father luke proved a good prophet as george himself had not long before the rain soon eased off the thunder stopped a brisk breeze sprang up and blew away the storm clouds here comes the sun george said happily the sunshine was watery but it was sunshine and there in the sunshine stood the avar priest now that george got a good look at him he saw his bizarre costume was soaked and with any luck at all ruined the wizard stared toward the wall and shook a fist at no not at george it had to be at father luke and the priest nodded back toward the avar recognizing the others skill and potence you ought to blast him with an anathema dactylius said i do not think he fears my anathemas father luke said i do not think he fears any christian power only greater acquaintance with us will teach him the true strength of the lord that was as temperate an answer as george could have looked for from any priest but the avars and the romans had struggled against each other now for most of a decade the war remained unwon on either side which he presumed also meant neither god nor the gods and spirits of the slavs and avars had prevailed he might have been able to say something to that effect to father luke as he could not have to bishop eusebius but when he opened his mouth to speak his teeth chattered so loudly he could not he and the rest of the militiamen on the wall had stood in the driving rain longer than the avar wizard had done and were more drenched than he the breeze was chilly too father luke took off his cloak which was thick even if soaked and wrapped it around georges shoulders thats all right your reverence the shoemaker said trying to shrug it off here you keep it i may not be the son of god to give up my life for mankind but i should be a poor sort of priest indeed if i did not give up my cloak for a friend father luke said just then dactylius sneezed that gave george the excuse he needed to shed the cloak he passed it to dactylius the jeweler tried to protest too but kept on sneezing that let george and father luke ignore him and left them both warm in spirit if less so in body john and sabbatius came up onto the wall to replace george and dactylius so far as george knew nobody had told sabbatius that john was in the habit of making jokes about him one of these days sabbatius would find out and there would be trouble not wishing either to borrow or to cause the latter george kept his mouth shut and headed for home when the shoemaker got to his shop irene said wasnt that a dreadful storm a couple of hours ago i see youre still all wet poor thing and the roof has a new leak in it too i put a bowl down under it to catch the drips it was quite a storm george agreed if it had seemed nothing more than that to his wife he was as well pleased storm like that im glad the slavs didnt attack theodore said they could have caused all sorts of trouble and you might not have noticed them in the rain till too late thats true too george said and sneezed as vigorously as dactylius had up on the wall come upstairs get out of that wet tunic irene took charge of him with brisk efficiency drink some warm wine with honey in it that will make you feel better if i dont feel better i wont notice after i drink enough of it george said ignoring that irene maneuvered him much as rufus might have done up on the wall and sure enough in dry clothes and with hot wine in him he did think the world a kindlier place than he had when he was all wet and shivery he stretched the upper for a boot he was working on over the last and smoothed the leather with a round file thats good work father theodore said looking over his shoulder he paid more attention to it himself than he had been doing it is isnt it he said surprised at how surprised he sounded looking down at his hands he added they know what theyre up to anyhow now if i could only leave them behind to work while the rest of me goes upstairs to supper or off to the tavern that would be pretty fine theodore snorted while youre at it why not wish for a bronze man like the one the poet says hephaestus made to help him with his work why not indeed george said mildlytoo mildly to suit his son who might have been hoping for an argument as he often did these days he went back to work himself george let his hands guide the file over the leather once more since theyd proved they could tend to that by themselves when theodore had learned to read greek the teacher taught him homer from whose poems boys had been learning to read for more than a thousand years even now in these christian times the iliad and the odyssey gave the old gods a shadowy life they would not have had without them was that good or bad homer wrote so well that while you were reading him you couldnt help believing in his gods and heroesgeorge remembered as much from his own days in school no wonder some bishops would sooner have had students taught from the holy scriptures alone thereby interring the memory of the pagan gods for good but the words are so fine george murmured while hed mused his hands had smoothed out the whole toe of the boot he opened and closed them almost as if to make sure they were still willing to respond to his will maybe hed come closer to imitating hephaestus than either he or his son had thought that night irene said something more happened today than you let on in front of the childrenor in front of me either come to that what was it he didnt bother asking how she knew theyd slept side by side more than half their lives he often wondered if she knew him better than he knew himself it wasnt an ordinary storm he said and went on to explain how the thirteen thunder spirits and however many little rumblers there had been had let the slavs shoot at the romans for a while without fear of reprisal and how theyd nearly let the slavs do worse than that too irene shivered then took him in her arms as much he judged to reassure herself he still lay beside her as because the night was chilly that is a terrible thing she said in the quiet dark that the power of the lord could not rout these skythings the avars worship it is a terrible thing george answered remembering how frightened hed been when father lukes first prayer faded to drive the thunder spirits and rumblers away from thessalonica its what ive been saying the powers feed off the belief the slavs and avars give them god doesnt feed off our power he gives us power the way he did with rufus in the church of st demetrius the pagan powers from the old days that still lurk here fear him why dont these others because theyre stronger george said patiently i think father luke did very well when he saw he couldnt force the avar powers out of the sky he went with them instead of against them he used their own nature to get them to drench the barbarians along with us and that ruined whatever plan the avars had it worked but was it right irene asked satan will give you what you want too if you ask it of him asking is the sin i dont think father luke sinned i think he did what he had to do and i think he was clever to come up with it so quickly after the first prayer faded irene shivered again and held him tighter i hope youre right so do i george said he didnt want to think about what being wrong might mean that his wife was holding him and he her gave him something else to think about since he was a man what that something was soon became evident irene laughed a quiet laugh deep down in her throat and reached between them they made love with their tunics hiked up rather than naked the night was cold they were generally happy with each other in bed one reason they got on well with each other outside the bedroom tonight though irene responded to his caresses with more fervor than shed shown in he couldnt remember how long her excitement drove his too only afterwards his tunic down past his knees again to warm as much of him as it could did he wonder whether irene also had a good many things she was trying not to think about he yawned and snuggled closer to her she was already nearly asleep all the jokes said that was something men did but it happened with her more often than with him not that he wasnt sleepy himself no indeed soon after her breathing grew deep and regular his did too the last thought he remembered having was a vague hope that she would find herself worried more often you shoemaker the gruff growl made george look up from his work there in the doorway stood menas looking large and well fed and unpleasant one look at his proud meaty face said he remembered and still resented georges remark up on the wall he was the sort of man who would remember for a long time anything diminishing his selfimportance no help for it what can i do for you today sir george asked i hear youve been telling lies about me menas said heavily no sir george said surprised now so far as i know sir i havent said anything about you at all lying again menas said well youll pay for that too youre going to tell me the stinking joke going through the taverns the one that says god gave me my legs back so i could run away from the slavs that isnt yours no thats not mine the shoemaker said but he had heard itwhere at pauls tavern coming out of johns mouth that was where hed worried it would land john in trouble with menas hed never imagined it would land him in trouble with the noble instead not only a liar but a bad liar menas thrust out his big square chin if its not your joke wretch whose is it his thickfingered hands opened and closed opened and closed as if around the neck of anyone rash enough to tell jokes on him im sorry sir but i dont know that george lied without hesitation if he threw john to this wolfno this bear a better description for menashow was he supposed to live with himself afterwards of course you dontits yours who else would have wanted to tarnish gods miracle by calling me a coward ive never wanted to tarnish any of gods miracles george replied with absolute conviction menas would hear none of it he shook his fist at the shoemaker not a true word comes out of your mouth tell me you didnt say to my face that gods curing me didnt mean anything in particular and that he cared more about the city than about any of the people in it thats not what i said sir george told him aware as he spoke that he had no hope of being believed the noble had closed his mind locked the door arid thrown away the key you mocked me then and youve made vicious jokes about me ever since menas declared heedless not only of georges denials but also of having mentioned only one joke bare moments before george stood up if he could not convince menas he had done him no harm maybe he could convince him he might do harm if provoked sir i tell you again i did not do those things but i also tell you youre starting to make me sorry i didnt youre not sorry menas said you dont know what sorry is but i tell you this shoemakeryoure going to find out he turned on his heel and stamped up the street waves of indignation rising from his back as heat rose from a blacksmiths forge theodore and sophia both stared at george hes an important fellow father sophia said worriedly i wish he werent angry at you i wish he werent too george answered steadily thats not your joke irene said i know who tells jokes like that to his relief she did not upbraid him for protecting john do you know who told that joke theodore asked george nodded his son burst out then why didnt you tell menas because a man who betrays his friends has no friends left after a whileand doesnt deserve any either george said and because if menas werent angry at me for this hed be angry at me for something else hes decided hes going to be angry at me and hes the kind of man who doesnt change his mind about things like that its one thing if a tanner or a butcher is angry at you sophia said all they can do is insult you in the street or something like that but if menas is angry at you he could she paused trying to think of the worst thing she could after a moment she went on he could set lawyers on you heaven forbid irene exclaimed george would have said the same thing if his wife hadnt beaten him to it he didnt have a lot of money the next rich shoemaker of whom he heard would be the first not only would he find it hard to fend off the attacks of lawyers trained in berytus or constantinople and find it all the harder because judges would surely be prejudiced in favor of the lawyers wealthy prominent client he would also be tied up in court for so long he wouldnt be able to tend to what business he had serving on the militia gave him that kind of trouble but half the menbetter than half the menin thessalonica had it now if menas decided to persecute him by prosecuting him that wouldnt be so well just have to see what happens thats all he said maybe he stopped maybe some slav will shoot him in the face with an arrow theodore said shooting him in the heart wouldnt doim sure its too hard for an arrow to hurt theodore georges voice carried a warning for a couple of reasons theodore hadnt bothered keeping his voice down if word of what hed said got to menas the noble would have another reason for hating george and the shoemaker did not feel comfortable about wishing anyone dead hed had the thought his son had spoken aloud but hed stopped before he said it words he told himself were what gave thought power theodore said sometimes i think youre too kindhearted for your own good george walked over and swatted him in the backside he leaped into the air with a yelp there george said think again theodore did his best to look indignant but couldnt help laughingespecially when his sister and mother were laughing already but irene quickly turned serious again what are we going to do she asked i know what im going to do george said im going to finish this sandal i was working on as for the rest i wont worry about it till it happensif it happens he hoped he convinced irene with that if he wished he could convince himself vi standing up on top of the wall george shivered the day was bright but cold enough to make him wish for trousers we ought to be warmer here than down below john said were closer to the sun arent we close enough to bake your wits anyhow rufus said john grinned at him unperturbed george wished john would stop making jokes he didnt think hed get either of his wishes but made them anyhow he hadnt told john of the trouble from his joke about menaswhat point it wouldnt have abashed the tavern comic and might have given him ideas for new vile jokes although john being john never seemed to have any trouble coming up with those ideas rufus pointed out toward the slavs they look like trying anything not today john said quiet as the basilica halfway through one of eusebius sermons except the slavs are too far away for you to hear them snoring oh john george murmured as he sometimes did when john went too far in the middle of his routine john took no notice john seldom took notice of anything george spoke to rufus im not sure hes right they were stirring about when we first came up onto the wall though they havent done much the past couple of hours maybe they were stirring so quick because theyve got dysentery going through their camp john mimed a man dashing for the latrine he didnt need to say anything to be funny sometimes as now he was funnier when he let his body do the talking for him rufus laughed you couldnt watch john trying to hurry and at the same time trying to clench every part of himself without laughing but the veteran said dysenterys no joke ive been in camps where it came calling sometimes more soldiers die of a flux of the bowels than from swords and spears and arrows and what have you george waited for john to crack wise about soldierings being a shitty job but his friend disdained the easy laugh if he was casting about for one more worthy of his talents he never got the chance to use it instead he spoke in a voice so flat and unemphatic it commanded immediate attention and belief you were right george the slavs are up to something they sure are rufus said both brown eye and blue going wide his voice rose to a formidable shout sound the alarm the slavs are attacking the city the first horns on the wall might have rung out before he shouted but they might not have too afterwards george never was sure he was sure a whole ungodly lot of slavs were rushing at the wall some of them carried picks others sledgehammers and still others the big shields hed noted at the edges of their encampments he was slow adding up what all that meant not least because another host of slavs these keeping their distance from thessalonica filled the air with arrows george ducked behind the battlement to snatch an arrow out of his own quiver stood up quickly to shoot it and then ducked down once more rufus wasted no more time in taking cover but rufus had seen everything once and most things half a dozen times he knew what the slavs intended and announced what he knew to everyone else theyre going to try making tortoises and undermining the wall have we got enough things to drop on them george asked were going to find out arent we rufus said not the most reassuring answer the shoemaker could imagine the veterans bowstring twanged as he shot at a slav his curses said hed missed while setting another arrow to the string he went on theyre not doing a very good job of it they should set up the tortoises before they move on the wallstheyd take fewer casualties that way his critique of the slavs performance was milder than some hed given the militiamen on the practice field george shot at a slav carrying one of the oversized ironfaced shields the fellow clutched at his leg and fell the shield bounced away before he could recover it three more arrows pierced him none of them finished him off though he managed to get the shield back and slowly crawl away from the fighting in the abstract george pitied him if he lived he would be a long painful time healing at the same time though he wished his first arrow had killed the slav instead of merely wounding him he lacked the leisure to contemplate the inconsistency of those two notions he lacked leisure for anything his life reduced itself to groping for arrows nocking them finding a target drawing the bow and letting fly that slav was an exception with most of the shafts he loosed he had no idea whether hed hit or missed a good many slavs sprawled in death or writhed in torment on the ground in front of the walls of thessalonica quite a lot of shieldmen reached the walls though and raised their shields up over their heads to protect themselves and their comrades with picks and crowbars from whatever the thessalonicans rained down on them thats not how bousas would have taught them to do it rufus said reprovingly they should know better if they learned from a proper roman i dont think this is one of those times when the pedagogue will come across their backsides with a stick if theyre sloppy john said sieges arent marked on neatness theyre wasting men rufus insisted they dont care john replied accurately enough you think the avars are going to break down and bawl because some stupid slav gets an arrow in the ribs he might have turned if he was careful his mobile features suggested an aggressively indifferent barbarian rufus seemed inclined to carry the argument further george for once found himself on johns side the avars had already shown they didnt care what happened to their slavic subjects so long as they got into thessalonica and then the slavs started pounding away at the city walls a distraction that made both john and rufus forget what theyd been talking about george felt the pounding through the soles of his feet he seemed to hear it the same way as if it had traversed his entire body before reaching his ears the noise or feeling was alarming if the slavs could get enough stones out from the bottom of the wall the masonry above the place where those stones had been would fall down too and since george was standing on top of that masonry he grabbed a large stone from a pile on the walkway picked it up and grunting with effort carried it to the edge of the wall and dropped it on the attackers below a loud and satisfying crash said it had landed on one of the upheld shields of a tortoise down there he hurried back to the pile for another stone he was just about to fling it down onto the slavs too when an arrow hit it and tumbled spinning up over his head thank you lord he said sincerely and let the stone fall had he not been holding it or had he already dropped it the arrow would have pierced him that was another of those chances of war that did not repay close contemplation here pick something theyll feel rufus said his stringy corded muscles bunched as he stooped and seized a rock george reckoned hercules would have had trouble lifting up it came though maybe fighting frenzy impelled the old man or maybe george thought with no small awe st demetrius was once more lending a subtle hand in the fighting how else could rufus carry that weight george was not the only militiaman to stare as the veteran brought the stone to the edge of the wall and cast it down not only did he hear a crash when it hit but also hoarse screams theres a tortoise with a broken shell john shouted not far down the wall a couple of romans lifted a cauldron from a hastily lighted fire wrapping rags around their hands so the hot iron handles would not bum them they tipped the boding water in the cauldron over the edge of the wall george capered in glee at the shrieks that rose immediately afterwards the romans did not get off scotfree there one of them dropped his half of the cauldron howling in pain and clutching at the shoulder from which an arrow had suddenly sprouted get down into the city and have that seen to his comrade said the militiaman made his way toward the stairs hand still clapped over the wound and bright blood running out between his fingers rufus pawed through the pile of stones casting aside with such fervor those he didnt care for everyone nearby had to step lively to keep toes from getting smashed when he finally found the one he wanted george stared in astonishment he had no idea why or for that matter how people had carried it up to the top of the wall in the first place it looked too big and heavy for any two men to lift let alone one rufus took hold of it his lips moved silently prayer curse george couldnt tell the veteran strained whatever power was in him he was pushing it as far as it would go maybe farther no up came the stone not so smoothly as the one before but up nonetheless staggering a little rufus got it to the edge of the wall set it down so he could pant for a moment like a winded dog and then with what looked to be all the strength he had in him shoved it off george heard a crash but no screams the feel of the pounding under his feet changed subtly i dont think anyone in that tortoise is left alive he said in tones of wonder you just wrecked it good rufus told him if this was a miracle it didnt leave him confused and dazed as he had been when st demetrius spoke through him instead he sounded ready to pick up another stone and heave it down onto the slavs that was exactly what he did though the one he chose this time was small enough not to leave george wondering whether hed had divine help handling it after casting another stone at the slavs and not worrying in the least whether he was without sin george traded arrows with some of the archers down on the ground when he was shootingor flinching from shafts flying far too close to his facehe thought about the impossibly large stone rufus had lifted impossibly he shrugged maybe not men in battle could do strange things hed already seen that for himself limited as his experience was if he believed half the tales hed heard there stood rufus solid and bandylegged about the least likely man or so anyone with sense would think through whom god would choose to work a miracle but god had already worked one through him no matter what any man with sense would think so maybe he had worked two you george you fallen asleep there the subject of the shoemakers musings demanded in his rough soldiers latin youve got no business doing that john hasnt been telling his jokes up here after all stick out your tongue john told him rufus did a gesture more contemptuous than obedient a physician would have been proud of johns wise thoughtful nod the words that followed though were less than hippocratic i remember george said he was missing one of his files now i see where its turned up you go on like that see where you turn up in a little while rufus retorted somebody else doesnt do it for me ill put you there john picked up a heavy stone and made as if to throw it at the veteran herecatch he said but then hurled it down on the slavs brothers the lot of us george said he shot at a slavand missed after some halfhearted blasphemy he went on how are we doing the wall doesnt feel so much as if termites are nibbling at it were his feet feeling what he wished them to feel or had the slavs efforts to undermine the wall really slowed down rufus said i think youre right lord knows i hope youre right but i tell you thisright now im not going to stick my head out and look down to the bottom of the wall to find out if youre right thats sensible george said im not either it is sensible john said apparently to no one in particular how did he ever manage to come up with it when this fighting is done rufus began in a voice thick with menace but he broke off shaking his head ahh whats the use i should have known better than to try making a soldier out of you but near as i can guess we may drive the slavs off this time but theres never going to be a time when all the fightings done i pray youre wrong george said but i think youre right its as sure as burying your money back of your house rufus said he looked around a couple of militiamen were lugging a great jar of water up the stairs to pour it into the cauldron to heat more men were carrying stones in upsidedown shields are we going to have enough things to throw down to make them give over before they bring down a stretch of wall john askedthe question on everyones mind if god is kind we will george answered so far as he could tellwith the possible exception of rufus lifting those two enormous stonesthe fight here was of men against men not of god against the powers of the slavs and avars hed meant what he said as a general wish then not as a prayer for divine intervention rufus picked up another stone braved looking out over the wall in that storm of arrows to see where it would do the most good and threw it down the crash that came back was particularly loud and satisfying that one went where it was supposed to john said youd best believe it did rufus said flexing his elderly biceps and twisting into a pose that put george in mind of the statue of an athlete from pagan times or rather of something the pagan sculptors had never made the statue of a former athlete as a grandfather it put john in mind of something else you go prancing around like that anywhere near the baths theyll drag you off to gaol for unnatural vice he said the most unnatural vice ive ever tried is putting up with you rufus said that prompted john to pull out an arrow and shoot it at the slavs rufus smiled probably because hed hoped to accomplish something on that order george threw another rock down on the slavs himself the pile of stones on the walkway was much smaller than it had been men were still bringing more up to the top of the wall but not nearly so fast as they were being used that pile and the others like it had been accumulated over days they couldnt be maintained when they were used up in hours if the defenders ran out before the slavs had had all they could stand if we cant drive them off like this will we have to sortie he asked rufus maybe so the veteran said unhappily i dont want to do it you understand but i dont want the wall crumbling under me either methodically almost mechanically the defenders kept dropping stones and boding water onto the slavs they knew they were hurting the foe the screams and shrieks from the ground said as much but war as george had discovered was not merely a business of hurting the enemy it meant hurting him more than he could endure were the romans doing that the slavs had already shown they could endure a good deal grunting george lifted and flung another stone the pile was small indeed now hardly higher than his knees once it was gone what then rushing out and fighting the slavs seemed a better choice than helplessly staying up here and waiting for the wall to fall down but neither alternative struck the shoemaker as highly desirable shall we sortie he asked as hed done before if we have to we have to rufus face twisted damn me to hell if i like the idea but damn me to hell if i like the idea of letting the cursed slavs do whatever they please either thats what i was thinking george said when the other choice is worse a bad choice can turn good the militia captain made no reply for a moment his lips moved as he worked that through youre right he said at last he cocked his head to one side you managed to put enough twist on that to make a priest happy not sure whether he was being complimented or mocked george maintained a discreet silence and then john who left no doubt when he was insulting someoneas he often waslet out a howl of pure joy theyre running away he shouted a moment later george and rufus shouted too george slapped the veteran on the back rufus not only endured the familiarity he grinned wide enough to show off the worn and snaggled teeth still in his mouth the world soon interfered with that little stretch of unexpected delight as the world has a way of doing rufus remembering he was a captain shouted lets give the bastards a goingaway present grab your bows lads along with the rest of the men on the walls george shot at the slavs till they fled out of range as the warriors from the tortoises withdrew the archers who had supported them also moved away from the wall that let the romans peer down at the ground without the risk of taking an arrow in the face we dented them george said which would do for an understatement till a bigger one appeared it was in some instances only literal truth many of the big reinforced shields the slavs had brought up against the walls of thessalonica were broken while others had their iron facings badly battered a good many dented men lay under the wall too men whose shields had proved unable to protect them from the stones and arrows the romans had showered down on them a couple of them were almost as badly smashed as poor father gregory had been after the slavic waterdemigod hurled him to the cobblestones by the cistern this too was war george wished theodore had come up on the wall beside him to see the reality of what he thought so great and glorious not all the slavs who lay below the wall were dead groans and shrieks still rose from those whose crushed limbs or bums kept them from retreating with their comrades and from a couple who dragged themselves along with their hands because they were dead from the waist down lets finish them rufus said some militiamen had already begun shooting at the helpless slavs and precisely aiming stones at those right under the wall that was a hard unpleasant business one by one the screams and their makers died till none was left into the grim silence following that last death rufus said i think most of us can come down off the wall now they arent going to be able to nerve themselves for another attack any time real soon what do we do if youre wrong john asked rufus shrugged if youre still up on the wall you fight em if youre down in the city you come running back and you fight em if theyre already down into the city before you get back here its the end but you fight em anyway and you keep fighting em till they kill you any other questions what good would other questions do me john returned youve only got one answer only when he turned to head down the stairs into thessalonica did the comics shoulders sag and his stride lose its jaunty spring mother of god im so tired he said over his shoulder to george who was a couple of steps above him if those bastards keep coming after us like this sooner or later theyre going to break in if they can keep coming at us i think youre right george answered but weve given them a fine set of lumps every time theyve tried how many men did they lose today it had to be hundreds rufus is righttheyll take a while getting over that maybe youre right john said maybe master one blue and one brown is right too but maybe not you think the avars care how many slavs the ravens peck the eyes out of its like spending other peoples money if paul tells me i can drink all i want at his place and hes paying for it why should i stay sober people arent miliaresia george said after a while the slavs will start saying no when the avars send em out against the wall to be slaughtered and a fat lot of good that will do them john jumped off the last step if they dont come out here against the walls the avars will do the job on them for us sure as god made the world in seven days george thought that over he decided the tavern comic was probably right i dont think id care to be a slav right now he observed leave the right now out of it if you please john said i cant think of any time id want to be a slav he turned off at the side street that led to the furnished room where he lived on reflection george couldnt think of any time when he would have wanted to be a slav either he waved to john who filled with himself as he often was didnt see or didnt noticein any case john didnt wave back sighing george headed on home himself several people on the street had blankets over their tunics like sad excuses for cloaks george didnt blame them now that he wasnt up on the wall fighting for his life he realized how raw the day was and wished he had a cloak himself as was the way with such things wishing did him little good along with wishing he hurried that not only made him a little warmer than he would have been otherwise it also got him home sooner george was growing resigned to gasps of relief and excited exclamations whenever he walked through the door into his shop they helped him understand why armies whenever they could fought far from home it wasnt so much to keep their own lands from being ravaged as hed always thought more likely it was so the soldiers could get away from their families and not have them fretting every minute of the day and night are you all right father sophia said now hurrying toward him youve got blood on your tunic do i george looked down at himself why so i do he pulled the hem of the tunic up a little so he could inspect his legs it isnt mine ive said that before and been wrong so i wanted to make certain this time and not look foolish what was it now irene asked in a voice so flat and dull from holding in worry that it might as well have been a scream we hear people running and people shouting but we never really know whats going on till you come home were always afraid till then too im all right george held up both hands so his wife could see as much then he stood on one leg like a stork and then on the other that made sophia and theodore laugh and even irenes smile was a little warmer than dutiful he went on what was it now the slavs tried knocking down the foundations of the wall it didnt work we killed a lot of them and made the rest run away put that way it sounded easy the result seeming foreordained the few sentences said nothing of the way the wall had shuddered under georges feet when the slavs attacked it with picks and pry bars nothing of the fear that it would do more than shudder and would come tumbling down like the walls of jericho in the bible story george felt not the least bit guilty at keeping such knowledge from his family he wished he had no part of it himself theodore said ill bet you butchered them we hurt them george agreed tonelessly i was thinking at the time that you should have been there theodore looked proud till he went on seeing what a man looks like after a rock this big he gestured with his hands lands on his head would keep you from going on and on about what you dont begin to understand sophia made a small disgusted sound irene looked down at the leather strap she was sewing to a sandal and didnt say anything theodore did think about what his father said george gave him credit for that but it didnt sink in george could see as much maybe he should have talked about the men whod had rocks fall on them but didnt die right away the men with crushed limbs or broken backs maybe he should have talked about the men whod screamed and screamed after a cauldronful of boiling water came down on them maybe he should have he shook his head none of it would do any good not till theodore saw it for himself and more important still understood in his belly that it could have been he as easily as any luckless barbarian im not afraid theodore said which so decisively proved hed paid george no attention that the shoemaker instead of uselessly arguing with him walked over to his bench to get to some of the work the siege had kept him from doing hed just picked up his awl and noted how smoothly the wooden handle fit against his palm and fingers when irene said will you come out back with me please dear i want to know whether you think the fennel is ready for picking george muttered under his breath irene knew far more about the herbs she grew back there than he did he couldnt remember the last time shed asked his opinion about them the last time hed offered it unasked shed made a point of ignoring him and he had more work to do in less time than hed ever known before he started to say as much before he did though he looked over at his wife without a word he set the awl down on the bench and walked out with her to have a look at the fennel seems fine to me he said pointing at the wispy light green plants that stood almost as tall as he did irene gave him the stare she reserved for times when she caught him being deliberately obtuse of course its fine she said with an edge to her voice but i cant very well talk about sophia right there in front of her can i why not george asked you talk about me when im right there all the time irenes left foot began tapping the muddy ground of the herb garden a sure danger sign how much do you know about constantine the son of leo the potter she asked say as much as i know about any of the young men who live on this street george answered he doesnt wear baggy tunics with puffy sleeves and cut his hair short the way the young toughs do so i suppose hes not so bad as some why do you want to his voice traded off looking back he realized it should have traded off a couple of sentences sooner irenes foot was tapping harder which showed exactly how stupid hed been yes thats right she said as if hed asked the right question sophia has noticed him shes done rather more than notice him this morning she told me she thought he was the sweetest thing god had made since the fruit in the garden of eden oh george suppressed a strong urge to retch oh dear hed never particularly noticed young constantine what he had noticed was a fellow huskier than most whose beard which he did not shave very well had some red patches in it that were startling when seen with the dark hair on top of his head is she serious or is it just foolishness that wasnt the word he wanted but he couldnt find a better one she thinks shes serious so she might as well be irene answered a thought convoluted enough to have made bishop eusebius proud am i going to have to talk to leo george asked and then as much to himself as to his wife do i want to talk to leo as he had asked it he answered his own question constantines not the worst match i can think of no hes not irene agreed but hes not the best either we have to think about this and we have to see whether sophia changes her mind again day after tomorrow too i remember there were boys who now she was the one who broke off george waggled a finger at her ha im usually the one who makes mistakes like that with his wife still flustered he went on some of the boys who might have caught her eye well i think id be praying the slavs and avars would sack the city before the wedding god forbid irenes voice was serious but her eyes danced as you said it could be worse i was wondering if theodore had his eye on anyone in particular but he hasnt shown any signs of that it wont be long i expect no but for now he hasnt george said nothing more at theodores age hed had his eye on every pretty girl who walked past the open door but hed left it to his parents to find him one with whom to make a life his gaze flicked back to irene would he have chosen her on his own he didnt know but his mother and father had done well by him i can guess what youre thinking irene said and laughed a little that laugh meant she wasnt guessing she knew hed eyed all the girls when he was younger she continued with sophia its not anything we have to worry about right away i dont think but if shes still serious come summer all right george said summer seemed farther away than jerusalem farther away than gaul farther away than the island that was supposed to be beyond gaul the island whose name for the moment hed entirely forgotten he clicked his tongue between his teeth that would bother him till he remembered no matter how useless knowing the name of an immensely distant island now surely infested with barbarians was he grunted thessalonica was infested with barbarians to think of them he didnt need to worry about britain he said happily what are you talking about irene asked before he had to come up with an answer sophia called how much can the two of you say about fennel anyway theyre not talking about fennel theodore said in a voice george didnt think he was supposed to overhear theyre talking about one of usunless theyre talking about both of us i know that sophia replied indignantly as if her brother had mistaken her for a halfwit but i dont want to come right out and say it do i george suffered a coughing fit at the same time as irene made wheezing noises the way some people did when flowers bloomed in springtime had their children been a little farther awayon the island of britain for instance george thoughtboth of them would have howled laughter as they went back inside irene found a way to make them both serious again she asked now that the slavs and avars have found they cant knock the wall down with crowbars and such what do you think theyll try next i dont know if theyve found they cant knock the wall down this way george answered i just think the slavs took as much punishment as they could stand right then which may not be the same thing he considered they seem to be taking turns soldiers one try powers the next we still dont know all the different powers they have but my bet is well find out find out what theodore asked when they came into the workroom find out whos been trying to listen to every word we say his father answered with a growl that concealed memories of trying to find out what his own parents had been up to when he was theodores age and younger is the fennel all right sophia asked mildly enough to keep george from thinking she was practicing one of johns routines the fennel is fine george said the two of you on the other hand are nosy irene which of them do you suppose is nosier than the other both irene said which confused george but confused theodore and sophia even more thereby accomplishing its purpose claudia came in with the sandal george had repaired not long before now it had two broken straps not just one despite that detail claudia said you didnt fix this very well george i am sorry george replied examining the damage if you use a shoe to hit people you know it wont wear so well as it would if you only walked in it thats not very good claudias voice was indignant not only did irony roll off her like dye from a wellgreased area of leather on a boot she also remained as convinced nothing was ever her fault as if she were an aristocrat rather than an artisans wife shoes should be strong enough to stand up to whatever you do to them ill try to get this back to you in a couple of days george said resignedly he knew he wasnt going to make her see the world or her place in it any differently what dactylius saw in herexcept someone bigger and stronger and fiercer than hewas beyond the shoemaker claudias pale eyes flashed fire a couple of days she said not being married to her george could take a firmer line than her husband yes a couple of days im afraid he answered i have a lot of work here that im trying to do and i dont have a lot of time to do it you can blame that on the slavs and avars if you like along with everything else i do oh i do claudia said theyve done nothing but make my life miserable ever since they got here as far as im concerned they ought to go away and never come back as far as im concerned they ought to go away and never come back too george said though he concerned himself with the slavs and avars more for what they were liable to do to thessalonica as a whole than for how they were inconveniencing him in particular claudia let out a melodramatic sigh she probably meant to be martyred instead all right george a couple of days since youre the one who says so she swept out dissatisfied but doing her best to bear up under the disappointment an actor in a mime troupe couldnt have conveyed the emotion more clearly once she was gone and george was sure she wouldnt make any sudden reappearances he said i admire claudiai really do that drew from the rest of his family the disbelieving exclamations hed expected he held up a hand no wait hear me out how many other people in this whole city can you think of who make me glad to go up on the wall and fight the slavs and avars no one answered him by which he concluded hed won his point george and theodore jostled for places near the altar in st demetrius basilica up in the womens gallery irene and sophia were probably doing the same thing they sometimes came home from church with stories of pushing and shoving once or twice theyd come home with bruises on their arms theodore twisted past a plump man turning back to his father he said ill bet dactylius wife watches the divine liturgy from wherever she pleases claudia ill bet youre right son george answered then he stopped and really listened to what theodore had said that meant he all but had to kick the plump man out of the way to keep up with his son but he didnt care he didnt even snarl back when the plump man used several expressions not often heard in church theodore had thought along with him as effortlessly and accurately as irene sometimes did the boyno the young man nowhad had a lifetime of practice doing just that of course but his lifetime hadnt been very long not to georges way of thinking the shoemaker suddenly felt more like a grandfather than a father deacons and acolytes and altar boys scurried up and down the aisle keeping it clear so bishop eusebius could advance to the altar a rising hum of conversation said he was on his way george craned his neck but taller people around him kept him from seeing the bishop rumor declared eusebius would say something important this morning which was why george and his family had come to st demetrius rumor frustratingly was mute about what the bishop would say celebrating the divine liturgy in a church as splendid as any outside constantinople was of itself enough to leave george convinced the longer walk than usual had been worth making but when bishop eusebius finally got around to his sermon more jostling and pushing and shoving started up with everyone trying to get closer to hear him better my children he began the vicious barbarians outside our gates still seek to inter thessalonica in a sarcophagus of their design george smiled to himself eusebius remained fond of trotting out tombs and coffins thanks to the power of god and of our own holy saint we have thus far prevented them from achieving their wicked ends the bishop went on but our hold on safety is not secure far from it the slavs and avars being ignorant of the power of the one true god have at their beck and call a host of vile powers whom they have summoned again and again to try to overwhelm us they have come too close to success a murmur of agreement ran through the basilica much of it george thought from militiamen he added his small part to the murmur whispering to theodore they certainly have his son nodded but waved for him to be quiet so they could hear what eusebius was saying george had to his annoyance missed a few words so they think we can use our own power the power of truth and righteousness only for defense the bishop declared but my fellow christians i tell you they are mistaken god not only heals his flock he curses the wolves who seek to pray upon it let us beseech him to curse the slavs and avars who so plainly need to become acquainted with his wrath back in pauls tavern george had casually wished a pestilence on the slavs he was sure half the people in thessalonica likely more had expressed similar wishes that was not the sort of thing bishop eusebius was talking about a shiver ran through george when a bishop formally asked god to bring a curse down on an evildoers head the lord was likely to deliver eusebius said god has granted such prayers before echoing georges thought the bishop went on when pharaoh of egypt would not let the children of israel depart his lands in peace god visited upon him the ten plagues did pharaoh of egypt oppress the children of israel more harshly than the khagan of the avars oppresses the people of thessalonica i think not my children was eusebius right george wondered the slavs and avars had ravaged the countryside and killed and wounded a number of militiamen on the walls but they hadnt enslaved the thessalonicans or forced them to make bricks without straw and theyd been here for weeks they hadnt held the thessalonicans in bondage for generations but if the avars ever broke into thessalonica what they would do was liable to be worse than anything pharaoh had visited upon the israelites george gave eusebius the benefit of the rhetorical doubt the bishop went on when the wicked assyrians who knew god not besieged jerusalem the lord sent a plague into their camp so that they had to give over the siege what he did for jerusalem he shall surely be willing to do as well for this famous city of thessalonica which as he has shown he enfolds under his protecting arm thessalonica did indeed have a name for being a godguarded city and it was more than a name or rufus would not have been inspired to warn of the slavs onset that thought passed through georges mind in a moment the one that followed and stayed longer was curiosity about how benjamin the jew would have felt listening to eusebius going on about miracles worked on behalf of his people not on behalf of christians if that inconsistency bothered eusebius he gave no sign of it continuing what god has done in days gone by he can surely do again for as we have seen with our own eyes my children the age of miracles is not yet past and so let us with full hearts and reverent spirits offer up a prayer to god our lord that he have mercy upon us now as he did upon the israelites in days gone by and smite the slavs and avars with plagues and pestilences such that they are compelled to withdraw from the environs of this godprotected city and such that they suffer from the aforesaid sickness as they deserve for the suffering they have inflicted upon us let us pray that they are requited as justice demands that was a prayer to conjure with literally and figuratively george shivered again he could think of no one who could hope to come through safe based only on justice with no mercy thrown onto the scales to temper the verdict how much more would that be true of the slavs and avars than of people at least acquainted with the christian faith someone stepped on his foot he looked around there stood menas who by the smug expression on his fleshy face hadnt done it by accident george sent up a prayer of his own for some undoubted divine justice to come to the nobleman who had taken a dislike to him bishop eusebius looked up through the beams of the roof to the heavens beyond we pray o lord our god that thou savest thy city of thessalonica and thy christian people in it not a word about the jews in it george noted despite eusebius citations of the lords aid to the israelites in days gone by by smiting the slavs and avars with loathsome plagues and diseases showing forth thy power in that way and making the barbarians whom thou hast accursed withdraw in terror and disorder amen amen the worshipers in the basilica said solemnly menas and george for once agreeing george hadnt been willing to pray for menas getting an arrow in the face when theodore suggested it he wondered if he really ought to be praying for dysentery or the bubonic plague to visit the slavs and avars in their camps how was one different from the other the only answer he could come up with was that when he prayed for something dreadful to happen to menas he would be praying for his own personal advantage when he prayed for the slavs and avars to take ill he was praying for the wellbeing of all the christians and even the unmentioned jews in thessalonica he hoped that was enough of a difference a moment later he remembered that menas was himself not only a christian but one whom god had directly aided through a miracle a prayer for some misfortune to land on him was much less likely to be acceptable than one for the discomfiture of the pagans beyond the wall that made george feel better but only for a little while out beyond the wall the gods of the slavic wizards and avar priests would find their prayers the more acceptable how did that leave george on the moral high ground he wasnt sure it did the powers and gods the slavs and avars reverenced were both true for them and powerful as he had seen his chief hope was that god would prove more powerful that took things out of the realm of morals altogether and into the realm of brute force brute force mattered anyone who had ever walloped a child for doing wrong knew as much but george cast a speculative eye menas way maybe he should have asked god to let the nasty noble stop an arrow with his face god only knew what menas had asked him to do to george the slavs george reminded himself the avars once they abandoned the siege life would return to normal then he could worry about menas and his ilk till then the survival of the city had to rank ahead of his own another reason to pray for the plague to visit the barbarians he thought and did so the divine liturgy is over go in peace eusebius said as george and theodore filed out of the church the shoemaker reflected that that farewell offered a strange contrast to the catastrophe the bishop and the congregation had called down on the heads of the warriors besieging thessalonica as soon as they were outside menas said do you know what i was praying for shoemaker something unpleasant for me i dont doubt george answered and the noble smiled unpleasantly to show he was right shrugging george said if i were you sir id spend more time praying camels fit through the eye of needles if they dont youll have trouble fitting through the doors to the kingdom of heaven now if youll excuse me i have to meet my wife and daughter he felt menas eyes boring into his back as he walked away theodore set a hand on his arm thats telling him father thats telling the bigbellied toad he cant mess around with you oh i can tell him that george answered i can tell him any number of things whether theyre true or not he shook his head thats different in a strange way george enjoyed mounting to the stretch of wall near the litaean gate that had become almost as familiar to him as his workshop up here at least he knew who his enemies were and from which direction they were likely to strike rufus and john stood on the wall now god bless you george john said youre as reliable as my bladder after three mugs of wine thank you so very much the shoemaker made as if to examine johns neck then whistled as if astonished i see rufus still hasnt tried strangling you i wonder why not im an old man rufus got into the spirit of raillery in a hurry this sprout here hes too quick for me to catch him i love you both john planted a big wet kiss on georges cheek which led both of them to make disgusted noises youre as bristly as a boars back john exclaimed but like i said youre here which means i dont have to be see you soon i expect he strode toward the head of the stairs whistling one of lucius and marias better tunesnot that that was saying much whos up with you george rufus asked sabbatius the shoemaker answered rufus made a face im liable to be up here a while then by st demetrius im liable to be up here his whole time on the wall if hes gone and got outside a whole great lot of wine the way he sometimes does i can only think of once when he didnt come up at all george said and if you didnt put the fear of god into him then hell never have it if he were in the regular army i wouldnt have just screamed at him the veteran answered hed have got himself a beating or else someone would have taken a sword to his thick neck you cant do that kind of thing i should have given him worse than he got as things are with us under siege here the militia are the regular army i must be getting soft george found that unlikely he reckoned it unwise to say how unlikely he found it in lieu of saying any such thing he pointed out from the wall and asked any sign of the slavs coming down with the plague rufus shook his head not so ive noticed anyhow that kind of curse if god grants it usually comes later than you wish it would motion at the top of the stairs made his eyes flick in that direction speaking of curses coming later than you wish they would actually sabbatius wasnt late or wasnt very late anyhow george had been early hah sabbatius said he smelled like wine past its best days but he usually smelled like that a good day to you george told him there were people with whom he would sooner have spent his time up on the wallthe faces of almost all the members of his militia company flashed before his eyesbut telling sabbatius what he thought of him wouldnt solve anything it wouldnt even mean they could avoid stints together it would just make them snarl at each other george saw no point to that rufus didnt leave right away george sometimes wondered if the militia captain had set up housekeeping on top of the wall aside from that rufus also had a habit of staying around longer than usual when sabbatius was coming up for his turn no doubt to make sure sabbatius could get through that turn without falling asleep or starting to see things that werent there except for squinting against sunlight that didnt need to be squinted against sabbatius seemed in good enough shape this morning he walked out to the edge of the wall to see what the slavs and avars were up to which was more than he often did when he started to laugh george wondered if he was seeing snakes and aurochs instead but he pointed to show the shoemaker and rufus what he was seeing look he exclaimed theyve got the galloping trots sure enough a couple of slavs were squatting just beyond archery range from the wall a couple of more were running for the trees one of them realizing he wasnt going to make it also suddenly assumed an undignified posture more and more of the besiegers seemed afflicted isnt that nice rufus said happily one of their cooks must have tossed something bad into the stewpot last night and now theyre paying for it ive been in armies where things like that happened look at them sabbatius said again in high glee the whole bunch of emll be sick by this afternoon looks like george stared out at the slavs do they just have bad stomachs he asked or is that the plague bishop eusebius asked for what rufus snorted and started to laugh you think gods answering eusebius prayer through the slavs arseholes because he couldnt go on but doubled over grabbing his knees as he guffawed do miracles have to be fancy george said you know dysentery have you ever seen a whole army come down with the runs as fast as this a whole army down with the runs plenty of times rufus answered it would happen to the goths and the franks all the time they were too stupid to keep from pissing and shitting in rivers upstream from their camp and ill bet the slavs and avars are too but as fast as this he rubbed his chin mm maybe not they were fine an hour ago sure as sure they were they arent fine now sabbatius said look at em go george wondered if hed intended the double meaning or for that matter even noticed it sabbatius went on shame its so far into fall most of the flies are gone otherwise theyd be biting em on their bare bums just like they deserve his pronouns were tangled but his meaning seemed clear if we attack now could they fight back george asked rufus probably the veteran answered you dont die from the runs most of the timeyou just wish you did if somebodys really trying to kill you youll yank up your trousers fast enough and thats the truth i remember back in italy there was this lombard and he what the incontinent lombard did or did not do george never found out sabbatius pointed out over the wall again saying look heres that ugly avar bugger with the funny clothes again and hes got some slavs with him whore cursed near as ugly and funnylooking as he is sure enough the avar wizard or priest or whatever he was and the slavic sorcerers who had defeated bishop eusebius charm on the grappling hooks had their heads together now the way they were seriously discussing things now and then pointing toward the stricken slavs left george sure of what they were talking about their manner almost made him laugh in different vestments they might have been eusebius and some priests hashing over a fine theological point rufus said you dont see any of the likes of them running for the slit trenches mind you george kicked himself for not having noticed that what it meant wasnt hard to figure out they have some way of turning aside the curse then id say youre likely right rufus answered nodding wish you werent but i think you are next question we get to have answered is whether they can protect the odds and sods in their army not just themselves how can they do that sabbatius said indignantly this isnt eusebius cursing themits god cursing them you cant keep god from doing what hes going to do to you you can if youve got gods of your ownor maybe you can anyhow george said some of those gods are pretty strong too not like the pagan ones were used to those gods theyve been fighting god for hundreds of years and theyre worn out and beaten the gods of the slavs and avars are running up against god for the first time now they have all their strength and power still and that means they can put up a good fight same as the avars and slavs do against roman armies he might as well have been talking to one of the paving stones of the walkway you cant keep god from doing what hes going to do to you sabbatius repeated as if george hadnt spoken at all out beyond the wall one of the slavic wizards might have accused another of heresy the reaction was about the same as if one christian priest had accused another of heresy anyhow the offended party first struck a dramatic pose almost as if he were turned into a statue illustrating denial and then that failing punched his accuser in the nose the two of them rolled around on the ground hitting and kicking each other till their companions pulled them apart after that their deliberations went more smoothly the avar walloped one slav but the lesser wizard accepted the rebuke in the same way a junior priest might have accepted chastisement from bishop eusebius the avar priest stared in toward thessalonica from where he stood he would have been peering more or less in the direction of the basilica of st demetrius though the walls hid it from his gaze a small chill ran through george he knows where their sickness is coming from the shoemaker said it is a curse rufus grunted well he would wouldnt he if its not a natural sickness theyve got to figure we gave em a present question is what can they do about it the slavic wizards were shouting not at one another for a change but at one of their sick comrades the fellow came over to them with dragging stride the complaint with which eusebius curse had afflicted him had not slain but as rufus had said he looked unhappy about being alive as if they were physicians the slavs examined him from head to foot staring intently at him and running their hands over his body one of them had him bend over so he could look at the bodily part that was the most immediate source of his difficulty thorough george remarked sabbatius held his nose and cackled like a hen one of the slavsnot the thorough onemade the sick warrior straighten up then he slapped him first on the right cheek then on the left then on the right and then on the left again he and his colleagues made passes over the sick slavs head and in front of his belly then they had the fellow open his mouth did you see that rufus said george wasnt sure what hed seen but answered anyhow the little gray cloud that came out of his mouth it didnt look like the steam you breathe out on a cold day did it he scratched his chin i wonder what it was i wonder what it meant i know sabbatius exclaimed i know he bounced up and down in his excitement like a usually slow schoolboy who saw something his smarter classmates had missed theyre getting rid of the evil eye my granny used to use a ritual like that shes from illyria where the slavs have been trouble for years maybe they got it there i dont know the evil eye rufus said this isnt the evil eye its a curse of god i was in the basilica when bishop eusebius asked us to pray for it you cant get rid of the curse of god the way you get rid of the evil eye you cant huh sabbatius pointed tell that to him and sure enough the slav on whom the wizards had tested their technique seemed much livelier than he had been the moment before he hugged his belly george hoped that was torment but it turned out to be delight it isnt right rufus insisted as if his eyes were lying maybe it is george said slowly whats the evil eye but a kind of curse if you can lift one kind of curse with that ritual why cant you lift another one if youre strong enough and weve already seen how the slavs and avars worry more about their gods than they do about ours we have priests protecting our people against their curses their wizards are protecting them against us that was just what the slavic wizards were doing as soon as theyd cured their first patient they began shouting again two slavs came over to them this time the avar priest danced in front of them the slavic wizards performed the same rite as before although they slapped the face of only one both men however rocked back on their heels as if slapped a small cloud of smoke came from the mouth of each and both warriors walked away far happier than they had approached sabbatius rufus said with sudden decision go run to the church of st demetrius and bring the bishop here me sabbatius eyes widened he wont listen to me tell him what the slavs and avars are doing out there rufus answered hell listen i promise you his voice roughened now get moving curse you ill hold your place heredont worry about that sabbatius left by his expression he would sooner have stayed and stood around than moved quickly you argued with rufus at your peril though george said i hope he doesnt stop into a wineshop as soon as hes out of sight if he does ill kill him rufus spoke as matteroffactly as if he were talking about slicing bread that made him both more believable and more frightening than if hed ranted and raved out beyond the wall the slavic wizards summoned four of their fellow tribesmen the avar priest briefly danced in front of them capering george thought like a fool then the slavs singled out one warrior to be slapped all four of them might as well have been though by the way they staggered all four of them opened their mouths four little clouds of vapor escaped four slavic soldiers suddenly seemed free of their diarrhea one of them ran and got his bow and started shooting arrows at the romans atop the walls of thessalonica the romans shot back when half a dozen arrows fell close by him the slav lost the nerve or anger that had sustained him he turned and ran away the romans kept shooting one shaft caught him in the left nether cheek he let out a howl george could hear from the wall lets see your cursed wizards fix that pain in the arse rufus shouted out to him george laughed out loud but the avar priest and slavic wizards paid no attention to the wounded warrior this time eight hangdog slavs stumbled up before them again the avar performed as if he were a dancing bear one slavic sorcerer slapped one slavic soldier all eight slavs might have been slapped they all opened their mouths they all expelled vapor and apparently their illness with it they all walked away as healthy men would walk what would be next george counted on his fingers two eights makesixteen and sure enough the slavs and the avar cured sixteen soldiers next rufus lips moved he was probably performing the same mental arithmetic as george itd bethirtytwothis time wouldnt it he said and the shoemaker nodded having just reached the same answer rufus went on if they keep doubling up like that every time theyll curse their whole stinking army in a jiffy george turned his head here come sabbatius and bishop eusebius he said good rufus said now i dont have to kill sabbatius again he sounded as if he would have done it without a second thought robes swirling around him bishop eusebius came out onto the walkway sabbatius followed the bishop did not look out from the wall instead rounding on rufus he said this man you sent tells me the barbarians have the power to defeat the curse of the lord can such a thing be true he did not sound as if he believed it rufus was a man who said what he thought in his rough latin he answered no of course not your excellency i lied just to get you up here and to get you angry at me i like having important people angry at me eusebius eyes flashed george who already had an important person angry at him feared the militia captain s pungent sarcasm had achieved its announced purpose before eusebius vented the anger he plainly felt george said see for yourself your excellency turned from the personal toward the real eusebius watched as the slavic wizards cured thirtytwo warriors of the disease with which the bishops curse had tormented them when the small dark clouds of vapor had sprung from the mouths of the sick slavs and when the warriors walked away no longer sick eusebius made the sign of the cross as if to say no spiritual power but his own had any business being effective can you stop them your excellency george asked can you bring the curse back to its full strength i can try i will try eusebius drew himself up to his full heightwhich would have been more impressive had he been taller he began to pray lord god i beseech thee do not abandon the folk of thessalonica to the slavs and avars punish the barbarians smite them as they deserve for taking no thought of thee or of thy truths and he went on in that vein he seemed prepared to go on in that vein for some time he had however attracted the notice of the slavs and avars george thought they would try to disrupt his petition to the lord with a storm of arrows such as they had sent his way the last time hed come up onto the city wall and into their presence instead the slavs went on curing their fellow tribesmen while the avar priest or wizard began what was plainly a petition to his own powers and as plainly those powers were heeding him as god had heeded bishop eusebius i am hindered the bishop said indignantly i can sense i am hindered in the name of christ who cast forth demons i command this hindrance to cease the avar priest staggered he glared toward the wall evidently he was no more used to having his power thwarted than was eusebius as the bishop had done he redoubled his efforts dancing harder than he had before and shouting to his gods so loudly that george had no trouble hearing him across more than a bowshot of ground were noise the only criterion for piety he would have defeated eusebius he did not the bishops quiet prayer discomfited him and also discomfited the slavic wizards with whom hed been working rather than curing their warriors thirtytwo at a time they had to drop down to batches of eight sometimes four but they did keep curing them eusebius groaned who would have expected the pagans to be so strong he said and shook his fist out toward the avar who was keeping him from keeping the slavic wizards from curing the slavic warriors almighty god invincible god a plague is but a small thing next to what thou canst do i pray thee smite them now with thunder and lightning george hoped for a levinbolt from the clear blue sky to crisp the slavs and avar he hoped for one but did not expect it nor was his hope granted the avar priest after all was the one who controlled the thirteen thunder spirits and the rumblers going straight against the avars powers from all hed seen did not work your excellency he said sometimes its better to work with what the powers out there can do than to ignore them he explained how father luke had turned the sorcerous storm against the avar who had created it i have heard this sordid tale already eusebius replied in a voice chillier than the weather father luke is serving a penance for undue familiarity with these demonic powers he saved us all rufus exclaimed doesnt that count for more than how he did it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul eusebius answered smug as any theologian with a quotation from scripture handy he didnt do it for gain george said stubbornly he did it to save the city and save the people it was useless he knew it was useless a layman arguing theology with a theologian was like a militiaman taking on a fully armored regular soldier a gifted amateur might prevail but that wasnt the way to bet eusebius fortunately kept his temper indeed the look he gave george was pitying that made the shoemaker angry which was also useless as well have a gnat angry at a horse out beyond the wall hampered but not stopped the slavic wizards went on curing their countrymen bishop eusebius tried again to break their power to do so tried again and faded again that did anger him as if someone had changed the rules to a game without telling him first he stomped off in high dudgeon were not going to win all of them looks like rufus said no george agreed and now its their turn vii when george went into the church of st elias he found father luke alone there praying in front of the altar the priest turned and greeted him with a smile welcome george he said god is always glad to see you here i didnt come here for myself george answered i came here for you your reverence youve done more than anyone else to keep the slavs and avars out of thessalonica and what have you got for it penance i hear its not right father lukes smile did not shrink nor did it seem grudging so my superior has ordered so shall it be disobedience is not a sin i want on my conscience i have too many others men who talked about their many sins commonly had very few that was georges experience at any rate nonsense he said roughly youre the holiest man i know the priest made a deprecating gesture you do not know me so well as you think you do my friend and i tell you again what bishop eusebius did what he commanded me to do he had every right to do and to command i speak truly did i not believe it i have means of recourse george frowned within thessalonica eusebius was ecclesiastically supreme along with being de facto city prefect if father luke didnt care for anything he did the priest had no one to whom to appealno one in the city at any rate the shoemakers eyes widened you would of course i would father luke said if i believed the holy bishop eusebius had trampled on my rights as a priest i would not hesitate for an instant before writing to cyriacus in constantinople the patriarch has the authority to bring back under rein any cleric who outrages propriety he obviously meant what he said from that george concluded he also meant he didnt believe eusebius infliction of penance on him was wrong maybe that was part of holiness too if it was it was a part george didnt fully understand if it hadnt been for what you did he said you wouldnt be arguing with the bishop youd be arguing with that avar out there the one who brought the storm down on the city that is possible father luke admitted and yet he quoted the same verse from the book of matthew that bishop eusebius had used what does it profit you to die george returned when you have a weapon in your hand that might let you live he would have given up against bishop eusebius the priest though took argument as a sport not a personal affront if using that weapon to save your body damns your soul to all eternity dying might well be the better course to take father luke said if i saved myself by worshiping satan and working abominations then you might be right george said but thats not what you did thats not anything like what you did the difference is of degree not of kind father luke said i follow the son and thought i stayed within the limits of what is permissible for christian men bishop eusebius thought otherwise i willingly accept his judgment but george gave up had father luke felt resentment the shoemaker might have fanned it with resentment of his own against acceptance he had no power and he knew it your reverence so long as youre content i am the priest assured him he smiled again i do thank you for your concern you are not the first to have expressed it i told the others what i am telling you now from smile he went to outright laughter some of them were harder to dissuade than you one suggested something i could not in good conscience even hear though i do not think he meant it seriously george had a sudden vivid vision of rufus proposing that eusebius be flung off the top of the wall into a dungheap he didnt ask who he didnt ask what but he would have bet his guess was near the truth can i do anything else for you today george father luke asked no the shoemaker said he checked himself no wait yes maybe you can what do you know about constantine the son of leo the potter what do you think of him constantine father lukes eyes sparkled are you thinking of a match im trying to find out if i should be thinking of a match george said ah the priest nodded you are a prudent man except when you go butting into the affairs of the clergy georges ears heated thoughtfully father luke went on hes a big strapping lad isnt he truth to tell past that i cant think of anything remarkable about him for good or ill he seems a decent enough young man whatever that may be worth to you thats not good enough for sophia was georges first thought on the other hand he knew himself well enough to understand he wouldnt have reckoned the city prefects son good enough for his daughter not if the lad were also handsome and saintly in the bargain he let out a rueful chuckle thanks your reverence ill do some looking and some more asking of my own then no hurry with this god be praised or i dont think so anyhow all right george the priest said im sure youll do very well whatever choice you and irene make for sophia irene would be looking and asking on her own too irene very likely had already started doing just that what she thought of constantine and of leo and of leos wife whose name at the moment escaped george would carry enormous weight if george approved and she didnt the marriage would not even be broached if she approved and george didnt he didnt know what would happen then in spite of being in theory unquestioned head of the household he was glad they thought alike most of the time nodding to father luke he left the church and headed back toward his shop and there heading the other way his arms full of straw came constantine the son of leo he was indeed a strapping lad with shoulders wider than georges which was saying something his walk was something less than graceful but georges would have been too had he borne a like burden constantine nodded at george politely enough he was nothing special to look at so the shoemaker thought anyhow his daughter evidently had a different opinion and pimples splashed his cheeks and chin george nodded to him in return he looked back over his shoulder at constantine to his surprise the potters son was looking back at him too each of them tried to pretend hed done no such thing why was constantine looking over his shoulder the likeliest explanation occurring to george was that hed noticed sophia and wanted some notion of what her father was like that was unsettling so was the idea that what some youthful lout thought of him might be important when george returned to the shop he and irene went out to inspect the fennel again he caught the glance that went from sophia to theodore but did his best to seem as if he hadnt once he and irene were out among the herbs he told her of what little father luke had had to say about constantine yes that sounds about like what ive heard she answered with a brisk nod does it george said and where have you heard all this why from zoe the weavers wife and from julia you know the widow who sells fish because her husband sold fishand even from claudia though she hasnt the slightest idea why i was interested and from plainly irene was ready to go on for some time george however was not ready to let her he interrupted with a cough if youve heard all this dear he said bearing down a little on the endearment why havent i heard any of it from you i mean oh you would have she said blithely in due time you would have once i knew enough to make up my mind once you knew enough to make up my mind george returned irene stuck out her tongue at him he did not take that for a ringing denial well i gather hes not so good but hes certainly not so bad either what does that leave us to make up our own minds i suppose we would have anyway his wife said the best thing we can do now is wait she cant even think of marrying till after the siege is over and she doesnt have to think of it even then shes a long way from being an old maid fifteen is nothing to worry about she may decide there are other fish in the sea before we need to do anything about constantine so she may george said so there are some of them have shells and claws some of them have lots of arms all covered with suckers my dear any boy constantine s age seems to have lots of arms covered with suckers irene cocked her head to one side or isnt that what you meant by now believe me its hard to tell george said they both laughed and went back into the workshop laughing still sophia and theodore eyed them suspiciously sure they were up to something since they were they tried all the harder to pretend they werent do you know george said to dactylius as they paced along the wall bows in hand quivers on their backs i used to come up here when the weather was fine just for a promenade take a little walk you know and get out of the city stink for a while if the wind was blowing in the right direction im not going to do that anymore ive seen altogether too much of this awl if you werent a shoemaker that would make even less sense than it really does dactylius answered as things are it leaves my ears ringing george took two or three steps before realizing his friend had topped him a measure of how badly hed been topped he sent dactylius a reproachful look john and i are the ones who make jokes like that contagious as the dactylius had probably been about to say plague but remembered george had lost family from it the grippe he finished cant trust anybody anymore george said mockserious dactylius smiled in something like triumph the little jeweler pointed out toward the tent where the avar priest or wizard made his home and to the smaller ones nearby that belonged to the slavic wizards i wish they hadnt chosen to camp near the litaean gate he said if they were somewhere else we wouldnt be able to watch them getting ready to work all their magic oh i dont know george said for better or worse i want to know whats going on as soon as i can it wouldnt stop happening if we didnt find out about it till it came down on us like a building falling over i suppose not dactylius said but if i didnt see them at their sorceries i wouldnt worry about them so much of course you would george said having known his friend for many years youd just be shying at shadows not at anything real dactylius sighed he wasnt ignorant of his own faults like most mortals he had trouble doing anything about them youre probably right he said besides george sent dactylius a sidelong look sometimes you cause the trouble you complain about afterwards if you hadnt bounced an arrow off that avars corselet that priest of theirs wouldnt have tried to drown the city with a thunderstorm in the end though it showed the power of god dactylius said and george supposed that was true but it had also shown the strength of the powers upon which the avar had called dactylius continued in musing tones i wonder what theyll try next no way to tell george didnt want the jeweler working himself up into a swivet over the incalculable but then being who he was the shoemaker tried to figure out what hed just said could not be figured out the storm had spirits of the air in it and maybe spirits of water too that waterdemigod was certainly one of those and when the avar tried to take the bishops blessing off the grappling hooks the earth shook even if it didnt shake very hard earth and air dactylius said musing still water and itll be something to do with fire id bet i think youre right george answered i hope youre wrong he knew he was the one who would start worrying start shying at shadows now fire was a constant dread in every city thessalonica no less than others once it started spreading you could do so little to put it out what can we do dactylius whispered echoing his thoughts i dont know george pointed toward the avar priests tent keeping an eye on what hes up to strikes me as a good idea well of course it does dactylius exclaimed and then had the good grace to turn red you have me this time dont you george a little while ago i said i wished that tent was somewhere else thats true george bowed to dactylius as he might have done before the city prefect his friend looked puzzled he explained you also just admitted you were wrong that doesnt happen every day or every month either oh dactylius looked abashed he started to say something more chewed on it and shut his mouth tight instead george thought he could guess what his friend hadnt said that living with claudia hed had practice confessing he was wrong whether he was or not george would not have chosen to live with claudia but then dactylius hadnt exactly chosen to live with her either his parents had done it for himor rather to him one of the slavic wizards came out of his tent and looked toward thessalonica his shoulders moved up and down not a shrug george thought more likely a sigh seen by himself the slav like the couple of his compatriots whom george had encountered in the woods didnt seem threatening when you put him together with all his compatriots though dactylius said he looks like hes sick of the whole business he does doesnt he george said well im sick of the whole business too but im sticking with it i suppose he will too worse luck for us he described his conceit of a moment before for his friend then added you take me by myself and im not what youd call dangerous either but think of me as one part of the roman empire and i look different dactylius studied him carefully no you dont youre not making this easy george said clucking now if you think of the whole massed weight of the empire as he spoke he waited for dactylius who seemed in a whimsical mood this morning to crack a joke about the weight of the empires making the wall fall down but since he didnt complete his sentence dactylius never got the chance instead george pointed out toward the wizard hello hes got company the other slavic wizards were coming out of their tents too and studying thessalonica with the same intent look the first one had given the city and here came the avar priest or wizard in his costume of furs and leather and fringes as always george shivered when he saw him the avar carried a lot of spiritual force had he been born a christian and a roman rather than a barbarous pagan he might well have become a bishop pointing again this time toward the avar george said can you imagine him in eusebius vestments dactylius gaped then made a noise half giggle half squeak easily he said and eusebius born a barbarian might have been out there in furs and leather and fringes trying to rouse his powers to break into thessalonica and overcome the god who held them at bay he wondered what he himself would have been had his life begun among the slavs or avars rather than the romans probably not a shoemaker from what hed seen the enemy had no one who made shoes for everyone else each man being his own shoemaker and cobbler george shrugged he could have found something else to do what are they doing dactylius asked a question of more immediate import i dont know george said if i had to guess though id say its nothing were going to like very much the slavs and the avars had huddled together like small boys before a mime show theyd thought up that george recognized they wanted everything right when they broke apart the avar priest shouted something that was as usual unintelligible from the wall also as usual it got prompt results several slavs with the harassed look of slaves began building a great fire from so much wood and brush that george whod often been chilly because thessalonica lacked fuel grew warm with angry jealousy one of the slaves thrust a torch into the brush the fire caught swiftly flames leaped higher than a man the slavic wizards drew close to the blaze whether for warmth or for the sake of ritual george could not tell staring out at the fire dactylius sighed longingly another slav led a billy goat up close to the fire tethering the beast to a stake driven into the ground the avar priest walked all around the goat raising his hands and chanting in a scale that had little to do with any sort of music george had heard before when the avar got round behind the goat he drew a knife from his belt firelight flashed off the edge of the blade with one swift motion he reached down and castrated the goat blood spurted the animal gave a bleat of startled agony a moment later the slavic wizards took up the strange chant the avar had been using he after holding the goats testicles aloft as if in triumph flung them into the heart of the fire it flared up for a moment in a blaze more nearly white than honest redgold the avar priest and his slavic acolytesfor so they seemed to george to bebegan a new and different chant one the shoemaker thought might be a name odkan galakan eke odkan galakan eke they called the name or phrase over and over again till it echoed in georges mind dactylius crossed himself the goat he said look at the goat watching the avar and the slavs george had almost forgotten the poor unfortunate animal whose role in the ceremony he had assumed to be over now he found he was mistaken holy virgin mother of god he whispered and also made the sign of the cross it had no effect the woman now riding on the goat she might have been odkan galakan eke george thought of her thus rightly or wrongly he did not know though plainly supernatural was as plainly not the virgin mother of god half again the size of a man she and her clothing seemed made all from fire her tunic might at first glance have been woven of crimson silk but was in fact flames her face was the color of melted butter but glowed like the fire that would have melted it her eyes george looked away from her eyes something more than mere fire blazed there the mother substance from which all fire sprang men were not meant to see such directly what are they going to do dactylius said staring at the beautiful and terrible being who rode the goat without consuming it i dont know george answered with a small shudder talking about the slavs and avars using fire against thessalonica was one thing having them actually go and do it was something else something daunting i wish father luke were up here with us i was thinking of bishop eusebius but youre right dactylius said when the fire goddess appeared atop the castrated goat the slavic wizards drew back from her in what looked to george like awe and wonder that made the shoemaker think theyd never seen her before and that even though theyd helped evoke her she was likelier to be an avar power than one of their own the way the avar priest shouted at them as if drawing them back to a task theyd forgotten but still needed to finish strengthened that impression they began a new chant this one low and rambling altogether different from that which had summoned odkan galakan eke on her bleeding mount the fire goddess stirred restlessly dactylius whispered i dont think she likes what theyre doing i dont think so either george whispered too not wanting to draw the notice of that beautiful flaming unearthly creature in any way he added question is will we like it any better chanting still the slavic wizards picked up swords and spears and thrust them into the fire that had summoned odkan galakan eke despite the fierce blaze the wooden spearshafts did not catch the fire goddess writhed again she doesnt like that dactylius insisted had george been a fire goddess he wouldnt have liked it either the slavic wizards seemed to be trying to wound the bonfire not to sustain it one of them took a spear out of the flames another a sword each pointed his weapon at thessalonica all the wizards and the avar who led them cried out together the outcry looked to have mollified odkan galakan eke she stretched out a long shining arm toward thessalonica as if she too were holding a weapon in it but the fire goddess did not hold a weapon she was a weapon for a moment her voice joined with those of the avar and the slavs all the hair on the back of georges neck rose in alarm the avar had power wielded power george had been forced to acknowledge as much but odkan galakan eke was power power raw and terrifying and then suddenly she was gone the bonfire suddenly was but a bonfire the billy goat which had been awed into silence while the fire goddess rode him began to bawl once more though his bawling would never restore what the avar had taken from him dactylius and george looked at each other did they fail dactylius asked did they offend her so she fled not to look at them they didnt george answered pointing out at the avar and the slavs who did indeed look pleased at what they had wrought why they were pleased george did not understand as far as he could see they hadnt changed anything as they had done with the waterdemigod and more subtly with the magic aimed against the blessed grappling hooks from further north along the wall one of the romans called to another say bonosus let me light a torch at your fire will you ours went out some way dont know how but the voice traded away george would have bet the speaker was shrugging a hapless shrug after a brief silence another militiaman presumably bonosus answered i would if i could julius but ours is out too funny aint it they were careless george said with more than a hint of smugness its a good thing weve kept our fire he glanced toward the fire at which he and dactylius had been in the habit of warming their hands he did not say going as hed intended for the fire wasnt going anymore how did that happen dactylius asked realizing the same thing at the same time dont know george answered it hasnt rained and you wouldnt think a gust of wind could his voice trailed off again dactylius eyes got big and round you dont think he began he and george both seemed to be speaking in halfsentences the shoemaker said what i think is the avars and the slavs and their fire goddess didnt fad at all i think they did just what they intended to do and i think he took a deep breath i think every fire in thessalonica may be out right now thatsthats terrible if youre right dactylius exclaimed how will people get any work done smiths potters jewelers too he stopped looking even more appalled than he had before how will people cook their food christ and the saints how will people stay warm i dont know the answers to any of those questions george said i dont know if any of those questions have answers they may all have the same answer people wont he thought the growing commotion down in the city suggested he and dactylius had been right people came running out onto the streets looking in rather than out george watched them pointing and gesticulating he couldnt hear what they were saying only a confused babel of greek and latin came to his ears dactylius tried to make the best of the avars successful magic they cant have put out the fires in the churches those are holy and he cut himself off again looking foolish turning into a persian fireworshiper are you george asked spelling out the reason for his friends confusion he wondered if any persians were in the city merchants from the distant eastern land did come here every so often when their kingdom was at peace with the roman empire as it had been these past five years but he did not recall any of them being around now too bad he thought he would have liked to take advantage of their faith false though he reckoned it and then he spied along with the townsfolk of thessalonica some tonsured priests they looked as bewildered and bereft as anyone else dactylius saw that too and groaned look at them they must be without fire too i dont know about must be but its the way to bet george agreed how will we bake our bread dactylius demanded george didnt know the answer to that either and then all at once he did or he thought he did remember when the waterdemigod showed up in all the cisterns in thessalonica at the same time he said im not likely to forget it dactylius replied with feeling no i suppose not george said but the point is the waterdemigod didnt really show up in all the cisterns there was one it kept clear of i didnt know that dactylius said which one was it the one in the jews quarter george answered as soon as our shift up here ends thats where im going to go to see if i cant get fire thats proof against the slavs magic i dont know whether i can mind you but i think its worth a try if you do youll be like dactylius face furrowed with concentration what was the name of the fellow who stole fire from the pagan gods prometheus george said a priest might not have approved of how quickly he brought out the name but knowing the old stories and believing them were two different things so he told himself at any rate john and sabbatius came up a little later to replace their fellow militiamen when george explained what he intended to do john shook his head paul wont be happy with you he said why is that george asked in honest puzzlement think for yourselfdont make me do the work with the way he cooks having all the fires in town go out is the best thing that could happen to his place the tavern comic said ill tell paul you said so george replied which made sabbatius laugh nastily john laughed too unlike his comrade he could tell george was kidding dactylius trading along behind him george descended from the wall before heading to the jews district the shoemaker stopped in st elias church if any christian man was likely to have a fire going he thought father luke the one but the church proved as dark and chilly as the rest of thessalonica shaking his head at the strength of the barbarians magic george went on down toward the jewish quarter what do we do if the jews have no fire either dactylius asked pray that father luke or bishop eusebius can figure out how to get some the shoemaker said the priest is pious enough for god to hear him and the bishop is tricky enough for anything at all if eusebius wanted fire badly enough he was liable to call on prometheus and then convince his congregants the titan had been a christian saint at first the jewish quarter seemed no different from the rest of thessalonica as many people were on the streets and they seemed as excited as their christian fellows but that was simply how the jews lived their everyday lives listening to them george realized they were exclaiming and gesticulating over the ordinary things of life not over the mornings prodigy he took that for a hopeful sign just where are you going dactylius asked if you walk into the shop of some jew youve never seen hes more likely to set his dog on you than to give you fire if he has any fire to give that is george said but im not going to walk into the shop of some jew ive never seen im going to walk into the shop of a jew ive been doing business with for years sudden understanding lit dactylius face that bronzesmith friend of yours do you mean the one who was also making arrowheads benjamins not my friend not exactly george answered the regret he felt at that surprised him he went on i dont think he has any friends who arent jews but he wont turn me away if he can help i dont think hell turn me away anyhow were about to find out he led dactylius into benjamins shop the jew looked up from the arrowhead he was sharpening by his posture he might not have moved since george last saw him i rejoice to see you george he said in polite greek and who is your friend when george had introduced dactylius benjamin nodded to the little jeweler yes i know of you your work has a good name from the couple of pieces of it i have seen it deserves such a name for this i thank you dactylius sounded more constrained than he usually did he was probably hoping and likely to be hoping in vainclaudias loud opinions about jews had never reached the bronzeworkers ears if they had benjamin made no mention of them he said how can my poor shop help the two of you george looked around he saw no lamps burning he saw no lamps that looked as if theyd recently gone out either have you fire he asked benjamins eyebrows rose have i fire he said as if ensuring hed heard correctly not on my person he ran his hands up and down his wool tunic in what was as near an approach to a joke as george had ever heard from him when his visitors neither laughed nor even smiled he grew serious himself you ask as if this is a matter of no small importance i shall see for myself without another word he ducked into the back room when he returned a moment later he was carrying a lamp whose smoky wick showed he had just lighted it thank god dactylius exclaimed and then turning to george you were right all along it is a lamp benjamin said setting it down on his worktable having a lamp is good yes but so good right now yes george told him and explained the magic the slavs and avars had worked against fire in thessalonica benjamin listened till he was through then said if you need this fire take it i give it to you god protects our fires hundreds of years ago he made a flask of pure oil enough for only one day burn for eight until more could be brought this was after we jews had driven the macedonians out of jerusalem you understand george had never heard of the event that seemed near as yesterday to the jew that didnt matter what mattered was the fire hed always taken fire for granted except when he worried about its getting out of control now he realizedhe had been forcibly made to realizehow precious it was bowing a little benjamin handed him the lamp carry it back to your own home use it as you need it when he saw georges hand going to his beltpouch the jew shook his head no need for that if i give a starving man food do i ask him for payment take it i say god bless you george answered to which the jew bowed again carrying the lamp as carefully as he had held theodore when his firstborn was laid in his arms george left the bronzeworkers shop the little flame burning at the end of the wick flickered in the breeze outside but did not go out dactylius said i think that will keep burning till you get back to your home i think youre right george said god wouldnt have given it to us only to snatch it away again dactylius nodded george listened to himself in some surprise who was he to expound on what god would or wouldnt do he pursed his lips thoughtfully whoever he was he had fire when the rest of thessalonicasave its jews did without people saw he had fire too and came running up with candles and lamps and sometimes just twigs to get some of their own from him remembering what benjamin had said he gave it to them and took nothing in return even when they tried to pay him you could be rich by the time you get back dactylius said wouldnt be worth it george answered and do you know what if i took money what do you bet the next little breeze would blow out the flame here maybe it would blow out all the flames maybe it would dactylius voice went soft with wonder from around a comer someone with a big deep voice shouted fire i need fire ill pay five solidi to anybody with fire i have fire george called ill give it to you for nothing what the owner of the voice came trotting into sight george stared with no small dismay at menas the noble looked ready to take fire by force if he could get it no other way he had a candle in his left hand and a longhandled war hammer its iron head chased with shining silver a weapon intended more for show than for use in his right seeing george menas looked as unhappy as the shoemaker you you have fire what are you doing with fire by the way he spoke he didnt think the shoemaker deserved to have fire even on an ordinary day i have it thats all george thrust the lamp at the noble take what you need i dont want your money menas gaze looked burning enough to start a fire by itself think yourself above me do you think youre too good for me eh people were staring at him and george he went on dont want your hands to touch my filthy money is that it the diatribe george noticed did not keep him from lighting the candle he clutched from the lamps flame george said i havent taken money from anyone else either likely tell menas said well you can vaunt and preen and strut now but the day will come when youll wish you hadnt off he went the hammer stuffed into his belt so he could shield from the wind with his hand the fire hed got looking after him george let out a long sigh i could save his life and hed curse me for doing it a man like that he means trouble dactylius said as a good many others had before him really i never would have noticed george said the hurt look in dactylius large brown eyes made him feel as if hed kicked a puppy sighing again he said im sorry its not your fault ive fallen foul of him as far as i can see its not my fault either but it takes only one to start a quarrel when they got to the jewelers house and shop dactylius ran inside he came back with a lamp pursued by claudias raucous questions ignoring those he started the lamp at the one george was carrying once the flame caught he carried it inside claudia for a wonder fell silent george carried benjamins lamp into his own workshop his wife and children were all wearing two or three tunics with woolen mantles or blankets draped over their shoulders instead of falling silent as claudia had done they all started talking at once george had to try several times before he could tell them the whole story that jew came in handy theodore said speaking of benjamin as he might have of an awl or a punch twice now magic from outside the city hasnt bitten on the jews when it hit everyone else george observed i wonder if god is trying to tell us something are you going to stop eating pork and have them do theodore glanced at his mother and sister and chose his words carefully what they do to a man the mere thought of being circumcised made george wince and want to cover himself with his hands not likely he said to his sons evident relief he went on but i dont think im going to sneer at them the way i sometimes have either never mind the jews now for heavens sake irene said with brisk feminine pragmatism lets get the braziers lighted and put a little heat back into this place and while were at it lets thank god for not letting the slavs and avars freeze us out of our homes no matter how he chose to do that amen george said with no hesitation at all if you were the khagan of the avars paul said in musing tones and your wizards kept promising that youd be able to get into thessalonica and then not delivering what would you do i wouldnt be very happy george admitted looking out from the wall toward the camp of the slavs and avars but then i dont even know whether the khagan is here right now theres a lot of fighting south of the danube these days thats not the point the taverner said you dont have anybody who works for you do you besides your family i meanthats different if you have somebody whos not doing the job you pay him to do you fling him out the door and you get somebody else i dont think the khagan would fling his wizards out the door george said he might see how well they do without their heads thoughbarbarian princes are supposed to do things like that he paused to think for a moment been a few roman emperors like that too havent there so they say pauls shrug expressed the limits of both his interest and his knowledge of the subject but hell do something new because what hes been trying hasnt worked such conversations went on every hour of every day up on the wall and in the taverns and throughout thessalonicabeing besieged the people of the city and most of all the militiamen defending it spent a lot of ingenuity wondering and arguing about what the besiegers would try next among so many speculations some by the nature of things had to be correct george understood thatby his own nature he understood it better than most and hed been right himself once or twice understanding didnt keep him from boasting afterwards when less than an hour after he said well theyve tried magic and that hasnt worked and theyve tried rams and those havent worked and theyve tried tortoises and those havent worked either so theyll likely get around to using the catapults they made when they started the siege the slavs and avars did exactly as hed foretold someone out there beyond the wall blew a raucous horn the noise which bore no closer resemblance to music than a vulture to a peacock spurred the barbarian soldiers into action avars rode around on horseback screaming at the much more numerous slavs some of the slavs picked up their bows and started shooting at the militiamen on the wall others picked up chunks of stone and loaded them into the catapults which kicking like mules flung them not only at the militiamen but also at the walls themselves one of those stones lucidly or cleverly aimed hit a man less than fifty feet from george red sprayed out of the fellow he dropped to the walkway dead without a word without a sound without a twitch having seen how hard human beings were to kill let alone to kill cleanly george viewed that with no small astonishment more stones of course slammed into the wall than into the people on top of it to georges frightened eyes a lot of them looked big as islands every time one struck the wall shivered under his feet as if in pain the shiverings ran together into what felt like an earthquake that would not stop what can we do paul shouted in between the smashing of stone missiles on stone fortifications i dont know george answered helplessly those catapults are out past arrow range thessalonicas walls bore catapults of their own after a bit of hesitation the militiamen began shooting back at the ones the slavs and avars had built they did not fling rocks at the foe but jars of pitch and naphtha the men lighted as they launched them when one of those jars hit the ground it smashed and spilled fire over ten or fifteen feet but few of the enemys catapults burned they were covered in hides to keep flame from sticking to them not even the inflammable mix the romans hurled was enough to make the hides catch fire only when the hellbrew splashed onto a wooden castingarm would the engine of which it formed a part begin to blaze a big stone stuck about ten feet below where george was standing the wall shuddered he shuddered too how many impacts like that would it take till the wall no longer shuddered but collapsed heaped here and there along the wall along with stones for hurling down on the foe not enough stones not after the assault with the tortoises and cauldrons for heating water lay mats and horse blankets roughly basted together padding to protect the gray stone fortifications from the worst the stones might do george and paul along with many other militiamen on the works began lowering the mats and blankets draping them over the outside of the wall and weighting them in place with some of the stones they would otherwise have dropped on the slavs heads they quickly discovered there was more wall than matting with which to cover it they also discovered that covering it did only so much good as the cloth they were using could not absorb all the force from the rocks the enemys catapults threw but as george said now weve done what we can do the rest is up to god and to the slavs and avars paul added to which the shoemaker had to nod feeling more helpless than he had before the taverner spoke the bombardment went on for what seemed like forever but could not have been more than a couple of hours men on the wall were hurt some of them were killed the wall itself took a fearful pounding certainly a pounding that made george fearful here and there stones shattered but in the end the roman engineers and masons whod designed and built the wall were vindicated it did not collapse as had in his alarmed imagination seemed likely that must have seemed likely to the slavs too for their archers kept drawing ever nearer to rush into the city if the catapults forced a breach when the crews manning those catapults stopped shootingperhaps because they ran out of stones perhaps merely because they saw they were doing no good george and paul the tavernkeeper solemnly clasped hands first mug of wine is free if you come to my place tonight paul said which struck george as a fitting enough tribute to what theyd been through together the aftermath put him in mind of nothing so much as what happened after a bad storm he and his comrades on the wall looked around exclaiming at the damage that had been done and sharing one common refrain it could have been worse the disappointed bearing of the slavs out beyond the wall gave mute testimony to how bad it could have been they kept right on shooting arrows after the catapults left off trying to smash down the fortifications paul shot back at the slavs as long as theyre just sending arrows our way im not going to worry he said neither will i george agreed they wont get anywhere that way they looked at each other we never would have talked like this before the siege started paul said i sure wouldnt george replied never in my life i remember what it felt like the first time a slav shot at me no one had ever done that before but nowyoure right arrows arent worth getting excited about rufus for once had not been up on the wall when trouble started he got there a little while after the catapults had stopped flinging stones at the city busy time you had looks like he said with which george could hardly disagree the veteran peered down at the stones at the base of the wall he let out a loud whistle looks like they cut the tips off some mountains and tossed em this way he remarked thats what it felt like george said and paul nodded i believe it rufus said ive been bombarded its not what id care to do for fun thank you very much he raised his voice so the militiamen along a big stretch of thessalonicas wall could hear him lets get this matting pulled up and stacked again we may need it again you know as george hauled the lengths of thick cloth back over the wall he said i didnt see it helped very much it doesnt help very much rufus agreed but it does help some you cant know beforehand whether putting it down or not putting it down will make the difference between a wall that stays up and one that doesnt for no one hit makes a wall fall down since you cant say beforehand you dont take the chance you didnt take the chance and you were right george knew rufus wasnt praising him personally but praise from the veteran even if aimed at all the defenders felt good raising an eyebrow the shoemaker asked where were you anyway hardly seemed like a proper fight without you running around up here screaming at us youll pay for that rufus said though he didnt sound angry where was i he peered this way and that ill tell you and paul but i dont want it all over the city i was closeted with bishop eusebius is where i was were trying to figure out how were doing all right that makes sense george said and then as rufus didnt say anything more well how are we doing fair the veteran answered id say fair would be a fair way to put it ignoring georges groan and pauls sour look he went on were low on a lot of things we dont have as much food or firewood as we ought to and we arent as good with what we do have as we might be food and firewood and other things i mean he pointed to the heaps of stones on the walkway we havent replenished those the way we should for instance the slavs and avars might try tortoises again but nobodys worrying about it we have so many things to worry about we cant keep track of all of them at once even if thats what we need to do most and it is we need a real general paul observed youve worked wonders rufus dont take me wrong but you never tried keeping track of a whole city before eusebius is used to doing that but he doesnt know what all soldiers need to keep track of youre not as foolish as you look rufus said to which paul one of the least foolish looking men in thessalonica responded with a dry chuckle rufus continued a lot of what we talked about was just that what all needed doing and who would take charge of doing it what was the rest george asked again rufus did not appear forthcoming george said come on you just told us not to gossip now out with it rufus let out a long sigh then he said well its not anything you havent seen for yourselves and its not anything you couldnt figure out for yourselves either the bishops not happy about how strong the powers of the slavs and avars have turned out to be hes not happy paul exclaimed im not happy either if they were mild little powers the way everybody hoped the slavs and avars would have given up on the siege a long time ago i tried to tell him george said before we saw even a single slav around the city i tried to tell him he was polite to me and made as if he believed what i was saying but it must not have sunk in till he saw it for himself life is like that rufus said if we really learned things from what other people told us wed all be smarter and richer than we are right now and fathers wouldnt want to clout their sons over the head with rocks about the time the brats started shaving amen to that george said with a laugh and speaking of brats who havent been shaving long i think im going to bring theodore up onto the wall with me next time its my shift he knows how to shoot a bow so he wont be altogether useless up here and its about time he has a look at the way this particular part of the world works aye go ahead and do that rufus told him first battle first brothelthose are the memories thatll stick with you even when you get old i ought to know about that eh if im as hale as you are when i have your years i wont be doing too bad george said he hoped he managed to pile on as many years as rufus had in whatever shape he might be at that time the veteran had to be getting close to his threescore and ten but george had seen again and again how much vitality he still had in him george caught himself in a yawn he didnt have all that much vitality himself these days theodore flew up the stairs to the top of the wall george plodded after him the shoemaker was still feeling anything but vital maybe rufus should have taken theodore up on the wall not the youths tired old father when george got to the top and looked out toward the encampment of the slavs and avars theodore was already taking aim at the first slav he saw who wasnt impossibly far out of arrow range george made him rum the bow aside before any of the other militiamen had to come rushing over and do it for him but father theodore exclaimed aghast thats the enemy by the way he spoke the skinny draggledlooking slav at whom he wanted to shoot might have been the general commanding the barbarians not a tired soldier who looked to want nothing so much as a mug of wine and a place close by the fire to sleep when the slavs shoot at us we shoot at them george said patiently when they dont shoot we dont do much shooting either for one thing it wastes arrows for another if we start shooting at them theyll start shooting at us and more of us are liable to get hurt if theyre quiet were happy enough to let em stay that way everyone within earshot nodded theodore proved the point rufus had made a couple of days before saying but if theyre the enemy we need to kill them how can we kill them if we dont shoot at them all we need to do is keep them out of thessalonica george said we dont have to kill them if they cant get in sooner or later theyll go away dactylius came up onto the wall then he beamed at theodore and failed to notice theodore wasnt beaming back young blood the little jeweler said young blood makes me feel old and useless you know what young blood was going to do one of the nearby militiamen said he was going to start shooting at the first slav he saw and probably go right on shooting after that christe eleison wed have been ducking for days if george here hadnt stopped him theodore looked and sounded ready to burst this isnt fighting he said this is all makebelieve and cowardice a couple of militiamen laughed which only made matters worse but before theodore could do or say anything irrevocable george looked out from the wall hello he said and then to theodore son if you want fighting im afraid you may get it he pointed toward the troop of avars riding out of their encampment toward thessalonica as they did whenever he saw them the avars alarmed him part of that was their gear not only did they armor themselves in scalemail from head to foot they armored their horses the same way part of it was their horsemanship they might almost have been centaurs attached to their mounts from birth and part of it was the arrogance that flowed off them in waves the feeling that they were convinced they were the toughest people in the world their powers were convinced they were the toughest powers in the world too george also got that feeling from the avars and very strongly as strongly as the churches of christian saints reflected their special traits he wasnt the only one who got that feeling either dactylius said they give you the chills just looking at them dont they im glad they let the slavs do so much of the dirty work for them yes george said warily watching the avars shake themselves out from a column to a line paralleling the wall they were he thought still out of arrow range of the militiamen on the wall they did not share his opinion instead of quivers they carried cases holding both bow and arrows as if inspired by a single will they took out the bows and started shooting those bows must have been better than the ones the slavs usedbetter than the ones the militiamen on the walls of thessalonica used too the fellow whod been mocking theodores aggressive inexperience made a hideous gobbling noise and toppled over onto his side his hands clutched at the arrow that had suddenly sprouted from his neck bright red blood streamed out between his fingers and puddled on the walkway it steamed in the chill air of early morning the militiamans feet drummed and were still theodore stared eyes wide george set a hand on his shoulder were going to get some fighting whether we want it or not he said the avars arent going to care whether we and the slavs spend the next week shooting at each other youve got that bow youd better use it now before theodore could an arrow hissed between him and his father he jumped coming to the same horrible realization george had at the start of the siege people out there were trying to kill him then he shouted several words george had never heard him use at home yanked an arrow from his quiver and let fly at the avars george thought that a healthy reaction but after theodore had sent a couple of more arrows after the first the shoemaker said take it easy son they have better bows than we do so they can reach the wall and we probably cant hit them theodore stared at him as if hed started speaking slavic george realized the youth hadnt had the slightest idea where his arrows were going except that he was shooting at the foe he said youre right father i see that but what keeps them from before he could finish the question an avar arrow pierced another militiaman not far away the fellow howled like a wolf then started cursing in such a manner as to leave theodores earlier bad language in the shade christs stinking foreskin im bleeding like a stuck hog he shouted hold a bowl under me and you can make blood sausage tomorrow he plainly wasnt on the point of death but as plainly wasnt happy with what life had just given him either theodore tried again what keeps the avars from doing what theyre doing shooting at us from so far away we cant shoot back our bows cant reach them george answered our catapults can now the engines on top of the walls of thessalonica were not engaging the stonethrowers the avars had built they were taking on the avars themselves and throwing stones themselves not fire theodore cheered when a frying rock knocked a horse and rider flat but he watched thoughtfully as the animal and the man writhed about with neither one of them showing any sign of being able to get up the avars scalemail turned ordinary arrows at long range dactylius told theodore the story of the avar hed hit but hadnt hurt and then for good measure told it over again no matter how far away the nomad horsemen were though when a dart hit them it struck home an avar let out a shriek clearly audible from the wall when one of those darts pinned his leg to the horse he was riding the horse shrieked too and galloped madly away but soon went crashing down again george didnt think it or its rider would be of much use after that with the romans catapults in the fight the avars moved even farther from the wall than they had been their arrows began falling short seeing that they abandoned their effort as abruptly as they had started it trotting back toward their encampment with hardly a backward glance we did it father theodore burst out we drove them away thats true george said we did he didnt say anything about the militiaman who had caught the arrow in the neck and who now lay dead only a few feet away nor did he look in the direction of the dead man somehow he contrived by not saying and not looking to allude to the man as loudly as if hed shouted loudly himself at least at the outset theodore said that wouldnt happen to me theres no way in the world that could his voice which had been fading traded away altogether as he obviously remembered the arrow that hadnt missed him by much he did well dactylius said he did very well without children of his own dactylius didnt have to worry about raising them he would in fact have made a splendid indulgent grandfather but he wasnt altogether wrong either not here george nodded aye hell do he said he kept shooting at the avarseven if he wanted to start too bloody soon and he didnt start puking when people got hurt around him you sound like rufus theodore laughed george didnt rufus may be old and crude but ill tell you this son if theres one thing in the world he knows its what makes a soldier and what doesnt when im talking about soldiers i dont mind at dl if i sound like him he waited for theodore or dactylius to argue with him neither of them did dactylius nodded theodore changed the subject why do you suppose the avars started shooting at us like that you said the slavs and we were happy enough to live and let live i dont think the avars are happy letting anything live that they dont rule george answered maybe they thought the slavs have been getting too soft and they needed to make the fight livelier maybe some general of theirs came by and they were showing off for him maybe they just felt mean and wanted to kill themselves some romans does it matter dactylius added it might theodore said if we knew why they did what they do we might be able to keep them from doing it dactylius looked over toward george anyone would think he was your son he said i cant imagine why the shoemaker answered his voice dry but a sparkle in his eye theodore scowled at both of them he didnt think he sounded like his father he didnt think he thought like his father either all that proved as far as george was concerned was that he remained very young another blow with weapons dactylius said musingly i suppose that means theyll try something magical next they dont seem willing or able to do both at once do they george said i wouldnt mind rattling them again with our own power that sickness eusebius called down on them left them this far he held thumb and forefinger close together from having to up and go i thought the nature of the plague was that they had to up and go father theodore said so innocently that george had no more than a momentary temptation to pitch him off the wall onto his head anyone would think dactylius repeated my jokes arent that bad george said his voice full of affronted dignity he couldnt possibly be johns son john wasnt anywhere near thessalonica nine months before he was born theodore turned red soldiers chaffed one another harder than his friends did and george ever so slightly was chaffing his mother too father he said and his voice betrayed him sliding up into a boyish treble for the second syllable of the word dont worry about it boy im joking your mother would hit me if she heard me but not very hard george said adding if youre worried about what shes thinking go home and show her youre all right she was convinced the only reason id taken you up here was to get you killed that was another joke but less so than theodore probably thought will it be all right the youth asked doubtfully go ahead george told him i let rufus know i was going to bring you up here today to see how youd do but youre not on any official list i expect you can be by this time tomorrow though if thats what youd like all ive got to do is ask him to put you there you fought well enough no one can say you dont deserve it all right father if thats what you think thats what we should do theodore answered a more subdued response than the whoop of ecstatic glee george had expected maybe a firsthand look at war had sobered his son after all with a nod theodore descended from the wall hes a good boy george you should be proud of him dactylius said just outside the wall fluttered one of those batlike spirits that had startled george and dactylius on their first night patrol together its ugly little face twisted into a nasty leer as it echoed dactylius words in a high squeaky voice hes a good boy george you should be very proud of him whether it was meant for mockery or not it sounded scornful begone foul flying sprite george exclaimed and made the sign of the cross at it it bared its teeth and flapped a few feet farther away but seemed unharmed by the gesture that would have sent one of the powers of the pagan days of greece fleeing in abject terror you should be very proud it squeaked at the shoemaker was that an echo a mocking warning he couldnt tell he drew his bow and let fly at the spirit maybe his arrow missed maybe it passed right through the thing without causing it undue harm it did upset the spirit which shrilled very proud and flew away darting and dodging like a beast made of flesh and blood that bats gone george said in some satisfaction it was spying on us dactylius said yes i think youre right george answered that darting dodging flight had taken the batlike spirit back toward the tents of the slavic wizards who associated with the avar priest in spite of where it had gone the shoemaker laughed if the slavs think theyre going to learn how to take thessalonica from the likes of you and me theyll be disappointed oh dactylius blinked i hadnt thought of that youre right arent you unless you know more about the secrets of the city than i do i am george said he looked out toward the wizards tents once more they are strong the slavs i mean they arent very bright though or theyre not very good at using the power they do have otherwise one of those little bat things would have been listening to rufus and eusebius not to us how do you know one wasnt dactylius asked he stood there small and smug and proud of his own cleverness and george demolished it not taking malicious glee in the doing as john would have but doing it anyhow hardly noticing he was doing it not thinking of anything but going after the truth wherever it happened to be hiding this particular day if the slavs and avars were listening to what our leaders said to one another theyve have a better idea of where were weak than they really do and theyd do a better job of hurting us in those places dactylius stared at him pride leaked out of him like water from a squeezed sponge even with pride gone though integrity remained youre right he said a sentence hed used twice lately but one many men would sooner have been tortured than utter that makes better sense than my notion it does only stand to reason george said trying by his tone to imply that his friend would surely have seen the same thing had he but waited a moment longer before he spoke he waved up and down the length of the wall see we still dont have as many stones up here as we did before the slavs attacked the foundations with their tortoises for instance if they knew that they might try again good thing none of those little bat spirits was flying near you then dactylius said he and george both looked around anxiously to make sure that was so george didnt see any of the ugly little things so he supposed it was the supposition cheered him less than it might have sooner or later he said slowly those things are going to hear something important for no better reason than luck if they come around often enough they have to and if the slavs and avars can figure out what to do with it were in trouble dactylius finished for him were in worse trouble george corrected him weve been in plain trouble for a while now dactylius looked out toward the enemy encampment well yes he said viii a barmaid sidled up to george smiling a bright professional smile more salted olives she asked partly that was to help make him thirsty partly it was pride that pauls tavern still had salted olives to sell whatever it was george had already gone through one bowl of them and a fresh mug of wine sat in front of him he shook his head a kithara gently wept accompanying the singers plaintive song of lost love across the table from george john made a face if i had to listen to this fellow all day long id have left him too the comic said practice for your act george asked his friend wore the intent look he donned whenever he was about to perform but john shook his head paul told me hed throw me out on my ear if i ever badmouthed any of the other people he brought up onstage to make the customers forget how lousy his wine is his flexible features displayed great gobs of scorn as if anybody needs me to tell him what a bad mouth this singer has he wasnt on the platform yet but his quips drew blood even so before long the kithara player mercifully finished his last song he got a tepid round of applause half praise half relief that he was done paul shouted and now heres john the comic bounded up onto the little stage the kithara player gave him a fanfare he looked as if he could have done without i thought i was going to have good news for everybody tonight john said i thought the siege would be over by now when i was out on the wall a couple of weeks ago one of the avars told me their women were getting pretty tired of how long this whole business is taking and they said they wouldnt sleep with their men unless they gave up and made peace with us romans youre stealing that from aristophanes yelled a heckler with an education in the classics the frogs are loud tonight observed john who also had one koax koaxl but thats from the wrong play and besides anybody see the siege ending nope the avars are still here all right and whats more half their sheep are pregnant somebody threw an olive at him he caught it out of the air and ate it its not a tough crowd if they dont throw things from the swordsmiths shop he remarked maybe that was supposed to be a joke maybe it was just how a tavern comic went about gauging his audience john said one thing this siege has done is make me glad im a christian i have enough trouble keeping one god happy try and keep all the gods the slavs and avars have happy and you end up as worn out as an old man trying to keep a young harem happy he pantomimed limp exhaustionlimp in every sense of the word after exactly the right pause he recovered as if by magic and started counting on his fingers how many gods have we seen water god thunder gods fire godi expect any minute now theyre going to sic the god of shrunken tunics on us again he let his body get his laughs for him twisting and jerking as he tried to handle an imaginary bow in a tunic that was squeezing his arms like a serpent and somebody he said sitting down on his stool once more told the chief tax collector the slavs have so many gods they even have one who inflicts high interest on delinquent returns from what i hear the tax man jumped over the wall and converted day before yesterday that got a loud laugh every tax collector george had ever known would have worshiped a god like that he watched the men in the taverns looking around at one another half of them would have worshiped a god like that too enough people owed george money that he might have been tempted into a brief bit of fiscal paganism himself that same god went down into the jews quarter john added they told him to come back once he had some experience no one was safe from john that was a lot of what made him funny it was also what made the people whose vanity he flicked hate him a barmaid carrying a wooden tray filled with empty mugs stumbled over somebodys outstretched foot she squealed and managed to stay upright but several of the mugs flew off the tray being the cheapest of cheap crockery they shattered pick up the pieces verina paul said wearily when the noise stopped thatll come out of your pay you know what a kind and generous host we have john exclaimednot sarcasm as george first thought but the leadin to a joke for the comic continued puts me in mind of the two fellows who owned a slave in common one day one of them came into their shop and found the other one whacking the slave with a stick what are you doing he asked his partner and the other fellow told him im beating my half as verina swept up the shards of the broken mugs john said like i told you pauls a good fellow instead of taking it out of verina s pay he could have taken it out some other way he leered at the barmaid the largely male crowd whooped verina looked ready to throw the pieces of crockery at him again though hed only used the situation to help set up a story i remember the poor fool who was talking with a goodlooking woman and he said to her i wonder whether you or my wife tastes better he leered again and ran his tongue lewdly over his lips and the woman said why dont you ask my husband hes tasted us both he got his laugh but george listening to it thought it had a certain nervous undertone not everyone had as much confidence in his wife as he did with irene and everyone there no doubt had been devastated by an unexpected answer at one time or another even if not by that particular unexpected answer when johns jokes worked well they touched a central core of humanity all his listeners shared then said the comic there was the fellow who went to maurice and wanted to be named augustal prefect of egypt i already have one maurice told him well all right youre the emperormake me governor of thrace the man said and maurice answered i cant do that eitheri like the job the man there now is doing and the fellow said in that case give me twenty solidi so maurice did as the fellow was walking out of the palace with his gold pieces his friend asked arent you disappointed you got so little and the fellow said are you crazy i never would have got this much if i hadnt asked for all the other stuff that got a laugh too both for the sake of the joke and again for the obvious truth it contained maurice among the most parsimonious roman emperors of all time never parted with a copper if he could help it john got down from the platform went over to the bar and spoke to paul in a loud wheedling voice how about giving me half an interest in this tavern my good and wise friend what paul jerked as if a wasp had stung him are you out of your mind john go away well if you wont do that how about letting me have all the roast pork i can eat for the next year john asked are you crazy said the taverner who obviously hadnt been paying attention to the routine go back there and be funny give me a mug of wine then paul dipped it out for him there go on now john turned to the crowd you see he said with an enormous grin people laughed and cheered as he finally went back to the platform and paul never did figure out where the joke lay john knocked back the wine in one long draught then ruefully shook his head go back there and be funny the man says ill tell you people whats funny thats funny our beloved host thinks he can tell somebody to be funny and have it happen just like that youd better be funny said paul who was listening now john ignored him now the comics face bore a wistful expression maybe a true one maybe only a trick of the light i wish it were that easy i wish you could walk into a shop and say id like a pound of funny please and put it in a sack and take it home with you wouldnt that be fine if you could buy funny the way you buy a loaf of bread from justin the baker or a pair of shoes from george here now george jumped john hadnt been in the habit of including him in his routines and he would have been as well pleased had his friend left him out of this one too and sure enough john sent a sardonic stare his way as he went on come to think of it you can buy some pretty funny shoes from george all right ill remember you in my nightmares george called your nightmares are ugly enough without me john retorted he wasnt shy about mocking himself either he went on besides its hard to be funny in thessalonica these days god is punishing us for our sins the slavs and avars are outside the wall theres not enough food inside the wall and he gave menas back his legs so he could go around shouting at everybody some people laughed others looked alarmed either because god might have been insulted or because menas had been george put his elbows down on the tabletop and buried his face in his hands sure as sure that crack would get back to menas and sure as sure menas would think george had said it not anyone else fourteen people might tell him it had come from johns lips he would hear george every time the shoemaker didnt really listen to the rest of johns routine people laughed every so often so he suspected his friend was doing well and when john finally came back to the table the bowl he brought with him was nicely full of coins he sorted them with his usual quick dexterity george said i do wish you wouldnt tell jokes on menas so often why in gods name john didnt look up from what he was doing hes funny is what he is i cant think of anybody funnier in the whole world him swaggering around like hes got gods hand in his drawers the trouble is he doesor he did anyhowhave gods hand in his drawers george said uncomfortably yes but god didnt put it there to play menas trumpet for him john answered setting a silver miliaresion off by itself with a pleased grunt menas still hasnt figured that out even though its been months hes pretty stupid too he may never get the idea regardless of how stupid he is a sentiment with which george heartily concurred hes rich too and hell get you in trouble if you keep making jokes about him hell get me in trouble if you keep making jokes about him but george remained too stubborn to tell john about that whats he going to do the comic asked make me leave town i cant go by land and if he puts me on a ship he does me a favor he can make your life miserable while youre here george said believe me i know that was as close as he would come to revealing the trouble to which his friend had contributed my life is already miserable while im here john said a little less miserable he amended because the nights take is pretty good and if verinas in the right kind of mood he raised his voice and called to the barmaid hello sweetheart what do you say you and i i say no whatever it is verina answered all those broken cups i was cleaning up i wish id broken them over your head george didnt know what john had done to her or what she thought hed done to her but she didnt want to have anything to do with him now stalking off nose in air if he was embarrassed he didnt show it going up in front of an audience to tell jokes for a living had no doubt hardened him against embarrassment it doesnt matter he said lightly shes no good in bed anyhow that for once hadnt been pitched to carry to verinas ears but she heard it and came storming back for one thing youre a liar she snapped for another youve never had the chance to find out whether youre a liar and for one more youre never going to have the chance off she went again john got more laughs than he had through his whole routine all of them aimed at him had george been publicly humiliated like that he wouldnt have dared show his face on the street for weeks afterwards john took it all in stride by the calculating look on his face he was figuring out the jokes hed tell about it the next time he got up in front of a crowd having gone to pauls tavern george was glad he had an afternoon shift on the wall the next day he was less glad about staring into the westering sun the day was cold but brilliantly clear the glare in his face made it hard for him to keep an eye on whatever the slavs and avars might be doing john didnt worry about that and had some reason not to worry the barbarians encampment seemed as quiet as it ever had since the siege began the comic said theyre probably all out with their sheep you told that one last night john george said patiently go on complain about every little thing john said i think george didnt find out what john thought up farther north along the wall someone started shouting in a very loud unpleasant voice call yourself a fighting man do you a fighting man is supposed to be alert in the presence of danger he is supposed to had rufus been giving that dressingdown neither george nor john would have thought anything of it as it was johns face gave the impression that hed smelled some meat several days later than it should have been smelled georges lip also curled menas he said menas it was and he was to george s dismay heading in the direction of the litaean gate spreading joy and good cheer in front of him john glanced his way and said whats that thing hes carrying besides his big ugly belly i mean his war hammeris that what youre talking about george said ive seen him lugging that around before its a rich mans toy if you ask mesomething that makes him feel like a soldier even if hes not he wasnt a soldier himself as any member of thessalonicas regular garrison would have told him in as much detail as he could stand but hed done real fighting since the slavs and avars infested the city which was more than menas could have said george checked himself no it was more than menas could truthfully have said and here came the noble twirling the hammer around by the leather strap attached to the end of the handle he glared at george as if at a moldy spot on a chunk of bread havent i told you to stop insulting me he growled havent i warned you ill get my own back if its the last thing i do youve done all those things sir george answered what i havent done is insult you liar menas shouted loud enough to make militiamen within a bowshot of him turn their heads his way the latest is you say god cured me so i could go around shouting at people whoever had reported johns joke to him had got the words right but menas had got the source wrong as george had known would happen the shoemaker wondered if john would own up to having said it and if menas would believe him if he did since john kept quiet the latter didnt become an issue george said i did not say that about you sir liar menas shouted again i did not say that george repeated if you keep doing the things that someone said about you though i will start saying them myself ill have to start saying them myself because youll have made them true menas stared at him being a rich and prominent man being a man to whom god had granted a miracle for what reason george could not imagine and hed tried how hed tried the noble was not accustomed to having anyone speak so pointedly to him he raised the hammer as if to strike george down george sprang backwards he had an arrow on the string and the bow down almost as soon as his feet hit the walkway again the point of the arrowa bronze point perhaps made by benjaminwas aimed at a spot a palms breadth above menas navel as nothing george said had ever managed to do that made menas thoughtful he lowered the silverchased hammer george lowered the bow so the arrow pointed toward the walkway rather than menas brisket he held it at full draw though ready to bring it up in a hurry if the noble was only pretending to back away from a fight how youll pay menas snarled youll wish the slavs and avars had got hold of you by the time im done he stamped south along the walkway george resisted the temptation to put the arrow in his bow straight through menas left kidney it wasnt easy he had to make himself replace the arrow in the quiver one motion at a time getting credit for my lines are you john said when menas started bellowing at some other luckless militiaman farther down the wall thats a trouble you could probably do without now that you mention it yes george answered john was bolder with his insults when the target wasnt standing right there in front of him george tried to get angry at that but found he couldnt most men were made the same way thats why youve been after me not to tell jokes about him anymore john said with the air of a man for whom a dark corner of the world has suddenly become bright in a manner of speaking george said well i wont john promised and then an instant later he backtracked i dont think i will anyhow but if something comes to me while im up there in front of a bunch of people who knows what ill do no one george said sadly not a single solitary soul not even you youd be better off if you did maybe john said but if i knew ahead of time everything id do when i got up on a platform and if i did just what id thought beforehand i was going to do i wouldnt be me like you say i might be better off but i might not be able to perform at all george thought about that hed made shoes all his life learning the trade from his father but if for some reason he couldnt make shoes anymore he was sure hed be happy enough as a potter or a miller instead once hed learned one of those businesses if however a man had in his makeup something that had to come out if he was to be happy he couldnt very well go through life denying it was there i will try john said which as a pledge left something to be desired do the best you can george sounded weary even to himself the damage is probably done by now any which way a man whom george needed a moment to recognize was in the shop when he came back from the wall a burly fellow of about his own age with rather heavy features pitted by scars from either a light case of smallpox or a bad set of pimples as a youth the latter george thought and that let him figure out who the visitor was a moment before irene said dear of course you know leo the potter yes of course george said and clasped leos hand the potter had a firm grip and very smooth skin on his palm from using it to shape clay a great contrast to the scars and punctures that marked a shoemakers hands a pleasure to see you will you drink some wine with me your lady already gave me a cup leo answered holding it up i got here myself not two minutes ago matter of fact irene poured a cup for her husband who took it with a word of thanks he looked around for sophia and theodore both of whom seemed to have vanished but no shadows at the top of the stairway said they were lingering as discreetly as they could no doubt with hands cupped to their ears to hear the better as much to annoy them as for any other reason george stretched small talk longer than he might have done but small talk was also a way of getting acquainted with leo whom he did not know well after a while casually george said youre constantines father arent you had leo still had his youthful pimples he and constantine might have been two brothers not father and son george stretched a point finelooking boy irene frowned at him he nodded very slightly to let her know hed seen had he been buying a donkey he wouldnt have praised anything about the animal till it was his a marriage dicker though was a different sort of businessor so he thought hes a good lad if i do say so my own self leo answered and since hes not here theres nobody but me to say it for him helenmy wife you knowshe didnt come through the plague a couple of years ago absentmindedly he scratched himself i hate fleas they are a nuisance george agreed yes the plague was a hard time for all of us this siege is another hard time i hadnt intended speaking to you till it was over and done and things were back to normal again yes i can see that leo said but i drew a different lesson from the plague and that is dont wait things may never bewhat was that word you usednormal thats it normal again no telling whatll happen tomorrow i say so wed better arrange today the best we can and on account of that i didnt figure i ought to wait before i came to see you george hesitated before replying as far as he was concerned leos lesson was absolutely the wrong one festina lente ran through his mind make haste slowly but the fact that leo did draw lessons even mistaken lessons from what went on around him bumped the potter up a notch in georges estimation most people he was convinced went through life without a clue it might hold patterns they could use irene said your brother is a potter too isnt he zeno thats right though his shop is over by the other side of st demetrius church leo smiled at irene either you have a right fine memory or youve been asking questions about me everyone in this family has a very good memory irene said primly that was on the whole true even if theodore sometimes showed a maddening inability to remember what george had told him to do five minutes earlier thats nice leo said willing to pretend to believe irene hadnt been investigating his family hed also been doing some investigating for he went on im sorry god didnt give either of you sibs who lived i had an older brother george said i dont even remember him he died when i was a baby i had an older sister and a younger brother irenes eyes were sad as she looked into the past gods will she grew brisk once more but you didnt come here to talk about old sorrows but the chance for new joys the chance yes leo scratched his nose you do keep a clean shop george ill say that for you hardly any stink of leather in the air though george bristled he made a point of not letting leo notice making and repairing shoes was a perfectly respectable trade but not one of high class by implying as much leo was making a bid for a bigger dowry to accompany sophia if she married constantine it was astonishing how a fatter bride portion could balance social stigma in the scales but george in turn remarked you and your son are lucky fellows not to be melted to tallow standing in front of your kilns day after day he had no intention of conceding that potters stood any higher on the social scale than did shoemakers leo grunted well when we talk about sophias dowry what are we talking about twenty solidi something like that george stared at him admiring the effrontery of such a forthright thief youre going to lose this girl if you go on that way he said we arent nobility and neither are you sulkily leo said how much then it would have to be a pretty price ill tell you constantine has his admirers yes he does irene said when you married helen leo her bride portion was what two solidi and a little silver wasnt it how did you know that leo turned red as the fire under one of his kilns george wondered the same thing although his wifes skill at ferreting out such tidbits roused respect in him not the horror leo obviously felt by that horror george judged irene had the straight goods never mind how i know she said crisply that hasnt got anything to do with anything what matters is its true are you so much richer than your father that you think people want to beggar themselves to join your family and i hear zeno s wife brought a smaller dowry than yours did she leo exclaimed she puts on airs she doesnt deserve then now he sounded indignant he also sounded as if he hadnt known what his sisterinlaws bride portion had been george wondered from whom irene had pried that little nugget if youre going to be unreasonable about these things theres no point in us even talking george said in fact i probably wouldnt even be talking with you now if i didnt know how sweet constantine was on sophia he didnt know that but had a feeling it was so from the way the youth had glanced back at him when they passed on the street and for a wonder his shot proved as effective as irenes had been leo turned red again this time from annoyance rather than embarrassment he said i told him not to show that on the sleeve of his tunic i have nothing against love matches george said a lot of times they work out as well as the other sort but i dont see any reason a bride should pay a fancy price so she and the groom can end up doing what theyve wanted to do anyhow if she brings a small portion that makes your family and mine both look bad leo said people will find out about it and gossip he sent irene a glance filled with anything but delight unalloyed i dont gossip she said sweetly but i will say you have a point since i know people who do leo got to his feet i thank you for the wine maybe you were right after all and we shouldnt talk this all the way through till we know thessalonica is safe after this i dont know as i want to talk with anybody else either good day to you both he edged out of the shop and fled no sooner had he gone than sophia and theodore hurried downstairs angrily sophia said now look what you did you scared him away he wont come back anymore and my life is ruined ruined she burst into tears george and irene by contrast burst into laughter that made sophia cry harder than ever she glared at them from red wet eyes george said he will be back little onei promise the only thing your mother and i did was show him the two of us werent fools sophia stared at him doubtfully do you really think so she wanted to believe him that was plain no doubt about it irene said he thought wed dower you with everything we own just for the sake of joining his snooty family now that he knows better we should get on well enough he wants this match too george added otherwise he would have waited till the siege was over before he started talking about it the way we were going to do oh sophia said in a small voice her smile was like the sun coming out from behind rain clouds i hope youre right it was evident she wanted the match at least as much as constantine did george resolved not to let leo know that it would make the dickering harder theodore asked mother how did you know what bride portions constantines mother and aunt brought with them from claudia of all people irene answered before george could say anything worried she went on it didnt have anything to do with this match either i forget whether it was last year or the year beforelast year i guess because it was after the plagueand claudia was complaining about people who pretended they were finer than they really were and she mentioned helen and her dowry and her sisterinlaw too i thought it was in poor taste myself poor helen being dead and all but i didnt forget it either and when i turned out to need it there it was your mother george told theodore not joking at all never forgets anything me irene said me who was it about the time we got married who could tell which team had won the chariot races at every running for the past fifty years before then and which rider had the most wins for each team and how this one bald driver hadnt missed a running for fifteen years george maintained a dignified silence that was how he thought of it at any rate its chief effect was making his wife and both his children laugh at him seeing that he tried the opposite course that bald fellow had a brother who was a driver too and their father trained their horses same as hed been doing for twentythree years before that and such arcana proved every bit as risible as dignified silence george gave up and started repairing a sandal sophia having swung from sad to furious to eager and hopeful in the course of a couple of minutes came over and kissed him on the cheek thank you papa she said for what george asked confused now for a bald charioteer his daughter answered which confused him worse than ever but hed just started talking about marrying her off and she didnt hate him for it confused or not he didnt suppose he was doing too badly there magic rufus said decisively peering out toward the encampment of the slavs and avars i think youre right george nodded thats what theyll hit us with next he sniffed the wind was out of the west and swept the savory odors of roasting mutton and beef from the enemys camp into the city sighing he said theyre still eating well i wish we were weve got enough to get us through rufus answered which lifted georges spirits if anyone knew how thessalonica stood for food the veteran was the man he went on what surprises me is that the barbarians are keeping their army so well fed they must have dragged in all the livestock for miles around the bastards even after they go the countrysidell be bare as a sheared sheep for years i hadnt thought about that george said an admission that bothered him he was the sort of man who tried to think as far ahead as he could meat will be expensive for a long time to come we can always eat old avars rufus said except i think theyd be tougher than your shoeleather shoeleather george exclaimed if theyre slaughtering all the cattle and sheep what will i use for shoeleather dont know that one either rufus said if not cheerfully than with a good deal less concern than george had for the question what weve got to do is weve got to get the siege over with so we can worry about things like shoeleather again things like deciding whether i want to see sophia marry constantine george thought but the veteran was right what sort of magic do you think theyll throw at us he asked the bishop and i have been talking about that rufus answered george had a hard time gauging his tone was he proud of having become part of the citys inner circle or scornful of the man with whom he was conferring a bit of both the shoemaker judged rufus continued eusebius thinks were going to come up against it before too long that theyre going to throw all the magic they have at us to try and break in if they dont make it theyll likely give up and go away that sounds sensible george said it may be true anyway rufus smile was crooked the bishop kept giving me all sorts of reasons out of the holy scriptures why he thought it was so after a while i started to doze off you dont think hes right the shoemaker asked oh i think hes right but not for any of the reasons he was going on about rufus said you look at whats left for the slavs and avars to eat out there you look at the really bad weather thats bound to come and you cant see them besieging us forever the only thing about the cold i dont like is that it makes pestilences spread slowerbut their magic for that sort of thing is pretty good anyhow weve found out about that weve found out their magic for a lot of different things is pretty good george said i tried telling that to eusebius but rufus held up his hand ive heard that story you know george and do you know what bishop eusebius said to me he said rufus if id only listened to that shoemaker whatshisname wed all be better off now because he sure knew how strong the slavs magic was really georges eyes widened he didnt even mind being called whatshisname did he really say that rufus leered evilly no the gesture george used invited rufus to perform an act so vile and so anatomically unlikely that god when he was writing the holy scriptures hadnt thought to condemn it the veteran laughed till he held his sides if you could have seen the look on your face he dissolved again funny george said i laugh sorry rufus said sounded about a quarter sincere i couldnt resist you didnt try george said rufus did not deny it by the nature of things rufus hardly could have denied it george thought for a bit he could either stay angry at the veteran or he could forget about it he forgot about it suffusing himself in a warmly christian glow of virtue besides forgetting about it let him keep on questioning rufus instead of cursing him his relentless curiosity insisted that was the better choice he asked what kind of magic does bishop eusebius think will be in the next big push from the slavs and avars you never quite answered earth most likely rufus said theyve tried air and fire and water more i dont know whether they can make the wall come down that way but thats what the bishop thinks theyll try it does make sense i suppose george kicked at the walkway i dont want the wall to crumble under my feet neither do i rufus said theyve come too cursed close to managing that without using any magic at all if they have some gods whose special province is earthquakes say that could be very bad george agreed are there any special prayers we can use to keep earthquakes from happening eusebius is looking for some rufus answered me i have my doubts if there really were prayers like that everybody would know them and use them and we wouldnt have earthquakes anymore something to that i shouldnt wonder it was in fact the sort of logical look at a problem george might have used himself he said if we cant pray to stop a quake what can we do pray that the gods of the slavs and avars cant start one that wouldnt have happened without them i suppose rufus said thats better than nothing and it lets us fight them on our own ground george grimaced rufus grinned relax pal im not smart enough to do that on purpose if you say so george answered which won him a dirty look from the veteran he held up a placating hand if you were stupid rufus you would have done something that got you killed years ago rufus laughed ah theres a deal of truth in that i tell you a soldier starting out hes all balls and no brains he laughed again on a different note this time maybe its a good thing i came to the trade with narses for my first general he didnt have any balls at allfirst eunuch i ever heard of who wanted to be a fighting man and oh wasnt he a fine onebut brains that man had more brains than any five ive met since after looking around he lowered his voice and that includes eusebius too also quietly george said ive always thought the bishops pretty smart oh he is he is rufus said thats what he is sure enough pretty smart lf we had narses here in thessalonica now if we had narses the slavs and avars would have gone away weeks ago and they would have thought it was their idea and they would have been proud of it he sounds like quite a leader george said thinking he sounded like rufus beloved first commander seen across most of a lifetime through a warm haze of memory he was rufus said remember hes the fellow who finished the job of conquering italy from the goths after belisarius marched up and down and up and down till his feet got flat but couldnt make those shaggy bastards he down and quit and narses only had dribs and drabs of money and men to work with too on account of most everything got sent to the frontier with the persians when the war started up there thats so george said slowly maybe rufus knew what he was talking about after all he had a way of knowing what he was talking about but isnt italy full of lombards nowadays it sure is rufus said and do you know what thats narses doing too after justinian finally upped and dropped dead sophiahis nephew justins wife you know the new empressheard how narses had booted all the goths and franks out of italy and you know what she did what george asked willing to oblige the veteran he neednt have bothered rufus talked right through him she sent him a distaff so he could spin thread he was a eunuch after all so she figured she could insult him no matter what hed done for the roman empire but he had his revenge hed had lombard mercenaries on his side fighting in italy and he invited the whole cursed tribe down they were plenty glad to come too ill bet the country next door to theirs was filling up with avars about then george thought about that his shiver had nothing to do with the weather any country next door to the avars is a good one to get out of you ask me you mean like this one rufus asked which was such a good question george didnt answer it at first george thought the service at st demetrius basilica convened for prayer against earthquakes a coincidence then he reminded himself that rufus and eusebius had been putting their heads together if they thought the slavs and avars liable to try working earth magic the bishop would naturally do his best to forestall it why does the earth quake father sophia asked as they walked toward the basilica because god is angry with us irene said before george could answer i know that sophia said impatiently what i mean is how does he make the earth shake or how do the gods of the slavs and avars do that so he can stop them they jump up and down inside the earth and when their feet hit everything in there shakes and so do we theodore said lets say thats true george said what is there for their feet to land on thats any harder than anything else and if there isnt any one part inside the earth thats harder than another how can they jump up and down at all theyre gods theodore said or demons anyhow who knows what they can or cant do besides that avar wizard i mean george chewed on that of course godand demons i supposecan break natural laws now and then thats what miracles are but if natural laws got broken all the time we wouldnt have any natural laws earthquakes only happen every now and then sophia said thank god irene added and made the sign of the cross theodore being of the age where he constantly had to challenge his father did so if demons jumping up and down inside the earth dont make earthquakes what does my father said that his father said he once heard a philosopher traveling to athens say george began irenes loud and pointed sniff interrupted him philosophers followed the pagan gods she reminded him and god proved the stronger so why should anyone care what the philosophers said why should anyone care if i get a word in edgewise george said i dont think anyone does care if i get a word in edgewise having won a small space of silence with that outburst he proceeded to fill it what this fellow said if i have it right didnt have anything to do with god or demons at all he said the earth is full of caves and caverns that go deep deep deep underground and when air rumbles through them in underground storms thats what makes earthquakes theodore delightedly clapped his hands together earthfarts he cried hopping in the air with glee lets all pray that god can keep the slavic demons from farting underground amen i get asked a serious question i give a serious answer and what thanks do i get for it george asked the air this straighten up you foolish loon he growled at theodore who had doubled over in laughter he was having a hard time not laughing himself but he would have given himself over to the city torturer before admitting it he was not the only one who knew their son well either in tones suggesting the last judgment irene said theodore before you think of breaking wind in the middle of bishop eusebius prayer imagine what your father will do to you after you come out of the church theodore did imagine it george could see him weighing whether the disaster to follow would be worth the entertainment during what he could not see and what worried him was which way his son would decide when they got to the basilica irene and sophia went upstairs to the womens gallery george and theodore made their way toward the altar along with keeping his elbows up to move other men out of the way george kept looking around to see where menas was when he spotted the rich nobleman he made a point of staying away from him it wasnt fear more on the order of not borrowing trouble since every time the two of them came anywhere near each other things only got worse people muttered back and forth while they waited for bishop eusebius not everyone knew why the bishop had summoned the folk of thessalonica theodore made himself look wise and well connected by explaining to anyone who would listen george kept his own counsel being thought close to the powerful was nothing he deemed important besides eusebius would do his own explaining soon enough here came the bishop behind a couple of muscular deacons swinging thuribles from which came the incense george often thought of as the odor of piety eusebius his clever face more deeply lined than it had been when the siege began took his place behind the altar he raised his hands in a gesture of benediction that was at the same time a request for silence when that silence proved slow in coming the deacons stared out at the congregation so sternly they soon obtained it kyrie eleisonlord have mercy eusebius said christe eleisonchrist have mercy george echoed those prayers so did everyone else in the basilica the women in their gallery along with the men below eusebius said servants of christ brethren my friends i have not bid you come to any ordinary divine liturgy we are indeed here to beg god to have mercy on us in our struggle against the barbarians vicious onslaughts in spite of the fiercely scowling deacons a low murmur ran through the basilica from people who hadnt heard why eusebius wanted them there or had got a garbled account that needed correcting eusebius went on we have reason to believe the slavs and avars are wickedly consorting with the demons who in their pride reckon themselves gods and seek to inspire those demons whose province is the infernal regions to overthrow the fortifications of this great and godguarded cityfortifications the aforementioned barbarians have proved unable to overcomeby causing the ground to tremble and shake in the horrors of an earthquake thereby transforming thessalonica in the wink of an eye from town to tomb he brought out the sentence all in one breath without the slightest hesitation george admired that as much as he resigned himself to yet another dose of eusebius mortuary rhetoric the bishop went on we pray thee god all of us here individually and collectively to spare thy city and thwart and bind the powers of the demons in accordance with the greatness of thine own power let us live as we have lived secure in thy bosom and that of the roman empire thou lovest preserve the calm thou hast ordained in the bowels of the earth theodores face assumed a look of intense concentration acting with the reflexive speed hed acquired in combat on the walls of thessalonica george stepped on his sons foot hard enough to make theodore grimace in pain whatever might have happened didnt after that assuming a properly reverential attitude one that might persuade god to pay some small attention to his prayer wasnt easy for george he did his best and had to hope it was good enough he suspected the only prayer theodore had offered up to the lord was one for timely flatulence and george had managed to keep that one from being granted fortunately theodore hadnt howled when george stepped on him that meant the reverence of the rest of the congregation remained undisturbed all the way up to eusebius final amen people filed out of the basilica of st demetrius chattering approvingly about what a moving prayer service it had been and when they say moving george told his son they arent talking about their bowels bishop eusebius was theodore retorted whereupon george trod upon his toes again this time it didnt help theodore dissolved into giggles from which occasional mumbles of bowels and earthfarts emerged he and his father met irene and sophia across the street from the church i see you didnt have to kill him quite irene said to george again proving she knew their son as well as he did i didnt do anything theodore protested a cry that would have resounded with greater sincerity had he not still been snickering from time to time yes and it wasnt for lack of effort that you didnt either george said which singularly faded to abash his son sophia gasped george whirled expecting some slavic or avar demigod to be menacing his daughter or someone else close by pointing sophia said looktheres constantine isnt he splendid as far as george could see the splendid one was still hulking rather surlylooking and pimplebesplotched he knew sophia was looking at the youth as much with her heart as with her eyes instead of examining constantine to his way of thinking an unprofitable exercise george nodded politely to leo the potter the father of sophias object of affection nodded back he studied sophia and then warily irene the smile she gave leo showed good teeth george was sure hed imagined fangs in her mouth almost sure god will provide irene said her husband wondered whether she was talking about constantine or freedom from earthquakes probably both he decided several avars on horseback stared in at thessalonica they dont look very happy do they dactylius said sounding happy himself at the avars appearance of unhappiness no george said and then more sharply uhoh here comes that priest or wizard of theirs id almost sooner pray never to see him again than for no more earthquakes for a while amen to that rufus said hes caused us as much trouble as all their soldiers rolled togetherthrow in the slavic wizards with him i mean thats so george agreed but it looks like the other avars arent any happier to see him than they are to look at us doesnt it good rufus said with considerable relish one of the mounted men pointed toward thessalonica the priest shook his head and spread his hands in regret whatever the horseman wanted him to do he couldnt do it no earthquake today rufus voice oozed false regret cant make the walls fall down oh poor ducks what a shame they had to go up against the power of god when you do that you come off second best realism replaced sarcasm for a moment well most of the time you do the powers out there theyre pretty tough the avar cuffed at the priest george stared knowing how much power the man who wore furs and fringes controlled he waited for the wizard to turn the horseman into a grub or possibly even into a roman scribe but nothing happened save that the avar priest brought up a hand to keep the captain from hitting him more than once dissension in their ranks someone with a big deep voice shouted from not far away menas there he stood atop the litaean gate hed been quiet till that moment something so unusual it had kept george from noticing him now he went on loudly obvious if they quarrel among themselves our victory is assured why doesnt he keep still dactylius asked i dont think he knows how george answered if he stops talking for long he forgets he exists thats no way to talk about a noble rufus said in stern tones then added but i wont tell you youre wrong either menas waved his big expensive ostentatious war hammer we shall slaughter them hip and thigh root and branch is he a wrestler a gardener or a soldier george asked hes a blowhard thats what he is rufus said havent seen him up on the wall for a bit he must have heard that the truth gets told here and the truth about him is that hush dactylius said hes liable to hear you and then youll have the same troubles with him that george does not me rufus hand dropped to the hilt of his sword he tries getting wise with me hell regret it to the end of his daysand thatll be soon out beyond the wall the avar captain was finally getting it through his head that the wizard couldnt give him what he wanted he shouted to his companions one of them produced a horn of polished brass that shone like gold even on a cloudy day the fellow raised it to his lips and blew a long unmelodious blast uhoh george said as he had a little while before on spying the wizard oh dear dactylius added rufus said something that expressed the same opinion a good deal more pungently slavs started tumbling out of the tents and little wooden shacks in which they sheltered from the elements and all along the wall more horn blasts were presumably calling more slavs out of more encampments somethings going on rufus said as good a statement of the obvious as george had heard in a long time a moment later the veteran added here come the slavs all right almost indignantly george said i thought we decided the slavs and avars would try magic against us next maybe they did try it and it didnt work thanks to the prayers we sent up to god the other day rufus answered or maybe we were just flatout wrong wouldnt be the first time thats happened to me and i expect not to you either eh george didnt answer he was watching the slavs who were indeed issuing from their encampments in large numbers most of the barbarians were clutching bows they trotted toward the wall of thessalonica and started loosing great flights of arrows crouching behind a battlement dactylius said this must be what they mean when they talk about shooting so many arrows they darken the sun as they come if one of em hits you square itll darken the sun for you all right and you can take that to church rufus said as if to underscore his words men up and down the length of the wall shouted and screamed as they were wounded george heard menas say here my good fellow lean on me ill get you down to safety and the help of a physician the shoemakers lip curled menas had found a way to get out of the dangerous part of the fighting and to look good while he did it george popped up long enough to shoot at the slavs then ducked back down again up shoot duck up shoot duck they havent tried anything like this for a while he said nocking another arrow sure havent agreed rufus who was also grabbing for a new shaft whatever theyre doing theyre bloody serious about it of course theyre serious a newcomer said have you ever seen anybody tell jokes while he was shooting a bow hullo john george said without looking up till you did it just now no i hadnt seen anybody do that he did didnt he dactylius said is it time to change shifts already i mean would it be time if im not there when im supposed to be it will make claudia very unhappy shed be even more unhappy if the slavs take the city paul pointed out the taverner had come up onto the wall with the comic he shot at the slavs got one there i think there are enough of them ill say that rufus said they havent brought the whole army forward like this since his brow already wrinkled furrowed still more as he thought since that time they used those tortoises to try and undermine the walls after george let fly with another arrow he stayed upright longer than he had been doing i see more of them getting ready to use those big shields they had then let me have a look rufus stood up beside him ignoring the arrows humming by as if they were so many gnats george pointed the veteran let out a grunt aye thats what theyre doing didnt know whether theyd try the same stunt twice but i always figured they might and dont the scriptures talk about a dog coming back to its vomit that means coming back to a bad idea george said loosing another shaft at the advancing slavs for them this is liable to be coming back to a good idea he shot again the arrow ricocheted from one of the large heavy shields he cursed so did rufus aye its liable to be he agreed after he looked around at the piles of stones on the walkway his curses put georges to shame ive been screaming at everybody who might listen but we still havent put back as many rocks as we dropped on the slavs the last time they tried tortoises against us he raised his voice to a great bellow water and fuel for the cauldrons in more conversational tones he said to george well never get stones up here quick enough to do much good dropping boiling water on the whoresons will still help though it had better george said the tortoise crews moved steadily forward the shoemaker pointed to them theyve learned from what went wrong the first time now theyve got the shields up to make their shells right from the start only way to do it rufus said absently and then i wish they were as stupid as those goths and franks and lombards over in italy the german tribes didnt know how to do anything except bash and slash and they didnt want to learn either under georges feet the wall shivered the first tortoise had reached it and under cover of the ironfaced shields the slavs were using pry bars and hammers and chisels to try to pull stones out of the base and send the whole thing tumbling down george set down his bow picked up a stone and dropped it down toward the attackers it landed with a dull thud not a clatter telling him hed missed dactylius threw a stone down on the slavs too he cheered when he heard a crash but the barbarians kept chipping away at the wall which meant the shields above them had turned the stone john said if this goes on much longer it could get very boring after a moment he added running out of rocks up here could be boring too boring as he used it seemed to mean getting everyone on the wall killed rufus lifted a stone it was not one of the enormous boulders hed picked up the first time the slavs tried tortoises but of more ordinary size and weight even so it was enough to make him stagger george decided god really had been helping him then he also decided god wasnt helping rufus now when the veteran dropped the stone he missed the tortoise as george had the vibration underfoot got worse as more and more slavic crews got to work at the base of the wall we arent going to have enough rocks to smash all of them paul said i dont know how else were going to stop them either george had been thinking the same thing hed kept quiet hoping it wouldnt be true if he didnt say it now paul had said it it was true rufus face was haggard for once showing every one of his years were in trouble he said each word dragged from him a sally george asked as he had before he saw how much rufus wanted to say no to keep fighting from the top of thessalonicas wall the wall that had for so long warded the romans within from the barbarians outside but the wall trembled beneath their feet and might crumble beneath those feet at any moment looking as if every word tasted bad rufus said aye a sally the decision made he wasted no time wondering whether he should change his mind instead he shouted come on you lugs grab your swords and shields and get down to the gate if we cant make the slavs leave the wall alone any other way well have to chase em off having set down all his arms but his bow and arrow when he got up to the walkway george had to snatch them up in a hurry now several of his comrades were doing the same thing rufus had already started down the stairway toward the litaean gate john paul george and dactylius hurried after him along with a couple of dozen other militiamen from farther away down on the ground rufus was shoving every ablebodied man he could find in the direction of the gate here what are you doing menas shouted in anger and alarm do you know who i am rufus kept shoving youre not much more than half my age and youve got that big fancy hammer in your hand he answered past that pal i dont care who you are this time the soldier at the postern gate gave rufus no argument when he ordered it open doesnt this look like fun john exclaimed but the tavern comic was the first one through the gate out into the hostile world beyond the wall george followed a moment later he let out the loudest shout he could both to frighten the slavs and to try to make himself believe he wasnt frightened he didnt know how he did on the first count on the second he faded miserably he ran toward the tortoise closest to the litaean gate arrows hissed past bouncing back from the wall or shattering against it to his relief the slavic archers didnt come rushing forward to engage his comrades and him in handtohand combat there were enough of them that they might have overwhelmed the militiamen by force of numbers alone behind their shields the slavs in the tortoise saw the romans running at them and shouted in alarm john pulled one of the shields aside and slashed at the men it sheltered suddenly the tortoise broke up as the warriors inside realized they had to fight for their lives their pry bars and hammers were better weapons against stone than against soldiers the big heavy shields were more suited to warding off rocks cast from above than attackers at close quarters too one of the slavs swung at george with the iron bar he held in lieu of a sword george got his shield in front of the blow pain shot up his arm all the way to the shoulder he cut at the slav then circled rapidly to his left away from that part of the barbarian the shield protected the slav grunted in alarm and tried to turn with him but the ironfaced shield weighed so much it made him slow and in his desperate urgency he tripped over his own feet and sprawled on the ground bang bang menas silvered hammer came down upon his head had george dropped a pumpkin from the wall to the ground below it would have made a sound like that when it hit blood sprayed the slav writhed then lay still menas hit him again to make sure that he was dead erthank you george said feeling such awkwardness as hed never known at having to be grateful to the noble menas exploded that gratitude as thoroughly as hed ruined the slavs head swinging the hammer he said i wish it had been you george wondered if he could make menas suffer an unfortunate accident out here beyond the wall it would make the nobles wife a widow true but after being married to menas widowhood might look good to her though such thoughts ran through the shoemakers mind he had not the slightest chance to do anything about them nor did menas do anything to him that would have given him an excuse to make the noble suffer that unfortunate accident both of them along with the rest of the militiamen who had sallied from several gates were and stayed busy battling the slavs who had been assaulting the wall of thessalonica some of those slavs fought as fiercely as any men george had ever seen in spite of their makeshift weapons and clumsy shields one of them came within a whisker of caving in his skull with a pry bar only the pointed tip slid across his forehead slicing the skin so that blood kept running down into his left eye that was the last swing the slav ever took georges sword slammed into the side of his neck a moment later the barbarian let out a hoarse gobbling cough blood poured from the wound and from his mouth even as he began to topple george ran past him the shoemaker had been one of the first men out of the postern gate on the sally and hed come as far from it as any of his comrades the farther he went the more slavs he could drive from the wall not all the barbarians stood up against the unexpected roman attack more than a few ran away from the militiamen some dropping their shields to flee the faster bowmen whod stayed up on the wall shot several of them george let out a hoarse cheer every time he saw one fall the slavic archers whod been shooting at the defenders on the wall and at the sally parties kept their distance till mounted avars showed up behind them and started shouting what had to be threats more afraid of their overlords than they were of the romans a regrettably sensible attitude as far as george was concerned the slavs ran toward the militiamen whom they badly outnumbered back rufus shouted they arent banging away at the wall anymore and thats what we wanted come back george would have been delighted to do just that but he and a slav were busy trying to kill each other finally as if by common consent they turned and ran away from each other george was appalled to discover how close other slavs were and how far away all his comrades had got there went paul back through the postern gate there went sabbatius george hadnt noticed him coming out there went john loping along with a bloody sword there went rufus george ran harder not many romans hardly any romansremained outside the wall there went menas the noble turned around and looked out at george he smiled tm the last of us he shouted the very last he slammed the postern gate shut the bar thudded down ix from up on top of the wall people shouted down to the men by the postern gate that somebody hadnt managed to get in those shouts did george no good whatever the gate didnt open again right away and what looked like all the slavs in the world were bearing down on him george turned his face from the wall and ran for his life not quite so many slavs were coming from the southwest and the woods in that direction were fairly close he slashed at a slavic archer as he sprinted the barbarian fell back with a howl of pain george was in among the slavs now no more arrows hissed past him the archers most likely feared hitting their own comrades if they closed with him he was dead and he knew it but he was still swinging that sword and they were armed with nothing better than bows and belt knives that left them unenthusiastic about closing breath sobbing in his throat heart thudding as if it would burst at any moment he got closer and closer to the woods now most of the slavs were behind him which meant they started sending arrows after him once more he remembered they were in the habit of poisoning those arrows and wished he could have kept on forgetting it here was the brush his boots scrunched on dry fallen leaves he groanedhow could he hope to go anywhere without giving himself away with every step he took he wondered if the barbarians had let him get into the woods just to give themselves the pleasure of hunting him down hed watched cats playing with mice let the little creature think it can break free why not especially when its blocked off from its hole sometimes the mouse does get away he panted dodging between tree trunks sometimes the cat ends up with a stupid look on its face most of the time the mouse got eaten he knew it again he did his best not to think about it from right beside him a voice spoke in greek sometimes mouse gets help he had all he could do not to scream he hadnt thought anyone was right beside him some slavs were coming through the woods after himmuch more quietly than he couldbut he turned his head a satyr looked back at him its amber eyes wide and amused its phallus jutting out almost as far as his sword was it the one hed met when he was out hunting that day not long before the slavs and avars came he thought so but couldnt be sure come the satyr said not stay here long he didnt know whether that meant the creature couldnt stay so close to christian thessalonica for long or whether it deemed staying so close to so many slavs unsafe either way george couldnt argue with it the satyr hurried away leaves flew up from under its hooves but it made no noise as it moved noneas far as georges ears could tell it might as well not have been there he blundered along as he always had sounding like a herd of cattle being driven to market over a field of kettledrums or so his racket sounded to himself but however appalling the racket he made the slavs didnt seem able to use it to track him he heard them shouting back behind him some of them peeled off to the left of his true track others to the right both groups by the excitement in their voices thought theyd seize him at any moment meanwhile he got farther and farther away from them realization blossomed youre doing this he said to the satyr yes hush not safe yet on it went silent itself and using the noise george made as a ventriloquist uses his voice throwing it in every direction but that from which it truly came something small and winged peered out at them from the branch of a sapling it made a piping sound that had words buried in it they were not greek words all at once both groups of slavs behind george started moving in the right direction snorting with fear the satyr grabbed for the fairy it flitted into the air those dragonfly wings buzzing the satyr grabbed again and missed again kill this thing it called to george who me the shoemaker said in surprise without much conscious thought he swung his sword at the fairy he started to pray to god to help him but swallowed the words at the last instant the holy name would surely make the satyr flee and maybe god was helping him through the satyr or would be if george let him he felt no resistance when his blade as much by luck as by design passed through the fairys translucent body but a tingle ran up his arm as if lightning had struck close by light flared from the swordblade where the fairy had been wasnothing good the satyr groped for words that thing look tell it ran a hand up and down its erection as if it kept its brains there george wouldnt have been surprised he knew some men who did he gave the satyr the word it wanted it was a spy a spy yes the satyrs smile stretched across its snubnosed face not speak much not need many names for longish time now need again you give before george could answer that the mercurial creature changed the subject you have wine you give wine like before it was the same satyr then no im sorry i have none george hadnt bothered bringing a skin of wine up onto the wall with him what point when hed be going back down again before long and could step into whatever tavern he liked he hadnt expected to go beyond the wall to be trapped outside of thessalonica or to need wine to make a thirsty satyr happy its pointed ears drooped no wine it said as if summer had gone to winter in the space of two words it trudged along with slumped shoulders now for the first time george could faintly hear its hooves moving through the leaves as if the very aura of magic surrounding it was fading he knew how absurd it was to feel guilt at not having done something he couldnt possibly have known he would need to do he felt it anyhow i am sorry he said here hows this when we find a village ill get some for you there he didnt have more than a few folleis in his beltpouch but they ought to serve if they didnt he would trade workshoe repairs for instancefor wine the thought made him feel better it didnt seem to make the satyr happier not find villages the creature said stroking itself again not for a while not find what do you mean george said the hills around thessalonica are full of villages why he paused trying to work out the direction in which theyd gone there should be one over over he started to point then stopped he tried again to get his bearings eyes glowing the satyr looked back at him it looked amused you see now not for a while not find yes george said slowly where are we anyway he didnt know if that was the precise question he wanted to ask but couldnt find a better one as he ran through the woods the ground on which he set his feet and the trees and bushes all around him seemed familiar enough he would have seen their like had he gone out from thessalonica to hunt in quieter more peaceful times their like yes but whether he would have seen precisely these stones those oaks that set of brambles with every step he took he grew more doubtful of that for the life of him he could not tell where he was in relation to the city he couldnt hear the slavs coming after him either at first hed thought that was because he and the satyr had outdistanced them now he didnt think that was all as if picking the thought from his mind the satyr nodded you not in hills you know it said you beyond hills you know it went on quickly reassuringly can go back go back now be hunted to death but can go back mortals go back forth many times it hesitated then not go back forth so much now on account of it could not say the name despite its forced muteness george understood he was in the fairyland that had been receding from this country ever since men began following father son and holy spirit christian men would reckon they could not cross into that world that plane whatever the proper term was without imperiling their souls he supposed he was imperiling his soul who does go back and forth these days he asked men women follow old ways some yet yes the satyr answered up in hills deep in hills where not come yet again the silence implied the new dispensation after a moment the satyr added those others the ones with wolves and such george presumed he meant the powers of the slavs they live in this kind of hills too they share with us a kind of being godthe god george had worshiped all his life presumably either shared a kind of being essence the shoemaker thought the word is essencebut what would a satyr know of theological terms save perhaps for those dealing with fornication and lewdness with the powers of the slavs and avars or else altogether transcended those powers george had always believed the latter now he was less sure the farther he went the stranger things felt the strangeness did not lie in what he could see or hear or in the way the ground pressed his feet through the soles of his shoes with every breath he took though he felt himself farther from thessalonica and that had nothing to do with getting away from the city stink it suddenly occurred to him that mt olympus lay only thirty or forty miles south and west of the christian city in which hed always dwelt did the gods of whom homer sang still live there a few weeks before he would have said no and laughed at the idea now now he wondered hed thought before that the epic poems might give those old gods a sort of halflife even in a christian world but when he asked the satyr it shook its head if up there not come down pretty women no get zeusget me instead it rubbed itself once more smiled lasciviously and rocked its hips forward and back how they laugh and squeal pretty women the great god was gone conquered by god who was greater the homely earthy satyr remained still a part even if a hunted part of the world george knew he wondered how the slavic powers would look after a couple of centuries of struggle against christianity unfortunately he did not have the luxury of waiting around to find out another little wingety thing peeped out at him from behind a bush then let out a highpitched squeak the satyr waved its horselike tail came up in greeting the fairy waved back then flew off deeper into the woods ours the satyr said yes id worked that out thanks george answered as surprised by how much he was taking all this for granted as by anything else on a day he would cheerfully have traded for any other three bad days in his life where are we going exactly to a place the satyr answered which made george wish to boot it in its hairy hind end near a village it amended perhaps sensing his discontent to friends when we get to this place near a village what will we do george asked being of the cast of mind to seek answers as far out ahead of possibly needing them as he could eat the satyr said maybe drink wine village has wine he stared reproachfully at george angry the shoemaker almost cursed the satyr in the name of god that would surely have made the creature flee and as surely would have dropped george back into the mundane woods and lulls around thessalonica he had no chance of getting back into the city on his own not with the slavs and avars stall besieging it finding a village would be a matter of luck finding one the invaders hadnt wrecked would be a matter of much more luck with autumn sliding rapidly toward winter finding food and shelter enough in the woods to make it on his own would be more than a matter of luck it would be a matter of divine intervention he kept on following the satyr then surely coming across it in the woods had been a matter of divine intervention he would have felt easier about that though had he had a better notion of which divinity was intervening whats the name of this village he asked after a while the satyr shrugged the village one of the villages it took a few more steps then added pretty women as far as it was concerned that counted for more than such merely human things as names they came out into a small clearing a rabbit bounded across it flup flup flup little black eyes wide with fear george wished for his bow if you could get close enough to kill a rabbit with a sword you could get close enough to kill it with your bare hands george knew he wasnt that kind of woodsman a rock hissed through the air almost as fast as if flung by a catapult it caught the rabbit in midbound george heard bones shatter the rabbit let out a shrill startled cry it tried to leap again after it thudded to the ground but its hind legs didnt want to work bleeding it dragged itself along with its forepaws clattering hooves in the brush at the edge of the clearing made george tighten his grip on his sword and bring up his shieldhad the avars pursued him even here as the satyr said they might but it was not avars who burst from the screen of bushes george was glad he had his hand clenched on the swordhilt that made it harder for him to cross himself which would have frightened the centaurs away he watched fascinated awed as they came out into the clearing the one that had thrown the rock was a roan male its human torso had thick red hair on the chest while a red beard grew from its cheeks and chin george had never imagined a bald centaur but this one was its companion was smaller slighter darker and so fervently female from the navel up as to make george wish he were part stallion himself the noise the satyr made reminded him that it was part stallion even if to a lesser degree than the two centaurs george wondered whether they had laws against such outofkind couplings if they did the satyr by its reaction cared not a fig for them george kept staring as the centaurs cantered across the field to pick up the rabbit which had stopped moving not all the staring had to do with the way the female centaurs breasts bobbed as it moved either satyrs were rare around thessalonica yes centaurs were more than rare hed thought the swelling power of the lord had long since driven them from the world of men twill be fine cony in a stew of leeks and turnips the male centaur remarked his voice a bass deeper than any mans his greek so archaic george had to think before he could be sure he understood it aye thou hast reason in good sooth the female replied in the same old old dialect that dialect was not the only reason her voice startled the shoemaker for it fell in the same baritone registers as his own all the same he couldnt help wondering whether the biblical prohibitions against bestiality applied to creatures such as these then he had another curious thought not too far distant from the first along with those splendid humanlike breasts the female centaur also had a set of teats at the bottom of its horsy belly when it had a baby or a foal or whatever the right word was where did it nurse george knew what his choice would have been but he reminded himself he wasnt a newborn centaur hunting is so poor these days the female said with a sigh aye for the newcomers do most savagely chase and slay all the small deer they chance to run across leaving but their leavings for us who have since time out of mind made these woods our home the male said george supposed it meant the slavic wolves and other such powers had george been a wolf he wouldnt have cared to run up against the male centaur but a partly supernatural wolf might think different when hed seen the avars so confidently planted on their horses theyd put him in mind of centaurs now seeing the real thing he wondered what the avars would make of them would they be jealous or would they assume the centaurs were meant to be their slaves simply because they hadnt been lucky enough to be born avars that fit in with what hed seen of the fierce nomads from off the distant plains the centaurs had their own measure of that lordly arrogance only after theyd finished with their own business did they deign to notice the satyr and his human companion who is it that cometh with thee ampelus the male asked that thee unlike the one the female had used with the male was patronizing even insulting not intimate a man from the city below not so yes from the city the city where they fight the new people the new things the satyrampelusanswered the city with saints inside that made both centaurs scowl reminding them of the marginal life theyand the centaurled in an ever more christianized world the male dipped its shiny head to george we welcome you to this fastness to which our acquaintance hath brought you know that i am crotus and with me you see my wife nephele george gave his own name then said i didnt know centaurs still roamed these hills they are ours the female said drawing itself up with formidable pride not enough saints hath your city nephele could not speak the names of god or christ any more than the satyr could and had to talk around them to drive us hence altogether nor shall the savage strangers force us to flee however fierce they be they very fierce they very many ampelus said how we stop them the satyr had fewer words and a far less elegant way of speaking than the centaurs but seemed to george to have a better grasp on the way the world outside this backwoods retreat worked crotus said thou satyr art less afflicted than we by the powers we do not name and so hast wider compass of visionthe very thought that had just gone through georges mind but if one deem a difficulty impossible of solution unsolved it shall surely be forevermore nor dost thou reckon our case hopeless i warrant else thou hadst not brought here this mortal this george ampelus shrugged the satyrs erection jounced up and down nepheles reaction might have been amusement or disgust george had no practice reading the sounds centaurs made after a moment ampelus said he give me wine once i save him hoping he maybe give me wine again but he has no wine this time as nothing else had done that made its phallus droop for a moment as well that he have none nephele exclaimed wine for you satyrs is as it is for men a little foolishness a little sleep a little headache and then all in readiness to be done over again not so for us whom the slightest taste of the blood of the grape inflameth to madness wine is sweet ampelus protested wine is good ayefor thee crotus said when the scent of the fermenting vintage wafteth from the villages wherein the men trample the grapes a look of terrible longing filled the centaurs face i needs must hie me off deep into the woods then lest instead i rush forward to guzzle and it fell silent again the day was chilly sudden sweat sprang out on its forehead even so will someone please take me to one of these villages george asked maybe i can find a way to get back into thessalonica if i can get down to the seaside if i can find a boat he didnt think any of that was likely to happen but it was the best his imagination had been able to do satyr and centaurs ignored the request in that disconcerting baritone nephele asked how is it george of thessalonica you have no fear of our kind and neither seek you to compel us to flee your presence with signs against which we may not stand why would i do that george asked in return if the female centaur thought he wasnt afraid that only proved the pagan powers were a long way from omniscient hoping nephele wouldnt notice he was responding to only half the question he went on ampelus saved my life he didnt have to do that i owe him a debt wine the centaur cried jars and jars and jars of wine we stand in need of a better bargain than that crotus said stiffly is no such thing ampelus said but then corrected itself is maybe one but cannot bring jars and jars and jars of pretty women nephele set hands on no not on its hips but the place where the narrowness of that human waist swelled out to meet the equine body that carried it enough of japes and jests and fribbles the female centaur declared giving the satyr a severe look that altogether failed to dismay it when nephele went on it was to george so many of your fellows would raise against us that which we cannot face or deny our existence altogether aye bitterness edged crotus voice and should the denial become universal it becometh also sober truth another reason for our clinging to the peaks and other lands wherein our being is more certain george had never wondered what the growth of christianity looked like from the viewpoint of creatures pushed to the wall by the new faith along with other such abstract questions though that one would have to wait he found a question anything but abstract if you have these weaknesses how do you propose to come down and fight the powers of the slavs and avars we need help nephele spoke unhappily but without hesitation thus your coming is welcome even if ampelus aided it for reasons of his own rather than to promote the general welfare i do what i do ampelus said i like to do what i do the satyr rocked his hips forward and back again aiming that enormous phallus at nephele the female centaur ignored it george wondered whether that sprang from remarkable aplomb or standards of comparison different from those he was used to using what is your craft mortal crotus asked are you by any chance a priest of again the male used a pause to do what it could not that almost made george laugh no he answered im only a shoemaker that sounded as ordinary as any trade possibly could till he realized none of the beings with whom he was talking had any need for what he did he shook his head like a man caught between dream and reality the difference of his new companions feet brought home to him that dream was reality here tis too much to be hoped for that any priest should find our kind fit for aught but exorcisms nephele said so many woods and streams and paths barred to us on account of words from that book it glared at george as if that were his fault in a way he supposed it was he was a christian man his belief gave the priests some part of their power just as lack of belief threatened to doom centaurs and satyrs and other failing creatures of pagan days but he brightened i think i know a priest who would come here he said he wondered what sort of penance bishop eusebius would set father luke for associating with these beings he did not wonder whether father luke would associate with them if it meant saving thessalonica he was sure the priest would come which left the next question how to get him to come of necessity twill be you delivering word he is wanted crotus said saints hem nephele and me and the rest of our land so close it were the end for any of us to venture forth from these hills as hath been previously intimated to you being of ruder substance ampelus and his fellows may fare farther abroad more readily but cannot think to enter into the city where so many are of your opinion mm george rubbed his chin since its surrounded by the slavs and avars i cant think about entering it either can you help me come close enoughmaybe through the hills my land dont usually travel anymore to give me some chance of getting in it may be so the male centaur answered i cannot speak with certainty not here not yet but the thing must be essayed lest all fail new things in woods things in those hills ampelus added fearfully things with wings to spy and see things with teeth and claws to bite and kill you can speak of them cant you george asked the satyr and the two centaurs nodded watching nephele nod was worth the candle even if the females voice was as deep as his refusing to let himself be distracted he went on im surprised you dont want to see those powers win at thessalonica theyre more your kind than now he used silence to indicate god whom he would not name here not so crotus said for their people lack all knowledge of and belief in our kind did they win did they defeat even that which hath reduced us to our present estate they would on the instant then proceed to hunt us to extinction not a slow fading but a quick and bitter end he hath courage to speak on what reboundeth not to his advantage nephele said tempering the compliment a moment later by adding courage or a signal want of good sense how soon can you try to get me back into the city george asked my family he broke off thinking of his family for the first time since menas slammed the postern gate in his face as far as they knew he was probably dead he hoped someone had seen him escape into the woods but even if someone had so what the most reasonable guess was that the slavs would have hunted him down regardless had he been up on the wall watching someone else run that was what he would have believed crotus and nephele looked toward ampelus who could approach thessalonica more closely than they the satyr nervously masturbated itself not be easy it said its rusty voice worried people round the city things in the woods george looked at the sky the sun would soon be down hurrying toward the southwestern horizon on this cold nearwinter day would it be easier by which he meant safer to travel at night no ampelus spoke with great certainly and kneaded its own tumescent flesh to emphasize the point things worser at night eyes glow they see like owls they no realizing the hour made george also realize how worn and hungry he was will you take me to that village then he asked that should be safe i doubt we should reach it ere the suns chariot leaveth the sky crotus said are you fain to pass the night with us george who feareth not that which dwelt in this land long ago and abideth here yet unlike ampelus the male centaur plainly did not want to go anywhere near where men dwelt fear of wine george thought and then or is it lust for wine yes of course thank you the shoemaker bowed to the centaur he did his best to tell himself getting back among men even backwoods pagans who probably didnt know the emperors name was better than passing his time with creatures whom bishop eusebius and almost all his fellow christians back in thessalonica reckoned fit only for exorcism that was the right thing the proper thing to think he couldnt make himself believe it his curiosity was itching too fiercely how many modern men got a chance like this for that matter how many men in ancient days had got a chance like this crotus and nephele went ahead at a pace he could not match ampelus led him through the woods to what might easily have been a hunters encampment it was almost disappointingly prosaic several neat leantos some of them outsized to accommodate centaurs with a fire in the middle a large pot bubbling over it little by little strangenesses surfaced the knife nephele used to cut up the rabbit and add it to the stew was bronze with a bone handle the pot into which the female threw the pieces of meat had a delicate perfection of shape potters these days didnt even attempt and was ornamented with capering satyrs in black on a red background george didnt know how old that made it leo might havebut knew it was very old indeed ampelus walked over to the pot nephele gave the satyr a look that warned it not to steal any stew but that wasnt what it had had in mind it pointed to one of the satyrs the potter had painted then to its own chest me he said proudly for a moment george thought that only an idle boast then he took a closer more careful look the potter had labeled each dancing satyr beside the one at which georges guide had pointed were greek letters amtieo the shoemaker stared at the ancient portrait it was a good likeness another satyr came into the encampment carrying a couple of squirrels by the tail ha stusippus ampelus said here is george this man i tell you i meet yesterday it hadnt been yesterday it had been months before george started to say as much then abruptly closed his mouth here was a creature with a picture from at least as many centuries before the incarnation as had passed since no wonder the recent past blurred together for it friendly mani remember stusippus said the new satyrs features were less manlike than ampelus its erection even larger man with wine i have no wine today george said and stusippus phallus drooped for a moment as ampelus had done at the same sad news give thou me thy meat there nephele said stusippus handed the female the squirrels without making the bawdy comment george had expected nephele still had that knife in hand more centaurs drifted into the camp a couple of femaleslampra and xanthippe their names were brought in baskets of roots while lampras mate husband george didnt know elatus had a dead pig tied onto its back with vines more fires were started more delicious smells rose into the evening air with xanthippe frolicked something george had never imagined a baby centaur again he wondered whether to think of it as a foal or a child he watched fascinated whats it called he asked the young ones mother whose light roan coat and golden human hair and horses tail might have given it the name xanthippe demetrius the female centaur answered its voice was deep as nepheles georges jaw dropped after the saint he said could the pagan creatures have been trying to gain the protection of god whose name they could not say but they knew deities of their own after the great mother goddess xanthippe said severely oh george was relieved and disappointed at the same time how old is it he asked wondering if centaurs grew according to the pattern of horses or men xanthippe shrugged time meant no more to centaurs than it did to satyrs i dont know its voice wasnot indifferent but uninterested a few hundred years oh george said again and said no more would demetrius be ranging these hills a thousand years from now if the slavs and avars werent driven away the youngster wouldnt be otherwise george tried not to think of the thirty or forty years that were the most he could expect to remain on this earth but his soul would exist forever did demetrius have a soul one more thing george did not know and never would he missed bread with his supper and he was used to drinking wine not the clear cold water bubbling up from a spring near the fire other than that the meal was as good as any hed ever eaten with hunger a relish sharper than garlic after everyone had eaten xanthippe chanted pindars second pythian ode to hiero of syracuse george did not understand why it had chosen that particular piece till he realized it spoke of the creation of its race crotus and nephele little demetrius and elatus all got up and danced to the song that had been written ages before georges greatgreatgrandmother was born but anyone of them save perhaps demetrius might have seen pindar the shoemakers shiver had nothing to do with the cold the centaurs and satyrs had drifted fallen leaves in their shelters to serve as beds ampelus and stusippus invited george in with them the three of them crowded their leanto and the satyrs phalluses kept prodding at him as he burrowed into the leaves the pagan greeks he remembered uneasily had found unnatural vice neither unnatural nor a vice and so their powers would not either but the satyrs did not seek to molest him he was glad hed had no wine for them shortly thereafter he was glad to be in bed with the satyrs a gladness that had nothing to do with carnality without them he would have shivered the whole night through with them despite their phalluses and other minor annoyances such as their hooves kicking him in the shins he was warm enough he burrowed into the leaves and slept what a strange dream george said the next morning he rolled over to tell it to irene leaves rustling under him made him open his eyes he was looking into ampelus face morning the satyr said more an announcement than a greeting good day george said wondering if it would be he got to his feet and started brushing leaves off his tunic and out of his hair if the satyrs and centaurs slept like this he wondered why they werent perpetually covered with bits of their mattresses he discovered the answer to that moments later ampelus and stusippus had a bone comb the first thing they did after getting out of their bed was to take turns combing each other free of dried leaves george knew a couple of brushmakers down in thessalonica if they brought their wares up into the hills they might do a good business since he had less hair to fret over than any of his companions and since he also had no one to groom him he decided to make himself useful by stirring up the fire his breath smoked as he built the blaze up again the heat from the new flames was welcome for this we thank you crotus said coming up behind him where george had been warming his hands in front of the fire the male centaur bent forward so it could beat the bare crown of its head brushmaker hatmaker george added to his mental list of artisans who might be useful here among these creatures of an outworn creed what did creatures of an outworn creed do about breakfast at home george was ready to face the day after bread with olive oil and a cup of wine his chances of getting any of those things here in this sylvan encampment didnt look good what he got were sundried apples and apricots washed down with more water from that stream it was cold enough to make his teeth ache but almost as sweet as the fruit the centaurs gave him once hed eaten and drunk he asked shall we go on to one of those villages now if you be so eager to return to your own kind we can dot for you crotus said however wary of villages we may be on account of the temptations of the vintage brewed therein but if you would liefer bring us this holy man of whom you spoke not long ago were it not wiser to seek to return to the town whence you came if you think you can get me back inside thessalonica in spite of the slavs and avars all around im game but i dont see how youll do it especially since you cant come close to the city yourselves crotus frowned in a way george knew a certain amount of intellectual pride at having perplexed the supernatural being in another way he wished the centaur had had an easy answer waiting crotus said we shall do all in our power to aid you the more so as the holy man seemeth to be of the sort the situation requireth that there may be risk in this course both from the newcome powers and from the one against which we cannot standthis we understand we weigh here dangers one against another in no direction standeth none i think youre right about that george said slowly he thought for a little while himself then said all right if you think you can get me down to thessalonica and into the city wed better try it and the sooner the better there i deem you have bitten through the meat straight to the bone the male centaur said my land is but rarely inclined to take quick action the passage of time being of small import to us thus it was that what you follow established itself in our land we feeling no urgency toward expelling it till too late and now we are all but banished ourselves may we prove wise enough to learn from one error and not commit a second of like sort people dont often learn from their mistakes george said if these immortal creatures did they deserved to be reckoned demigods nor satyrs either they being prisoners to their lusts crotus answered we dare hope ourselves the wiser we are no longer winebibbers having learnt from sore experience how such enrageth us they could have stood around for the next several days talking about the ramifications of moving and not moving george realized crotus would talk about ramifications for the next several days and not notice the flowing time harshly the shoemaker said lets get moving then if were ever going to i cry huzzah for mortal celerity crotus said on to thessalonica it went back to the leanto it shared with nephele and talked with its mate for a while then with the rest of the centaurs and at last with the satyrs who seemed to require less in the way of instruction and debate than its own kind however much it tried to hurry more than an hour went by before george all the centaurs even little demetrius and the satyrs started down from the hills toward the city in purely physical terms going down was easier than coming up had been but purely physical terms were far from the only ones that mattered for one thing george was not entirely certain he remained in the hills he knew for another after a while he began to feel as if every step he took required a distinct effort of will when he remarked on that nephele tossed its head and replied in that disconcerting baritone tis but a cantrip of the barbarians circling round the city and hardly one of potency overwhelming its sniff declared the slavs and avars should have done better the spells potency might not have been overwhelming to the female centaur but it was of different substance from george who found the going ever harder and then suddenly he had no trouble at all setting one foot in front of the other and went along as ready as he might have done on the street outside his shop in the city thats better he said only when the words were out of his mouth did he notice that his companions had stopped as if theyd walked into thessalonicas wall after a moment ampelus and stusippus gathered themselves and came toward him the centaurs needed longer than the satyrs and advanced as if pushing their way through glue not air whats wrong george asked did that cursed avar priest make the spell stronger hes not to be taken lightly that one the barbarian crotus had to fight to get the words out one by one nay that was naught of his doing meseems you are prayed for inside the city toward which we fare george thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand of course he was prayed for back in thessalonica his wife and children would be in st elias nowif they werent in st demetrius his friends would be in one church or another too if they werent up on the wall and their prayers had succeeded in weakening the spells the slavs and avars had been using to keep him from approaching thessalonica the only trouble with that was the prayers also seemed to have weakened the supernatural beings aiding him that wasnt good he had doubts about being able to get down from the lulls with the centaurs and satyrs helping him without them he had no doubts he wouldnt make it he saw how vulnerable they were to the power of god as a christian that made him proud as someone trying to save his own neck it worried him if he was going to keep on being proud he hoped hed soon be able to start worrying less the weakness passeth xanthippe said after a bit tossing its head in an impatient gesture a horse without human excrescences might have made the petition methinks was not aimed straight against us else the hurt had been greater gaining strength with her the other centaurs also came on down the game tracks they went with the satyrs and george he was thoughtful and quiet the prayer had surely been aimed at the slavs and avars it had weakened their spell to be sure but he doubted it had done them the harm it had his companions that meant those companions were weaker than the powers of the slavs and avars hed known as much but didnt care to be reminded of it little by little the shock of gods power wore away the satyrs took to playing with themselves again that amused demetrius the immature centaur who having seen such things for only a few centuries still found them funny george didnt laugh he took the masturbation as a sign the satyrs remained alarmed even if at the slavs and avars not at the lord smiling like a good dog the first wolf stepped out from between two trees half a bowshot in front of george it was obviously no ordinary wolf it was bigger than a wolf had any business being its teeth were longer and sharper its very stance fiercer and more alert than an ordinary wolfs could have been ampelus who had been walking alongside of george sprang nimbly back with a gasp of fright the shoemaker gasped too and made the sign of the cross hed already done it before he remembered the company he was keeping but the satyr had said hed watched a christian priest make the holy sign when confronted by a slavic wolfdemon it hadnt been aimed at ampelus and so had had no effect on him nor did the satyrs and centaurs flee george now but the sign of the cross though it made the wolf draw back a pace and turned that doglike smile into a snarl did not rout it george remembered that the wolf the priest had met had killed him in short order he yanked out his sword this wolf would not have such an easy time he had more defenses than the spiritual alone the wolf snarled again as if angry at itself for yielding even slightly to the strength of the christian sign then it sprang for him he raised his shield if the wolf knocks me down he thought i have to keep the shield between those teeth and my throat maybe ill be able to stab it before it bites too many chunks out of me from behind him a rock flew through the air and caught the wolfdemon on the tip of its nose its agonized yelp was sweet music in george s ears it skidded to a stop and stared past him to the centaurs as if it had never imagined they would do such a thing to it another stone hit it this one in the chest it staggered threw back its head and loosed one of those horrifying howls george had heard corning out of the forest from the walls of thessalonica the shoemaker crossed himself again growling deep in its throat the wolf retreated a few paces perhaps because it was hurt the sign of the cross had more power over it than had been true a moment before it howled again this time more in pain than to cause fear among its foes george took a step toward it and it drew back once more move aside that we may pelt the creature according to its deserts crotus called i dont care about its pelt george heard himself answer his mouth ran wild and free disconnected from such wits as he had besides this is my fight too he advanced on the wolf which backed away from him but now other howls rose in answer to those the creature had loosed other wolves came out of the woods to stand with the first and still others made leaves rustle in the forest to either side of the path such creatures could surely have traveled silent as a thought had they so chosen but they must have wanted george and his companions to know they were there so as to put them in fear george stared now this way now that he and the satyrs and centaurs were outflanked we have to go back george shouted ampelus and stusippus scampered away toward the encampment from which theyd set out that morning all the centaurs though stared at george with blank incomprehension that look told him more clearly than anything else could have why even the pagans of ancient greece without the power of god behind them had been able to drive the powerful creatures deep into the hill country the very notion of retreat seemed alien to them however necessary it might be only when wolves burst out at them from left and right at the same time did the centaurs suddenly seem to catch on to what george had meant he hoped that wasnt so late it would get them all lolledand him with them a wolf sprang at xanthippes flank the female centaur whirled startlingly quick and kicked out with its hind legs the hooves slammed into the wolf s snout it rolled away yowling in pain blood spurting from its wounds any natural creature any creature of flesh and blood would have had its head caved in demetrius let out a sound halfscream halfwhinny as a wolf raked the youngbut not so youngcentaurs side with its teeth the wolf rammed the centaur overbore it and came darting back to tear out its throat shouting george ran to thecoltsaid the first swipe of his sword lopped off a couple of digits worth of the wolf s tail that got its attention it whirled away from demetrius and toward george the end with the teeth looked much more dangerous than the end with the tail the wolfdemon leaped straight for his face he got his shield uprufus would have been proud of himand cut at the creature he felt his blade bite into its side but it didnt seem to mind in the least it hit him like a boulder try as he would to keep his feet he went over backwards he did all the things hed reminded himself to do when the first wolfdemon had been about to attack him he kept his shield up the wolf s fangs scraped on the leather facing he kept slashing with his sword none of that would have mattered very long the wolf was immensely stronger than he and his sword seemed unable to do it much harm but then just as it was scrabbling with paws unnaturally clever to pull down the shield so its teeth could do their deadly work thud thudtwo stones struck it blows hard enough to make it roll off him and away if those stones hadnt broken ribs the wolf owned none george scrambled to his feet elatus grabbed the wolf with human arms and hands lifted it off the ground in an amazing display of strength and then threw it down hard the male centaur trampled the wolfdemon with both pairs of equine hooves the wolf howled and twisted and then clamped its jaws on elatus left hindmost leg the centaur cried out in anguish as george rushed to its aid he stabbed the wolfdemon in the belly with his sword it screamed supernatural or not it was sorely hurt its blood smelled hot and metallic and almost spicy an odor much stronger and more distinctive than that of the blood of ordinary living things elatus was bleeding too that did not keep the centaur from flailing away with its three good horses legs at the wolfdemon which finally broke away and fled not just from the male centaur but from the right as a whole we cant go forward george said there are still too many of them we have to go back a truth may be bitter but a truth naytheless elatus said the male dipped its shaggy head to george and i own myself in your debt mortal that was bravely done it twisted so it could look at its wounded leg scabs were already forming over the bites in a day or two george supposed elatus would be altogether healed and in a day or two the wolfdemon the shoemaker had stabbed would probably be well again too he sighed had he been a proper hero out of myth he would have slain it elatus shouted a great sound without words george could discern but one that must have had meaning to the other centaurs they began to retreat down the path ampelus and stusippus had taken george went with them the wolves made as if to pursue but gave up when the centaurs having opened a little distance from them bombarded them with showers of stones none of the centaurs had escaped without wounds but all of them were well on the way toward healing by the time they got back to the encampment from which theyd set out george counted himself lucky to have got away with nothing worse than cuts and scrapes and bruises no sharp teeth had pierced his tender flesh he ached and stung as things were being in the company of the supernatural beings did not make him so close to immune to hurt as they were manifest it is crotus said scratching what had been a bite and was now a rough red scar that these folk and their powers desire not your return to the city whenee you were abstracted i didnt want to be abstracted from it george said when he thought of menas his hands bunched into fists i didnt get what i wanted i dont see any reason the slavs and avars should get what they want one reason doth suggest itself nephele observed namely and to wit that they have the power to enforce that which they desire ampelus came up to george all the centaurs glared at the satyr who had been of such little use in the fight against the wolfdemons sensitive to that scorn ampelus spoke with something like embarrassment not good to go in day maybe good to go in night george clapped a hand to his forehead when i wanted to do that everyone said it would be worse than trying it in the daytime what can be worse than that the satyr asked reasonably try in day not go try in night likely not go but maybe go george could see one way in which things might be worse hed come out of this try alive even if unsuccessful if things went wrong again he wondered what was happening back at thessalonica the sally from inside the city had driven back the slavs undermining the walls beneath the shelter of their tortoises but had the barbarians attacked again had the avar priest or wizard found yet another set of demigods to hurl against the protective power that came from st demetrius and from god and on those questions depended the answer to the truly important one how were irene and theodore and sophia wed better try and get back any way we possibly can george said if it cant be by day it will have to be by night the children of israel had traveled by night as well as by day he reminded himself with a pillar of fire to light their way as they went he did not expect god to give him a pillar of fire thinking of the children of israel made him think of benjamin the jew and thinking of benjamin made him think of dactylius and rufus and john and drunken sabbatius and claudia and paul and the rest of his friends back in thessalonica he also thought again of menas back in thessalonica as they had before his hands formed fists without menas he wouldnt have been in this predicament rich though menas was noble though menas was george resolved he would have his revenge one more reason to go back he thought daylight hours were short at this season of the year time seemed to crawl by anyhow the satyrs went out hunting and came back with rabbits and roots and herbs they presented these to the centaurs as what george took to be a peaceoffering nephele looked as if she wanted to fling the food in stusippus face but if the female did that everyone would go hungry into the pot everything went george had seen the day before that centaurs had appetites in keeping with their size he got only a few mouthfuls of stew and a bit more dried fruit to go with it after two days straight of fighting for his life that didnt feel like enough his stomach made noises that might have come from the throat of a slavic wolfdemon when darkness finally came the shoemaker shivered part of that he was not ashamed to admit to himself was fear part too was cold his teeth had chattered up on the wall when hed drawn night duty being out in the woods was worse he would have welcomed the company of a couple of rampantly erect satyrs in a bed of leavesthey would have helped keep him warm instead having bolted his meager meal he slipped out of the encampment with ampelus none of the centaurs accompanied them for crotus said as they were leaving strength having faded stealth needs must serve there the lustful ones surpass us they being every inclined to sneak up on mortal women and so debauch themselves the males lip curled in scorn mayhap their skulking habits shall this once prove of advantage to us huh ampelus said he not so smart as he think he is one of these days i climb up on rock back of nephele show that mare what loving can be the satyrs hips twitched in lewd anticipation george noted however that for all of ampelus bravado it made sure it was well out of earshot of the encampment before making a boast like that they walked quietly through the woods down toward thessalonica all george heard were their footfalls scuffing through fallen leaves or rather all he heard were his own footfalls scuffing through fallen leaves ampelus paced along beside him silent as a shadow no insects chirped too late in the year no nightjars called no owls hooted barebranched trees raised their boughs to the sky as if surrendering to robbers those boughs passed black in front of the nearly full moon that poured pale radiance over the hillside normally george would have been delighted to have all the light he could if he was crazy enough to go through the forest at night now now he said wont the moon make it easier for the wolves and whatever else is out there to find us easier yes the satyr played with itself for a little while as it did whenever it was worried but they not need much light to see maybe they not need to see at all maybe they know what will you do if they know george pronounced the word as portentously as ampelus had done run away again this the satyr gripped its swollen phallus with both hands this is no sword cant kick like donkey like stupid centaurs do can maybe throw rocks maybe what good in fight i made to be lover that hiprocking motion again not fighter well even so george began admitting to himself if not to the satyr that it had a point ampelus cut him off shut up mortal george or see how mortal you be not get through by fighting anyhow get through by sneaking sneaking you be quiet the satyr had another point there even if it had been doing more talking than george the shoemaker trudged along most of the time he and ampelus headed downhill toward their goal pushing through the spell of resistance the slavs and avars had established against such ventures every so often they climbed rises lying athwart their path ampelus judging that quicker than walking around from one of those bits of higher ground george caught a glimpse of thessalonica lamps and torches bravely burning inside the wall the city hadnt fallen then relief made him feel as if hed walked fewer miles on more food than was really so that remained true despite his also having seen the campfires of the slavs and avars around the besieged city he hadnt expected the barbarians to have cleared out since he was locked away from thessalonica as long as they were outside the wall not within it something might yet be done ampelus suddenly grabbed georges arm and pulled him to one side ever so carefully skirting what looked to the shoemaker like a stretch of ground no different from any other whats wrong george whispered did you see a wolf worse the satyr answered with a fearful shudder saint do something holy there who knows when ground hurt to go on st demetrius george asked ampelus turned to stare at him the satyrs eyes flashed the light george thought was their own not reflected moonlight who cares st who the creature burst out is saint is holyfied ground is hurt we go different way if we did go through the hallowed ground george said thoughtfully we would be doing something the slavs and avars and their powers dont expect it might gain us an edge i do not go through holyfied ground ampelus insisted hurt me too much and like i tell you i watch wolf eat one of your priests wolf not care about ground like i do that was true it was also depressing and standing around in the woods arguing did not strike george as a good idea standing around in the woods for any reason did not strike george as a good idea being in the woods did not strike him as a good idea but when all the other ideas looked worse all the other ideas looking worse did not make this a good one of that the shoemaker was convinced he and the satyr pressed on toward thessalonica how they were going to get through the encirclement the slavs and avars had round the city bulked larger and larger in his mind he had at the moment no idea he decided to worry about it when the time came he had plenty of other things to worry about till the time came an old man stepped out into the path ahead of george and ampelus his long beard and bushy eyebrows were green and glowed brighter than ampelus eyes had flashed well george said its a good bet hes not a wandering peasant isnt it he drew his sword i am vucji pastir the old man said his voice sounding in georges mind rather than his ears the shepherd of the wolves his eyes which shone almost as brightly as his beard and eyebrows seemed ready to pop from his head though he stood in the moonlight he cast no shadow i am a good christian man george said begone evil spirit he made the sign of the cross that had pained the wolfdemon at the start of the daylight fight even if it hadnt routed the creature vucji pastir smiled when he did he showed his teeth which were as sharp and pointed as any wolf s the holy sign did him no harm he raised his right hand off in the distance howling rose my sheep they come for you he said george was not inclined to wait for them he rushed at the shepherd of the wolves slashing as he came his blade shortened the slavic demigods beard by several inches the severed hairs glowed as brightly as they had while still attached to their master vucji pastir bellowed in surprise and anger andfear he vanished leaving behind the results of georges impromptu barbering bravely did ampelus cried now we can get away no george said now we can go on he snatched up the tuft of shining green hairs and now we have a holy relicno an unholy relic i supposeof our own if that ugly thing is the shepherd of the wolves they should pay attention to his beard yeswhen they eat you they not eat the beard the satyr said gloomily but it went on with george instead of turning back as it plainly would rather have done they had not gone far before a wolfdemon snarled at them instead of slashing at it with his sword george thrust the fragment of vucji pastir s beard in its face it let out a startled yip then a doglike yelp of greeting having the bit of beard in his possession made george a shepherd of wolves in his own right see i told you so he said to ampelusa privilege he would not have taken with irene butgod be praisedhe wasnt married to the satyr the wolfdemon rolled onto its belly then placed itself at georges left heel exactly as a welltrained dog would have done if it was going for a walk in the moonlight the shoemaker grinned at ampelus come onweve got our own escort warily the satyr moved closer to the wolf the wolf accepted ampelus as a friend of georges strange business the satyr said and stroked itself for reassurance they had not gone far before another fierce wolfdemon tried to bar their way before george could thrust his fluffy talisman at it the first wolf the one hed tamed with vucji pastirs whiskers snarledbut at the newcomer not at him the second wolfdemon whined appeasingly and fell into place beside the one that had warned it maybe ill have the whole pack of them by the time we get to thessalonica george said gaily ampelus didnt answer but he didnt run away or masturbate either which meant he was happy enough and then without warning vucji pastir reappeared right beside george the wolves stared at the slavic demigod and the shoemaker as if realizing they might have made a mistake vucji pastir snatched back the bit of beard george had trimmed from him he set it against the rest of his green whiskers it grew fast to them almost at once mine he said and disappeared again george thought he was a dead man by the way ampelus moaned the satyr expected the wolves to tear them to pieces in the next instant too but they didnt some small part of vucji pastirs glamour still clung to george the wolves however did whine and growl when he tried to go forward when he turned around and started uphill the way he had come they were silent i think he said carefully wed better head back see ampelus said i told you so youll make someone a fine wife one day george snapped the satyr laughed at him he looked over his shoulder the wolves were not tagging along at his heels as they had before that made him more glad than otherwise sooner or later they were going to figure out that hed duped them he didnt want them anywhere near his heels then as things happened hed put most of a mile between himself and the wolves before a furious howling broke out at his back they didnt catch up with him and ampelus before the two of them had returned to the encampment from which theyd set out nor did they prove willing to attack the centaurs there after more hideous howls they went away i cant go to thessalonica in the daytime george muttered and i cant go at night either what does that leave he didnt think it left anything but there had to be a way into the city nohe wanted a way into the city there was unfortunately all too often a difference between what he wanted and what there was x a satyr named ithys whom george hadnt met before came into the camp the next morning where the satyrs and centaurs there moped ithys bounced and sparkled tell me why ampelus said scowling or i throw something at you i tell you why ithys leaped in the air from sheer high spirits find woman in villagelete give her all my loving all my loving i give to her he leaped again like a happy billy goat that instantly raised the satyrs spirits and their phalluses though the centaurs stayed glum tell me tell me stusippus exclaimed i want to tell you ithys said yesterday i see tell me what you see stusippus broke in i try i try i tell the word logos in greek could mean almost anything connected with speech and thought if you not interrupting you wait otherwise i looking through you ithys stood on its dignity which was even more absurd than a dog standing on its hind legs first i just see a face then what this time stusippus and ampelus interrupted together i get you i think i wave to her what ithys waved was not a hand she want me the satyr preened i see her standing there she set down her washering she leaving home her home she not want to do it in road but come out into trees love me i say do please please me she no ask me why she hold me tight we do and do and do ithys panted at the memory ampelus and stusippus panted too not a second time not a third not a fourth not a fifth ithys boasted she never say you cant do that like women sometimes do when she finally have to go any time at all she say she say i need you ill be back yes yes yes ampelus and stusippus both sighed jealousy and admiration perfectly mixed nice someone happy ampelus said stusippus nodded why all so gloomish here ithys asked all you need is love the word the satyr used was related to love anyhow need something different ampelus answered and went on to explain what george was doing in the camp and how the shoemaker and the satyrs and centaurs had tried and failed to reach thessalonica ithys stayed cheerful you not know lovely lete well no you come in i show you this too maybe even show you maid the second part of the offer raised the satyrs interest the first part made the centaurs pay attention at last what meanest thou nephele demanded the satyr talked for some time if not explicit it was interesting finally it said you come with me i show it started off presumably toward the village george crotus and nephele and the two other satyrs followed lete as far as george was concerned might as well have been called lethe or forgetfulness till he walked down its narrow muddy twisting main street he would not have believed any such hamlet still existed in the roman empire in these modern enlightened times he had known paganism still survived in the hills above thessalonica he had always taken that to mean though that in some of those isolated villages pagans still lived side by side with their christian neighbors but he might well have been the first christian ever to set foot in lete that he walked into the village with ithys and ampelus and stusippus with crotus and nephele argued that he was had christians dwelt in lete their crosses and relics and icons would have forced the satyrs and centaurs to stay away the villagers stared at the centaurs but only in surprise not in superstitious dread they took the satyrs utterly for granted nodding and waving to them and calling greetings to ithys who was evidently a frequent visitor oh a couple of matrons hustled young daughters presumably maidens off the streets when ampelus and ithys strolled by fondling themselves but that was the sort of motherly precaution irene would have taken with sophia had they dwelt here rather than down in the city george got a much more careful scrutiny than satyrs or centaurs the people of lete were familiar with his companions he was a stranger and therefore an object of suspicion till proved otherwise he wondered what bishop eusebius would have made of a place like this the short answer he thought was hash he understood why the good and holy bishop of thessalonica left lete alone the good and holy bishop undoubtedly hadnt the slightest idea the village existed ithys leading the way had found it without trouble but george doubted whether he himself could have come back unaided folds in the hills hid a good many villages but none so well as this one what can they have here he asked crotus means for your ingress into thessalonica an we be fortunate and the cockproud satyr speak sooth the male centaur answered that was more of a response than any george had dragged out of the creature till now what sort of means he demanded i know not not with certainty crotus said i had not thought such means yet lay under the sun if you dont know what and you dont know whether what in he almost said gods holy name which would have forced his companions to flight do you know i know we have hitherto failed which doth vex me as it doth you in no small measure crotus said george walked along fuming the male made no more sense than if it had suddenly started speaking slavic seeing his anger and confusion ampelus said all sorts old things here old things strong things strong things but not strong enough out there that didnt make any sense either and then after a moment it did or maybe it did christianity was too strong for the old paganism of greece as the old faith and old powers fell back naturally they would bring their talismans with them could winged slippers fly without a god in them or maybe the satyr meant something else altogether george would find out in the midst of strangeness one thing was familiar the grapevine painted outside a budding near the center of the village george said shall we go in and have some wine ampelus and the other satyrs nodded as their heads happily bobbed up and down so did their phalluses but crotus and nephele drew back in something like horror this is why we come not into villages nephele said did you not hear foolish mortal that wine doth madden and enrage us that deep voice coming from such a lushly female form never failed to disconcert george at the moment his own embarrassment disconcerted him more im sorry he mumbled i forgot fortunate it is that the folk of lete have memories better trained to retention crotus said they know better than to serve us of the drink that inflameth us and that by its sweet savor tempteth us to inflammation the males left forehoof took a quarter of a step toward the tavern when it noticed it stood very still indeed i want wine ampelus said wait george told the satyr pouting it obeyed george spoke to satyrs and centaurs both who here is best able to tell us how we can use whatever is in this village against the slavs and avars the taverner ampelus exclaimed crotus and nephele both loomed over the satyr enough of this japery and nonsense the male centaur rambled it is gorgonius the carpenter ithys said he has thisthing i pray he hath a tongue that scoffeth not nephele said lead on ithys led george followed not without a regretful glance at the wineshop as they passed it he also came with a certain amount of relief that menas had locked him and not sabbatius out of thessalonica sabbatius would have headed for the wineshop regardless of what that might do to the centaurs along with the pleasant smells of newcut wood and sawdust gorgonius establishment smelled of leather an odor with which george was intimately familiar and which made him wish he were back in his own city the carpenter was repairing the webbing of a bedframe when george and his companions came in good day friend ithys said good day good day gorgonius answered with a broad smile that grew broader when he saw the centaurs a good day indeed he exclaimed welcome welcome thrice welcome your kind but seldom honors us wine crotus said we fear it aye aye gorgonius nodded he was near or past his threescore and ten his hair and beard were the silvery white that seems to shine even indoors and his voice sounded a little mushy because he had only a few teeth left in his head but his eyes were still sharp and nothing was wrong with his wits satyrs and centaurs together eh centaurs here in lete at all eh something is curious sure as sure and whos this fellow you have with you george cometh out of thessalonica nephele said sounding portentous in lieu of identifying him as a christian which the centaur could not do is that so gorgonius said is that so isnt that interesting what are you doing here george out of thessalonica trying to stay alive george did his best to put things in order from most immediately urgent to longterm goals trying to keep the slavs and avars from sacking my city and murdering my family trying to drive them away from here for good that wont be bad if you can do it the old carpenter said nodding these new people and their new powers i dont fancy em a bit not a bit they change things around till they arent the way they used to be so how do you propose to go about it i know a priest a man who believes as i do george picked his words with care trying to convey to gorgonius what he meant without naming names that would drive off ampelus and ithys and stusippus crotus and nephele put his power together with the powers that still live in these hills he pointed to centaurs and satyrs and we ought to be able to beat the barbarians a priest eh one of your land of priests gorgonius might not have been a christian might hardly have seen any christians but he had a good notion of how christian priests most christian priests thought wouldnt he sooner exorcise our friends hereisnt that what they call itthan work alongside em i dont think so george answered hesdifferent from most priests and hes doing penance because of it the shoemaker thought he didnt mention that to gorgonius well maybe so maybe so it would surprise me but maybe so gorgonius pointed down toward thessalonica what are you doing here in lete instead of there i cant get back to the city george said the slavs and avars and their powers are between here and there the band of centaurs and satyrs tried to get me through yesterday during the day and ampelus and i tried to sneak through last night didnt work either way wolves ampelus added ah those yes ive seen those nasty things arent they absentmindedly gorgonius began stropping a knife on one of the leather straps that would support the mattress well well what am i supposed to be able to do to help you i havent the faintest idea george answered ithys thought coming to you was a good idea all i can do is hope it was right the carpenter didnt say anything to that he silently studied george for a while then turned his gaze on ithys the satyr said you are gorgonius you know of what clan you spring and why you have that name i knew the man who founded your clan you in the later days of your life look like him in the later days of his i say this to you before yes and every time youve said it ive told you what daft nonsense it is gorgonius said he was a hero i make tables he killed monsters and rescued maidens i got a cat out of a tree once if that counts for anything and i stepped on a cockroach the other day the satyr hath reason nephele said your foresire had wit and wisdom and knew both how to give and how to receive good counsel than which few things are rarer among mankind wait a minute george said everyone aging carpenter and ageless immortal creatures alike looked at him wait just a minute everyone did indeed seem willing enough to wait hesitantly wondering whether hed heard what he thought hed heard and whether he ought to believe it if he had he pointed to gorgonius he didnt speak to the carpenter though but to ithys and to nephele youre saying hes from perseus family aye in good sooth we are nephele said we knew perseus perseus was our friend doth surprise you this mayfly man a bit george said trying not to show how much more than a bit it surprised him he remembered thinking when hed first met ampelus how the satyr had been up in these hills when paul was writing to the thessalonicans and for hundreds of years before that he hadnt realized how many hundreds of years though he didnt know how long ago perseus had lived but it was back before the trojan war which was by definition antiquity immeasurableexcept that ithys and nephele measured it we have reckoned his descendants even unto the hundred and fifteenth generation nephele said measuring antiquity most precisely indeed that and a few folleis will get you some winewell not you but the man here said gorgonius who seemed unimpressed with his illustrious ancestor but now i understand why ithys brought you to me george george made the sort of intuitive leap that had given him a reputation for cleverness in thessalonicaamong those who cared whether a shoemaker was clever at any rate he stabbed out a finger at gorgonius youve got medusas head stowed away here somewhere dont you so we can turn the slavs and avars to stone with it are you out of your bloody mind gorgonius exclaimed if the family had kept that horrible thing theyd have been turned to stone themselves some of em anyhow and i wouldnt be standing here talking with you the whole village would be stone too and we could fortify it with our cousins and uncles daft he shook his head oh george said in a very small voice when a clever man was stupid he was stupid in a way a man who was stupid all the time could never hope to match for the clever mans stupidity drawing as it did on so much more knowledge had a breadth and depth to it the runofthemill fool found impossible to duplicate gorgonius took pity on him what i do have pal he said is the cap perseus wore when he got up close to medusa and her sisters for a moment that cap meant nothing more to george than that it was the pagan equivalent of say a saints shinbone in a reliquary in a church but a saints shinbone might work miracles and so might this cap the gorgons couldnt see perseus when he came up to them george said thats right gorgonius said encouragingly as if george might not be an idiot after all very good does it still work the shoemaker asked perseus wore it a long time ago it works gorgonius leer rivaled anything ampelus could produce ive seen more pretty girls and more of em than youll ever dream about pal even if you live in that big city oh it works all right nephele let out a noise half giggle half horsy snort the satyrs interest in the conversation which had been small visibly swelled george was all at once convinced gorgonius was telling the truth he didnt know whether to be awed or appalled that gorgonius had figured out a use for the cap so far removed from that originally intended for it after a moment though he doubted the old carpenter was the one who had only just begun that use a lot of mens lives lay between perseus and gorgonius surely one of the carpenters multiple greatgrandsires had had that same inspiration probably a good many of them had had it gorgonius walked out of the room in which theyd been talking instead of having his living quarters above his shop as george did gorgonius lived behind his workroom lete was less crowded than thessalonica and so far as george could recall had no buildings taller than one story when gorgonius didnt come back right away crotus rumbled whither is the fellow gone and for what purpose an i be not much mistaken he hath not gone or rather he is returned among us nephele answered gorgonius said see what a clever lady you are his voice came from a point halfway between george and nephele his voice was there but he wasntnot so far as the eye could tell at any rate then he lifted a nondescript leather cap from his head and abruptly became visible once more you see he said and george did see then he put the cap on again and george saw no more he was tempted to cross himself to learn whether the power of the holy sign was stronger than that of the cap which had befooled medusa and her sisters in ancient days and evidently other more attractive females since he held his hand still the holy sign might destroy all the power the cap contained it would surely rout the centaurs and satyrs who had done so much to help him come back to our eyes gorgonius nephele said come back that we may all take counsel together each judging the probity of the others by examining their countenances all right between speaking one word and the next gorgonius reappeared youre saying you want me to let this fellow he pointed to george borrow my cap here whos to say ill ever see it again you cant see it now half the time george pointed out thats true the carpenter said aye thats true he smiled at george who thought hed won a point but even if he had a point was not the game gorgonius said why should i risk something thats been in the family for so long to help a stack of people who have no use for it dont believe its any good and would destroy it if they could he sent the question toward nephele but the female crotus and the satyrs looked with one accord at george why he said i can give you only one answer whatever you think of the folk of thessalonica having the slavs and avars sack the city would be worsefor us and for you too in the old days gorgonius said meditatively i could have gone down into thessalonica and so could they he nodded toward the centaurs and satyrs oh crotus and nephele might not have wanted to on account of the wine but they could have now though one of those priestsd be on me like a fox on a rabbit and my friends they cant go at all not with all the saints and such whove been through there one time or another is that better than not having any thessalonica at all i wonder george i do wonder they think so george answered now he nodded at ithys and ampelus and stusippus at crotus and nephele they wouldnt have brought me here if they didnt and theyve seen more of the slavs and avars than you have you think so do you gorgonius touched the cap that had come down from perseus with this i can see what i like i told you that already he clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth i didnt much like what i saw i will say that but to save arrogant thessalonica with something the towns too proud to believe in it gravels me that it does if i get down there if i can get into the city ill be bringing back a priest dont forget george said the old powers cant fight the slavs and avars and their gods and demons not alone we know that what i believe in he had to keep coming up with circumlocutions for christianity may not be strong enough by itself either together we can hope anyway hope came out of the box last of all gorgonius said he made that clicking noise again and stood very still taking his own time to make up his mind when crotus started to say something the carpenter tossed his head in negation ive heard all i want the centaur did not try to speak again the satyrs masturbated nervously outside far off in the distance a wolf howled but it was not an ordinary wolf george had grown too well acquainted with the horrible howls of the slavic wolfdemons to mistake them for anything but what they were very slightly nephele shuddered maybe that howl helped gorgonius decide maybe concentrating as he was he didnt even hear it but he came out of his brown study only moments after its last echoes had died away holding out the cap to george he growled youd better bring this back or ill be angry at you if i dont bring it back the shoemaker answered odds are ill be too dead to care the first thing george discovered about being invisible was that he wasnt invisible to himself that came as something of a relief not being the most graceful man ever born he had trouble planting his feet even when he could see exactly where he was putting them had he not known where they were going his best guess was that he would have broken his leg or maybe his neck long before he got close to thessalonica the next thing he discovered was that when he was invisible people didnt notice him that made perfect logical sense of courseit was why he needed perseus cap in the first place it brought problems too though problems he hadnt expected as he walked up and down letes narrow streets people didnt get out of the way for him why should they have done so they had no idea he was there all the dodging was up to him once he had to say excuse me out of thin air which startled the man whod collided with him something else occurred to him after he bumped into the villager he asked gorgonius about it when he got back to the carpenters place took me years to wonder about that gorgonius said but seeing what youre going to be doing i can understand how it would be on your mind best i can tell dogs dont take my scent when i have the cap on and nobody and nothing hears you unless you speak out loud oh good george said by everything ive heard wolves use their noses more than their eyes but if dogs dont notice your odor im going to hope the wolfdemons wont notice mine i dont know anything about demons gorgonius said if their power is strong enough they might be able to beat the strength in the cap the power inhering in them is not to be despised nephele said george didnt despise the wolfdemons or any of the other powers the slavs and avars controlledif the control didnt run in the other direction they frightened him out of his wits i dont see that i have much choice he said this cap is my best chanceprobably my only chanceto get back to thessalonica im going to use it ill be back here with father luke two or three days after i set outi hope may fortune favor you nephele said she spoke of fortune as a power in its own right as a christian george knew he wasnt supposed to think of it that way as a man who sat down with some friends to roll dice every now and then he couldnt help thinking of it so he slept in the straw in gorgonius bam that night it made a better bed than the one of dry leaves hed shared with ampelus and stusippus and not only because he didnt have a couple of satyrs in it with him when he woke up he didnt look like a young forest anymore he wasnt covered with leaves being covered with straw instead he looked like a young unmowed field instead gorgonius gave him a slab of bread and a stoppered jug that almost surely contained wine nephele and crotus both made an elaborate pretense of not looking at it though they turned their heads away their eyes had minds of their own and kept sliding back toward the jug the satyrs more than humanly fond of wine made no bones about watching the jar as soon as george could see his feet and the path they would take he left lete his breath smoked in the chilly air he told himself firmly that he would presume no one but he could see it had the truth been otherwise gorgonius would have mentioned it wouldnt he george knew the direction in which hed have to go hed traveled part of that road already he wished hed been able to travel all of it then he wouldnt have had to involve himself with such potent pagan powers as perseus cap even if he was less devout than many in thessalonica he did believe well he murmured if eusebius wants to impose a penance on me after all this is over ill observe it i just want this to be all over he hadnt been walking for more than half an hour before he spotted xanthippe and demetrius out on a meadow the female centaur and the young one young enough perhaps not to have been in a position to know st paul when hed traveled through this land more than five centuries before both moved easily showing no signs of the wounds theyd taken from the slavic wolfdemons wounds that would have laid george up for weeks or lolled him they also showed no sign of having any idea he was around he did not call out to them no telling who or whatmight be listening good thing ampelus didnt rescue john the shoemaker thought he wouldnt be able to keep his mouth shut long enough to get full good from this cap even that uncharitable judgment of his friend reminded george how much he missed thessalonica and all its people he shook his head revising that thought as soon as he had it he didnt miss menas even a tittle he drank some wine between that and the steady exercise of tramping through the hill country he felt warm enough though the earlymorning air still had a chilly edge to it the right side of his mouth twisted up into an ironic smile hed had more exercise lately than hed ever wanted the morning was still young when he saw his first wolf it wasnt far from the place where he and the centaurs and satyrs had fought the slavic demons and stood by the side of the path as if waiting for him to come past so it could finish him for good instead of just driving him back into the hills he stopped in his tracks knowing he was invisible was one thing believing it when his life depended on its being so proved something else again the wolfdemons tongue lolled out impossibly red against its dark gray fur its eyes glittered with alertness its head turned this way and that for a moment it looked straight at him dared he believe it could not see him could not sense him if he didnt dare believe that what point to going any farther he walked past the wolf close enough so that he could have kicked it in the ribs as he moved past the wolfdemon let out a puzzled whine as if it had the feeling it should have been noticing something it was missing george reached up and touched the leather cap now he believed he went almost jauntily after that he caught himself just before he started whistling a happy little tune that would have been stupidodds were fatally stupid more wolves than the first one guarded the trails down to thessalonica he passed them all some seemed to have no notion he was anywhere nearby others like the first looked and sounded discontented but could not understand why they dimly suspected something was wrong and then george approached vucji pastir the slavic demigod who shepherded wolves had a couple of his charges close by he was talking to them in a language made up of yips and growls his glowing green beard george saw had grown out to its full magnificence once more the barbering his own sword had done proved as impermanent as the wounds the centaurs had taken vucji pastir knew he was coming that was the impression he got anyhow from the demigods demeanor vucji pastir urged his wolves out onto the trail as a man hunting boar would have urged on his hounds the wolfdemons whined and lashed their tails they were george realized joyfully trying to tell their master they could find no sign of any impertinent christian shoemaker vucji pastir peered this way and that once as the wolves had done before the demigod looked right at georgeand evidently saw nothing or perhaps as the wolves had also done vucji pastir saw next to nothing he frowned scratched at the roots of his green hairand then looked in another direction george let out a silent sigh of relief he didnt think perseus cap would get a harder test till he drew far closer to thessalonica he was soon proved wrong he hadnt gone more than another couple of furlongs before he encountered vucji pastir again this time with a different pack of wolfdemons again the slavic demigod almost spotted him again the demigod apparently could not believe his own eyes as george hurried on toward the city he wondered how vucji pastir had been behind him and then in front of him without so far as an impertinent christian shoemaker could tell crossing the intervening space had the shepherd of the wolves been first in one place and then in the other or had he manifested himself in both at once would he show up again and again on the lookout for george all the way down to the city wall sure enough george saw him and he did not see george several more times there in the hill country toward the end of the dayand also a good deal of the way toward thessalonicathe shepherd of the wolves looked so upset at having faded to spot george that the shoemaker was tempted to go up to him tap him on the shoulder and say excuse me there friend but can i help you find somebody he convinced himself after some silent argument that that was not a good idea no matter how he would have enjoyed watching a demigod jump despite vucji pastir despite the wolfdemons george made better time down toward thessalonica than hed expected approaching the city before the sun had sunk in the west that was not what he wanted if he went up to a postern gate in the dead of night he could slip off perseus cap and claim no one had noticed him till he got there if he tried that in the afternoon the guards would see him materialize out of thin air so would the slavs with results liable to be unpleasant waiting for nightfall proved harder than hed expected the woods near thessalonica were full of slavs some hunting others taking axes to trees and bushes to fuel their fires they had no notion he was there but like the fellow back in lete kept doing their best to blunder into his invisible but not incorporeal form if one of them did chance to trip over his foot he did not think a simple friendly excuse me would set matters right carefully he worked his way around the wall till he neared the litaean gate the men on the wall there would be likeliest to know him and to recognize his voice when he came up to the gate so would the men at the postern gate by the main gateway if he presented himself and they wouldnt let him into the city he didnt want to think about that by the time hed found a position from which he could keep an eye on the gate twilight was falling the slavs built up the fires in their encampments and started cooking their supper the odors of roasted meat and bubbling porridge made georges stomach growl hed long since finished the bread and wine gorgonius had given him night quickly swallowed twilight george waited for the campfires to the back to embers and for most of the slavs to shelter under blankets and furs and whatever else they used to ward off the cold of night george wasnt using anything to ward off the cold of night his teeth chattered if he froze to death out here in the woods would his corpse stay invisible till a storm knocked the cap off his head one more thing i dont want to find out he muttered by what he judged to be the fourth hour of the night the encampments were about as quiet as they ever got he started picking his way between a couple of disorderly clumps of huts and tents one hand held the cap tight on his head the other was on his swordhilt if by some mischance he did run into a slav he thought his best bet was to kill the fellow quickly giving him no chance to cry out instead of a slav he almost ran into the avar wizard the fellow loomed up before him outline distorted by the fringes and furs of his costume george froze metaphorically to go with the literal cold that had afflicted him from everything gorgonius had said from everything george himself had seen the avar should have had no idea he was there but the wizard was as wary as the wolves and as vucji pastir he murmured something in his incomprehensible language and stared right atright throughgeorge he took a step forward one hand outstretched as if to seize the shoemaker heart pounding george jumped to one side if the avar priest had pursued him he would have run for the gate with every bit of strength he had left but the avar kept on walking toward his own tent which george saw lay not far away maybe he hadnt sensed george at all the shoemaker could not make himself believe it he looked up to the wall wondering which of his friends were on it now when menas locked him out of thessalonica and the slavs bore down on him he hadnt thought such things would matter again how glad he was to discover they did he was within bowshot of the wall now in the empty area the slavs and avars entered only when they were attacking there was the ironplated bulk of the litaean gate ahead and there inset into the wall the postern gate beside it that postern gate drew him like a lodestone once there he found a new question how hard to rap on it too softly and the guards wouldnt notice too hard and the slavs would his first tap was too tentative his second was so loud it frightened him he looked anxiously back toward the barbarians encampment no shouts rose there he knocked again a tiny grill in the center of the gate opened whos there a guard demanded stand and be recognized its megeorge george said for the love of he cut that off not knowing what gods name would do to the cap i managed to get away from the slavs and avars and make it back here let me in through the iron grill he saw one of the guards eyes and part of his cheek stand and be recognized the fellow repeated if youre really a slav who speaks latin youre going to be a dead slav who used to speak latin but im in front of oh again george broke off he was glad the guard couldnt see him blush the guard couldnt see him at all because he was still wearing the cap he hadnt wanted to test with gods name hed remembered it in that context but not in the context of making him invisible feeling a fool once more he took it from his head the guard recoded kyrie eleison he exclaimed it is you george how in christs holy name did you just spring out of thin air like that id have sworn nobody was there let me in george said if the cap couldnt bear holy names it wouldnt be much good in thessalonica or maybe ever after george hoped that wasnt so otherwise hed have a much harder time getting father luke out to lete open the gate curse it before the slavs figure out im here wood scraped on wood as the guard unbarred the postern gate it swung open george darted back into the city the guard closed the gate after him and set the bars back in place george allowed himself the luxury of a long heartfelt sigh of relief dont know how you managed to stay in one piece out there but im glad you did the guard said he turned away continuing over his shoulder come along with me tell the rest of the crew how you did it george didnt want to tell anybody how hed done it he also didnt want to return to his normal routine which would make slipping out of thessalonica again all the harder and so wondering what would happen he set the leather cap back on his head i want to tell you george you frightened me out of the guard noticed george hadnt answered he turned around to look for the man hed admitted george his eyes got big he crossed himself george where in the devils name did you go he scratched his head were you ever here at all or am i daydreamingnightdreaming ive got to get more sleep thats all there is to it he yawned whats going on there one of the other guards called from the main gate since the fellow who had admitted george didnt know what was going on his explanation was fumbling at best while he stuttered and mumbled george slipped past him heading home he was glad he could do so still cloaked in invisibility when the guard signed himself hed again feared the magic in perseus cap would dissolve he wondered why it hadnt perhaps because the guard had made the sign of the cross to protect himself not to lash out at that which had startled him thessalonicas streets were dark and quiet and cold george wished for a torch to light his wayand then after a moment he didnt no one could see him but everyone would be able to see the torch that just might cause talk in the city here came a fellow swaggering along as if he owned the street the stout bludgeon he carried in his right hand was doubtless intended to persuade anyone who might doubt his view of the situation george reached up to make sure the cap was firmly on his head this was a fellow thessalonican he had no interest in knowing better away from the main avenues which formed a grid thessalonicas streets wandered crazily without a torch george got lost a couple of times and had to backtrack if the slavs and avars broke into the city he suspected some houses would go unplundered simply because the barbarians couldnt find them shouts told him he was getting close to home they werent shouts from anyone whod seen him they were claudias shouts aimed at dactylius in the nocturnal stillness they carried a long way anybody who cared to listen could get an earful of claudias views of her husbands shortcomings anyone who didnt care to listen was liable to be awakened you could throw a rock or an old shoe at a cat george had no idea how to make claudia shut up partly guided by her abuse he found his own front door he tried the latch the door was barred he knocked on it the same problem applied here as it had at the postern gate he wanted to wake his family but not the neighbors he knocked again louder and hoped he wasnt being too loud after a while he heard someone moving inside theodores sleepy voice came through the door whos there i am george said father theodore undid the bar before his son opened the door george remembered to snatch the cap off his head he didnt want theodore thinking he was a ghost he took off the cap just in time the little lamp theodore held in his left hand seemed dazzlingly bright in theodores right hand was the longest sharpest awl in the shop in case george had turned out to be somebody else theodore dropped the awl with a clatter set down the lamp and embraced his father bursting into tears as he did somehow george got into the shop and closed the door before irene and sophia dashed downstairs and added their embraces and tears to theodores thank god youre safe irene said over and over thank god youre here to stay im not here to stay george said his wife stiffened against him he had to drag his words out one at a time i have to leave the city again or else i think it will fall how can you leave the city sophia demanded stay here with us youll youll something bad will happen if you dont shed probably been trying to say something like youll get killed if you dont but hadnt been able to do it i dont think so as george spoke he set perseus cap on his head his wife and children cried out in astonishment as he disappeared he took off the cap and became visible once more you see the slavs wont even know im anywhere around he knew he was making it sound easier than it would be but he didnt want his family worried irene pointed to the cap where did you get that who gave it to you whoor what quick as he could he explained what it was and where hed got it irenes disapproval grew with every word he said he tried to forestall her could you get me something to eat please ive been tramping all over everywhere on not very much believe me bread and honey and olives and wine put new heart in him but no sooner had he taken the last swallow than irene said nowwhy did these pagans and these these creatures send you into thessalonica and expect you to come back out again they want me to bring father luke to them george said hed thought that would startle his wife and it did but theyre satyrs and centaurs and fairies and pagans irene protested what do they think a man of god will do for them help drive back the slavs and avars and their powers george said they arent strong enough to do it by themselves we may not be strong enough to do it by ourselves together god willing would father luke go sophia asked i cant believe a priest of god would hobnob with these these things she shivered i think he will george answered he explained the penance eusebius had set on father luke for manipulating the avars thunder gods im going to ask him anyhow hes not so set in his ways as most of the other priests i know what if he wont go father theodore said will you stay here then yes then i will stay george said if we come through the siege ill have to go up into the hills afterwards and give the cap back to gorgonius but for now ill stay he held up a hand but if i do go with father luke dont let anyone know ive come back into the city now just say you hope im all right and you think youll see me again what i hope irene said fiercely is that father luke tells you he wants nothing to do with this scheme and hat its mad pagan wickedness and i hope you listen o him too if he says that i will listen to him george promised if he says that ill be back here in an hour or so and well go on about our business and hope for the best i dont know what else we can do well wait up for you irene said sophia and theodore nodded all right george would sooner have told them to go back to bed but he knew they wouldnt listen he said in case i dont come back here remember dont let anyone know i was in the city if people are gossiping up on the wall the slavs and avars are liable to hear them and find some way to stop father luke and me his son and daughter nodded again at last reluctantly so did irene george embraced her knowing he was using up a marriages worth of faith in a night and going into debt besides if it didnt come out rightif it didnt come out right he doubted hed be in any position to apologize he hugged theodore again and then sophia everything will be fine he said words had power they were magical things saying that made it likelier to come true after a last awkward nod he set perseus cap on his head his wife and children exclaimed again so he knew hed vanished he opened the door and went back out into the night st elias church was only a few blocks away its doors stood open as they always did it was dim and dark inside though with but a handful of candles burning georges shadow flickered and swooped like an owl after mice as he walked down the aisle toward the altar in front of which father luke stood praying probably still at his penance george thought at the sound of georges footsteps the priest turned even in the semidarkness father lukes smile glowed george he exclaimed thank god youre safe yes i george stopped in confusion as he realized he was still wearing the cap you can see me of course i can now father luke gave him a quizzical look shouldnt i be able to this is hallowed ground george muttered reminding himself he hoped that meant nothing more than that the magic in perseus cap was overcome by a stronger power here not gone for good only one way to find out your reverence will you please not think im a crazy man if i ask you to step outside with me for a minute or two george i could think you were a great many things the priest answered but im hardpressed to imagine you crazy ill come with you george couldnt feel anything different happen when he left the holy precinct father luke though suddenly jerked in surprise george let out a sigh of relief he took off the cap his reappearance startled father luke again you see your reverence george said yes i see father luke said or rather i didnt see you for a little whole there i suppose youre going to tell me theres a story attached to this thisvanishing trick there certainly is george said and proceeded to tell it only the faintest light leaked out of the church shrouded in darkness and shadow father lukes face was unreadable as the shoemaker went through the strange things that had happened to him since menas slammed the postern gate in his face when hed finished father luke stood silent for a while then said this village of lete and others like it up in the hills they sound as if theyre ripe for evangelizing one day soon that may be so your reverence george said in some alarm but the priest held up a hand and laughed quietly but one day soon isnt quite yet he said george nodded father luke stood in thought for another little while then said well lets go just like that george said in surprise just like that father luke agreed thats what you wanted isnt it well yes but only a couple of days before george had been thinking about the difference between what he wanted and what life commonly handed him something else crossed his mind too what will bishop eusebius do to you after you come back from consorting with pagan powers again i dont know the priest answered whatever it is he will do it and i will accept it if we save the city hell be able to do it if thessalonica falls to the slavs and avars what bishop eusebius might want to do to me becomes a bit less important wouldnt you say since that was exactly what george would have said he didnt say it instead he nodded again thank you your reverence for what now father luke sounded startled youve been risking your life and maybe your soul as well for the sake of the city wouldnt you call me meanspirited if i did anything less without giving george a chance to reply he started west along the street on which st elias church lay you did say you came in at the litaean gate thats right george hurried after him if the priest was worried about traveling through thessalonica by night without even a torch to light his way he showed no sign of it george said uh your reverence the one thing i havent been able to figure out is how to get you out of the city and past the slavs and avars without them spotting you god will provide father luke said serenely his plans are hidden from mortal eyes but never from his own thought now i suggest you put on that extraordinary headgear you borrowed you wont want to leave the fellow at the postern gate any more confused than he is already youre right about that george said he and father luke were walking past the cistern where the priest had defeated the slavic waterdemigod seeing it reminded george how urgent their mission was he set the leather cap on his head hed carried it till then out of a vague sense that vanishing in front of father luke would be rude extraordinary the priest repeated when he did disappear no footpads came leaping out of deep shadow to assail father luke that was as well for them since he now had more unseen protection than the power of the lord alone on a cosmic scale george supposed his using perseus cap to baffle robbers would be only slightly more important than gorgonius using it to spy on goodlooking women but as a mere man the shoemaker found the cosmic scale too large to worry about anyhow when he and father luke got to the litaean gate he discovered a new crew of guards had come on duty since hed entered thessalonica he was glad of that as things were the fellow whod admitted him wouldnt be faced with the improbability of father lukes wanting to go out along with the flat impossibility of his own arrival the new man at the postern gate was surprised enough as things were why on earth do you need to go out there your reverence he asked father luke because i have reason to believe the slavs and avars are planning something particularly devilish and i have the chance to forestall it the priest answered all true but none of it very informative father luke put some snap in his voice saying are you going to listen to me or shall we send for bishop eusebius to tell you what he thinks george knew sending for the bishop was the last thing father luke wanted the guard didnt hastily he said all right your reverence you know what youre doing im sure he unbarred the postern gate and pulled it open perhaps because it had been opened not long before to admit george the hinges did not squeak much father luke got between the guard and the open gate for a moment that let george slip out ahead of the priest the postern gate shut behind father luke well well he murmured peering this way and that how best to get past the slavs and into the woods would you like to wear the cap yourself your reverence george asked i got past them once in the daylight i expect i can do it again no dont worry about it father luke stepped away from the sheltering shadow of the wall well just go on and trust in god in every church in thessalonica in every church in the roman empire in every church in christendom priests preached sermons on the glory of martyrs st demetrius was a martyr for the faith george felt horribly certain father luke was about to become another one as father luke had stood between the guard and the postern gate so now george stood between the priest and the encampment of the slavs and avars he told himself that was useless if he was invisible the barbarians would see right through him and spot father luke he kept on doing it anyhow on the notion that it couldnt hurt and might possibly do a little good he didnt know exactly how the invisibility worked if it made people see around him instead of turning him transparent maybe it would make the barbarians see around father luke too with every step he took he expected a hoarse shout from a slavic sentry he glanced back at father luke the priests lips were moving in prayer maybe that was why the slavs and avars faded to spot him as he walked across the open ground toward the woods maybe george and perseus capdid help shield him whatever the reason no outcry came in among first brush and then trees george murmured thank god father luke heard that the shoemaker thought he smiled though in the darkness he had trouble being sure did i not say the lord would provide the priest said quietly if he sent a chariot and horses all for fire for elijah surely he could manage something rather less dramatic for me george wondered what sort of miracle god had worked had he cloaked father luke in a separate bit of invisibility or had he used perseus cap to his own ends could he do that with magic not his own george had no answers but those were intriguing questions he wondered what father luke thought if he ever had the chance in a place where making noise mattered less he resolved to ask him of one thing he was certain this was not the moment having been this way before he guided father luke north he did not think though that he could find the hills beyond those he knew without help from ampelus or one of the other creatures out of legend he would have to get to the encampment of the centaurs and satyrs on his own somewhere ahead in the woods a wolfdemon howled george knew the creature could not sense him not when he wore the cap the slavs and avars hadnt been able to sense father lukes presence but they were only men he wondered what the wolfdemon would do and remembered what ampelus had said of the one that encountered a priest in the woods no sooner had he whispered a prayer that none of the wolfdemons would find father luke and him than one of them eyes glowing even in forested night strode out onto the game track the two men from thessalonica were using it snarledit knew the priest was there george drew his sword and started to advance on the wolf if it could not see him he might hurt it badly that was how perseus had slain medusa but before he got close enough to slash father luke made the sign of the cross and said depart in the name of god the wolf howled it sat back on its haunches in absurd surprise as if the priest had hit it in the muzzle with a stick then awkwardly it turned and ran tail between its legsagain for all the world like a beaten dog howhow did you do that your reverence george asked in a low voice these creatures they i have faith father luke said calmly i need nothing more remembering father gregory whom the waterdemigod had killed george slowly nodded the other priest the one ampelus had watched must have been uncertain or arrogant too father luke as far as the shoemaker could tell had neither arrogance nor uncertainty in him they went on stumbling through the undergrowth more wolfdemons gave cry but none came near hes put the fear of god in them george thought most of the time that was only a phrase not here not now and then instead of the wolfdemon father luke had routed vucji pastir blocked his way through the woods as he had with the wolf the priest crossed himself and said depart in the name of god vucji pastirs eyes always protuberant almost popped out of his head their glow and that of his hair and beard dimmed a little but he did not depart nor even retreat you are strong priest he said but not strong enough to defeat the shepherd of the wolves as it had in georges earlier meeting with him his voice sounded directly in the shoemakers mind and no doubt in that of father luke as well depart father luke repeated in the name of father son and holy spirit and the name of the holy virgin mother of god in the name of st demetrius the chief martyr in the name of gentle st catherine in the name of st elias whom i servedepart depart depart now vucji pastirs eyes blazed he opened his mouth wide showing his own fierce teeth a great laugh burst from him are you deaf foolish priest you have not the strength to make me do your will i shall not leave if you tell me once if you tell me three times or if you tell me three hundred flee now i tell you in the name of great vucji pastirflee or be my meat as had been true when george came down to thessalonica with perseus cap on his head the shepherd of the wolves could not tell he was there if anything vucji pastir was less concerned now than he had been before for georges presence on the way down had troubled him now intent on making father luke his victim he heeded nothing less the priest stood his ground defiant but weak george wondered what he thought he could do against an angry demigod his spiritual force had proved unable to rout whatever it was father luke never got the chance to try it vucji pastir had come within a couple of paces of the priest when george drove his sword into the small of the slavic demigods back vucji pastir screamed a great bellow of mingled astonishment and anguish george pulled out the sword and stabbed the demigod again this time in the side he said nothing not wanting to give the shepherd of the wolves any clue about where or what he was beyond the wounds themselves he stabbed vucji pastir for a third time he tried for the demigods throat but succeeded only in striking his shoulder murder vucji pastir cried to whom or what the shoemaker did not know this vile priest does murder depart in the name of god father luke said again and vucji pastir ran screaming still maybe the holy name had more effect on him once he was hurt as had been true with the wolfdemon maybe he was simply afraid of the holy man who had hurt him so horribly without moving from where he stood george did not think vucji pastir slain despite his shrieks had he struck off the demigods head thenperhaps but perhaps not too father luke said he would have done better had he hearkened when i bade him leave i would have left him in peace other than having him gone as it was he suffered for his stupidity what would you have done if i werent along george asked i dont know father luke answered i expect i would have managed one way or another god provides how he provides will differ according to the circumstances i am sure he is not wasteful but uses whatever he has handy george thought about that to his way of looking at the world it was taking a long chance irene would have saidirene had saidhe lived too much in the world of the ordinary senses and not enough in the world of the spirit most of his experience with the world of the spirit since the slavs and avars laid siege to thessalonica had frightened the whey out of him lessons came from the world of the ordinary senses too he drew one now wed better get going before something else dreadful happens to us here that makes excellent sense father luke said he and george moved deeper into the hills the quiet struck at george all the wolfdemons had left off their terrifying howling after their shepherd was hurt maybe that meant theyd all fled back to their lairs but maybe not too george did not want to find out the hard way when dawn began making the hillsides go from black to gray a large bush by the side of the path quivered at first george who by then was so tired he had trouble putting one foot in front of the other thought his eyes were playing tricks on him then he realized another of vucji pastirs wolves might have found father luke and him after all but from behind the bush stepped not a wolfdemon but ampelus and ithys quickly george spoke to father luke dont frighten them off your reverence theyre the people uh powers were looking for i see a mortal here ampelus pointed to father luke who was staring back at him with frank fascination the satyr turned and pointed in the direction from which georges voice had come i hear a mortal there these are the mortals we seek then if the satyrs had dared come so far down in the hills george thought he could safely take off perseus cap ha ithys said isaretwo mortals for true as ampelus had done he pointed to father luke and george in turn but he used phallus rather than forefinger george had seen enough of satyrs ways not to be surprised or offended he wondered what father luke thought whatever it was the priest kept it to himself to the satyrs he said take us on to your friends so we can all talk about how we are going to fight against the slavs and the avars and the powers theyve brought into this country ithys pointed to george again this time with a hand perhaps a gesture of respect he does what he says he does the satyr said to ampelus not many mortals like that truthnot many ampelus agreed that made george proud he yawned then nodded toward father luke here is a truly good man whose word is truly good he introduced father luke and the satyrs if i say a thing i will try to do it the priest said if i do not think i can do it or if i do not think i should do it i will not say it he had humility in him but no false modesty being around him had helped educate george to the difference we go then ampelus said talk with centaurs he rolled his eyes centaurs like talk centaurs like lots of talk maybe good mortal who does and not says you make centaurs do more not say so much redeeming a centaur even if only from loquaciousness would be a deed worth trying father luke said with a smile whether i can or not though remains to be seen he waved ahead lead us and ill find out together the satyrs and the men went deeper into the hills above thessalonica ithys and ampelus walked warily stealing glances at father luke and every now and then when they got so close it made them nervous skipping back from him they knew the power he held and did not quite trust him not to loose it against them george could not tell whether they took a shortcut through the hills that lay beyond those he knew for one thing he was so tired even a shortcut would have seemed dreadfully long for another having come so far in the night he could not be sure where he and father luke were when the satyrs found them since that point was unfamiliar everything after it seemed strange too then without any warning almost as if a wolfdemon nephele stepped out into the path in front of them the female centaur nodded to george and asked this is the cleric of whom you spoke yes he answered having introduced priest and satyrs he introduced priest and centaur without a qualm father luke bowed as if nephele were a lady high in the court at constantinople i am honored to meet you he said i am honored you would let me meet you in an aside to george he murmured i have every once in a while regretted my vows of celibacy i never expected to do that quite like this though however quietly he spoke nephele heard him the female centaur threw back its head and laughed listening to that laugh with his eyes closed george might have thought it came from a drinking companion in a tavern looking at nephele he did not want to close his eyes on the contrary to father luke the centaur said i taket as a compliment being sure twas meant so eryes the priest said george could not recall having seen him flustered before he did now onward then nephele turned to lead them seen from behind the centaur seemed less human than when viewed straight on they came to the encampment bare moments after george realized they were on the path leading to it stusippus spotted them first and made a sound more like a birdcall than any speech george had ever heard the centaurs in the camp came out of their leantos demetrius cantered up to father luke who stared at him in delight i never thought of there being young centaurs he said to george i know what you mean the shoemaker answered neither did i several centaurs whom george had not seen before were among those crowding round him and father luke he caught a couple of namespholus tachypus a femalebut missed more crotus still seemed to lead the band the male inclined its head to father luke we are told you fear not and despise not the linking of your power and our own against that to which both stand opposed if it can be done i think we can do it the priest replied we have shared this land many years now we can live at peace by share you mean your taking and our yielding crotus pointed out not without bitterness that you be preferred to the incomers and their powers who would slaughter us for sport meaneth not you are beloved i understand as much father luke said for the time being though the enemy of my enemy is my friend xanthippe said reasoning thus we may cooperate one side with the other and afterwards remembering our aid it may be that you prove more inclined to leave us in peace for myself i am willing father luke said i must tell you though for i would not he to you that my superior eusebius will remain set in his ways to expect him to change is as foredoomed a hope for you as for him to expect you to become a member of my faith for the honesty we are grateful crotus said the other centaurs and satyrs nodded the male went on for the sentiment we would it were otherwise the nods came again sighing crotus observed necessity driveth all we can but yield to it george wondered how much that attitude had to do with the failure of the old gods against christianity bishop eusebius and no doubt father luke too in his gentler way were convinced their faith would triumph regardless of the adversities it faced that was their notion of necessity not yielding to whatever the passage of time might bring against them nephele set hands on the narrowing of human waist above the outswelling into horses body very well priest you say you are fain to make alliance with us how then this being so shall we best combine against the foe tormenting us both how father luke looked straight at the female centaur which impressed george the priest smiled but not altogether happily my dear at the moment i have no idea xi the first thing george did was sleep till the sun which had been low in the east was low in the west he was relieved to find some stew in the pot aye nephele said the world waggeth on seek to stay it as we may george ate and yawned realizing he would have no trouble going back to sleep not long after nightfall he set a hand on perseus cap which lay beside him on the boulder on which he was sitting i want to go into lete he said and give this back to gorgonius i dont want him to think im a thief we cannot dot today nephele answered the suns chariot as you see having drawn too near the western horizon to permit the journey tomorrow then george said it could be nephele said but then again perhaps not surely we shall be undertaking many matters most urgent on that day conferring with your priest and someone mention me father luke came up they want to talk with you instead of taking me to lete to give gorgonius back his cap george said his voice a little sour if i understand right all the centaurs want to talk with you and none wants to go to lete that is good sooth nephele said but why father luke asked why because we but seldom venture among the habitations of mankind for any reason and have held to this rule for a time that seemeth long even to ourselves nephele replied if george be fain to return the cap doubtless a satyr will guide him they being eager to have as much to do with mankind or rather womankind as we are needful of holding to our sylvan fastness you went with me before george would not have argued so with the immortal had he not failed so completely of understanding why not now we went aye but with greatest reluctance as you must have seen gaining the cap of perseus held an urgency returning it lacketh nephele said an answer that was not an answer the female centaur saw george and father luke recognize that it was not an answer a very humansounding sigh came forth are the two of you blind and deaf what as is proved by experience bitter must my kind avoid at all costs father luke with only a days acquaintance with the centaurs looked blank george thought the answer was on the tip of his tongue and thinking that found it wine he exclaimed gravely nephele nodded even so the female centaur said even so being of the mortal land that prepareth and drinketh the blood of the grape with no further ado than that it should be a vintage you favor you have no notion of the longing for it we know a longing we also know we dare not sate all right george said he had seen the hunger on crotus face when they went into lete seen it but evidently underestimated its power if its as bad as that ill let ampelus or ithys or stusippus take me to the village for which you have my thanks nephele looked at him from under heavylidded longlashed eyes no even that disconcerting baritone wasnt always disconcerting enough to keep the females almost human and more than human beauty from stirring him and making him think how he might want to have those thanks shown wait father luke spoke only the one word but with such authority that both george and nephele turned their heads toward him he paid no attention to george for which the shoemaker could hardly blame him had he had to choose between nephele and himself he would have chosen the centaur too the priest said perhaps it would be for the best nephele if this once you and all your kind drink yourselves full of wine to the very point of bursting those splendid eyes were heavylidded no more but wide and staring priest of the new you know not what you say wine looseth in us a blazing madness oft satisfied only by blood it is the curse of my folk against which we have no power of resistance i dont want you to resist father luke said i want you to yield to it to revel in it with each shake of the female centaurs head black curly hair flew around its face you know not what you say even to suggest such a thing is madness nothing less aye madness akin to that madness we knew in the faroff days when the world was young and nothing had stolen from us the greatest part of the land that is ours not since the disaster of the supper with the lapiths have we taken wine for fear of what it will do to us nay i say again nay the last word was almost a horses ringing neigh but dont you understand father luke by contrast sounded calm and rational so calm and rational that george who aspired to those conditions wondered if the priest had lost his wits or perhaps did not fully appreciate even yet the depth of the centaurs revulsion unperturbed father luke went on you should be mad with wineyou need to be mad with wineif you are to stand against the slavs and avars and their powers when you remain your sober selves they have more strength than you not so that is so nephele admitted it is so but it hath no significance not set against our dire need to fight shy of the lovely deadly stuff if you will not set the arrow in your bow youll never know how well you might shoot father luke said and if you refuse to use the arrow will you go down to defeat wondering till you perish whether it might have done you some good nephele studied him the satyrs are fain to seduce us the female centaur said slowly but they seek no more than the use of our bodies which while no small thing also is not a matter of greatest consequence some have even yielded to them for a romp not i but some you now you would seduce our minds to do as you will not as custom ancient and longestablished teacheth in my view a stronger seduction father luke shrugged after george brought me here i was asked how i could help rally the strength of your land and mine together i didnt know then i still dont know but this is far and away the best idea ive had hearing georges name reminded nephele he was there the centaur rounded on him demanding what think you of this crackbrained scheme me george said i think that if you havent got any better ideas yourself youd be foolish not to pay attention when somebody else does nepheles shoulders sagged as if the answer hed given was exactly the opposite of the one the female wanted to hear even you too the centaur sighed a wintry sound very well then i shall broach the matter to my fellows what may come of it i do not presume to say this prohibition your friend is eager for us to break hath almost the status among us of a law of nature but we shall see the centaur turned and trotted away isnt this interesting father luke said with a broad smile very interesting george replied if its all the same to you your reverence id sooner be bored after nephele left george expected the female or crotus or one of the other centaurs would be back with an answer yea or nay in short order that didnt happen george remembered what the satyrs had said about centaurs and discussion and also his own experience with crotus he wondered if he and father luke would have a response before spring while he waited and the centaurs debated he asked ithys to take him to lete father luke stayed behind operating under what george was convinced to be the delusion that the centaurs would decide anything soon i shall have to be ready to cooperate when the critical moment comes the priest insisted i understand that george said you understand that the centaurs dont understand that though and they dont understand that they dont understandthey think theyre in a hurry and you your reverence i dont think you understand that they dont understand they dont understand i dont think i understand you father luke said laughing george listened again in his mind to what hed just said no longer sure he understood himself but after a little thought he decided hedprobablysaid what hed meant to say a little thought was all he got because ithys kept plucking at the sleeve of his tunic we go the satyr said come we go having found a willing woman in the village he was comically eager to get back there not only to see if she was willing again but also to learn whether he could find another one george carried perseus cap now that he was out of thessalonica he wished hed used it to pay a visit to menas he hadnt thought of it while he was in the city having been more worried about his familys knowing he was alive and about getting father luke he wondered if that singleminded concern for duty made him an exceptionally virtuous man or an exceptionally stupid one he and ithys drew near lete without seeing any women of any sort lecherously inclined or otherwise the satyr grumbled this bad time of year spring summer women bathe in streams wintertime no its cold in the winter george pointed out do you go into a stream in the middle of winter bad time of year ithys repeated where centaurs seemed given to endless arguments satyrs hardly argued at all they knew what they knew regardless of whether what they knew had anything to do with the truth and had no interest in anyone elses opinions lete occupied only a small hole in the woods even with fields all around the village one moment ithys was leading george down a game track the next they were staring at the village across those fields crossing the open ground ithys nodded familiarly to the now bare grape vines he had nothing against wineon the contrary to his annoyance he got nothing more than giggles from the few women walking through letes narrow twisting streets not right he gave george a dirty look must be your fault george wondered how many times over the centuries ithys had failed to find female companionship coming into lete alone thousands no doubt of course hed had only himself to blame then which was sure to mean hed blamed nobody gorgonius was pounding a wooden peg into the end of a table leg when george came into his shop good day the carpenter said setting down his mallet im glad to see you back and thats the truth you seemed a good fellow but nobody can tell for certain till the deeds are done if you know what i mean he suddenly looked anxious i dont aim to offend of course im not offended george said i understand what you mean you did me a large favor that you didnt have to do and im grateful for it you looked to be a chap who needed a large favor gorgonius answered not even the oldest old wife in town remembers hearing from her granny about the last time centaurs came into lete centaurs if they think youre important do you suppose im going to argue very hard i do thank you george said and heres your cap back he set it down on gorgonius workbench youre sure youve done everything with it you wanted the carpenter asked everything i needed george answered again a vision of the visit he hadnt paid on menas flashed through his mind gorgonius was no fool he caught the difference between his question and georges answer walking over to the bench he picked up the cap and thrust it at the shoemaker if youre not done with it friend take it back youve come up here once to return it to me i expect youll come again are you sure george said that thing is a temptation and no mistake if you came once youll come again gorgonius repeated as long as you have come all this way would you like some wine and olives before you go back and you too ithys of course he added politely for the satyrs benefit george nodded ithys said yes i take some some wine and olives just you leave out the olives laughter set the satyrs phallus bobbing up and down the two men laughed too gorgonius went off to get the food and drink ithys pointed to the cap he let you keep that longer eh it seems so yes george answered then we come all this way for nothing no need to give back hat no pretty women for me to take but ithys could not quite manage a fullblown scowl especially not after gorgonius came back with a bowl of olives and three cups wine the satyr said as if reminding itself wine no this walk not for nothing after all on the way back to the encampment where the centaurs and satyrs dwelt george stumbled several times his feet did not want to go where he meant to put them ithys normally as graceful as any of the supernatural kind also had trouble wine the satyr said and giggled a surprisingly highpitched squeaky sound to come from such a large shaggy creature maybe but george though he didnt argue wasnt so sure hed had only a couple of cups in lete not nearly enough to make him too tiddly to walk straight on the other hand if the problem wasnt wine what was it when he reached the encampment he found father luke looking worried i wish the centaurs would make up their minds the priest said he pointed down toward thessalonica cant you feel the trouble in the air and the power maybe there was a reason george had been so clumsy is that what im feeling he said you deal with powers all the time your reverence so youd know better than i do somethings wrong i think but i dont know what something enormous is building down by the city father luke said i cant tell what it is only that it is and that i dont like it i dont think the slavs and avars ever really turned their strongest gods loose against thessalonica george said theyve tried to get into the city without doing that unless im wrong i dont quite understand why but thats the way its looked to me you may have made a very good guess there father luke said i think the slavs and avars have been using their demigods and lesser deities for the same reason we often ask saints or the virgin to intercede for us with god facing too much raw power trying to turn that power to your own ends can bum out a mere man that makes sense george agreed thoughtfully but if the slavs and avars are changing what theyre doing now i can think of only one reason why they would change father luke said and that is that everything theyve tried up till now has failed if theyre going to take thessalonica theyll need everything they can possibly bring to bear against it the priest nodded that fits well with what im feeling do you know what their great gods are like george shook his head i havent the faintest notion your reverence were going to find out though arent we i wish i were back at st elias father luke said but then immediately he shook his head no im wrong inside thessalonica with faith so strong all around me i might not have noticed this till too late what can you do here that you wouldnt be able to do there george asked pray of course father luke looked surprised that he should need to put the question then the priest looked surprised again in a different way and i can also pray that the centaurs will decide to do whatever they decide to do soon enough for them and us to draw some benefit from it whatever it turns out to be that would be good george peered in the direction of thessalonica he was no holy man to feel subtle disturbances in the relationship of powers and the material world in which those powersand hedwelt but what was coming up from out of the south wasnt subtle his shiver had nothing to do with the chilly day how long do you think we have he asked i dont know father luke said its like a cloudburst hanging over us the rain will come but when and when it does will it wash us away the one thing i will say is i dont think we have very long what do we do then george turned to ithys the satyr had been ignoring him and father luke how do you go about making the centaurs move faster the shoemaker asked is no way ithys answered ampelus who was sitting close by the fire shook its shaggy head is maybe a way the satyr got to its feet and silently vanished into the woods whats he going to do father luke asked ithys shrugged as if to say it couldnt possibly make any difference whatever it was george answered if i knew id try it myself not much later and not very far away a loud baritone shout rose from the woods george needed a little while to remember male centaurs all had bass voices that wasnt a shout then it was a scream ampelus came back into the encampment laughing and staggering a little and rubbing at what george first took to be a bruise on the hairy flesh of the satyrs chest then the shoemaker saw that it was a bruise all right a bruise in the shape of a hoofprint ampelus said centaurs here soon minds made up not know which way but made up how did you manage that george exclaimed ampelus laughed some more though the laughter looked as if it hurt went up in back of filly nephele tried to screw if i do it i think i have good time if i dont do it i make nephele all the centaurs so mad they give over talk talk talk you get it in ithys demanded by way of reply ampelus sadly rubbed at that hoofshaped bruise though the satyr healed with the speed characteristic of immortals george suspected it would wear that mark for a good long while sure enough though nephele burst out of the woods a few minutes later the glance the female centaur aimed at ampelus should have annihilated the satyr more thoroughly than any kick no matter how ferocious ampelus however only leered back which made nephele more furious than ever father luke spoke quickly have you decided then whether you will drink the wine to try to save thessalonica distracted nephele turned away from ampelus oh the female centaur said that anger cooled somewhat it spoke now with more than a little hesitation aye it said at last we are decided let it be as you say priest of the new we shall do this thing and run wild upon the earth and madness shall overtake us and if it be fated we shall overfall the folk and powers that have come down into this land in the name of father luke checked himself before he named the name the centaur could not bear to hear in my name and in the name of thessalonica my city i thank you and while we run mad nephele went on as if the priest had not spoken if it be fated mayhap i shall run across a certain wretch with horses tail and billygoats nature and mayhap tear the said wretch limb from limb beyond any hope of healing even though that wretch belong to a race said to be undying mayhap this too shall come to pass george would not have wanted to be on the receiving end of a threat like that not when nephele so obviously looked forward to the prospect if it bothered ampelus the satyr didnt show it maybe you just get drunk and happy maybe we go someplace and nephele flung a stone ampelus dodge was and needed to be supernaturally quick the satyr darted in among the trees a volley of wellhurled stones followed george didnt think any of them hit lete was overrun with centaurs the townsfolk pagan though they were had stared when crotus and nephele accompanied george and the satyrs to gorgonius shop now george would not have been surprised if the centaurs here outnumbered the human population of lete from where had all the creatures come how had they gathered here so quickly when the shoemaker had seen but few signs of them up till now hed tried asking nephele but the female centaur gave him no answer he could understand his own best guess was that her kin had traveled by way of the hills beyond those he knew and that paths long in his own mundane world might prove shorter there he did not know that for a fact he did not know whether any humanly graspable facts were there to be known lete might not have seen centaurs for a long time lete might never before have seen centaurs in profusion but when those centaurs began gathering around the couple of taverns in the town the people of lete pagans as they were knew what that was liable to mean a lot of those people expressed their opinion of what was about to happen or was liable to happen by fleeing for their lives the proprietor of one of the taverns a dour little man who looked better suited to be a gravedigger came out of his establishment to look at the centaurs who stared hungrily back at him seeing father luke in the front ranks of the creatures alongside crotus and nephele the taverner called to him do you know what will happen when these centaurs get themselves a bellyful of wine no the priest answered cheerfully not in any great detail do you detail the fellow stared at him i dont care anything about the details you crazy he might have said you crazy christian which would have routed the centaurs and ruined father lukes plan on the spot instead he backed up and tried again you crazy bugger they get wine in em theyll tear up everything they can get their hands on thats the idea father luke said cheerful still how would you like to be a slav or an avar and have a pack of drunken centaurs come thundering down on you when you didnt expect it oh the taverner started to say something else but again checked himself he very visibly did try to imagine himself a barbarian caught by surprise under such circumstances the expression he donned after making that mental effort was merely dyspeptic a considerable improvement on the way hed looked before they wont be happy will they we hope not george said thats the idea to make them unhappy i mean why dont you bring some wine jars and dippers out here your place looks crowded for centaurs you dont mind my saying so dour glowering returned to the taverners face theyll drink me dry whos going to pay me for all this if you dont bring out the jars and dippers theyll go into your tavern drink you dry and probably wreck the place too george noted wouldnt you say keeping the building and furniture in one piece counts for something the taverners lips moved george could not make out what he was saying that was liable to be just as well the fellow went back into his shop george worried if no wine was forthcoming the centaurs were liable to storm and sack the place but then the taverner reemerged carrying a large jar he stabbed the pointed end into the ground so it stood upright by the look he gave george he would sooner have stabbed him george felt a certain amount of sympathy he wouldnt have wanted to give away all the shoes hed made over several months either nor was the taverner saving his own town the slavs and avars had shown no interest in lete if however the other choices were worse out came the taverner again with another jar of wine seeing him give up his colleague also began bringing out jars of wine behind george the centaurs leaned forward like a forest with the wind blowing through it they might not have tasted wine since the longago days but they rememberedand they hungered george turned to father luke once they start drinking how will we turn them toward thessalonica if they go mad or do whatever they do here that doesnt help us much i dont quite know the priests face was drawn and worried one way or another well manage well have to manage cant you feel how close the slavs and avars are to doing whatever theyre about to do i cant feel anything but how close we are to getting trampled when the creatures decide theyre not going to wait anymore george said father luke smiled at him but wanly crotus started shouting in a dialect even more archaic than the one the male and the other centaurs used when talking with mortals george could catch a word here and there but while he was getting that one three or four more would go by that had no meaning for him they meant something to the centaurs though several large burly males pushed their way through the crowd and took up stations by the growing rows of wine jars to father luke and george crotus said they are pledged to resist the lure of the wine as best they can to aid others in drinking whilst abstaining themselves so far as it may be prevented the madness shall not lay hold of all of us at once george and the priest beamed at each other the sober centaurs could send the rest of their kind in the required directionif they stayed sober and if the others once drunk paid any attention to them george was glad they were there of one thing he was certain drunk the mob of centaurs would have paid no attention to him at last everything was to crotus satisfaction let us taste the wine the male cried a sentence that had not changed much over time the rest of the centaurs did not cheer as george had expected them to do at that welcome exhortation instead a deep sigh ran through them as when a lover spied his beloved after the two of them had spent a long time apart crotus was the first to fill a dipper instead of also being the first to drink the male centaur oddly ceremonious passed the dipper to nephele the female savored the bouquet of the wine for a moment then poured the dipper down a shudder ran through both the human and the equine halves of the centaurs body its eyes slid almost shut a low soft sigh escaped its lips if that wasnt ecstasy george had never seen ecstasy and when nepheles eyes opened again they had fire in them the transformation was abrupt and a little terrifying all the planes and angles of the centaurs face were different every one of them screamed danger something wild and terrible something not seen in these hills for many long ages had slipped its bonds and was running free father luke saw that too he did his brave best not to seem alarmed in a conversational tone of voice he asked do you know the writer on magic named philotechnus george when george shook his head the priest went on one of the bits of advice he gives is do not call up that which you cannot put down i think that may have been good advice indeed nephele roughly flung the dipper back to crotus the male centaur refilled it and drank george watched in astonishment the change in crotus was even greater than that in nephele had been the male centaur seemed large and more predatory than had been true only a moment before if it turned that fearsome gaze on george he told himself he would make the sign of the cross at the creaturebetter to drive it off than be torn limb from limb and then george wondered if the sign of the cross would do any good against a centaur maddened by wine he could see father luke wondering the same thing all at once he understood in his belly what philotechnus maxim meant more and more centaurs drank more and more centaurs underwent that transformation aweinspiring and terrifying at the same time hoarse shouts rose into the sky the more drunken centaurs there were the more the horse shouts gained in volume and ferocity even demetrius still the only centaur colt george had seen took a dipper of wine and was remade in the savage image of its elders demetrius put the shoemaker in mind of a fox cub worrying at a bone too big for it but that didnt mean or didnt have to mean the small centaur wasnt dangerous in its own right how do we go down toward thessalonica luke asked i think wed better have the males who arent drunk tell the rest to get going george said he wasnt anxious to draw to him the notice of the centaurs who had been drinking that isnt what i meant the priest said how do we go down to thessalonica i may be needed there to bring the power of he didnt speak gods name not wanting to find out whether or not the centaurs could bear it in their present condition to bear against the slavs and avars and their powers oh george said and then well how do you feel about being cavalry your reverence riding a centaur do you mean father luke said george nodded the priest went on riding a drunken centaur riding a maddened drunken centaur of all the things in the world the only one id less rather do i think is stay up here in lete george nodded again he started to go up to nephele to ask if the female centaur would bear him down the long and winding road that led back to thessalonica then remembering what ampelus had tried to do to nephele he sheered off he could think of only one way to hold on as he rode and feared the female centaur would take it as an undue liberty he went up to crotus instead will you carry me to thessalonica he asked will one of your friends carry father luke crotus eyes were tracked with red slowly slowly they focused on george thessalonica the centaur said one thick syllable at a time as if it had never heard the word before then its head went up and down oh aye the new town george did not think of it as a new town but george did not personally remember its founding as crotus no doubt did the male went on and you mortal you are ah who you are returneth to me the follower of the new the centaur looked ready to tear him to pieces for being a follower of the new but then more memory seemed to make its way through the haze of wine and we are we are in alliance alliance with bad against worse a hard path but the only one left to us without another word crotus squatted down on all fours or rather on four out of six george scrambled onto the centaurs back crotus shouted for elatus the other male stood nearby elatus squatted too father luke hurried over and mounted his unorthodoxin both the literal and theological senses of the word steed thessalonica crotus shouted in a huge voice thessalonica the foe awaiteth thessalonica in a moment the whole great band of centaurs had taken up the cry baying like so many wolves thessalonica down the hillside they poured a drunken mob of supernatural creatures beneath georges fundament crotus musdes heaved and rippled the shoemaker clung to the centaurs human torso with one hand and to perseus cap with the other if he needed to draw his sword and fight he wouldnt be able to hold on then he hopedhow he hopedit wouldnt matter he looked around to see where in the band father luke was riding behind elatus torso as george rode behind crotus the priest made his centaur look as if it boasted two upthrust human parts rather than the standard one george and crotus no doubt made the same absurd picture thessalonica the centaurs shouted urging one another on and george suspected reminding themselves where they were going hurry father luke called to them in the name of whatever you hold dear hurry the foe ariseth in his might he imitated the oldfashioned greek they spoke which made them heed him almost as if he were one of their own george who could not have done the same wished he had hands free with which to applaud now despite being in among the band of centaurs he too could feel the gathering of power to the south hed known that sort of feeling in the churches of thessalonica but the power rising here had nothing to do with the god he worshiped whether it wasor could be if fully manifestedmore powerful than his god he did not know that frightened him worse than anything on the way home he murmured trying to reassure himself but the way home was as it had been blocked by the slavs and avars and by the powers that had already accompanied them into this part of the world a shout from the frontrunners among the centaurs said theyd spotted one of those powers peering forward over crotus shoulder george spied a slavic wolfdemon the creatures howl this once brought no terror with it had it burst from a human throat it would have been an exclamation of surprise and dismay the wolf turned and tried to flee as if to take news of what it had just seen back to those with more power than it possessed since it was heading down toward thessalonica the drunken centaurs ran after it in short order they ran over it the whole band or at least as many of them as its battered body happened to pass beneath george felt it go under crotus trampling pounding hooves with four legs on which to stand the centaur had no trouble keeping its balance and delivering a good stomping at the same timeonce the band had passed over the wolf george turned and looked back over his shoulder at it it didnt look as if it had ever been alive far from seeming immortal it didnt look as if it would ever be alive again either he might have been wrong things from beyond the hills he knew were often next to impossible to slay not many of them though endured what the wolfdemon had just suffered before long the centaurs came upon more wolves a few peeled off from the main band to chase them the wolfdemons more used to chasing centaurs ran away from their numbers and their ferocity baying as they went but a lot of the centaurs went on yelling thessalonica at the top of their lungs for whatever reason they did it it helped keep most of them together george kept looking for vucji pastir the shepherd of the wolves would be a more dangerous foe than the creatures he herded but of vucji pastir there was no sign george remembered the swordwork he had done while invisible he still did not think he had slain the demigod to think that on the basis of what little he knew would have made him both more stupid and more heroic than he actually was disturbed by the centaurs thundering hooves and by their cries bats rose in chittering swarms remembering that bats had spied on thessalonica george shouted a warning the centaurs were already flinging volleys of stones and branches at the creatures they brought down a good many and trampled them as they had trampled that first wolf again george wondered if any creature supernatural or not could survive such treatment close now father luke called through the din the centaurs made when will the slavs and avars notice whats bearing down on them if were lucky theyll take one look at the centaurs and run screaming george answered punctuating that with a sharp oof as he came down awkwardly on crotus back after the male took a particularly long bound of course if we were lucky god wouldnt have inflicted the slavs and avars on us in the first place would he i expect well have a fight on our hands bishop eusebius would sure have droned out some pious platitudes on the topic of all mankinds being able to live together in peace and understanding and everyones worshiping godin of course the orthodox fashion that would have been wonderful except that the slavs and avars had no interest in peace understanding or for that matter god and father luke unlike most clergymen of georges acquaintance had little use for pious platitudes not that he wasnt piousfar from itbut he expressed his piety more through his life than through his talk now he nodded and said thats what i think too he looked worried again i hope we arent too late off to one side of the main band of centaurs a scream rose in the woods it was not the sort of scream that might have come from the throat of one of the slavic demons or demigods it was a simple scream of human terror the slavs had had men hunting in the woods since before their assault on thessalonica as george knew full well no doubt slavs still roamed the woods trying to keep their larders full one of the small groups of centaurs that had peeled off from the main band in pursuit of a wolfdemon must have come upon a hunter instead by the sounds the fellow had made he wouldnt be making any more sounds in the near futureor in the distant future either a few minutes later a centaur let out a screech filled with both fury and pain an arrow sprouted from the creatures right hindmost leg another centaur tore the shaft out which caused the wounded male to screech again its bleeding slowed as quickly as george had seen to be commonplace among immortal beings he hoped the slav hadnt poisoned the arrow as his kind were known to do if the slav had poisoned it he hoped the venom was not of a sort to harm supernatural creatures the male centaur ran on as if not badly hurt so george supposed the arrow was either unpoisoned or harmless to the centaur regardless of poison he did not have long to contemplate such things for several centaurs both males and females galloped in the direction from which the arrow had come shouts rang out some theirs others from a man when they rejoined the main band blood dappled their human arms and torsos before long as they drew nearer to the encampments of the slavs and avars more and more arrows began coming their way keep on george shouted to crotus if you waste your time chasing down a few archers you wont get to the main body of the foe till too late more and more as power built in the air around him he got the feeling they had very little time whatever the slavs and avars were going to do it was on the point of being done so that we slay them what boots it an we slay them individually or collectively crorus shouted back that was george realized the wine raging in the centaur sober crotus liked nothing better than to deliberate to choose with great care the best possible course drunk none of that mattered all the male wanted to do was kick and stamp and tear and kill hows and whys and wherefores concerned it not at all we have to get down to the city and break up the magic theyre working george said desperately cant you feel it cant you sense it if their gods fully come through into the hills we know he broke off if that happened god would have to intervene perhaps through st demetrius to save thessalonicaif he chose to save it if he was strong enough to save it but crotus cared nothing about god and little about thessalonica george tried a different explanation if they manifest themselves in these hills theyll be too strong for you crotus bounded along seemingly tireless but after a few more strides the male let out a great rambling bellow thessalonica to thessalonica straight on to thessalonica the centaur sprang out ahead of the rest of the band leading not just by shouts but by example straight on they went they did not turn aside for holy ground of any sort maybe in their drunken madness the power in patches of holy ground had less effect on them than had been so while they were sober maybe too they simply happened not to run across any george was too busy trying to stay on crotus back to be sure the woods thinned followed close by the other centaurs crotus burst into the open ground around thessalonica the male shouted once more when he came out into that open country for the slavs and a large troop of avar cavalry were drawn up in battle array against the city so intent on thessalonica were they they did not turn against the centaurs till the drumroll of hoofbeats bearing down on them drew them away from the attack they had been about to begin on the wall indeed it might not even have been the hoofbeats from behind but rather the shouts from the defenders of thessalonica that made the slavs and avars realize the centaurs were there the shouts were joy not amazement at that distance the defenders must have taken the centaurs for regular cavalry coming to their rescue the surpriseeven the horroron the faces of the barbarians who knew better was marvelous to behold till then their powers not only held their own against the christian god but had routed the supernatural beings native to these hills and valleys perhaps the centaurs were in true terms of strength still overmatched if they were they neither knew nor cared maddened with wine all they wanted was to close with the folk whose demons and demigods had done so much to them up till then being afraid never crossed their minds it crossed georges mind it also crossed the minds of whole troops of slavs who turned and fled from the raging band but not all the barbarians fled some of them began shooting arrows at the centaurs they cried out in dismay when even after they scored hits their foes would not fall seeing that sent more of them running the avars were made of sterner stuff they shot arrows at the centaurs too arrows from their heavier bows they also wheeled their armored horses around and rode into battle some with swords some with spears they might never have seen these supernatural creatures before but they showed hardly more alarm than the beings galloping at crotus heels here and there one of those centaurs shot through the chest or perhaps the eye crashed to the ground and thrashed toward death not even their marvelous flesh was proof against an arrow lodged in the heart or in the brain george knew too well that his own flesh marvelous only to him was proof against very little not wanting the avars to take any special notice of him he clapped perseus cap onto his head he held it with his left hand with a great many misgivings he drew his sword with his right that left no hands with which to hold on to crotus human torso clenching the centaurs equine barrel with legs inexperienced at horsemanship he hoped he would not fall off and be trampled like a wolfdemon while a few centaurs went down most of them even those who were wounded stormed on toward the avars as the slavs had before them the mounted men lost spirit when their most telling shots evaded them little and the stones the centaurs flung smote as if they came from the hurling arms of the siege engines on the walls of thessalonica when one of those stones struck home an avar pitched from his saddle or despite armor of iron a horse staggered limbs half unstrung and then it was no longer a fight of arrows and stones the onrushing centaurs were in among the avars wrenching the spears from their hands wrenching riders off the backs of their horses and throwing them to the ground the avars remained brave they also retained the arrogance that made them believe they had the right to rule everything they could reach when confronted by immortal madmen who also could and did kick like mules none of that did them much good george slashed away with his sword every so often edge or point would find a gap in an avars scalemail the barbarian would howl with pain and look around wildly to see who had wounded him he would discover that he like polyphemus in the odyssey had apparently been hurt by nobody remembering that father luke lacked the option of invisibility george looked around to see how the priest fared he was glad to find he had a lot of trouble picking father lukes human torso out from those of the centaurs in whose midst the holy man rode he would have had more trouble still had father luke divested himself of his robes but while the priests piety was more flexible than that of bishop eusebius george was certain it would not bend so far as that an avar in a gilded helmet shouted something that sounded incendiary even if george couldnt understand a word of it crotus struck the man with a powerful fist the avars iron armor warded him against the blow george hit him too in the face with the edge of his blade blood spurted the avar screamed he clutched at himself george wished hed served menas the same way losing the officers steadying hand helped unsettle the avars so did their foes furious unyielding attack the nomads found themselves moving back instead of forward that unsettled them more now men began to break away from the fight instead of rushing toward it the centaurs seemed oblivious to the way their foes fought they fought hard no matter what some of the regular soldiers who had left thessalonica for the wars to the north and east owned warhorses that would strike out with their hooves at a riders command george had thought that marvelous till he saw the centaurs in action at close quarters one of them unarmored and unarmed except for what nature had provided was far more than a match for avars trained to horsemanship and war since childhood and the centaurs did not stay unarmed long many of themthose george thought rather less maddened by wine than some of the othersnot only wrested spears and swords from the men they were fighting they used them and weapons picked up from the ground with wicked effect george reveled in his own invisible deadliness whenever the melee brought crotus close enough to an avar the shoemaker on the centaurs back struck and struck hard the nomads did not know why crotus was a particularly dangerous enemy but soon figured out the male was such and did their best to stay away from it in the press of battle that best was too often not nearly good enough quite suddenly the press loosened with a small shock george saw that the centaurs had fought their way through the entire troop of avars some of the nomads rode away from them urging their horses to the best turn of speed they could more were down on the ground behind crotus dead or wounded more than a few riderless horses were mixed among the centaurs seeing the horses in that company george thought they looked oddly incomplete which only proved how used to centaurs he had grown over the past few days only a few warriorssome stubborn avars some slavs rushing up to try to plug the gap in the line their overlords overthrow had createdremained between the centaurs and what though seeing it from an unfamiliar angle george recognized the tent of the avar priest or wizard and the satellite tents of the slavic sorcerers nearby the sorcerers were not in their tents but capered around an immense bonfire not far from them at first george thought it was waves of heat that were beating against him from the bonfire then he realized that large as it was it wasnt large enough for that it wasnt heator rather wasnt heat exclusivelycoming from the fire it was sorcerous power that way he leaned forward to shout in crotus ear he pointed toward the great blaze forgetting he was as invisible to the centaur as to the avars and to everyone else but his words did what his outflung arm could not we have to get rid of those wizards before he didnt know just what they would or could do but from what father luke had said ive already asked you once do you want their great gods fully in this world with you that did the trick drunk as the centaur was supernaturally wild with wine as it was crotus somehow kept some semblance of sense far down at the bottom of its mind thither the male roared to the rest of the centaurs and pointed toward the bonfire its arm unlike georges was perfectly visible had george got an order like thither he would have spent the next half hour trying to figure out whether it meant this way or that way regardless of any gestures accompanying it he was sure the same held true for all his comrades in the militia and for thessalonicas regular garrison as well the centaurs though had no trouble with it now that they had broken free of the avar cavalry they were in plain sight from the wall distantly george heard the cries of astonishment that rang out from the militiamen there he hoped none of those shouts had gods name or christs in them or that like arrows such names had only a limited range otherwise some of thessalonicas defenders were liable to rout the rest before the latter had done all they could do what would he have done had he been up on the wall instead of up on crotus back what would his friends up there do seeing a horde of centaurs sabbatius now sabbatius would think he was drunk and seeing things that werent there but the rest what would they do one answer that crossed georges mind was holler for bishop eusebius and what would eusebius do when he saw centaurs being who and what he was he would start praying them away since he was a holy man his prayers would have more power behind them than those of ordinary militiamen george murmured a small prayer of his own to keep eusebius off the wall as long as possible an arrow hummed past georges head the slav who shot it had no idea he was riding crotus that mattered only a little the arrow might have pierced him only accidentally but would have caused every bit as much anguish as if aimed by a clever archer a thrown stone caught the slav in the ribs he dropped his bow and folded double clutching at himself another slav nearby threw down his spear and fled the field that struck george as an eminently sensible thing to do he might have done it himself had he been in a position where it was practical or even possible atop crotus he had no choice as if recalled from other business he had thought more urgent the avar priest suddenly seemed to spy the centaurs moving with obvious reluctance he pulled several slavic sorcerers away from their wild dance he and they stared at the onrushing supernatural creatures hardly more than a bowshot away crotus hooves came down in thick ooze the male centaur had to yank each foot from the ground to go forward angry cries said other centaurs were similarly mired the shouts from the walls of thessalonica loud before suddenly seemed weak distant george glanced toward the cityand stared all at once it looked very faraway were not in the hills we know he called to crotus they werent in hills at all but rather in a muddy marsh the slavic wizards acted perfectly at home in the new environment the slavs were people of forests and marshlands the avar who led them had got them to make their foes try to fight on terrain unsuited for any kind of quick movement natheless we go on crotus answered the centaur no longer sounded so fierce nor so sure of what it was about as had been true a little while beforethe wine george guessed was beginning to wear off but step by slow frustrating step the advance did go on the slavic wizards magic went on too seeming satisfied the centaurs would not be able to interrupt till too late the avar released the sorcerers he had called on to help him slow them the wizards went back to their dance he held the smaller magic by himself while they built the greater the hair stood straight up on georges arms as if lightning was about to strike and so perhaps it was clouds boded into being out of nothingness though somehow they avoided covering both the sun and the nearby crescent moon a harsh chant rose from the wizards george ground his teeth this was the moment he and the centaurs had come so far dared so much and fallen just short as clouds will these formed vast shapes in the sky or rather one vast shape the shape of a middleaged man of bulllike power his arms and the cloak draped over them flung out wide perun the slavic wizards cried and thunder and lightning roared the avar priest had called up thunder gods too but they were playful little things next to this brooding majesty after a moment as if they had paused to make sure their first summons was a success the sorcerers called out another name svarozhits more motion in the sky drew georges glance suddenly the moon was not only the moon but also the blade of an axe borne by a heavenly warrior taller than the treetops if the moon god brought down that shinybladed axe surely it would cleave the whole world along with their avar overlord the slavic wizards capered in delight they cried out yet again svarog where the moon had become svarozhits axe now the sun was also the blazing eye of a god enough like the other to be brother or father george bowed his head against crotus back if that burning gaze fell on him he would be nothing but ash blowing in the breeze and the slavic wizards summoned yet another god to their aid bellowing out his name triglav triglav triglav unlike his comrades triglav was rooted to the earth and seemed strong with a boulders great strength he had three conjoined heads on a single neck which perhaps accounted for the wizards summoning him three times he looked in all directions at the same time and carried a great sword had the great gods of the slavs fallen on the centaurs the fight such as it was would have been over in moments but the wizards had not summoned them into the world to deal with a minor annoyance but rather to crush the great city that had resisted the slavs and avars for so long and so perun and triglav svarog and svarozhits swung their ponderous attention toward thessalonica not only did the walls of the city seem distant to george but also tiny the advancing gods would crush those walls underfoot as a careless man might crush a childs toy god help thy city george groaned he forgot all about the centaurs since the holy name was not aimed against them it did them no harm as a man will george had sent up a great many prayers in his life some to get this or that some to avoid that or the other thing as is gods will some were answered some not he had never had a prayer answered so spectacularly as this one from the walls of thessalonicaand also at the same time from father luke on elatus back among the band of centaursshone a dear white light dispelling the gloom the clouds that were perun had cast over the landscape having seen the slavic gods manifest themselves on earth the shoemaker expected he would also see god the father probably in the guise of an angry old man appear to stand against them bishop eusebius father luke and every other priest to whom hed ever listened insisted god was uncircumscribable in that fashion but to george uncircumscribable had been nothing but a big word now he began to understand in that glorious light svarozhits and svarog all at once seemed pale attenuated like men stricken with consumption perun drew back his cloak of clouds as if to protect himself from the divine radiance triglav paused seeming frozen in his tracks but neither the gods nor the wizards of the slavs were to be despised nor for that matter was the avar priest who led them as bishop eusebius led the christian hierarchs of thessalonica the avar shouted angrily to the wizards the wizards screamed at their gods and the gods regained a measure of the strength and purpose they had lost in the first fierce glow of gods power triglav stumped forward once more sword held high perun unveiled his features to show his furious face lightnings rippled round the edges of his cloudcloak svarogs solar eye cast a fierce light of its own svarozhits swung his axe and the heavens seemed to tremble as the moon moved the litaean gate opened out rode a horseman gorgeous in the parade armor of a bygone era the roman cavalrymen carved on the arch of pagan galerius had gear rather like his but he was no pagan he glowed with the same light as had given the slavic gods pause st demetrius george shouted joyfully as if naming the saint had given him fresh force he lowered his lance and rode straight for triglav the slavic god did not give back a step but swung his savage sword and bellowed harsh defiance from three throats at once demetrius lance was aimed straight at his broad chest the hooves of the saints horse thundered likelike those of a centaur george thought though he rode one he had almost forgotten the centaurs transfixed as he was by the clash of greater powers but the centaurs were still very much in the fray crotus hurled a fistsized stone at the avar wizards head it hit the sorcerer just above his left ear he crumpled limp as a sack of barley the centaurs roared with delight the slavic wizards also cried out in horror stones started fading among themand striking home too all at once the marshy ground to which the fight had been transferred faded returning itand george and the centaurs and the wizardsto the lands the shoemaker knew it was he thought at last a good day sunshine streamed down from a sky free of slavic gods no divine radiance shone forth from thessalonicas wall where george could see bishop eusebius bright robes or from father luke but that was a fair trade george looked around no sign of st demetrius but no sign of threeheaded triglav either that was a fair trade too now the centaurs were on solid ground once more where they had wallowed forward through mud to get close enough to the avar priest and slavic wizards to do them any harm now they could gallop once more they might have been an avalanche rolling down on the sorcerers the slavs fled from the fire screaming it did them no good the centaurs thundered after them trampling the unconscious avar underfoot flinging stones seizing with hands kicking out with hooves from crotus back george slashed till his arm was sore the massacre took bare moments to finish george looked around to see what the centaurs might do next with some astonishment he realized they didnt have to do anything more the wizards must have promised the slavs and avars that this last push with their great gods brought forth to back them would surely let them break into thessalonica and now with success promised they and their warriors had faded having failed and having faded so unexpectedly the barbarians must have decided nothing could make their siege succeed avars in scalemail and slavs in hides and linen began streaming away from thessalonica here and there a chieftain from one people or the other tried to persuade his men to hold fast it did no good nothing did any good now not in holding the siege together george watched a band of slavs mob a chief who tried once too often to hold them to the fighting we did it the shoemaker shouted and pounded on crotus back with a hand he detached for a moment from perseus cap we did it he let out a great ringing shout of joy great ringing shouts of joy rose from the walls of thessalonica too as the defenders of the city watched the siege break up before their eyes gates opened militiamen came forth to harry the slavs and avars as they withdrew a few of the militiamen stared in wonder at the stillrampaging centaurs and tried to approach them more though paid them no attention whatever as if doing their best to pretend perhaps even to themselves that the creatures from a bygone era did not could not exist in modern christian times from the wall faint but unmistakable came bishop eusebius voice in the name of god in the name of jesus christ in the name of the holy martyr st demetrius let all pagan powers depart this land may it henceforth be free of them forevermore beneath george crotus shuddered as if an arrow had pierced its vitals behind him all the centaurs cried out they began to move away from thessalonica even mad with wine they could not bear the power of holy names directed specifically against them the last thing george wanted was to be taken away from thessalonica when hed gone through so much to get back there as carefully as he could he slid from crotus back to the ground that turned out not to be carefully enough he couldnt keep his feet but went down onto his backside perseus cap fell off his head he grabbed it and started to put it back on but then when a centaur dodged around him realized that might not be a good idea right away if the centaurs saw him they could avoid him if they didnt see him theyd trample him without knowing he was there impelled by the name of god the band of centaurs fled back up into the hills with amazing speed not a bowshot away from george father luke stood staring back at their retreating hindquarters he waved to the shoemaker george waved too and walked toward him father luke clapped him on the back when he came up thank you the priest said i want to tell you this has been i think the most astonishing day of my life and i wouldnt have had the chance to take part in these great events if not for you if thats how you look at things your reverence youre welcome said george who would have been as happy happierto have had no part whatever in these great events and will you thank me tomorrow when you go back into the city youll have to explain to bishop eusebius what youve been doing he will set me a penance i will accept and perform it and well go on as we did before the priest answered with the siege broken and thessalonica delivered from the slavs and avars he may not be too harsh i hope youre right george said father luke looked concerned but what of you george you still have troubles with menas i will do all i can for you but i do not know how much that will be menas is a powerful man he had a will of his own even before god gave him back the use of his legs and now by way of answer george did put perseus cap on again he patted father luke on the back then when the priest turned one way he went around and tapped him on the other shoulder father luke turned again george patted him on the head a moment later he poked him in the ribs a grin stretched across the shoemakers face father luke could not see that grin which was exactly the point i think i can manage george said out of thin air i think you may be right father luke admitted fortunately not angry at the cavalier way the shoemaker had treated him try not to be so ferocious in your rejoinder that you make a new martyr illtry george said grudgingly menas hadnt shown any such restraint toward him menas had done his level best to get him killed and the rich nobles best had almost been good enough good father luke started walking toward thessalonica george followed invisibly the gates remained open some militiamen were still corning out to pursue the slavs and avars others many with light wounds came back into the city no one paid much attention to father luke as he walked toward the litaean gate no one paid any attention to george at all invisibility had its advantages on the other hand he might have painted himself orange with green stripes and got into thessalonica unchallenged right then so long as the men coming in didnt look like slavs or avars the guards who stayed at the gates werent bothering them the guards were not in a bothering mood they were passing a jar of wine back and forth he wondered what rufus would say about that give me some most likely george walked past the guards into the city xii people packed the narrow winding streets they pounded one another on the back they shouted out bits of song generally offkey men and women kissed in doorways or sometimes out in the middle of the street blocking other traffic nobody showered them with abuse not now george would have bet anything anyone cared to name that not all or even most of the couples embracing were married to each other nobody cared not now he spied a familiar tall thin figure the thessalonicans were so overjoyed at being delivered from the slavs and avars they even included benjamin the jew in their celebration no one showered him with abuse either not now he looked absurdly confused he had no idea how to cope with acceptance it wasnt anything hed ever had to worry about before then he spotted george he smiled waved and picked his way through the crowd toward the shoemaker he clasped his hand praise the lord to see you here and well he exclaimed i had heard you were lost beyond the wall which grieved me greatly i was lost beyond the wall george said i managed to get back god must think well of you benjamin said george wondered about that if god thought so well of him why had he put him through so much trouble and danger why had he inflicted menas on him why for that matter had he cured menas so the noble had a fresh chance to inflict himself not just on george but also on the rest of thessalonica before george could come up with answers for any of those questions a different more obvious one occurred to him you can see me he exclaimed of itself his hand went to his head yes he was still wearing perseus cap how is it you can see me with my eyes benjamin suggested which was george supposed about as near as the sobersided jew came to making a joke before either of them could take the question further the crowd separated them someone stepped on georges toes in the crush whether that fellow saw him or not was irrelevant under the rim of perseus cap george scratched his head the slavic demons and demigods hadnt plagued the jewish district of thessalonica and now benjamin not only penetrated the pagan greek enchantment that lay over george he didnt even seem to notice there was an enchantment to penetrate george didnt know exactly what that meant whatever it was he had the strong feeling bishop eusebius would not approve he got stepped on several more times before he finally reached his own street and elbowed and kneed and poked in close quarters invisibility had its disadvantages too when he did get to his own street the first thing he found was claudia arguing with the woman who lived next door to her and dactylius between them was a pile of garbage someonegeorge didnt know whohad thrown into the street right between the two houses if the two women knew the slavs and avars had been routed and the siege of thessalonica broken they didnt care george smiled some things didnt change but if claudia and her neighbor remained intent on their own private quarrel the rest of the street celebrated along with the rest of the city people passed jars of wine back and forth those who still had salt meat or candied fruit stored away brought them out and shared them with friendsand sometimes with passersby tooconfident they could replace them now and everywhere people were embracing george almost walked past a young couple in a doorway three or four doors down from his house and shop they didnt seem any different from scores of other happy pairs hed seen till he noticed that one of them was constantine the potters son and the other his daughter sophia he coughed at the same time he took off perseus cap returning to visibility constantine and sophia jumped in the air then flew apart from each other as if hed dumped a pad of water over them father sophia exclaimed she managed to pack a multitude of meanings into the one word joy at having him come back again along with something that wasnt joy at all at having him come back at that particular moment uh we didnt see you sir constantine added i know i noticed george said constantine and sophia both turned red the cap of invisibility wasnt why they hadnt seen him theyd been otherwise occupied if hed kept quiet he might have stood there for an hour before they noticed him maybe you wont see me the next time either he went on maybe ill be more annoyed about it the next time too go on home constantine sophia you come with me constantine went without a murmur only later did george realize that with a sword on his belt and with his right arm and tunic splashed with blood obviously not his own he looked well able to enforce any orders he might give even sophia followed him without arguing in his own doorway he found theodore kissing the plump daughterplump despite the siegeof dalmatius the oilseller who lived in the next street over he hadnt known the two of them cared about each other for that matter he didnt know whether they would care about each other tomorrow or in an hour an evenhanded man he coughed as loudly as he had with sophia and constantine theodore and his friendher name george remembered was lucretiasprang apart as sophia and constantine had done hello father theodore said sounding a little less reproachful than sophia had hello george answered mildly lucretia headed for home without georges suggesting it he wondered how many more shed kiss before she got there then he wondered if theodore was wondering the same thing a moment later such abstractions stopped troubling his mind for irene came running out of the shop and threw herself into his arms he tilted her face up and kissed her doing a good and thorough job of it sophia and theodore both coughed they sounded downright consumptive as each tried to outdo the other irene ignored them her lips were urgent against her husbands george ignored his children too till he started to laugh that ruined the kiss were married he growled at sophia and theodore and returned to what hed been doing when he was so rudely interrupted except for his son and daughter no one paid one more kissing couple any mind claudia and her nextdoor neighbor by contrast had drawn a fairsized crowd a quarrel in thessalonica just then was remarkable for its rarity thank god youre safe irene exclaimed when her lips separated from georges again she dragged him into the shop a couple of braziers made it a little warmer in there than it had been outside if theodore and sophia hadnt followed them in george got the idea his wife might have dragged him down onto the floor of the shop too before he got in there he doubted whether he would have been able to do anything in response to that just when he decided he would he found he didnt have the chance were there really centaurs out there father sophia asked people are saying so but people are always saying all sorts of things that arent true so they can make a better story out of them there really were centaurs george said solemnly he could feel the truth of that on the insides of his thighs he wasnt used to riding a donkey let alone a horse let alone a supernatural being with a mind of its owna mind when he was aboard crotus full of mad drunken fury and those other things irene asked she shivered against george and crossed herself i didnt want to look up in the sky for fear id believe what i was seeing only irene george thought with a smile would put it like that but the smile quickly faded those other things were there too im glad theyre gone god overcame them irene said george wondered about that the slavic thunder god and gods of sun and moon had paled before the power of the lord but they hadnt vanished and the struggle between triglav and st demetrius had barely begun before the centaurs distracted and then overwhelmed the slavic wizards and their avar leader thus returning the conflict at least as george perceived it to the mundane plane however it happened the siege is over he said and thats what matters nobody argued with him the slavs and avars wont be back here any time soon either theodore said we taught em a proper lesson we did to listen to him hed beaten back the barbarians singlehandedly during his brief stretch of duty on the wall you still have that cap irene said pointing to it by the way she spoke it might have been josephs coat of many colors soaked in blood yes and glad of it too george said without it we wouldnt have had the centaurs in front of the city or father luke with em and who knows what would have happened ive got to go up into the hills and give it back but i want to use it one more time before i do i dont want you to do that irene said well im going to george answered in a tone that brooked no argument irene stared at him he wasnt the sort of man who commonly ignored what his wife wanted maybe that was what let him get away with it even after midnight revelers remained on the streets of thessalonica in a way george liked that the people of the poor beleaguered city deserved to celebrate their victory over the slavs and avars in another way noisy roisterers on the street were a nuisance to the shoemaker he would have preferred everything around him to be dead quiet that would have made what he was doing more impressive maybe i should have waited he thought what if hes out celebrating what do i do then he shook his head he couldnt afford to wait not if he wanted to keep the peace in his own home at the moment irene wasnt arguing with him if perseus cap stayed in his home for several days before he got around to using it that would change he knew his wife she would come up with a reason why he shouldnt use it and likely reasons why he ought to get rid of it too and they would be good reasonshe was sure of it if he turned them down he would have a quarrel on his hands he didnt want that and so instead of a quarrel on his hands he had perseus cap on his head he slipped through thessalonicas streets unnoticed unremarked upon some of the things he noticed while slipping through the streets were themselves remarkable but he kept quiet the district by the citadel up in the northeastern part of the city was where the rich people lived one of the privileges of being rich was taking shelter in the citadel if the city wall was breached george went slowly he seldom came to that part of town from the outside the house he was looking for wouldnt be much different from its neighbors and in the darkness the differences were next to impossible to make out i dont want to knock on the wrong door the shoemaker muttered i really dont want to knock on the wrong door at last he found what he thought was the right door he tried it gently so as not to disturb anyone inside it was barred he muttered again hed known it would be but had hoped that just this once life would make things easy for him no such luck he rapped loudly on the door as if he had every right in the world to go straight in when nothing happened he rapped again even louder a tiny window with a metal grate was set into the timbers of the door after a little while a small part of a face dimly lit by a lamp or taper appeared on the other side of the window who disturbs menas rest at this ungodly hour asked a voice presumably connected to the face i am an angel george announced he stood very close to the door so the servant inside could tell where his voice was coming fromand could note that he was hearing it without being able to see anyone speaking i am come to test both you and your master open at once or you will share his fate in a way this was the weak part of his plan and he knew it if menas servant liked the rich noble and was loyal to him he would leave the door closed and george wouldnt be able to get in the only thing invisibility would be good for then was to keep anyone from seeing how foolish he looked coming to menas home though hed pinned his hopes on the idea that no one who knew menas and had to work for him was likely to like him and so it proved the door flew open the servant said if you want menas you can bloody well have him you have passed your test george said and squeezed past the fellow careful not to touch him as he did so lamps set in wall niches lighted the halls of menas home george wished he could have afforded to use oil so prodigally there were a lot of corridors toohe wandered for a bit before finding the one that led to menas bedchamber the nobles own snores guided the shoemaker down the corridor to the proper room there dim shadows lay menas and his wife she snored too george took a deep breath then shouted at the top of his lungs injustice both shapes sat up in bed and looked around wildly menas started to cry out george whacked him with the flat of his blade the rich noble tried to reach down under the bed where he likely kept a sword of his own george stepped on his hand about then menas realized that while he could hear and feel whoever was in the chamber with him he couldnt see anyone but his wife injustice george shouted again menas wife opened her mouth to scream george yelled once more silence menas wife didnt scream the noble did ho my men help to me a murder to me george whacked him again he howled down the hall george heard the servants stirring that was liable to be trouble if they came after him they could trap him in these narrow halls without having to see him then if he wanted to escape hed have to cut his way through them which he hadnt intended to do but the servants did not come to menas rescue instead one after another they ran outside into the chilly night maybe the doorman had told them what sort of visitor the household had maybe they werent interested in rescuing menas any which way george wouldnt have been he laughed unpleasantly you see what the wages of injustice are he boomed trying to sound as impressive and as much unlike george the shoemakeras he could whowhowho are you menas now menas sounded like an owl his wife had a different question what are you i am an angel george declared as he had for the servant menas wife crossed herself george had already seenand was very gladthat that did not destroy the power in perseus cap he went on speaking to menas wretch god did not give you back your legs so that you could use your regained bodily vigor to wrong those who have done you no harm the grave awaits such wickedness the grave and eternal torment he didnt sound like himself after a moment he realized he did sound like bishop eusebius that was all right he supposed angels could reasonably sound like churchmen churchmen certainly thought they sounded like angels butive never done anything like that this was not the angry blustering menas george had come to know and loathe this was a frightened menas but it was also an utterly bewildered menas with no small shock george realized the noble had no idea hed done anything wrong or reprehensible hesitantly menas wife spoke up maybe dear maybe the angel means that shoemaker who was persecuting you george felt like kissing her though that wouldnt have done his impersonation any good if hed had to mention himself menas was liable to have put two and two together on the other hand maybe he wouldnt have menas seemed to have trouble putting one and one together that gregory or george or whatever his name was he exclaimed not likely he deserved whatever happened to him the way he spread lies about me through the city he never knew how close he came to having his big belly ripped open by a sword he never saw fool george shouted arrogant idiot he whacked menas with the flat of the blade again the temptation to let it turn in his hand to slash instead of whacking was as strong in his mouth as the maddening taste of wine in a centaurs menas cringed fighting down the urge to murder george went on being a liar and a cheat yourself you reckon all men possessed of a like meanspiritedness he knew he was stealing that phrase from father luke but did not think the priest would mind the shoemaker told you the truth he did not slander you menas hadnt even bothered to remember his name that infuriated him more than almost anything else really the rich noble sounded astonished everyone said he did and you believed gossips and liars not the man himself george said scornfully know you not what rumor and gossip are worth he still thought menas hadnt listened very well to what everybody said too but kept quiet about that not wanting to escape trouble by putting john into it what must he do to be saved menas wife asked the question perhaps because she thought her husband wouldnt stirred by that menas spoke up in a petulant voice i suppose youre going to tell me i have to pay him ten pounds of gold or something outrageous like that he stuck out his chin and looked stubborn did he suspect george was george and not an angel at all or had he been visited by a veritable angel before and made to pay compensation for whatever hed done to prompt the visit george wasnt sure he wanted to know he answered leave the man at peace and trouble him no more that will suffice obey me not and the grave and the pangs of hell await you ill obey menas said quickly i will now he sounded perfectly tractable george wondered why it occurred to him that if menas were an angel an unlikely thought he would have demanded money in exchange for good behavior georges not doing so must have struck the noble as particularly holy even downright angelic he didnt mind menas thinking him holy he didnt want menas thinking him soft he walloped the noble with the flat of the blade again and shouted obey by then menas head was probably ringing like a gong george hoped he hadnt broken that head although his own heart wouldnt have broken if it turned out he had deciding the wisest thing he could do was not overstay his welcome he left the bedchamber then for good measure he slammed the door shut behind him which made menas wife scream george didnt mind that if she was impressed with him as an angel she would help hold her husband to the straight and narrow as things were george discovered hed almost stayed too long after fleeing the house a couple of servants had nerved themselves to go back inside wed better see if theres anything left of the boss the one in front said to the other who seemed to be doing his best to walk in his footprints hope not the one behind him saidbut he said it quietly in case menas should have disappointed his hopes george flattened himself against the wall of the corridor that just gave the servants room to squeeze past without touching him as soon as they were past he shouted beware and ran for the door their frightened shouts rang most enjoyably in his ears as he dashed out into the night more servants were coming toward the house so were a couple of neighbors so was a priest the church of the archangels wasnt far away and somebody must have run and fetched him george wasnt sure the power in perseus cap could survive an exorcism aimed directly at it then again he didnt have to put it to the test and he didnt hopingand praying a little toothe lesson hed given menas would stick he dodged around the people cautiously approaching and headed home john said let me make sure i understand this you hung around in the woods until the slavs and avars got driven away then you came back into thessalonica through one of the gates we opened to come out and chase em thats right george said and it was right it omitted a good dealand all the most interesting partsbut it was the essence of what had happened george was as well pleased to have the interesting parts omitted john rolled his eyes theres only two problems with it the first one is i dont believe a word of it how come nobody saw you coming in i dont know george answered stolidly hed said the same thing whenever any of his friends asked him that question even more stolidly he went on i suppose everybody was too busy staring at the herd of centaurs to pay any attention to one ordinary shoemaker the tavern comic grunted if i hadnt seen them with my own eyes i wouldnt believe that either im still not sure i do fine dont believe it then believe were still under siege george said me im going to go out there and do some hunting the litaean gate loomed up ahead of the two men thats the other reason i dont believe the story youre telling john said if id been dodging slavs for however long it was i wouldnt want to stick my nose outside the wall now there are still barbarians skulking through the woods you know you remind me of the clever fellow during the storm at sea he saw everybody else on the ship grab something to save himself with so he took hold of the anchor heh george said have you used that one at pauls place yet or are you trying it out on me first im trying to keep you from getting killed john said with some asperity i thought youd gone and done it once with a little help from your friend menas but then you came back againhowever you came back again he gave george a dark look and now you want to go out there some more you used to be such a sensible fellow im sensible enough to know when i need to do some hunting george said someone else went out of the litaean gate george pointed see im not the only one either why dont you nag him for a while im not his motherim your mother john said which startled a grunt of laughter out of george john threw his hands in the air all right go ahead see if i care but if you come back dead dont run crying to me saying i didnt warn you george contemplated following that through to its logical conclusion but his own logical conclusion was that it didnt have one he walked out through the gate when he looked back john was still framed in the gateway staring out after him the tavern comic shook his head and turned back toward the center of the city george headed out to the woods once trees and brush screened him from view he took perseus cap out of the large leather wallet he was wearing on his belt in place of the more usual pouch john had assumed hed be bringing small game back to thessalonica in it he would too if he caught any meanwhile though the pouch let him take the cap out unnoticed as soon as he put the cap on his head he was unnoticed too he headed north toward lete when he got farther up into the hills he intended to take off the cap in the hope that a centaur or satyr would find him then and guide him to the pagan village which he was still unsure of finding without such aid in the meantime he killed several rabbits that thanks to perseus cap never knew he was there it wasnt sporting but he wasnt hunting for sporthe was hunting for the pot he spent the night in a chilly bed of leaves and boughs early the next morning noises from beyond the brush ahead made him move forward cautiously he had seen a couple of small bands of slavs in the woods poor hungrylooking fellows for whom he would have felt more sympathy had he not known they would have cut his throat if he were visible if he was coming up on another such he wanted to make sure they had no idea he was anywhere close by these noises though werent quite like the ones the barbarians had made as george drew closer he realized they werent like any noises hed ever heard in the woods as he drew closer still he realized that didnt mean they were altogether unfamiliar thanks to the cap he made no noise working his way through the undergrowth he bit down hard on his lower lip to keep from exclaiming which would have been heard hed found a satyr all right there on the stump of a toppled forest giant stood ampelus and there back to the satyr golden tail in the air stood xanthippe the centaur nephele hadnt been interestedwhich was putting it mildlybut the female had said other centaurs would sometimes sport with satyrs and some sport it was too ampelus had both equipment and stamina to make george acutely aware of his merely human shortcomings a most appropriate word in those regards at the end when xanthippe let out a sound half moan half whinny what george feltas opposed to what the female centaur feltwas closer to awe than to excitement and even afterwards ampelus tried to persuade xanthippe to stay for another round the centaur laughed oneand in especial one of that sortsufficeth not for me ampelus said grumpily sure enough the satyrs body showed how ready it was for another go xanthippe laughed then thou mayest sate thyself centaurs habitually used the familiar secondperson pronoun when speaking to satyrs was it here the familiarity of insult or intimacy a bit of each george thought laughing still xanthippe cantered away ampelus took a few trotting steps after the female centaur then seemed to realize the game truly was over the satyr stroked its own flesh if what had gone before failed to satisfy it it was george supposed true to its own nature with xanthippe gone the shoemaker thought he could reveal his own presence without embarrassing anyone not that ampelus was liable to embarrassment under any circumstances as soon as george took off perseus cap ampelus stiffened now with wariness rather than lust before the satyr could flee george stepped out into the clearing oh is you ampelus relaxed an enormous grin stretched over the satyrs notquitehuman features you know what i do george knew exactly what the satyr had done he shook his head anyhow could you tell me on the way to lete he asked all right i do ampelus said sooner tell you than other satyrs they talk too much in front of centaurs and i get a kicking like you dont believe the bruise nepheles hoof had given the satyr was gone from its flesh by now but evidently not from its memory ampelus bragged all the way up to the pagan village hidden in the lulls george had heard much the same from men the satyr by what hed seen boasted only of what it had truly done as much as its incredible performance that served to set it apart from mankind as they approached lete a woman who had been spreading tunics and cloaks on the branches of a tree to dry paused in her work and stared at ampelus the satyr leaped in the air with glee maybe this the one ithys get it said you go to village yourself now george i have to find this out it trotted toward the woman she didnt run for her life so maybe she was the one with whom ithys had frolickedwhich meant ithys bragging hadnt been a pack of lies either when george got to gorgonius shop the carpenter nodded as if hed been expecting him just then see i knew youd be back gorgonius said is everything well down in the city yes the siege is broken george answered a moment later he realized gorgonius might have meant something else and everythings well with me tooi think he set perseus cap on a table thank you youre welcome the carpenter said youre a good fellow even if you are a christian george jumped to hear the name gorgonius laughed i can say it no centaurs or satyrs to frighten now so why not im willing enough to let you go your way your bishops down in the city though they wouldnt be willing to let me go mine when there were only a few christians pagans persecuted them george said with a shrug now its the other way around thats all it was gorgonius turn to look surprised i hadnt thought of it like that he admitted shall we drink some wine on it when george nodded he went on ive got some chicken left over from yesterday too if youd like that george nodded again he reached into the wallet took out a rabbit and laid it by the ancient leather cap why dont you take this then you can use it tomorrow or itll keep a couple of days more if you leave it out in the cold youre a gentleman gorgonius said dont go away ill be back with the wine and the food he brought everything in on a fancy wooden tray he must have made himself along with the chicken he had bread and sundried apples one cup of wine became several george taught him a couple of tavern songs from thessalonica that hadnt made their way up into the hills before in turn gorgonius sang a couple so old theyd been forgotten down in the city they might have been old but they werent bad george hoped hed remember them after a while gorgonius said youll spend the night in my barn again better that than finding some place to he up in the woods i expect i should be all right as long as i have george stopped and stared suspiciously at his winecup once he left lete he wouldnt have perseus cap anymore he covered his mistake as best he could saying thanks again any time any time maybe gorgonius hadnt noticed the error anyhow he sounded pretty vague himself he held out the dipper more wine why not george said as he had the last time he slept in lete george spent a little while brushing wisps of hay out of his hair and off his tunic when he woke up in the morning gorgonius gave him a flat loaf of barley bread and a small flask of wine you want to have a care going home you know he said seriously you wont be wearing the cap mind you yes i understand that george answered no the carpenter hadnt noticed his flub the night before ill keep my eyes open come up here again gorgonius said as the shoemaker stepped out into the street youll be welcome why dont you come down to thessalonica george said i wont tell bishop eusebius youre there he realized irene would have some detailed opinions to express about the prospect of a visit from a pagan but since perseus cap had saved not only george but also very possibly thessalonica itself the shoemaker had some opinions of his own too who knows gorgonius said maybe ill even do that you never can tell he sounded as if he might have meant it and was surprised to discover as much as george headed out of lete and down toward thessalonica he looked around for ampelus and for the woman whod been hanging out her wash he didnt see either one of them the laundry shed hung out was still draped in the tree george wondered what that meant she and ampelus couldnt still be at it could they he supposed satyrs wouldnt be satyrs if anything along those lines were impossible for them when he got into the woods he moved as quietly and cautiously as he could hed come to take for granted the protection perseus cap gave him now that he was without it once more he knew how vulnerable to his foes he was if a band of roving slavs found him he was in trouble if a slavic wolfdemon found him he was in bigger trouble perhaps because he was so cautious he had another good day hunting he got a couple of rabbits and also got a squirrel he caught on the ground before it could scramble up into a tree if he found a place where he thought it safe to build a fire hed eat well if he didnt hed bring the meat home to irene who could do tasty things with it beyond toasting chunks of it on a stick over the fire or baking it in clay he was he supposed somewhere a little more than halfway to thessalonica when he came across the slav each of them stepped into the same small clearing at the same time georges sword was in his hand the slav carried a heavy javelin or light spear if he threw it and hit george hed win the fight straightaway if he threw it and missed all he had left with which to defend himself was a short dagger he didnt throw the spear instead he darted back in among the trees so did george the shoemaker began a cautious sidle to his right hopingprayingthe slav was alone hed gone more than halfway round to the other side of the clearing before he called to mind the expression on the barbarians face at seeing him the slav had been at least as horrified as he was that argued the fellow was alone too and hoping george wasnt part of a band of romans when george got to the point from which the slav had emerged he stepped into the clearing and looked around at almost the same moment the barbarian poked his head out from the spot george had occupied they stared at each other again then both went back into the forest once more this time george kept on heading south he paused every little while listening to make sure the slav wasnt stalking him he never heard anything and the barbarian didnt leap out at him from behind with a savage shout after hed gone a few furlongs he had a sudden mental picture of the slav nervously traveling north pausing every little while to make sure the fearsome roman wasnt on his trail george laughed he knew he wasnt particularly fearsome if the slav didnt know that he wasnt about to tell him even so george walked a bit more confidently after that he got back to thessalonica a few minutes after sunset with the last of the evening twilight still staining the sky you have a good day out there a militiaman at the litaean gate asked pretty good george patted the wallet so the guard could see how nicely fat it was nodding the fellow waved him into the city a few minutes later he was back on his own street people waved to him there too he was something of a hero to his neighbors not for anything hed actually done while he was trapped outside the cityhe had said very little about that thinking the fewer who knew the better but simply because hed come back after being given up for lost even claudia called god loves you george as he walked by george wondered how much god had had to do with it and how much the pagan powers had accomplished he didnt argue with claudia though arguing with claudia was a losing proposition constantine leos son nodded warily to george as they passed on the street george nodded back he remembered giving that same sort of wary nod to irenes father back in the days when they were courting and their families were dickering he supposed that meant constantine was likely to end up his soninlaw he sighed he still thought sophia might have done better but then irenes father had thought the same thing about him he walked into his shop sophia and theodore let out squeals inconsistent with the adult dignity they usually affected he hugged them both irene came downstairs he hugged her too and showed her the carcasses of the animals hed caught on the way to and from lete she ignored them that thing you had she would not dignify perseus cap by its proper name its gone yes its gone george said you went to and from that place irene would not dignify lete by its proper name eithersafely george decided on the instant that she did not need to know about the slav hed met in the woods yes he answered he thought hed spoken without hesitation irenes face told him he was wrong but she didnt press the point saying instead and now that youre back youll stay here with your own family for a while by a while he knew she meant something like the next thirty or forty years nevertheless he said yes again this time he really must have spoken without hesitation his wife smiled and said good and kissed him right then staying in thessalonica struck him as a pretty good idea after all as if rufus were making a command decision in the middle of a battle he grabbed three of the rickety little tables in pauls tavern and pulled them into a line there he declared now we can all sit together along with dactylius sabbatius and john george slid stools over behind the tables john kept his at one end of the new formation ill be going on in a while he said this way none of you can trip me as i head up to the stage thats true rufus said well just beat on you when you come back he spoke as if he might have been jokingbut he might not have been too paul stepped out from behind the bar and walked over to his fellow militiamen first cups free tonight boys he said as hed been doing since the slavs and avars abandoned the siege george wondered how long such generosity would last not much longer if he knew paul john sipped the wine and made a sour face if it werent free itd be cheap i can tell you that he said thats good john george made as if to applaud go aheadbite the hand that feeds you good to see you back george paul said you always pay your scot you drink enough so you dont just fill up a stool and you dont get rowdy and tear the place apart and you dont soak your tongue in vinegar before you come in either he gave john a hard look the tavern comic who had seen a lifetime of them did not seem unduly damaged behold perfection he said with a mocking bow to george well i like the wine sabbatius said that however was a recommendation not even paul could view with pride sabbatius liked the wine because it was wine not because it was good wine as if to prove as much he held out his cup fill me up again i dont care with what sawdust might be good john said musingly or maybe rocks sabbatius folded his right hand into a fist heres one rock he closed his left hand too and heres another one how would you like to meet up with the two of them any time john jeered any time youre awake anyhow sabbatius started to surge up off his stool rufus grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him down too early to start brawlingdidnt you hear paul sabbatius was bigger and stronger than the veteran and less than half as old he obeyed him without question anyhow that was what made rufus a man to lead men dont start on your friends george advised john or after a while youll go around wondering why you havent got any i dont wonder john said i know he held out his cup to paul for a refill too when the taverner gave it to him he gulped it down dactylius said if you know your jokes annoy people why do you keep making them the little jeweler plainly did not aim to be annoying as usual he sounded serious and sincere johns eye glinted with one more cup of wine in him he would have wondered aloud why dactylius stayed with claudia if he knew she was a harridan george could see that he shifted so he could kick john in the ankle if he began to ask the question rather to his surprise john kept quiet maybe hed listened to george george wasnt used to having people listen to him but understood why he spent most of his time talking to his children the tavern filled up fast since the slavs and avars broke off the siege the people of thessalonica had been in a mood to have a good time sooner than he might otherwise have done paul called and now to make you laugh to take your troubles away and maybe to give you new ones heres john ha john said as he got to his feet and hurried to the platform with a sort of boneless lope he knows me too well he paused and looked out over the crowd then shook his head youre a bloody poor lot if youve come here for a good time you should all be home with your wives he paused again as if contemplating what hed just said well that explains that what does he mean asked sabbatius who was not only unwed but already drunk without waiting for an answer he laughed anyhow a loud empty bray here we are all safe and sound john said thoughtfully there were times when i wouldnt have believed it not during the siege i wouldnt he pointed to the table from which hed come there are the valiant militiamen who defended the wall near here would you think they could keep out a pack of howling barbarians thank you john george and dactylius called out together one in latin the other in greek they grinned at each other hey im a militiaman too john said would you think i could keep out a pack of howling barbarians if they understood what you were calling em yes somebody said loudly john didnt annihilate him as he did most critics the remark fit too well with the way his routine was heading maybe he said it all worked out thanks be to god you even see rich people over on this side of town and you didnt hardly do that during the siege did you no most of them stayed over on the east side where they could duck into the citadel in a hurry if they needed to george listened with wary attention after the putatively angelic visit menas had left him alone if john started poking fun at himfor he was one of the rich men who had been on the western wall of thessalonicageorge knew he was liable to get blamed for whatever the comic said that might mean the immunity hed won would unravel but john chose a different tack saying during the siege those rich people hardly even knew they were living in the same city with us somebody told one of them that there was an assault going on and he said well no need to panic its only the litaean gate the slavs and avars are attacking why is that funny sabbatius demanded he hadnt fallen asleep yet as he usually did sooner than this patiently george explained because the rich fool thinks that what happens over at the litaean gate couldnt matter to his part of the city oh after a bit sabbatius let out that braying laugh again by explaining george had missed some of johns routine the comic was saying and the fellows son promised to come back from the sally with a slavs head oh thats all right the fellow answered i dont care if you come back without a head somebody threw a roll at him he caught it and ate it thats one way to get something to eat around this place he said pointedly and stared over toward paul after a moment the taverner had a barmaid bring over a plate of olives john made as if to grab the girl instead of the plate and stared out at his audience in mock indignation after she escaped how did she know what i wanted to eat he said the barmaid threw a roll at him he caught that one too we all had a hard time he said no two ways around that what i want to know is why didnt the barbarians have the decency to besiege us in the summertime when we wouldnt have had to stay up on the wall in such miserable weather i know one fellow he pointed to sabbatius who had started to snore by then who stood out in the rain so long he jumped in the river to get dry christ rufus said they were telling that joke in italy when i was a lad they were telling that joke in italy when caesar was a lad george said and couldnt resist adding and hes only a little younger than you god will punish you for that rufus growled convincingly angry and if he doesnt i will they laughed together as old friends will why not the siege was over george laughed at johns jokes too at some more than others as is the way of such things what pleased him best about the comics routine was that john did not mention menas even once maybe however late in life hed learned the beginnings of discretion or maybe and perhaps more likely events of the past few weeks had given him so much new material that for the time being he didnt need to bait the rich noble john ran a hand through his hair and said i suppose youre wondering why i dont have so much up here these days his hair was cut a little shorter than it had been before george got locked out of thessalonica but only a little he went on i have to tell you its rufus fault just because you have to tell it that doesnt make it so rufus exclaimed john ignored him there at the end of the siege he was throwing us up onto the wall with anybody who was still healthy not just with men from our own company because george had been out of the city he didnt know whether that was so or not john continued me one night i was up there doing a shift with old bald basil and with victor the barber sometimes when nothing much is happening youll doze up there instead of tramping back and forth all the damn time youd better not another exclamation from rufus this one in an altogether different tone of voice john kept right on ignoring him saying so thats what i did and basil too i told victor to wake me in an hours time and then id do the same for him i fell asleep good and hard so did basil well victor got bored while we were snoring away he got out his little razor and shaved my head for a joke when he finally shook me i thought it was colder than it should have been and i rubbed my head and found out i didnt have any hair left what a fool you are i told victor youve gone and woke baldy there instead of me here somebody called ill give you a miliaresion not to tell that one again john leered at him and how much will you give me not to tell the next one on you he looked over the crowd and held out his bowl or on you or on you there with the ugly tunic yes you you know who i mean he was grinning when he came back to the table the bowl nicely heavy with money not a bad take he said not a bad take at all he started separating the coins with his usual quick dexterity then looked up from his work where are you going george home the shoemaker answered with a yawn im not like sabbatius who was still snoring away i dont sleep in taverns and besides dactylius put in you dont want to wake up bald the way john says he did everybody thinks he can do my job john muttered darkly then he brightened ha justus really did give me silver now you can go home george i dont take orders from you george said i take orders from rufus go home george rufus said laughing george did george said dear i think we really have to dicker with leo now irene let out a sigh i wish we didnt constantines not a bad lad mind you but i think we can do better for sophia i dont think sophia wants better she wants constantine and i think shes going to get him no matter what we say about it george told how the two of them had been kissing when he came back into thessalonica after the slavs and avars gave up the siege and what did you do about that his wife asked i coughed they jumped apart george answered they were embarrassed but theyll do it again whenever they find the chance you dont take one kiss like that without wanting another if they find the chance theyll do more than kiss he expected irene to be affronted at the way hed impugned sophias care about guarding her virtue instead his wife sighed and laughed a laugh half wry half genuinely amused all right wed better talk with leo she said you pick the oddest times to be sensible george remarked irene luckily for him was already intent on the dickering that lay ahead and so paid less attention to him than she might have done rain pattered down outside some of it turned to ice when it struck the ground george didnt mind he was under a roof that didnt leak too badly a couple of braziers spread heat and woodcutters could go out into the forest again even if they did go with armed guards to make sure no lurking slavs picked them off some of the woodcutters wanted armed guards against the centaurs and satyrs george knew that was foolish for any number of reasons but said nothing he was not a man to whom people listened on such matters the one thing we have to do irene said her mind running ahead on its own road is make certain sophia doesnt do anything out of the waya euphemism george hadnt heard before but clear enough till the dickering is done when i tell her it would hurt the bargain were striking shell understand that she looked sidelong at her husband my mother told me the same thing about you did she george said you never mentioned that before a time for everything and everything in its season irene answered not quite the language of the holy scriptures but close she grew brisk again nowhow do we approach leo without making it too obvious were approaching him why dont you go buy a pot from him george said if you like you can break one over my head so the story will get round that we need a new one i usually get them from old grouchy antonius but that will do i think irene gave him a kiss for coming up with a good idea musingly she went on i dont think i have to break one on you maybe i dont even want people to think i did that im not claudia after all george kissed her this time and a good thing too says i irene came back with a fine new potgeorge was ready to admit though he never would have done so to leos face it was better than any they already had she also came back with a triumphant smile lighting her features i didnt even have to start the dickering she told her husband leo did that as soon as i walked through the door constantine must be giving him some heat thats very good george said equably do we have a bargain do we have a brideprice set do we have a day for the wedding of course not irene said theres no hurry to these thingswell not too much of a hurry anyhow provided sophia and constantine dont give us a reason for one but we have a bargain that there will be a bargain if you know what i mean all right nice to have that settled or on the way to being settled george paused then said come to think of it we may be doing some more bargaining one of these days before too long he told how coming back into thessalonica hed found not only sophia kissing constantine but also theodore kissing lucretia lucretia irene said in some dismay shes so heavy her eyes glinted dangerously and why didnt you see fit to mention this until now i might have been caught unawares you know it slipped my mind george answered with a shrug we have had rather a lot of things going on lately you know and i dont have any idea how much she means to theodoreif she means anything he hasnt talked about her youll notice maybe that just means hes shy about it i admit but maybe it means irene finished that for him maybe it means the whole town was going crazy because the slavs and avars were leaving and he decided to see what he could get yes that sounds like a man oh i dont know george said not about to let his half of the human race be slandered so who came out of this shop and kissed me a lot harder than either of our children was kissing right then hmm irene said and george thought hed won the exchange but then she said ha and pointed at him and he knew he hadnt she said i kissed you my husband not the first man i saw on the street she drew herself up in triumph well so you did george admitted but he had a finger to wag at her too theodores not married so that isnt fair hmm irene said again this time she didnt go ha she seemed content to leave it a draw so was george they both started laughing at about the same time most likely because they both realized leaving such things as draws was the best way to get through life together and stay friends doing it george was coming back from benjamin the jews with a sack full of jingling bronze bucklesbenjamin had gone back to his regular line of work once the siege ended when he ran into father luke that was literally true each was hurrying around a corner they both said oof father luke who was the lighter of the two staggered back a couple of paces i crave your pardon your reverence george said steadying him no harm done the priest said with a smile most people in thessalonica by then had lost some of their siegeinduced gauntness grain and livestock had come in from several towns to the east easing hunger father lukes skin though seemed more tightly drawn over his cheekbones than ever he looked as if a strong wind would blow him away are you all right george asked hed gone to st elias for the divine liturgy each sabbath after the deliverance of the city but hadnt had a chance to talk with the priest since then father luke nodded yes im very well thank you you dont mind my saying so your reverence you dont look very well george said bluntly the wellbeing of the flesh and that of the spirit are not always one and the same the priest replied if he wasnt contented his voice didnt know it if you havent got any flesh left george began father luke cut him off if i havent got any flesh left he said my spirit will have been translated into a world better than this one as i pray it shall be one day in any case he set a hand on georges shoulder you neednt worry about me bishop eusebius is not so angry as to require me to give up the ghost i assure you you couldnt prove it by looking at you george said in a high wind youd be gone near as i can tell look theres a place he pointed to pauls tavern why dont you let me buy you some bread and sausage and a mug of wine youll be better off for itand happier by the look of you ill break bread with you if you like the priest answered but i am forbidden flesh and likewise i am forbidden strong drink drinking water all the times not healthy george exclaimed father luke shrugged you are the most exasperating man the shoemaker burst out and father luke shrugged again george rubbed his chin suppose i get you some bread and some cheese to go with it now father luke looked thoughtful i was forbidden meat and wine but i was not ordered to subsist on bread and water alone now this may well have been an oversight on the bishops part but he cannot in justice claim i have violated the terms of his penance if i start eating cheese before lent with that he started toward the tavern leaving george to hurry to catch up george almost ran into someone else who was hurrying around a comer a big burly fellow with an expression that warned anyone in his way to get out of it he recoiled from george however as much as george recoded from him they gave each other a wide silent berth as they went their separate ways that was menas wasnt it father luke asked when george came up to him he left you alone yes he did the shoemaker agreed i hope he goes right on doing it too ive prayed he would father lukes eyes twinkled whatever the agency of his change i am glad to see he has made it the priest did not ask what george had done with perseus cap before going back up to lete with it what he did not know he did not have to notice in his official capacity george got him bread and honey and cheese and onions and olives and mushrooms fried in olive oil there you go your reverence he said no flesh no wine but food thatll put some meat on your ribs looking at what was set before him father luke murmured the most holy bishop would not approve then louder he went on but you wont see me turn it down either he ate every little thing on the platter down to the last fried mushroom when he was done he still looked hungry but when george waved for the barmaid to bring him more food he shook his head ive already committed gluttony dont make me compound the sin eating a meal that keeps you from starving a digit at a time is not gluttony george declared as if daring the priest to argue with him all father luke said though was eating two such meals in the space of half an hour surely is when the priest seemed mildest and most gentle he was hardest to move george had seen that a good many times already if father luke didnt yield the shoemaker would have to and he did all right your reverence i was only trying to help you through the worst of it i understand that and im grateful father luke answered but this is not the worst of it this is only the aftermath the worst of it was galloping down through the hills on centaurback fearing at every bound we would be too late compared to that george supposed going hungry for a while wasnt the end of the world hed come too close to seeing the end of the world himself or of that part of the world that mattered most to him i think the worst of it for mejust for myself mind you not for thessalonicawas when menas slammed the postern gate in my face even menas has a place in gods plan father luke said serenely georges hackles rose ill tell you where id like to place menas he growled if you dropped him off the highest part of the wall into a really ripe midden heap he might go deep enough to suit me yes sir he just might father luke held up a hand the two of you are quits i have seen it is so and i am glad it is so very well then let it be so and let us speak of happier matters do i hear rightly that your lovely daughter is to marry the son of leo the potter i know you were asking me about constantine not so long ago and i regret having been unable to tell you more i gather you and your clever wife finally judged the young man adequate adequate yes george knew he should have spoken with more warmth more enthusiasm he couldnt do it what father ever truly believes any young man this side of a princeand sometimes that side of a prince tooadequate to marry his precious daughter maybe somewhere not far away dalmatius the oilseller was at that moment wondering if theodore could possibly be adequate for lucretia if so he was a fool and shamefully ignorant of theodores myriad sterling qualities anyone who knew theodore would think the same theodore after all was georges son i pray they will be happy together and enjoy many prosperous and fruitful years father luke said well your reverence if anything can make that likelier i expect your prayers will do the job george answered father luke dipped his head acknowledging the compliment more bread more olives more cheese the barmaid asked some wine neither one of you is drinking any wine what are you doing here if youre not drinking wine she seemed to be saying george shook his head father luke set a hand on the shoemakers arm because i may not he said does not mean you should not one cup george said and the barmaid went off to pour it father luke beamed pleased to have been taken at his word george had long since found that taking the priest at anything less than his word was a mistake when the woman brought back the wine father luke asked may i propose a toast if you consider that rude because i am not drinking by all means say so george made haste to wave for him to go on smiling the priest said drink to nephele and crotus and the rest of the centaurs for me then they went without wine rather longer than bishop eusebius has enjoined such abstinence for me half to himself he murmured abstinence again and then very quietly nephele if the thoughts going through his mind at that moment were ecclesiastical george would have been amazed im glad to drink to that one the shoemaker said and did if it hadnt been for the centaursand for you to persuade them to get roaring drunkwed all be worse off than we are now he raised a quizzical eyebrow didnt the bishop tell you not to have anything more to do with them though that he did father luke grinned he did not however forbid me to drink their health at least vicariously the grin got wider george recognized it it was the one theodore had given him when as a small boy hed found a way around some instruction of georges laughing george finished the wine but he didnt laugh long after a little while he said im afraid were not rid of the slavs and avars for good that sobered father luke too if the emperor maurice can drive the barbarians back beyond the danubewhich i pray he succeeds in doingthen we may be free of them for a long time to come he said if he is less fortunate on the battlefield heaven forbid george exclaimed what i wouldnt have given to see our garrison of regulars come galloping to the rescue there at the end of the siege and i the priest agreed but they served the roman empire elsewhere as was gods will and so we and thessalonica made do with centaurs centaurs fit into the divine plan too they would tell you otherwise if they could speak the name of god george said i know they would father luke was unruffled they are undying and wise and lovely was he thinking of nephele again before george could nerve himself to ask the priest went on but they are also faded defeated by the new dispensation and in any case only creatures of local power seeking to judge the one universal and almighty god they may no more comprehend him in fullness than may you or i they would tell you otherwise there too george said i know father luke repeated unruffled still if you like ill say my say all over again so we can have the argument at yet another remove no thanks george tried another tack if wed been late coming down from the hills the gods of the slavs might have overthrown thessalonica before we could do anything to the wizards who brought them forth so they might have father luke said but we were in good time if barely in good time the reason being that god did not allow us to be late youve got all the answers george said chuckling the priest shook his head no only one he rose from the table and clasped georges hand i was heading back toward st elias when you waylaid me and dragged me in here if you can stay a bit longer drink another cup of wine for me off he went a man who knew where he was going and why do you want that cup of wine or not the barmaid asked when george sat for a minute or two without calling for it he stared at her she stared back altogether unembarrassed about eavesdropping yes ill take it he said at last she brought it over to him and hovered till he set coins on the tabletop by the way she scooped them up she might have suspected they were counterfeit thus encouraged george gulped down the wine and left it had started to snow while he was in the tavern snowflakes danced in the air a thin layer of white lay over everything not yet streaked with soot not yet trampled into slush george stood outside the doorway for a moment the falling snow was beautiful it was also cold he wrapped his tunic more tightly around himself and hurried off toward his own home and shop the snow crunched under his boots every time he exhaled he breathed out fog as he walked along shivering he thought about what father luke had said crotus and nephele thought differently hed said as much himself the avar priest had thought differently too till the centaurs put paid to him who had the right of it menas a part of gods plan george snorted the notion was absurd on the face of it he walked a few steps farther then despite snow despite cold he stopped was it absurd or was the pattern of events larger and more complex than george had perceived till this moment had god cured menas paralysis so that the rich noble having become georges enemy could by shutting him out of the city force him up into the hills to meet the centaurs to gain perseus cap to bring father luke up into the hills to get the centaurs drunk so they would have the spirit to attack the slavs and avars besieging thessalonica and help save it he looked up into the gray sky was that gods will he saw or only his own imagination running away with him after a couple of cups of wine either way how was he supposed to tell a snowflake landed on the tip of his nose he brushed it off and started walking again he was only a couple of blocks from home
