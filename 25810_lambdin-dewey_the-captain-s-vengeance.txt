death the tempest act i scene william shakespeare the dry tortugas n w two ships tossed rocked and heaved on a fretful sea fetchedto and immobile within easy rowing distance of the dry lowlying rocky islettoo small to be called an island too large to be termed a cay bastard barren places were these islets neither caribbean soft and beguiling nor american mainland coastalmarshily bleak these islets did not belong to the caribbean but to the gulf of mexico and lay far west of southernmost spanish florida an afterthought of a distracted creator who had flung them like excess ochre droplets off a cosmic putty knife once the last of the florida keys had been shaped except for a small sand beach on the north side off which the two ships lay the islets shore was rocky gravelled and steepto with waves breaking vertically strewn with broken shells fragments of driftwood bird skeletons and russet humps of pine needles and palm furze the seas were lively and heaved four or five feet or more in a confused chop deepocean bluegrey changing to teal aqua or lapis near the shoreall under an achingly empty cerulean blue sky that was brushed by mares tails with only the rare stiffwinged albatross frigate bird or gull to show a single sign of life the two ships fetchedto off the northern beach were clattered clanged and slatted by those confused seas rising and dropping pitching at bows and sterns and rocking in uneven unpredictable fits and jerks one of the fetchedto vessels was a typical bluffbowed threemasted merchantman a tad high at poop and forecastle wide and beamy and deeply laded she gleamed with linseed oil twixt her blacktarred gunwale and her jaunty blue upperworks and bulwarks with a hint of a wealthy traders gilt round her bulging quartergalleries entry ports and figurehead her motion because of her greater tonnage and weight of cargo was a bit easier and more predictable than the other ships a tricolour flag of republican france flew from the leach of her large spanker which was still sheeted in to keep drive on her and her bows pinched up to the winds while her courses and topgallants were bagreefed her topsls flatted aback and her jibs knifeedged full of wind that unseeded gleaming wood was as pretty as a spankingnew beeswaxed tabletop the second fetchedto vessel rode much more lively for she was a schooner much narrower in beam gaffhung sails on her foremast and main fought a losing fight to drive her forward whilst her two standing jibs hauled taut on the opposing tack kept her motionlessin respect to the islet at least riding her decks keeping ones feet as she slatted was a feat worthy of gainful employment with a touring gypsy circus her hired captain and her crewmembers were managing it well so were their employers the schooner showed the world a lovely face too blackhulled with a dockyardfresh coat of the glossiest paint not tar that hull so long lean and so sweetly sheerlined was boottopped on the waterline and striped along the upperwork bulwarks with wide bands of a deep scarlet her masts gaffs and booms jib boom and bowsprit her coachtop tween foremast and mainmast and her two small upper yards were painted a hazy light bluegrey and her sails instead of newfromthechandlery ecru or wellworn and used parchmentlike tan had been dyed horizongrey as well la reunion she was called as so she was named in the scrollboard on her stern and in her ships papers that declared her a yacht a nautical plaything for her idlerich planter owners and registered as she was as homeported in a spanish possession she usually sported a gilttan flag with the two horizontal red stripes equidistant from top and bottom of a spanish merchantman or private vessel for this occasion though in keeping with her secret name and her other papers the purchased letter of marque and reprisal declaring her to be a french privateer by name of le revenantthat is to say the ghostthat despised shitbrintle rag had been hanked on below a french tricolour atop her mainsls leach a flag brighter and larger as if she were the prize lot the threemaster no matter how desolate or bleak the islet la reunion s owners were in happy takings eyes alight with the novelty of it all sipping champagne and snickering as they watched the crew aboard the merchantman struggle to sway out and lower her largest launch the sailors manning the check or snub lines were having a rough go of it as the prize ship juddered about i thought you said capitaine balfa was a salty man one young man demanded a bold experienced freebooter but he goes about that like a clumsy drunken bayou barataria coonass ha ha the hired captain of la reunion or le revenant standing aloof of them clamped his lips together to bite off what harsh response that petulant plaint merited eyes slit in frustration jerome lanxade and boudreaux balfa went back a long time together and a slur on boudreaux might as well have been a slur on his own competence dammit to hell neither he nor balfa owned this lithe schooner only shares in the enterprise it wasnt like the old days back in the last war when theyd commanded five ships at once when the names jerome lanxade le feroce for he had been called the ferociousand boudreaux balfa laffame or the hungryhad commanded respect and awe in every caribbean or gulf port then they could recruit an entire crew overnight at the snap of their fingers and fill every mans pockets with prize money or plunder under the old whiteandgold fleur de lis of royal france the heraldic redgold of spain even the dreaded jolly roger or black flag a time or two their orders or slightest whims could have made fish bait of callow capering lubbers like them jerome lanxade turned to face his employers hands clasped in the small of his back a blackvisaged glower of warning on his darktanned face just for a moment he fantasised again of murdering every last one of them of just taking this splendid little ship for his own and continuing the business for his own profit kill all the young men not the girl though oh no not for a long time he let his face soften and crease into a knowing smile the seas are up the prize ships motion lanxade told them with what might have seemed to be infinite patience nothing goes as quickly or smoothly as you wish aboard ship messieurs mademoiselle poseurs he silently accused though the girl was most fetchingeven if she was the most bloodyminded of the entire bunch his employers dressed the part jackboots and baggy sailors slop trousers colourful shirts under longtailed and gaudy oldstyle waistcoats that they wore open waist sashes crammed with pistols or daggers under the waistcoats broad satin or velvet baldrics bearing costly short swords or swepthilt rapiers widebrimmed hats adrip with egret plumes as if theyd tricked themselves out in fanciful garb and beauty spots and face powders for a prerevolution costume ball one would wish though msieur le capitaine lanxade that it goes competently nestce pas the young woman sweetarchly replied with an elegant lift of one brow a leering smile at one corner of her sweetly kissable mouth and a mocking salute with her wineglass arrogant wanton slut lanxade thought unable to keep his eyes from caressing her curves her slim legs on display for all the world to see in oversnug breeches and silk knee stockings her decolletage made prominent by a tight and waisthugging buttoned waistcoat just long enough to flare over the tops of her hips like a corset worstnamed cunt in all creation charite angelette de guilleri mile charite de guilleri lowered her lashes and smirked over the rim of her crystal champagne glass secretly delighted by their hired mans notsosecret lust and her heady power to deny i still say we should just shoot them make them to walk the plank or something her cousin jeanmarie rancour spat oui jean dead men tell no tales after all another of their party said unlike the rest he was darkhaired and browneyed was don rubio monaster while charite her brothers hippolyte and helio and their cousin were the typical longsettled creoles with chesnut hair and blue eyes just kill them and be done don rubio asserted with what he was certain was an aggressive decisive and manly lift of his chin for charites benefit and hopefully at some future time of bliss with her his own weve done that the eldest brother helio de guillieri responded in a lazy drawl that havana slavers crew remember rubio we made them walk the plank jean but we havent done marooning yet middle brother hippolyte snickered just about the only thing we havent done kill or maroon helio as leader posed the old buccaneers practiced egalite and fraternite they voted on things lets vote shoot don rubio monaster quickly replied but he was shouted down by those in favour of marooning their captives only jean sided with him and that not with a whole heart mon dieu what a pack of capt lanxade thought marooned men tell no tales no one ever comes here they give these isles a wide berth for fear of shoals and reefs only piles of bleached bones will be found if ever he gruffly told them i cannot shoot even one don rubio plaintively asked rubio dont be greedy mile charite coaxed sashaying to his side to drape an arm round his shoulders and lay her head next to his as if cajoling her papa for a new gown we have seen how well you shoot those runaway slavespimpimpim and all your doing nestce pas if we run across another prize on the way home we will leave things to you wont we helio hippolyte the other stalwart young fellows had no problem with that if not quel dommage charite continued and you must quell your eagerness til the next voyage remember rubio hastening the day of rejoining la belle france and throwing off the spanish tyrrany comes first last and always before our petty amusements she blew teasingly at his ear swept off his overly ornate hat and tousled his romantically long dark locks then gave the embarrassed young fellow a quick and sisterly peck on the cheek with a tiny flick of her tongue tip to tantalise before almost skipping away from him ah regardez the boat at last don rubio monaster bashfully grinned though following her every movement with downcast but lustful eyes unsure again whether hed been gulled by her or slyly encouraged but for their mutual scheme don rubio might have been shunned by her family his father had been a grandee spaniard sent to administrate the territory though a true castilian of noble hidalgo blood never tainted by moor or marrano whose sires had held titles since the reconquista in the s his father had been so impoverished that a wilderness posts salary had been welcomed spanish overlord or not his father had managed to wed a proud and exalted french creole lady heir to vast acreages upriver from the city and had seen to it that the old french deeds of her family the bergrands had become legitimate spanish land grants not so smart though to avoid taking the field against a chickasaw uprising up near natchez where his noble father had been slain since then the bergrands had moulded him into more of a creole than a don more a jacobin than a royalist after the french revolution too spain was old tired and bankrupt with nothing to offer but a corrupt and neglectful governance the new united states encroaching on their borders were even worse just too common venal grasping and backwoods crude without a powerful protector they would be swamped in buckskin awash in the vile juices of chawbaccy non only a rising of their own and a remonstrance of their fait accompli to the republican directory in paris could save them everyone was so sure of that but so few really ever did anything about it other than talk and talk in the cabarets only hippolyte and helio seemed capable of action and hed gladly become a part of their scheme for the future for bewitching charites costly parisian scent lingered on rubios shirt collar and he took a cautious sniff even as he stood to watch the launch from the prize ship finally be rowed over to the schooner feet widespread to balance springkneed to ride the pitching of the deck as masterfully as he rode the most spirited stallion with hands in the small of his back in unconscious imitation of their hired man the daunting dashing capt lanxade chin up and alert firmjawed in spite of the swooping jerks and snubs he would be dizzy and sick if he let himself he would not be sick he would be dashing though maman was delighted that her son had entree with a family as distinguished and rich as the de guilleris one even richer and of longer habitation than her own though he was coyly urged to lay suit to one of the older sisters iphegenie or marguerite though he was sure that either would be a pleasingly suitable and presentable match and either would be amenable yet there was charite that coquette oh if only he could tell her what agony and what ecstacy her toobrief caress and kiss could cause him how like the golden fleece he thought her long chestnut hair how lambent he deemed her turquoise eyes how generous her lips and mouth how bountiful her breasts god above not lambent don rubio chid himself hed sound lame and prissy as a dancing master no true gentleman wasted time on such limp tripe like a born creole grandee he had no time for poetry or books though girls did put a deal of stock in such a series of thuds alongside brought rubio back from his fancies as the launch butted the schooners hull below the entryport and was hooked onto the chains a moment later capitaine boudreaux balfa was clambering up the battens on his large and gnarly bare feet l affame more hungry for hog meat than booty rubio thought boudreaux balfa was typical of the shoddy runofthemill louisiana acadian dressed in a homegrown rough cotton ecru shirt homemade and indigodyed knee breeches of the same cotonnade material shoes or stockings well if nagged rustics such as balfa might don cowhide moccasins to attend church kneehigh moccasins to wade after his lost pigs in the swamps shoes and stockings balfa might possess for weddings or funerals if at all and like most acadians the man was so abstemious that he wore his clothes until they were halfway between mauvaises and usees meaning tattered or threadbare atop his crown balfa wore a plaited palmettofrond tricorne hat so old its wide brims sagged down nearly to horizontal and looked as if rats had been at it ohe lanxade balfa gravelled in glum greeting to his oldtime partner sweeping off that shabby tricorne to bare a fierce and wiry thicket of unruly irongrey hair and studiously ignoring his employers see dat sky dis choppy water feel dat wind itll be a good half a gale by sundown by gar lets get dis over wit cher in his younger years capitaine boudreaux balfa had been a doughty figure of a buccaneer and privateersman but time and shore living on a hardscrabble plot of land had not been kind he had thickened and grown a trenchermans gut a shad belly though not an ounce of him was yet soft balfa was as thick as a fierce boar hog ah oui boudreaux mon cher lanxade agreed we dont make a ceremony out of it we can be fifteen lieues alee by sundown in deep water and scudding large bosun fetch them up he took balfa by the arm and together they walked back to the rails away from the swaggering tipsy revellers time had been somewhat kinder to lanxade he was still tall lean and flatbellied unbowed after the toils of peaceful employment on trading company shalopes upriver to manchac natchez st louis and the old illinois settlements and back but boudreaux did imagine he heard a suspicious creak from somewhere near lanxades middle which put him in mind of a wellhidden corset and balfa allowed himself a secret smile to note that his old compatriots grey roots were showing along with the telltale splotch of greenish walnuthusk oil on his ears that betrayed his use of hair dye to remain so dark and virilelooking sure enough a playful poke at lanxades boudins met wellstayed canvas and whalebone resistance hawn hawn hawn he softly nasally chortled at such vanity oh shut up you old bougre lanxade hissed back stiffening to maintain his dignity and his secrets so we kill dem or we maroon dem balfa asked offhandedly maroon lanxade told him for the novelty of it dem babies not tired o killin yet balfa wondered aloud bored with it more likely lanxade said in a harsh mutter i could say queasy of the consequences but with this lot i wouldnt count on it sated for now but a few weeks ashore and theyll wish to be back at it piracys addictive as we both know cher pissing god and the devil in the eye by damn dey wanna see real piracy jerome what say we jus take dis damn goelette for our own balfa softly cackled mak dem walk de plank jus like de ol days maroon dem long wit dem poor salauds down below hein theyre too rich and important to go missing boudreaux and wed swing for it lanxade countered though not without a long pause to ponder it but we wont for dat dago guarda costa lugger merde the spanish government lugger outbound from havana returning rebel slaves for execution at mobilealong with a profitable load of other negres and smuggled goods that her unscrupulous captain had meant to land on the slywas their latest capture the small crew of spaniards had gone overside as had the convicted rebels though theyd kept the untainted negres for sale to the caboteurs the itinerant backcountry slave dealers after the pointe coupee slave insurrection four years earlier though even a blind planter would have spurned such lash or manaclescarred slaves as cutthroat troublemakers not with brigands such as st john or st malo leading vengeful runaway slave bands in the swamps of louisiana those captives had held no value except for sport with their hands free but with leg shackles linked and weighted with shot their struggle to stay afloat had been tres drole the strong futilely trying to buoy up the weaker after theyd been forced over the side once the lugger had been stripped of everything useful then sunk the spaniards had had it kinder theyd walked the plank with only their arms roped free to kickswim to stay afloat and alive til the game had palled and the youngsters had honed their marksmanship skills on them now there would be more fun hoots and curses erupted from the schooners crew more wine was poured by their youthful employers as the six remaining prisoners off the prize ship were fetched up the narrow and steep companionway ladder from the schooners foetid orlop stumbling and sickly reeling their eyes blindfolded and their arms bound they were unable to help themselves time to die bastards helio de guilleri taunted in english though his intent was spoiled by tittering at his own wit and putting stress on the second syllable of bastards go game lads go game one of the older captives urged his mates theyre nought but prinkin frogs an dons buck up young sir he added as the youngest began to mewl and gasp in dread fack th bloody lot o ye another doughtier prisoner cried

lanxade snapped back their blindfolds aussi take them off let them see what a fine estate we give them ha ha a mutual gasp of bleak realisation wheezed from the doomed men as they beheld the islet providing even more amusement for the captors and with much eager poking prodding and shoving the prisoners were forced to the entryport to lower themselves into the centre of the launch where extra hands with pistols and daggers waited to receive them balfa and his oarsmen got down into the boat with them and steered towards the shore stroke stroke balfa chearily directed tapping the time on the tillerbar a little song mes enfants he urged ah suzette suzette to veux pas chere ah suzette chere amie to pas vaimin moin malle dans montagne zamie malle coupe canne chere amie malle fait largent mo

and hope balfa scoffed dis de dry tortugas comprendre dry never know might catch turtle he blood you drink he meat and eggs you eat kill seabirds aussi same ah up oars bow men the launch staggered through the last froth of surf and ground her bows into the raspy pebbled grit of the beach bow men sprang to either side thighdeep in whitewater spume to steady the bows as a fresh wave lifted the boat a foot more ashore go over de bow dont even get your feet wet you out vite hope you like you new home balfa snickered as his oarsmen laid their blades in the bilges and waved their weapons at the

or we jus have tshoot us adieu allez vite as the pirates scrambled to shove off and leap into their boat one of the captives dared kneel by the leather sack and peer inside it he wonderingly drew out a rusting old kitchen knife paper and crikey tis a quizzin glass and a tinderbox too we can light a fire does a ship ever pass he whispered in surprise sweet merciful jaysus in heaven the irish captive cried in sudden glee as he swiped his fingers over a damp spot on the barrico and sniffed at it tis rum by god ten bloody gallon o rum what the devil the oldest sailor puzzled scratching at his grizzled scalp he almost felt a twinge of hope of gratitude to that the shot was inaudible over the loud swashing and raling of the surf the wind that flapped their clothing and the mewing cries of the seabirds that nested on the islet flushed awing by their presence oh the youngest lad said as if hed pricked his finger on a thorn and clapped a hand to the inside of his right thigh oh he reiterated as if a wasp or bee had stung him as he looked down at the blood on his white breeches ah oh lord as realisation came as he fell to his knees and went as pale as the wave spume the other captives could see the tiniest wisp of spent powder smoke that blew westward from the schooners small quarterdeck ragging past the taffrails like the spirit of a hag that had ridden her mortal too long and must flee the coming of dawn oh you bloody bastards you goddamn frog sonsabitches the doughty older captive howled shaking both fists at their tormentors well get ye yet well find ye and cut

the rope of his destiny our cable for our own doth little advantage if he be not born to be hanged our case is miserable the tempest act i scene william shakespeare chapter one hoy the boat mr midshipman larkin cried his challenge to the approaching civilian cutter though he had known who its passengers were as soon as they had stepped down into it on the distant quay ten minutes earlier had been awaiting those passengers return for at least the last two hours past proteus the mulatto bow man shouted back seated on the very tip of the cutters bows legs dangling to either side with a brassfitted gaff staff across his lap with which to hook onto the chains he shot one hand in the air for a moment showing four fingers proving that a captain was aboard come alongside aye mr larkin shouted back then paced over to join the others of the sideparty assembled to salute that officers arrival back aboard larkin was a thatchhaired illfeatured lout of a lad all out at elbows and knees in his secondhand uniform and that didnt even take into consideration the growing hed done since signing ships articles over a year before though it was a useless endeavour he twitched and tugged his coat waistcoat and neckstock into better order shifted the hang of his shoddy dirk and took a second to remove his battered cocked hat and swipe his unruly hair with a welsh comb that is to say with his fingers marine lieutenant devereux fiddled with his own immaculate neckstock harumphed to clear his throat and cocked a brow as he regarded his short line of marines under arms in a lastinstant inspection though ships officers did not usually stand harbour watches the first officer mr anthony langlie was present as was the second officer the evercynical and recently wakened and yawning lieutenant catterall the younger and cleverer scot lt adair also toed the line of a tarpaid seam in the starboard gangway planking his sword loose and ready to present mr winwood the sailing master and mr grace the ships other midshipman also stood nearby stiffbacked and chinup with curiosity thud went the shabby cutter against the hull a clatter of untidily boated oars more softer thuds as the cutter shouldered the proper captains gig and a grunt or two some mumbles as money changed hands for the short passage midshipman larkin dared a peek outboard and downwards from his position at the opening of the entryport nodded to the neatuniformed sailors in the sideparty and stiffened the bosun mr pendarves began his long elaborate call as the dogs vane of the arriving officers giltlaced cocked hat peeked over the top step at a whispered word officers swords were drawn then presented before their faces wellblacked marine boots stamped on the creamypale freshsanded planking hands slapped glossyoiled walnut musket buttstocks and foreends at a word of command from lt langlie all hands present on deck stood erect and doffed their hats the arriving officer leaned back a little gripping the tautly strung manropes for the last step of his ascent up the shelflike boarding battens that began level and a bit aft of the main chains a visitor unused to such ceremony might have deemed the officer nonplussed to stillness by the elaborateness of his welcome but it was simply his way to seize the manropes just below their terminations set below the caprail of the entryports bulwarks and jerk himself into the last step instead of groping and fumbling the caprails like some stout trullibubs or senior dodderer more in need of hoisting aboard in a bosuns chair he had barely turned his thirtysixth year this january of and was still almost boyishly spry that jerk was accompanied by a nearly playful hop or skip from the last batten to the snowy planks of the starboard gangway when the officer doffed his hat though he did so with solemn gravity so an uninitiated observer might have doubted his first playful theory said newcome lubber would have seen a slim man in his early thirties who stood three inches shy of six feet tall one who might weigh twelve or thirteen stone still wider in the shoulders than the waist a man whose snowwhite breeches and waistcoat lay trimly flat still he wore a good hardfinished blue wool shoregoing coat laced with butteryellow gilt trim on the lapels the standup blue collar the sidepocket flaps and cuffs with nine real gilt buttons on each wide turnback blue lapel a fringed giltlace epaulet sat upon the officers right shoulder too denoting him a postcaptain though one of less than three years seniority under that expensive coat lay a white leather baldric on which to hang his sword a discerning observer would have appreciated that sword a twentyfourinch hanger though he would have been puzzled by the scabbard for it was of dark blue leather not black and both throat and drag were of plain brass not gilded the hilt though was gilded and most ornate the typical lionshead pommel that swallowed the back handguard but the front guard that swelled to protect the users fist was piercedsteel like a scallop shell with a smaller second shell at the hilts forefront a discriminating man with a taste for blades would appreciate that the hanger was a gills and when drawn was nearly straight on the back edge the first eight inches honed razorsharp while the lower edge was upswept to the point so that it gave the impression of a curvedblade hanger a discriminating gentleman would have further ahhummed over the cutsteel square links of the officers watch chain and fob deeming him a man of good taste too with the officers beaver cocked hat doffed an outsider would have seen a full head of hair atop his pate still thick and all his own of a middle almost light brown a tad wavy at his temples over his ears and loosely gathered into a trim nautical sprig of a queue atop his coat collar bound with a bowknotted black silk ribbon the officer was much too sun or windburned for fashion in the better sorts salons though not completely a gentleman perhaps the lofty observer would have sniffed too much the sea dog after all the salute done lewrie clapped his hat back on his head and smiled at his first officer his darkly romantically handsome mr anthony langlie everythings in order mister langlie he asked nothing gone smash since i left the ship he gently teased no sir praise god lt langlie reported the working sail set hung slack and allowed to dry wood and watering done and mister cootes requirements stowed below sir did you ah find out ill be below and aft mr langlie capt lewrie told him in a mystifying way give me ten minutes then do attend me and i shall tell you all i have learned dismiss the hands back to their seeming drowsiness for now sir aye aye sir lt langlie crisply replied with a hand to his hat and a short sketch of a bow from the waist as capt lewrie went down the starboard ladderway to the gundeck then aft past the bulkhead door and the marine sentry to his greatcabins cool tea sir his cabin servant aspinall enquired after he had helped him out of his coat sword and baldric and hat thatd be handsome aspinall aye lewrie replied tearing at his neckstock and opening his shirt collar why hello catlins my littles and whatve you two imps been up to hey there were many glad trills and meows of welcome much butting of heads on his hessian boots perhaps a tad too much standing on hind legs and whetting claws in bienvenue at his white canvas breeches those mischievous looks from both toulon the stout and wellmuscled blackandwhite ramcat and chalky the greysmudged white yearling torn only half toulons heft warned lewrie that theyd be scaling up his thin shirt in their need to be newly adored miss me did you lewrie cooed to them a hand for each once he attained the chair behind his desk damn my eyes ye dont nip at me chalky hand that feeds and all that youll get your wubbies no fear o not yer tea sir aspinall announced after several long minutes of discrete observation as he sensed the cats enthusiasms begin to flag bridgetown didnt have no ice though sir all used up for the season i reckon cool from th orlop though sir massachusetts yankee ice never gets this far south was lewries surmise as he accepted the coinsilver commemorative tankard that the crew of his previous ship the sloop of war jester had given him just before theyd paid off at portsmouth and paced aft er no luck then sir aspinall dared to ask when ships officers would not lewrie flung himself onto the hard settee lashed to the starboard side almost sprawled with one leg up not the answers i was looking for aspinall no lewrie said busying himself with taking another sip the rob of lemons and sugar were dirt cheap in the caribbean and the sugar isles and tea was one of the most popular exports from england so aspinall brewed it by the gallon every day or so and kept it tepid at least in a pewter pitcher some days it was fresh some days it was leftovers clouded and so stout that it could rouse the deathly ill and make them prance hornpipes today it was fresh and merely refreshing no fear though sir well find em soonerr later i begin to wonder aspinall lewrie wearily said with a sigh running his free hand over his hair and leaning his head back upon the oak of the hulls inner scantling and decorative panelling pon my soul i do not only physically tired from his shore travels from riding a hired horse far out into the countryside and back lewrie was starting to feel spiritually tired no wonder since he had done everything he could conceive of had pursued every possibility no matter how tenuous and it had all seemingly resulted in a titanic nullity toulon and chalky now that hed alit hopped up for a return bout of pets for the duration of the first mug of cold tea by the refill toulon stalked off to claim his masters chair behind the desk leaving chalky to sling himself against lewries thigh wriggle and yawn then stretch out half on his back with his paws in the air and caulk down instantly dontfeelathing asleep a forceful knock on the greatcabin door the sharp thud of a brass musket butt on the deck and the cry of first awfcer sah didnt even stir chalky come lewrie responded sir langlie said hat under his arm youll pardon me mister langlie do i not get up hey lewrie said with a helpless shrug and a cock of his head in the direction of the furbag at his hip take a pew do aspinall refreshments for mister langlie thankee sir langlie answered plunking down into a leatherandwood chair that was ensembled with the settee his hat in his lap and fidgeting with expectation not of the cool tea decoction but of news at last well we found the mort known as mistress jugg lewrie told him once hed gotten his tea and had had a liberal draught of it her and the reputed girlchild that jugg spoke of capital sir langlie enthused no no it aint lewrie gloomed two months before lewries frigate had taken an easy and rich french prize near the enemyheld island of guadeloupe in the midst of confounding and capturing lewries old nemesis the fearsome guillaume choundas proteus had sailed as an independent ship with admiralty orders fetched out by foreign office secret agents the honourable mr grenville pelham an officious overvaunting twit and his much abler aide excaptain of household cavalry mr james peel their mission which everyone but pelham could charitably call a right cockup of a scheme had been to discomfit choundas and the french first off find a way to regain possession of the vast wealth of the french colony of saint domingue on hispaniola from the victorious slave rebellion led by toussaint louverture second then drag the americans and their spankingnew navy hooting and hollering into a declared war with the french or run the yankees out of the caribbean if they didnt jump through the right hoops the prize had been icing on the cake lewrie had left their prize safely at anchor in prince rupert bay in the hands of the local admiralty court with six crewmembers off proteus for her harbour watch not two weeks later though their prize had vanished the dimwits of the dominica prize court had flung up their shoulders and mumbled well its a mystry but the prize her bonded cargo and his five sailors and one midshipman were missing with her lost absconded had she been left at antigua and auctioned off she might have fetched them all over and would still have safely been there the eternally sozzled incompetents of the dominica court admitted that a man claiming to be the prizes quartermasters mate had come ashore at the sleepy port of roseau sculling a boat by himself saying that if a certain time period had elapsed without proteuss return to dominica his captain had left verbal orders to sail her to the court at antiqua to which roseaus court was ancillary theyd been so lax in their dealings they couldnt even adequately describe him but theyd let him sail anyway the thoughtless clods lewrie had left midshipman burns his bosuns mate mr towpenny three other hands and quartermasters mate toby jugg aboard the prize and toby jugg was a man to be leery of after all theyd pressed him off a yankee brig engaged in smuggling arms to the french and rebel slaves on saintdomingue in the danish virgins the year before american certificates of citizenshipeither forged false or merely purchased from yankee consulsbedamned jugg had appeared as british as john bull and liable to the press no matter where he was found juggs plaint of an impoverished wife and daughter on barbados had prompted lewrie to suggest jugg take the guinea joining bounty to forward on to support his wife and child hed even promoted the man to able seaman then quartermasters mate but if toby jugg had found a way to overpower or beguile the rest of the hands been glib enough to get them to desert with the prize to an enemy port where theyd be safe from capture in the future for the crime sell her off for half her potential value and go shares so each would be rich and idle for life well had jugg been aided by former associates whod slunk into the bay to wood and water or look for an easy capture had he encountered criminal jetsam loafing ashore on dominica whod put him up to it dammit jugg had been the only royal navy quartermasters mate in port hadnt he the court officers said the man had worn a navy mans uniform had an easy gruff air of command about him as a mate should and sounded fluent in his english so who else could it have been waving his admiralty orders as an independent ship as a license to steal lewrie had taken proteus in search of his missing men and the value of the prize and her cargo with a vengeance it had been a blow to his pride to his offered trust a slap in the face as bad as if his whole crew had mutinied in point of fact the missing toby jugg was becoming about as huge a bete noire to him as guillaume choundas had ever been now after weeks and weeks of searching of quartering the sea it appeared that the trail had gone completely cold and any hope lewrie had of rescuing his missing people was completely dashed his last best hope had been here on barbados in the hills lewrie padgett and coxn andrews had boated ashore talked to officials tradesmen dock workers and idlers his clerk padgett proved most useful in discovering that for a while a man named tobias hosier formerly a seaman by trade had farmed a small patch of land inland in saint thomas parish near a tiny place called welsh hell gully south of mount hillaby said tobias hosier had been slightly remiss in the tax collectors books at government house here in bridgetown but his shortfall of sp had been made good about seven months before which happily coincided with the time it would have taken for the noteofhand on his joining bounty to have arrived by mailpacket from jamaica where it had been posted any more information especially a physical description of this tobias or toby as opposed to the two or three hundred other settlers anointed with that christian name any further information about him would be the preserve of the parish authorities padgett was told that further search had involved runty hired horses the roads being almost impossible for a more comfortable coach and nearly six miserable miles upwards and inland with nary a hope of even a mean dinner or potable refreshments along the way the local magistrate your typical bluff squire was not available though his recumbent form could be espied sprawled on a settee in his parlour through the open double doors facing the front gallery of his imposing manor and his snores were loud enough to unnerve the horses both the vicar and his assisting curate were off tending to good worksthough they had trotted off on their best hunters clad in field clothing bearing fowling guns and animatedly conversing about ringnecked peasants or something such like as the dour housekeeper of the vicars manse told them rather brusquely between yawns evidently folk did a deal of napping in welsh hell gully trust to coxn andrews though to chat up the cuffies who worked at the hamlets tumbledown public house where they dined to learn that missah tobias matched the physical description of toby jugg to a tee and where his acreage could be found off theyd gone after an indifferent dinner but two tankards of rather good ale to the good each to seek out hosier hall mistress hosier i presume lewrie had said by way of enquiry he stood with hat in hand at the edge of the front gallery to a onestory house made of coral tabby blocks ballast stones and weathered scrap lumber the gallery wasnt a foot off the ground its planks uneven and sagging though the long overhang of the roof thatched from sugarcane stalks or bamboo or whatever fell to hand on barbados gave a more than welcome shade and the raised gallery that spanned the entire house did provide at least ten degrees of relief from the noonday sun or should i say mistress jugg lewrie added keeping a mild and unthreatening smile on his phyz oh saints presarve us the faded fubsy woman cried fanning herself with her stained housewife apron turning pale and fretful under her tropical island colour summats happened ttoby are ye come ttell me faith i she said gulping and collapsing in a rickety porch chair past the open door of the verticalboard house lewrie could espy a girlchild in a simple shift barelegged and barefoot coming out to the gallery from the inner gloom holding a squirming puppy the taxes on windows that london enforced mostlike also were imposed on barbados lewrie thought there was enough light though to note that a cradle took pride of place inside one still rocking one occupied by a baby in swaddles and not above a year old allow me to name myself to you mistress lewrie said captain alan lewrie of the proteus frigate ive tobys ship the woman cried lips trembling now and both hands lifted to her mouth as if to press back grief or chew her nails oh god that sounded as if it was wrung from her by a mangle th poor mans daid ant he oh swayet jaysus uh no mistress jugg hosier lewrie countered he the wife was beginning to sob into her cupped hands the little girl was beginning to blub too though for what reason she had yet to be told christ even the babe in the cradle had wakened and added querulous hiccoughy wailettes of its own hes alive and well we think lewrie was quick to inform hes run dye mean mistress whichever snapped going squintyeyed and flinty of a sudden all grief quite flown her an yere here ttake him back ye are tflog im courtmartial im find him aye mistress uh lewrie assured her daring to put one booted foot on the gallery thanking god that the juggshosiers could cut off their squawls so quickly the girlchild still sniffled but hadnt worked up to a fullblown howl and was now almost content to clamber up into her mothers lap still clasping the longeared pup to her chest and the cradled babe trained to stealthiness perhaps by a visiting muskogee or seminolee indian had gurgled back to drowsiness find our other missing people too missin dye say then missin missin how sir juggs woman warily enquired hesh up now tess she urged her girl lewrie daring to step up onto the gallery even to drag up a second equally rickety chair and seat himself fanning away the tropic heat and the many insects with his hat explained about the missing prize ship and the hands he had left aboard to safeguard her la arrah the woman said at last with a weary sigh tess cooshlin jump down an see tyer brother an mind yer puppy don make in th house nor get in th cradle an smither im she waited til the little girl had slid down from her lap and had toddled off inside dried her eyes for good and all with the hem of her apron then heaved a long bitter sigh and stared outwards unfocussed on her meagre acreage be mortalcairtain yer sinsll find ye out she whispered maam lewrie gently asked sure that the woman would confess juggs whereabouts did he play his cards right a little longer pore toby arrah she muttered with another long sigh all is work and sweat all

brightly covered th storekeepers ledger crop tcrop season tseason whatever surname she went by juggs woman had at one time been a tolerably fetching wench lewrie judged she was going stout after two children but had the sly eye and vixenish swayhipped carriage of a bouncy irish sort dark frazzled redauburn hair snappy green eyes high merry cheekbones and a wide and generous mouth in the caribbean she was quite the catch for a man of juggs social position what sins maam lewrie pressed the usual young tars privateersmans sins juggs mate admitted turning sadder jumpin ship sins deserters sins

asked hah was her answer to that and to lewries mystification she went into the house leaving him stewing on her porch not a minute later though she returned bearing a large painted mug much like a german beer stein along with several tattered letters she sat then showed him the mug it was large enough for two pints slightly tapering with two stout handles and a china lid like a teapots one side was crudely painted with a sailing ship the other showed a tarhatted sailor with a sea chest at his feet and a sea bag over his shoulder tis th jug we keep on th mantel she coyly imparted some o th

having a good guilty squirm to imagine that the tale of his accepting runaway slaves from the despised beauman familys plantations to take the kings shilling as it were as freedmen able to decide their own fate aye an he did she huffily continued he wrote me letters in is own hand mind ant no scholard is me toby but he can manage sure writin readin an ledgerin good as any man sos we wont be cheated like somed try and he said nothing to you of wishing to run of any scheme to make off with the prize or lewrie doggedly pursued nought but four letters from im did i get sir she informed him th last four month ago run aye an what sailor wouldnt long before the prize disappeared hmm lewrie muttered his spirits sinking at the thought that hed been on a wild goose chase all this time might i be so bold mistress hosier as to see the last couple of letters to see if theres anything any hint of mummy piddle little tess urgently said from the cabin door swab it then shoo that dog out and no mummy baby piddled wee tess amended see tess wriggled damp fingers then the babe within began to carp and wail so mrs hosier whomever leaped to her feet and scornfully flung her husbands letters at him before entering the house there to make soothing but frazzled noises as lewrie sorted the crinkly sheets he could be forgiven perhaps for a slightly smug and amused tetch of relief that all of his three legitimate children and both his byblows were long past swaddles piddles and poops thet damt lt caterall hoo thinx himsef so clevver but wat a buffelhed ferst off lt langlie spelled correctly for a wonder rites capts ward mooncaff in luv capts pett so is lt adare phonetically he supposed top lofty too smart by haff afavryte capt loory a close approximation the idel basterd him his catts all spoony over them tho thay piss on hammok netts we must sleep in them mr pendarves towpenny the bos n mate ar hard men never take calls from ther lipps tis a hard life the navy dear lewrie wished he could take the letters along or find paper and pen to make some notes for jugg had chuckled over the way some of the crew were getting their hands on smuggled rum or american corn whisky and where it was usually hidden how the assistant and clerk to the purser mr coote the jackinthebreadroom was working a fiddle in tobacco twists and sundries that he concealed in the fishroom all about the breadroom and cabletier rats being bred where they were pitted in battle how they were fed off wardroom flour and cornmeal thanks to the pussers aide too how the marine complements trinidad hindoo mongoose was unfair competition what bloody mongoose lewrie silently gawped and how did they smuggle that aboard weve never been tbloody trinidad oh it was a rare and embarrassing glimpse into the lives of the people before the mast their complaints and sorrows so well hidden from officers under a mask of rote duty jugg himself sullen and truculent embittered against those over him those with admiraltyordained rank or social position with inherited money or soft hands indeed he steered a quarterpoint alee of mute insubordination boasted of it to his wife whether dealing with captain or officers as eagerly as he would with a mainmast or guncaptain with the power to order him about so brusquely toby jugg or hosier or warderwhatever he truly named himself would never be a glad hand no matter were he promoted to bosun or fleet admiral yet jugg for all his simmering grievances his ability to doff his hat cry aye aye sir and tug his forelock and smile while supping on his superiors shite evinced no mutinous plots schemed none and reported none nowhere in his letters did he sound like a man who would run begrudgingly jugg admitted that he had settled in tolerably well that proteus was a competently run frigate whose mates and officers knew their professions and that she was mostly a happy ship was rated able rite off and struk for qwartermasters mate hah me in a red wesket butt sailing master winwood putt my name for d am now rated serving on the helm at lest proteus is ever in the way of fyteing as all frigates the capt betes the kings enemmys ever dear it looks fare to be prime for prize monie capt tho is madd for qwim thay call him ram catt not for his petts embarrassing aye to think how much of his personal private life his sailors and jugg knew jugg had learned about his american bastard son desmond mcgilliveray knew all about theoni connor back in london and his other byblow alan michael connor how his wife caroline was chewing brass rags over his peccadilloes and that there was a dear friend somewhere back in europe now that narrowed it down didnt it whod written anonymous yourhusbandsaswine letters and how the handshis trusted ships peoplecrammed fists into their mouths to keep from howling and chortling out loud over his doings thay reck her a lucky ship tho dearun for her lawnching was rite odd she wud not swimm stuck on the ways as proteus butt gott haffway when thay ferst name her merlin butt change it an irish sawyer hiz son whisper to her stemmpiece then she swamm capt loory is sayd to seen selkies sum say he has there favour sure jugg had also been struck that proteus was a musical ship when the work allowed and hed quite enjoyed that liam desmond his lap pipes ar capital we hev gudd fiddlers mr rain

english hoo d shutt us up call us mutinuss he d been coming round lewrie sadly thought letting the note drop to his lap better the devil you know spose jugg had had a snug berth promotion and decent pay shares in proteuss prize money acceptable shipmates and no obvious grievances most deserters took leg bail within the first few weeks or months aboard til they established a personal investment there were some whod run after getting the joining bounty before their kits were deducted then enlist under a fresh name at another recruiting rendezvous but jugg hadnt had that chance perhaps wasnt even that sort after all damn lewrie dejectedly muttered as mrs hosier came back out to the porch and sat down again a jutted hand silently demanded her precious letters and he handed them over she fondly straightened them and pressed them fiat with a palm as if ironing them before she tucked them away in an apron pocket toby warnt th one pirated yer ship capm lewrie not him juggs wife said hed never else wed lose evrything weve built up did he haveta run an change names again i thought that hed if he had that hed come to barbados to fetch you and the children lewrie confessed a little chagrined youre sure youve not heard from him he didnt nary a word since that last letter she firmly stated chin up and sullen at his accusation nor nary a sight o him at least twelve month or more when the boy was quickened huh she snorted derisively had he stole a rich prize ye think id still be grubbin at this farm that wed still be livin in a pore shebeen like this im cairtain ye already asked down at th harbour an know neither that prize ship nor toby has come in here ant it sor admitted lewried grudgingly allowed so when ye do find it if eer ye do yell already know me toby didn steal her an an whoever did theyd not be th sort tlet him live mrs jugg teared up and began to blub again that sortd want no witnesses oh arrah maam lewrie said springing to his feet at her upset damn is eyes but i almost wish e had took her sure for he would still be livin if he did she sniffled blowing her nose on her fingers an bad cess tye at findin him for youd hang him cairtain do ye have to la la whatll we do wi toby gone lewrie blushed and dug into his breeches pocket for his coinpurse he counted out about eight shillings and the odd pence in real coinage and a waddedup pound note call it bringing his pay up to date maam and im sorry that i cannot do more navy paymasters id no take yer charity capm lewrie mrs jugg huffed back scraping up all her dignity but aye needs must sure call it hardearned pay but a beggars price for me tobys life for all that id fling yer paltry silver back an spit in yer eye arrah she said rising stiffbacked and arms crossed over her chest but th pore cant have no scruples not in this life not like quality folk like your foin self sir an now ill thankee tbe departin me lands capm lewrie of course maam lewrie said gathering up his hat mind is your husband innocent and if i find him i promise ill fetch him back to you safe and sound unlashed and not disrated promises from yer like is fiddlers pay capm lewrie she said for so tis been my experience sure how can ye promise such when oh fash she swept her hair back from her brows in exasperation dont go makin promises ye dont mean tkeep or promises ye mostlike can never keep is my meanin i would admire howiver it falls that somebodyd write an let me know i shall mistress jugg hosier damme which do you prefer to which do i write without confusing the postboy hosierd do goodbye mistress hosier lewrie said bowing himself back off the porch and doffing his hat with a sociable bow despite what anger she felt mrs jugg for so he thought her anyway dropped him a bobbing little housemaids curtsy then squinted her eyes in embarrassment the next second to have such a servile habit so engrained in herself arrah so the trails gone cold as old boiled mutton sir langlie gathered glumly sipping the last of his mug of cool tea phantom spectral false trails are never hot enough to cool mister langlie lewrie sourly rejoined weve wasted nigh onto two whole months staggering from port to port down the whole windwards and no ones seen them bloody fools errand the prize is mostlike in cartagena tampico havana or verabloodycruz by now and has been all this time therefore untouchable thout a major military expedition damn and our people are mostlike a longtime dead lt langlie further supposed without jugg as a culprit i cannot imagine any of the others capable of the deed toffett ahern and luckaby were good men and certainly not mister towpenny or mister burns unless that lackwit burns couldnt keep them in control they found some liquor that we missed and it got out of hand lewrie said to the overhead and the deck beams a fight a knifing and a murder and they ran off with the ship out of fear not hope of gain we both know how insensible poor tars can get and how quickly and so quick to quarrel on a bungfull of rum a goodly number of men who enlisted in the army a goodly share of sailors willing volunteers or pressganged failures did it for a reliable daily issue of grog where the term groggy came from well weve searched everywhere we possibly could except for trinidad and tobago and the dutch isles down south lewrie grumbled cocking his head to a chart of the west indies that had been pinned to the larboard side of his daycabin for months on end weve prowled every cay and rock in the grenadines and havent found a sign of em id say its time mister langlie that we confess our failures then sail back to antigua and face the music then on to jamaica where we belong damme though captain sir edward bloody charles very well sir langlie glumly agreed shore liberty sir hmm oh aye lewrie decided weve worked the people hard and theyve earned a run ashore bridgetown isnt a bad port for em lots to do and the shore officials are reputed to be cooperative at huntin down runners larboard watch first at the end of the morning watch and back aboard by eight bells midnight with the usual caution for troublemakers and deserters that if they run or run wild the starbowlines wont be allowed sir first officer langlie said with a twinkle just so sir lewrie tiredly snickered back and whilst the larboard watch is ashore mister langlie you are going to become some sort of legend sir theres trade in smuggled rum and spirits aboard lewrie said reaching into a waistcoat pocket to withdraw a hastily scribbled list hed made at a harbour tavern while waiting for a hired boat to convey him back aboard here are the likely places to look this time at any rate you will also have a word with mister coote in the privacy of your mess and inform him that that jackanapes clerk of his sells smuggled tobacco at half the official price bits and pieces cut off mister cootes supply god knows what all else he deals in but he stashes it in a falseside keg in the fishroom under the tiller flat my word sir how did you langlie all but gasped sitting up straighter juggs chatty letters to his wife lewrie chuckled the man is also skimming off your wardrooms flour and cornmeal to fatten the rats they fight in the cabletiers and the forrud orlop rat fights sir rat on rat lewrie said beaming for want of terriers wagers are laid on em and ill not have it well now that you mention it sir i had noticed a diminution in the number of rats aboard lately lt langlie said making notes of his own with a pencil stub and his everpresent pocket notebook though i did put it down to the midshipmens appetites they dont have that brutus look do they lewrie mused no lean and hungry air probably purchasing the dead losers from the fights langlie laughed aye sir i will see to all of it damme the people will think you have eyes in the back of yer head mister langlie lewrie crowed that youre a dark devilish wizard who knows all and sees all mostlike ask you to take augury on chicken guts next hold one of those gothick seances speak to the dead only for people who could pay i would sir langlie replied speakin of chickens sir langlie enquired pencil poised havent some of the chickens gone missing lately well aye sir and so they have forgive me but i did suspect that your cats had um langlie said squirming and blushing its the mongoose more like lewrie offhandedly told him beg pardon sir mongoose did ye say langlie gawped in perplexity it wasnt often that his efficient first lieutenant wore a bewildered nigh crosseyed expression but he produced a passable facsimile mongoose the marines mongoose lewrie assured him blue riband champion hindoo ratkillin emigrant mongoose from trinidad or so i learned its been beatin the sailors best rats and they dont much care for it so its creating bad blood find it mister langlie run it to earth its probably been keepin its hand in by practicing on creatures in the manger up forrud thats where all our chickens have gone id wager find a mongoose and get rid of it sir aye langlie said as he scribbled into his little book well if all else fails definitely put a stop to the fights and definitely spare our fowl lewrie breezed on do the marines put so much stock in the beast well i dont much care whether it serves as a mascot with a red riband round its neck long as no one thinks tbring snakes aboard for it to fight i spose ill recognise a mongoose when i see one sir like an ermine or a ferret lewrie chuckled like an smallish otter with a talent for killin cobras and such ah langlie rejoined i see sir i think perhaps we may declare it the ships official ratter so long as no more wagersr made on its prowess thats what i like about you mister langlie lewrie smiled your flexibility in the face of unlookedfor adversity i believe thatll be all for now mister langlie that should be enough on yer plate for the nonce oh agreed sir agreed langlie said rising and departing chapter two hms proteus s return to english harbour antigua was actually not necessary and mostly unproductive the frigates mail was still being held at kingston jamaica by the authorities of the west indies station to which fleet she still putatively belonged even after her long sojourn thankfully lewries personal devils of late mr pelham and mr peel had long departed antigua for other climesall the way back to london lewrie fervently wished so he could live his life free of their cynical machinations ever more antiguas admiralty house atop mt shirley held only one letter for him and that from his newfound bastard son desmond mcgilliveray now a sixteenyearold midshipman aboard his uncles and the captains united states navy armed ship the thomas sumter desmond sounded as if he was thriving at his new profession so eerily coincidental to alans own sumter had just embarked upon arduous and boresome escort duties to convoy a trade of yankee merchantmen home and mostlike would put back into her homeport of charleston south carolina for refitting and provisioning young desmond chirped rightmerry over the prospects of how much prize money might result from sumtersand her small squadronsrecent captures in the caribbean french merchant ships and several warships tooones that lewrie had led them to twice using the reborn us navy as british cats paws in pelhams and peels scheme desmond enthused how halfseasover his hometown would be when they arrived with prizes in tow how famous they might be once the news spread from maine to georgia how eager he was to see his adoptive family once more and backhandedly desmond came close to boasting of a much better reception in charleston society than he once had strutting proudly in his uniform a newminted hero and promising gentleman seafarer which beat being shunned as a halfwhite halfmuskogee indian orphan all hollow lewrie sadly suspected desmond happily enquired about chalky too how large or playful the kitten had grown etc hed been desmonds gift found shivering and cowering on the boattier beams of a french capture rescued then shyly presented to the father hed never known so heartbreakingly eager to please to win lewries affection his claiming lewrie looked over at the settee where chalky sprawled teeth and little paws killing a cushions tassel and thought again quite possibly for the thousandth time that the lad had meant well but his fears for desmonds continued safety were allayed by news of guillaume choundas being detained on his parole aboard the uss hancock that monstrous frigate which still cruised the caribbean even so did choundas ever learn the boys parentage the seemingly indefatigable ogre might find a way to harm him to get even with lewrie with a fond smile lewrie set desmonds letter aside and pulled out the inkwell and one of his newfangled frenchinvented steelnib pens one more parting gift from the lad off a defeated french corvette to pen him a quick answer for mailing after the britishamerican riots when proteus was last in english harbour he was pretty sure that the local authorities would wish them gone as soon as theyd wooded and watered and not stand upon the order of their going either his working parties ashore were already limited to the docks area and that under the wary guard of the local garrison no proteus had already been absent long enoughit was time for a fond return to the bosom of admiral sir hyde parkers fleet on jamaica and the warm ministrations of the fleets staff captain sir edward bloody charles chapter three kingstonand old port royal or what was left of it after the infamous earthquake many years beforewas an ideal anchorage protected from hurricane winds and winter gales by the blue mountains but lord it could be a careerender to approach if one were ignorant of its dangers lime cay rackams cay and gun cay drunken mans cay christ you could see those could spot three miles of rocks and shoalwater reefs that stretched souwest to noreast beginning four miles south of fort charles at the tip of the palisades the reefs though like great and little portuguese and salt pond reef on the western approachesit took an experienced master or a knacky harbour pilot who knew the sea bottom as well as he knew his wifes and this time they had drawn the short straw and gotten a pilot with whom they had never worked one so blithely casual and dismissive of impending danger he had actually made that grave and sober christian mr winwood the sailing master throw parallel rules and brass dividers and curse he had come aboard with the dissembling gravitas of your practiced toper and had only started to slur titter and reveal himself as three sheets to the wind after they were committed halfway into the maze inshore of the great portuguese and it hadnt helped the deck officers the captain included that mere seconds after they had made their number to fort charles and had begun the required gunsalute to the flag that a signal had come in reply for her captain to repair on boardwhich in this case meant for lewrie to depart the ship instanter if not earlier and get his arse over to the fort giddy house or admiralty house in haste well done sir lewrie said doffing his hat to catterall and langlie as he readied to disembark given the circumstances and the pilots state had i known id have not asked it of you yet my congratulations for coping so well mister catterall erm thankee sir catterall responded greatly pleased at the unlookedfor compliment though still wheezing and swabbing perspiration my permission to hoist a full bumper lewrie continued with a sly wink you more than earned it god knows gentlemen with his reports and bearing his log just in case it might be required lewrie took the salute of the crew and sideparty and went down into his gig which had been towed astern in fear that his rapid reporting would be demanded the transition from sunlight to dim coolness almost made lewrie sneeze as he stopped by the hall porters station to ply a damp cool towel on his face and neck before confronting authority the weather actually was quite mild the daytime temperatures averaging in the low to mideighties but no matter the season the caribbean sun was still a farriers hammer combine that with lewries trepidation of rencontre with the wine keg capt sir edward charles whose animus hed roused through no fault of his own after nearly half a year of swanning about as free of navy control as so many larks and it was no wonder that he could feel moisture under his clothes in his nether regions once dried lewrie put the best face on it and nearly marched down the long gloomy hallway the hard leather heels of his gilttasseled hessian boots ringing off the plank floor and the hard plaster and shiny paint of the walls he attained those fearsome double doors so heavy and intricately panelled so glossy with linseed oil or beeswax polish hell was said to be alluring lewrie considered as he took a deep breath and heaved a sigh from the outside at least before one got past its portals he tugged his waistcoat shirt cuffs his sword baldric and neckstock into pristine order even gave the short ribbonbound queue atop his collar a nervous tug before knocking the double doors resounded with a sound not unlike doom doom go the bloody hell away someone inside shouted gladly lewrie replied without a thought feeling as if he was back in public school one of many he had attended at one time or another and had come for a welldeserved caning only to discover that the headmaster or proctor was sick may i take my frigate with me when i do he could not resist quipping there came a muttered something mighty like a suppressed curse then an aggrieved growl of enter lewrie pulled on the ornate brass handles and swung the doors back revealing that dread office that heaped desk awash under working papers the bookshelves spilling over with loose stacks of it and several wineglasses all used since sunrise wait a bit mine arse on a bandbox lewrie expostulated the shelves were neatly stacked all correspondence bound up in various coloured ribbons the desktop could actually be seen the books and ledgers were arranged in what lewrie could only take for a proper order and the only potables in sight was the coinsilver coffee set and tray on a sideboard neath the large northfacing windows a set of porcelain cups three candles burning under a more plebeian blackiron pot so you finally turned up have you scoffed the postcaptain standing behind the desk minus his uniform coat captain nicely lewrie gawped in utter surprise unfortunately that worthy said waving a weary hand over the neatbutdaunting stacks of paperwork come in come in captain and pray do pour yourself a cup do you enjoy coffee take a pew sir er thankee sir lewrie said feeling much more at ease he did pour a cup of coffee stirred in some local sugar and sniffed at the cream then poured in a dollop of that as well taking an appreciative sip before seating himself with his canvasbound packet on the other chair hmmm he added smacking his lips hope you dont mind goats milk nicely said but its fresher than cows just out back dye see drawn off the teat this dawn so it has no time to go over does the sugar run low at sea theres nothing like a dollop of sweet goats milk up til now id always thought it too sweet sir but leave off the sugar use a level teaspoons worth not a heaping nicely suggested seating himself behind the desk and perking up brisker and what have you brought me lewrie more paperwork to read initial pass on and file my aint you the fine giftgiver in their brief acquaintance lewrie had quite liked nicely he was so aptly named he was a squarely built older fellow one of those gentlemen who simply oozed confidence competence and reliability nicely was a bluff older sea dog but one with a wry and infectious sense of humouror ironyto go with his merry blue eyes brisk efficient yet droll he was a most congenial sort nicely had done lewrie several kindnesses at portauprince before the evacuation of the army from saintdomingue when nicely aboard hms obdurate had held temporary command of that harbour and after all lewrie had come in with complaints from capt george blaylock of hms halifax nicely and blaylock had been nigh mortal enemies since their midshipman days and since the enemy of my enemy is my friend applied to royal navy politics lewrie and nicely had turned out to be catercousinly sorry sir but i fear i must lewrie said setting aside his coffee to hand over his bundled packet weve been under independent orders at the behest of some people from the foreign office so heard all about that nicely breezed off so i fear that you wasted a deal of ink and paper documenting your doings sub rosa they were so theyll remain i take it that mister pelham and mister peel returned to jamaica before we did then sir lewrie surmised well damme it sounded like high adventures lewrie nicely said with a wry smirk beats fruitless cruising at any rate oh some snippets of your activities might appear in the gazette or the marine chronicle back home but the bulk of it nicely gave a shiver of denial a larger questiond be where the devil have you been since well thats a tad embarrassin really lewrie replied and tugged at his neckstock he crossed his legs involuntarily oh good nicely chirped do lewrie tell me all when the sorry tale was over nicely still beamed as if he had known some of the affair beforehand or was sitting on a secret as smug as a broodyhen with an iknowsomethingyoudontknow smile why damme captain lewrie nicely chid him in mock displeasure as he rose and got himself a fresh cup of coffee with milk only and not a dab of sugar youve been yachting you idle fop swanning from one liberty port to the next sightseeing every island in the caribbean and all at his majestys expense unlawful absconding with admiralty property too why my predecessor wouldve hacked your balls off done em in sweetmeats sauce and heavy cream by the way sir lewrie enquired in hopes perhaps that what grief he was about to suffer might be delayed a moment more like one of those headmasters canings where is sir edward dead as bloody mutton nicely told him with a grimace spoon tinkling a little louder in his fine china cup turned as yellow as quince and expired a week later physicians suspect twas his kidneys and liver finally rebelled at all the cheap spirits hed imbibed since his mothers paps were taken from him is my guess bugger all this mate its mutiny i spose they said to each other there belowdecks as it were he passed over three months ago just after we brought the lineofbattle ships back from halifax once hurricane season was over my condolences sir lewrie soberly said for the wine keg nicely scoffed no for you sir lewrie amended i spose you had to give up obdurate to take this well call it a promotion at the least aye i did dammit nicely groused seating himself once more best twodecker on the west indies station if i do say so myself and i do staff drudgery well something id been fortunate enough to miss til now sir hyde gave me no choice in the matter just said i was best for the post how careerenhancing itd be and all of that flummery then gave obdurate to one of his favourite frigate captains then gave said frigate to a junior captain shuffled another junior off a leaky sloop of war promoted a brigsloop commander into her made a lieutenant into commander for the brigsloop made a midshipman into a lieutenant in his flagships wardroom as a replacement nicely had a bleak look out his windows at real ships at anchor looking famished interest and favour or they all owe the admiral money or he owes their families but you know how the navy works lewrie refilled his coffee stinting on the sugar this time what could be said he wondered to himself shouldnt have joined if ye cant take a joke its a cruel old world and thats its way didnt bury captain charles here lewrie nicely further griped lumbered the old fellow into a beef barrel and filled it up with accidentally salted and condemned rum then shipped him to his loving family in england blieve it or not sir he actually had one lewrie could not keep his sniggering to himself at that news speaking ill of the dead nicely chid him you heathen springs to mind sir how apt it was to pickle him lewrie chortled setting his cup down before he spilled or broke it as a wave of titters took him and was there a tinge of saltwater in his keg thats the closest hed been to the genuine article in years if you cant say something good about the dead say not a word twas the old adage nicely replied grinning himself though hes dead good lewrie snickered aye well i doubt the rum was necessary sir edward was a fair way towards pickling himself long before his casking damn his jinglebrained ways to hell as much miss taylor black strap and rum went missing from stores all with sir edwards signature affixed tis a wonder he drew a waking breath much less a sober one nicely confided oned suspect malfeasance in office selling it off by the odd hundred gallons to shore merchants but no i suspect he drank it you cannot imagine what a bloody potmess this office was and how much labour its taken just to get it caught up and the sorriest thing lewrie capt nicely continued is just how little work is necessary now its all tiddly and clackin along like a hallway clock i am bored lewrie bored to tears there are too many hours in the day and damn you for havin so much fun at sea even if you didnt know where you were going or where you were when you got there my sincerest condolences again sir lewrie offered with his right hand over his heart and his eyes downcast for a sober moment know what youre thinkin so long as it aint me hey something very like that in truth captain nicely lewrie had to admit yes well nicely gruffly said shrugging finish your coffee lewrie and well coach down to the hospital youve a little surprise in store sir lewrie asked as nicely flung on his sword belt his ornate uniform coat and got his hat down from a bookshelf the hospital do you say cant get your rich prize ship back for you but we did recover your missing crewmen picked em up from theyre alive sir lewrie gawped springing to his feet aye most nicely said with a brief moue of chagrin and a quartermasters mate name of toby jugg too sir lewrie pressed he was recovered as well blieve that was one of the names captain lewrie why cause he just may be the bastard who arranged her taking well lets go sort it out then nicely said leading the way towards the double doors a stringypale and much harassed lieutenant came barging in shuffling a loose stack of papers and muttering under his breath fidditch nicely barked almost startling the poor young man out of a years growth making him go ashen cuttyeyed and fumblefingered whistle up me coach mister fidditch theres a good inksniff you poor putupon catchfart aye aye sir directly good lad really nicely commented as they drumechoed their boots down that long cool hallway not a dab o interest with admiralty in the world though and i need someone to abuse damme chapter four god bless ye capm lewrie sir bosuns mate towpenny cried in delight as lewrie entered their ward in the naval shore hospital on the palisades peninsula saw good ol proteus come in we did capm an i told em twouldnt be long before we got reclaimed towpenny waved a hand at the large open windows that faced the harbour approaches the louvred bahamian storm shutters propped high to provide shade yet still allow fresh air to circulate the windowpanes were small though reasonably clear and clean the lower halves of the sashes quite tropically homeybut for the iron bars that kept grateful recipients of his majestys care from deserting as soon as they were ambulatory lewrie took a quick census his eyes darting about the room and plucking names from memory towpenny able seaman ahern the teenaged topman willy toffett able seaman luckaby midshipman mr burns was not there but mostlike in a gentlemans ward and quartermaster jugg his eyes blared and his lips parted in astonishment to see toby jugg sitting on a cot near one of the windows what the devils he doin here why didnt he run if he ah sorry it took a while mister towpenny lads he managed to say gulping down his shock after a moment he strode about the room clapping them all on the back even the reluctantlooking jugg to congratulate them on their survival squeamish though as he looked into juggs eyes and patted his shoulder with false bonhomie squeamish too ready to clap a hand over his nose as the reek of the hospital caught up with him an ageold reek of blood pus and vomit of feversweat and flesh rot god how many thousands had died here in the tropics of fevers with battle wounds the rare cause it would be days lewrie had been told before his hands could be released even on light duties after their ordeal all were badly sunburned some peeling in rawbeef sheets their lips dryly cracked exposed skin spotted with lanced and draining saltwater boils able seaman ahern was the worst off still bedridden hed drunk seawater now lads just what the devil happened to you lewrie at last demanded taking a seat on a cot and fanning away the heat twas two hours into th middle watch sir towpenny said by way of a beginning mister burns toffett here and ahern over yonder was the watchstanders th rest of us caulkin below coordin to what theyve told me th first thing they knowed there come a wee thumpin of boats comin alongside sir then nigh on two dozen pirates got on deck and blink of an eye an they was just there sir willy toffett declared knives an cutlasses tour throats and twas nothin that we could do een tcry out three or four teach of us capm sir not a sound did they make sir towpenny started again after bestowing a sour whostellinthis glare at young toffett first i knowed there were three on me draggin me out me cot wed took over th wardroom cabins dye see a brief lark a few days luxury that to loll in private in a small canvasanddeal partition chamber normally reserved for officers or merchantmens mates in substantial bedcots not hammocks with elbow room to yawn and stretch not the fourteen to eighteen inches per man of swaying room on the gundeck convenient to the weather decks with fresh bedding and linens real chairs and a glossy table at which to dine as temporary civilian gentlemen of the quality black or dark grey boats and oars dark clothin and all done thout a sound above a whisper sir towpenny related still so impressed by their discipline that he shook his head in wonder two months later time they got us all bound gagged and blindfolded sir and manacled down in the after hold theyd got a way on her so quick they mustve cut the anchor cables who were they mister towpenny lewrie pressed privateers or pirates french or spanish he asked eying jugg askance claimed tbe french privateers sir towpenny related but we heard as much spanish palaver as we did frog so we werent sure even at th last a dayr two outta dominica they fetched us up we seen their schooner the reunion they called her but a big twomaster she woz sir toffett stuck in bouncing on his cot to add his share of their harrowing tale masts sails and upperworks grey as dusk capm blackhulled though black as them devils hearts the young topman spat red gunnls an boottop stripe too dont forget hey able seaman luckaby added through cracked and puffy lips reviv or summat like that woz wot i heardm call her ahern croaked from a raw throat propped up on one elbow two names that bitch had you heard it right jugg wot woz it ye said the revenant jugg gruffly supplied in a growl seated apart on his cot by the windows still means the ghost i think aye sir ahern snarled a ghost she were right enough and it was reported that ah you went ashore by yourself to the dominica court s office jugg lewrie asked raising a hand to quell the indignantly excited babble i was told you were the one to ask permission to sail the prize over to antigua nossir twerent me jugg objected his first sign of animation he left off paring slices of antiscorbutic apples that he ate off his knife blade to defend himself twas one o them pirates wot took mister towpennys coat an hat an went ashore real tall lean older man wot spoke english right good spanish an french just as easy got tacked on ats th way o hit sir axed our names at th point of a dagger ey did i see lewrie said after a long and leery pause to mull that over it would seem that all his preconceptions about the taking of the prize had been as wrong as his guesses as to where shed gone and might have been recaptured damme though lewrie thought juggs still lookin as shiftyeyed as a pickpocket i still think he knows more than hes telling old shipmates of his did it did he recognise anyone or lewrie frowned realising that for now he would have to take their collective word for it even juggs what happened after that lewrie asked instead once we sailed sir they kep us in irons down on th orlop willy toffett eagerly took up the tale sometimes theyd remember tfeed us an give us water sometimes not change out our shites or force us tmake in our clothes the like we woz nothin ey did ahern snarled from his bedcot like wed be dead as th rest when ey got round to it four five days twas rare quiet sir mr towpenny related in a weary voice felt like we were sailin large the winds on the starboard quarter most th time bound mostly westerly capm fifth or sixth day we heard em clearin for action an we were hopin it was one o ours but she turned out tbe a spaniard and she got took right quick wotd they say bout her jugg you savvied em that she woz a spanish cutter mebbe a guarda costa or a kendo movement ship anyways jugg warily supplied arms crossed on his deep chest made em right happy by th sounds of it smelled like a slaver tme mr towpenny objected hush at woz th firstun ahern quibbled a slaver sure cant mistake th stink twoz th second prize woz th guarda costa took a dayr two later sir toffett chirped up first she woz a blackbirder certain wotd ye say toby she woz outta th spanish main puerto cabello havana jugg gravelled bought slaves at havana tsell down to puerto cabello wot i could make out them sayin willy murderin bastards ahern added with a faint shudder of what hed heard even if he hadnt seen it gawd but there was a power o murderin both times sor murder lewrie asked appalled both times eyd start akillin folk sir seaman luckaby explained blackvisaged in anger evry last spaniard aboard both ships sir mr towpenny said some slaves too right jugg old an sickuns aye jugg grimly agreed lotta shootin wailin and screamin sir mr towpenny said in a croak of horrible awe down on th orlop we could hear em in th water alongside poundin and scrabblin at th hull keelhauled one sir luckaby shuddered ropes rubbed right neath us it sounded like shoved them healthy slaves down in th holds atop us round us an ye never ahern griped chiefest delight seemed tbe killin spaniards though sir mr towpenny marvelled like they were at war with them stead of us us those slaves we were more like icin on th cake theyd get round to us when it pleased em moved us aboard th schooner th last couple o nights hit was so crowded board th french prize sir toffett said wot with a hundredr more slaves tsee to we knew we were next though so how did you come to survive lewrie queried at a loss in the face of such capricious cruelty and bloodshed hauled us up we heard em say they hadnt done a maroonin yet towpenny said wasnt that wot ye said they said toby aye jugg was forced to admit like twoz nought but a rare game they woz playin whoopin like billyo over it and oddest thing that sir towpenny mused his greygrizzled head laid over to one side when they fetched us up on deck the last time and set us ashorethe dry tortugas it was sirwe could look back from shore an see em mustve burnt their last two prizes i spose for twere nought but our french merchantman and that blackheart schooner layin off both were fiyin th spanish flag along with the french atop em yet did they despise the dons as bad as it seemed they werent out of guadeloupe lewrie puzzled half to himself nossir towpenny countered and when they sailed away arter maroonin us they woz bound norwest straight as an arror til they drapt below th horizon capm spanish florida perhaps lewrie mused aloud rising to pace with his hands in the small of his back the engrained habit of a sea captain mobile pensacola christ other than new orleans in spanish louisiana theres not a single settled port where they could sell off their prizes and slaves til you get to tampico or veracruz down in new spain dont make sense jugg he exclaimed stopping midstride and turning to peer at the man sir jung warily replied did you ever hear them boast of their home port couldve been new orleans sir mebbe jugg reluctantly said spaniards and frogs together aye lewrie said frowning and going to the windows to look out at the ocean near juggs cot new orleans and louisiana were french first til and new orleans so ive heard draws seamen of every nation the frogs on guadeloupe sell letters of marque to anyone with a rowboat and a full purse no matter who it is other frogs spaniards british renegades yankee doodles somewhat honest privateersmen or outright pirates acted more like pirates ey did sir toffett grumbled played more like pirates seaman luckaby sneered see sir there woz common sailors like then there woz some o th quality sorts aboard at schooner an all o us could hear th diffrence twoz th way they talked dye see sir toplofty an lordly not loud an hard like though they were th cruelest toffett stuck on mean tsay sir luckaby forged on some of em could speak th good ol kings english and them lordley fiends toffett spat their capm and him wot set us ashore on that island sir

hmmm hear any other names lads lewrie asked them think the one played toby in my clothes woz called lancshire or somethin like that sir mr towpenny told him lanes langthingummy lotta first names mostly sir toffett offered pierre an jacques pedro an pablo nicknames mister jugg said one o their offcers might o been called hungry an totherun fierce didnt ye say mister jugg feroce meanin ferocious in frog jugg corrected gloomily and laffame means hungry aye never heard their real names so which woz which well the man trailed off with a confused shrug no ones heard either nickname i take it lewrie probed them nothing associated with a past a repute associated with either nossir sorry tsay mr towpenny said after silently polling their ignorant expressions and helpless shrugs probably named themselves to better their odds at recruiting sailors lewrie said sighing and shrugging himself that would be just like a gasconading frenchman tclaim hes successful well let me say that im damned relieved to find you all relatively healthy and alive men weve spent the last two months runnin down the windwards searching for you that prize bedamned twas you we wanted to get back and you can bet your last farthing soon as youre able to come back aboard your shipmatesll give you all a welcome worthy of the prodigal son well have a make or mend day and kill a fatted calf the pursers accounts no matter that cheered them considerably and they raised a hearty three cheers and a tiger for lewrie and their pending celebration ill just look in on mister burns then go back aboard to let everyone know that youre alive lewrie said basking in their cheers er uh mr towpenny gloomed up ye cant sir mister burns is dead sir them bastards killed him sir toffett barked they bloody what lewrie roared when how did you see which of em did it his selfcongratulatory mood had gone to ashes well sir mr towpenny began after another communal look and a sour swallow of bile that as senior hand it would be his forlorn duty to complete the sorry tale they set us ashore on the island run us up th beach at gunpoint an this balfa feller give us a few um things coz even he said tothers woz crazymean and that he d give us a sportin chance at least almost like a christian he did though i spect he woz a slave t popery leather bag o stuff an he wished us good luck an they woz shovin off had oars in th water an was nigh onta a long musketshot off astrokin for their ship when one o them buggerin high an mighty sods aboard th schooner just up an shot him sir for the hellish fun of it damn his blood pardon me french sir in his leg sir toffett luridly described grabbing his groin to show where the bullet had struck right close this weddin tackle werent nothin we could do for mister burns sir with one ol rusty knife that balfa buggerd left us ball was still in him an none of us with a lick o doctorin sir nought but seawater twash out th wound with so lasted three days he did fore he passed over sir and wee mister burns he went hard sorry thave ttell ye capm towpenny gravelled looking as if hed tear up as if it had happened just this morning and not a week or more before no shelter hardly any water tdrink cept for rain squalls an that foul sucked outta our shirts an such sir toffett recalled with a grimace as if in aftertaste caught in at ol washleather bag nought but a dram or two twixt th six of us was all it amounted to turtle blood fish blood and some gulls we knocked down with driftwood planks sir ugh they had dug with a greywood board in search of a fresh water seep but had hit porous limestone moist with saltwater amazingly to lewrie this balfa creature had left them a cracked magnifying glass a stained linen handkerchief and a flintlock tinderbox that rusty knife so a fire could be kindled once theyd found enough driftwood and sundry pine needles and palm furze most nights though they had shivered in the windswept chills in the dark saving firewood for a beacon to any passing ship raw turtle meat and blood raw seabird flesh and gore doled out in meagre handfuls to last an entire day the surf had been too heavy to grabble tickle or spear fish and the sharks too numerous and prowling almost into the glass windowpane of the waves that broke on their little beach thered been gulls eggs for one afternoon then the wonder of a hawksbill turtle that had crawled ashore to scoop out her nest in the sand craftily theyd waited til she was crawling back to the water totally spent and had hammered gouged and pried her open with their bare hands and fistsized rocks to kill her that night they had lit a fire to preserve so much meat and had dug up her eggs like the purser might dish out his rations a bit at a time from the sandy larder a dozen apiece per day to assuage their raging hunger and her massive shieldlike upper shell had made a catchbasin for the rare rain had tbury th poor lad there on th island sir mr towpenny said almost piping his eyes said wot words we had over him put up a driftwood cross but we darent risk th knife tcarve his name on it poor little tyke warnt th sort o midshipman like tprosper in th navy but he tried ill give him that werent right them bastards pottin him like th squired pot a rabbit then leave him tdie for th fun o it how long were you on that island mister towpenny lewrie asked about as sorrowful as his sailors after the dreary tale had been told of midshipman burnss sufferings before hed died and how were you rescued nigh on ten days sir towpenny grumbled deep in his chest got picked up bout two weeks ago finlly saw a sail o any sort up to th northrd and figgered even th spaniards couldnt do us worse in one o their prisons so we lit a fire and she seen us and hauled her wind tcome about used our slop trousers tmake a big smoky fire sir just like moses follered by day seaman luckaby said with an ironic chuckling noise stockingsd been burnt before thelp cook that turtle you were picked up naked from your shirts down lewrie said more than glad to conjure up a happier picture of their long ordeal burnt our tarred hats too sir an wearin our wool jackets like shawls mr towpenny added almost snickering too at the outre spectacle they had made of themselves thort at shipd sail right past us sor ahern said from his sickbed wheezing with happy remembrance of their deliverance but oncet at fire was blazin good wot with th vairy last scrap o wood on th island and god help us if shed not come about aye and amen i faith his proteuses chorused in cacophony sure an all at rum whooshed up like a fireship takin light sor an ahern chortled then blushed silenced he was taken by a fit of wheezing and coughing into his fist and all of the other hands broke off from contributions and exultations went red in the face and found sudden interest in the floor or the odd strolling insect their bare toes the rum lewrie posed a skeptical brow lifted in query ahem sir mr towpenny finally spoke up dye see sir as i told ye sir that balfa feller left us some things tgive us a sportin chance like he said and ah one of em was a tengallon barrico o rum sir unwatered dye see cruel oh cruel it woz that right lads oh aye arr bastard came their enthusiastic remonstrance to that fiendish infliction us tdo a drunken jack like at pore ol pirate got found on th coast o th carolinas nothin but bones an an empty cask hellish temptation but nary a drap o water die we must sure an wed all go blissful ahern fondly speculated adreamin twoz fiddlers green an not a desert we rationed it out we did sir mr towpenny firmly stated just enough tkeep our spirits up an it woz wet after all savin it for a big bonfire did a ship come dye see capm he extemporised eased mister burns too it did thankee jesus seemed like it kept his wound from festerin quick as it mightve give him at least a day or more o life tmake his peace with the lord so it could be counted a blessin do ye look at it that way sir and any left lewrie dryly asked well er nossir mr towpenny said squirming on his rickety chair th bonfire took a power of it sir flames nigh as tall as a crojack yard an lots o smoke tdraw that ship down tus umhumm lewrie commented though picturing his sailors being rescued with their pricks swaying in the wind short coats over their heads like beshawled dago widows and every last manjack as drunk as an emperor twas a wonder their rescuers hadnt backed oars gone about and rowed away and left them as a bad bargain and youve lost your kits i take it lewrie said further as he paced back to the centre of the room aye we must do something on that score the hospital charge you for these new slops you wear by god the skinflints ill speak to mister coote soon as i am back aboard and suggest a whipround from forecastle gundeck and the wardroom all to get you kitted out proper again so what pay youre owed wont vanish and you wont have to sign away your prize money to shore jobbers for a quarter its future worth either as far as im concerned you were on active duty all this time so dont fear pay stoppage in your absence as well he further promised you did darned well lads to keep your discipline and your wits about you simply to stay alive mister towpenny be sure that your keeping good charge will be noted and rewarded thankee sir thankee kindly towpenny said blushing anew youll all be back aboard in a few days lewrie told them as he picked up his hat and took a step towards the door in the meantime id wish you to try to recall all you can about those socalled privateers who held you any scrap of information as to names places or gossip you heard any clues as to where they were headed as to who they really were im sure mister jugg will prove helpful since he can sort out french or spanish words that might be confusing right jugg he prompted giving that dubious rogue a damned chary glare aye sir the fellow answered by the way jugg we sailed as far as barbados in search of you of word of you lewrie slyly continued we rode up to call on your acres in welsh hell gully youve gotten your mail since coming ashore no rest assured your wife is well theres a good crop coming up and both your daughter and infant son are in the best of health er thankee sir jugg all but gasped sitting up straight in spite of his guarded caution even as he went cuttyeyed to imagine what else lewrie had learned about him from his fellow barbadians and your girl tess has herself a reddish flopeared puppy lewrie added with a disarming grin almost housebroke but it looks tbe early days i expect youll hear all about it in your wifes next letter well ill see you all later lads keep your chins up and take no more guff from the hospital staff than you must drunk as goats lewrie asked capt nicely once they had met again in the hospitals cool northfacing entrance hall staggering nicely snorted with wry glee fallingdown jigdancing gravelswimming talkingintongues raving drunk they were commander mortimer of the sloop spritely which picked them up was of half a mind to give them two dozen lashes for drunk on duty as soon as he learned they were navy men thankfully your bosuns mate that towpenny had enough of his wits about him to claim the pirates were to blame for leaving all that rum as a fiendish torture with nary a drop of water about quite a fellow to keep good order among them so long given our tars penchant for running riot and drinkin themselves blind apparently he found a length of hollow cane washed up on the beach which was in his care at all times mind sir they scuttled the barricos top and each man got two sips off it as much as he could suck up three times a day morning noon and night aye mister towpennys a damned good man lewrie agreed though once they saw twas a navy ship their salvation capt nicely gaily went on nigh chortling one of the survivors told commander mortimer they drank it up quick as they could before somebody could take it away from them waste not want not is the old adage ha ha captain lewrie twas a drunken spree the likes of which they will mostlike remember all the rest of their lives and the heads that required a stay in hospital lewrie said chuckling too id like to think they learned a lesson but let sailors get a whiff of alcohol and its bedlam speaking of captain lewrie nicely cooed as they arrived at his waiting coach once youve delivered your delightful tidings to your ship and crew about the fate of their mates once the sun is well below the yardarm it would be my pleasure to break out a bottle or two of capital cheer knowing that officers are as tempted by alcohol as the least foredeck hand id admire did you dine with me ashore and i would delighted to accept sir lewrie gladly agreed shall we say seven sir so said sir lewrie replied laying his hat on his chest my um grand though it is to get your sailors back i do wish to extend my condolences upon the loss of your midshipman burns nicely sobered as they got seated facing each other and a postillion boy raised the step and shut the door for them a lad of connexion to you was he he asked expecting the usual kinship or interest most midshipmen gentlemenintraining came aboard as wards to captains suggested to them by kin or neighbours direct kin such as lewries bastard son desmond was to his uncle capt mcgilliveray but it was a rare lad and usually a poorun sent aboard by admiralty especially those from the naval academy as kings letter boys no no he was not lewrie sombrely said his sadness quickly returning in point of fact twas sir edward charles your predecessor who foisted him on me culled the west indies fleet for the worst he could find poor lad he meant well and he did try but my god what a witless goose for those pirates or privateers or whatever they wish tcall themselves to shoot him for sport deliberately wing him so hed take days to die as if theyd rather stayed to watch his suffering like strangling kittens fore their poor eyes are even opened by god id give my right arm tfind the bastards who did that to him id run em to earth did it take a year and a day and kill em slow tooth for a tooth eye for an eye make them suffer swear to christ i sorry sir to become so exercised but lewrie said as he came back to his senses noting how speculatively capt nicely eyed him nose high and one quizzical brow raised do forgive me but it seems such a bloody murderous injustice nicely leaned forward full of commiseration and true sympathy of suppressed disgust for the crime and what lewrie took for a mutual desire to carve out vengeance or justice what little i read from commander mortimers report captain lewrie i am utterly convinced we someone must pursue those devils they may have letters of marque but theyre nothing more than cutthroats and pirates and a scurrilous stain on the honest seamans trade even pon the dubious good name of privateer were knightserrant dye know sir knightserrant sir lewrie responded with a puzzled frown there are rules for warfare sir capt nicely insistently avowed there must be else all is chaos and depravity someone must enforce those rules we must standing armies came to be to replace barbarian gangs of land pirates navies got formed to protect trade and poor seamen innocent passengers from the evil depredations of piracy oh we also project power fight our kings enemies but mostly we go about our lonely occasions as nobly dedicated to the rule of law and the upkeep of civilisation as any of king arthurs questing knights to be the strong right arm for the helpless the only enforcers of justice that the seas know lewrie aye we are just like the knightserrant of old pure of heart aye sir lewrie mildly rejoined though stunned by the change in nicely from being well nice to what could be taken for a droolatthemouth turk in a holy hashishstoked hallucination knew he was too good tbe true lewrie thought wondering whether he should get out and walk back hes ravin fit tchew upholstery like hes been got at by the methodists or william wither force i see sir lewrie nodded as if sagely enlightened instead tell me something lewrie nicely said leaning forward with a crafty look on his phyz could i give you a fair wind towards the pursuit and capture or destruction of these murderous scum cobble up independent orders to fetch em in before the bar of justice for all the world tsee would you be interested oh well id like nothing better sir lewrie quickly vowed and of course he did for such fervent avowal was pretty much what one was supposed to say it must here be noted though that he also fervently speculated that wherever those pirates had run there also might be his missing prize there was the matter of how embarrassed hed be did the world learn how hed lost her and had spent two whole months chasing a willothewisp had those pirates sailed off to pensacola mobile or new orleans there probably wasnt a hope in hades of winkling them out without the use of an entire naval squadron and an invasion force to capture or reduce any forts guarding their lair but did he cruise off those harbours long enough surely theyd stand out to sea for another piratical cruise where he could nail them and punish the one or all who had perpetrated those cruelly useless murders poor midshipman burnss the most especially aye lewrie said with some heat and at least a scrap of hope that such a feat could be accomplished good capt nicely crowed in gentle triumph leaning back on his coat seat with a satisfied grin good youre still of the mind that your man jugg might have had a hand in it jugg well lewrie said frowning no sir i no longer think he instigated it but im still convinced that he knows more about the people involved that hed admit short of torture we must smoak him out then captain lewrie nicely beamed i will put my mind to it get in touch with a few people currently in port who own knowledge of the spanish louisiana and florida colonies and might be of avail to our quest i do believe within a fortnight we could be on their scent do you not object sir i know one wellconnected fellow who could dine with us tonight so our campaign may begin at once a tradesman a tradesman sir lewrie asked sharing an english gentlemans regard for people who actually handled finances money and goods a merchant adventurer so tis said rather capt nicely added a mister gideon pollock who works as the principal agent for the panton leslie company trading firm big in the indian trade inland in the americas pack trains and canoe expeditions pollock is head of panton leslies affairs at new orleans a british firm that trades with the dons sir lewrie gawped his name arose once your hands were fetched in and aroused curiosity in um certain quarters capt nicely guardedly explained mine arse on a bandbox lewrie thought with a sinking feeling in his nether innards but he dont mean somebody like peel or does he what in hell have i agreed to certain quarters mine not made the mans acquaintance myself yet nicely blathered on though he comes well recommended and his firm has ah proved very useful in a most quiet way to the crowns interests in the americas nicely tapped the side of his nose to assure lewrie that it was covert and sometimes skullduggerish this pollock fellow is reputed to be quite the neckornothing sort when among the savages and brute settlers supper should prove intresting if nothing else what oh aye sir mirth joy and bloody glee sounds like book two trinculo the folly of this island they say theres but five upon this isle we are three of them if th other two be brained like us the state totters the tempest act iii scene william shakespeare chapter five it was not often that capt alan lewrie rn actually sat down to dine with tradesmen nor did he suspect did capt nicely amiable though he was towards seemingly everyone with whom he came in contact tradesmen even those engaged in managing ones personal finances like his solicitor back in london mr matthew mountjoy the people at coutts bank his shore or prize agent well they werent exactly gentlemen were they even if they were an hundred times wealthier than their customers dining with tradesmen was not so much a downward social step as it was running the risk of being dunned sometime twixt the fish course and the cheese and port most gentlemen stayed in debt to tradesmen of their acquaintance a number fled like hell at the sight of em mr gideon pollock however turned out to be a most congenial and informative table companion not that he had a chance to eat much and so far as lewrie knew he didnt owe the man a farthing no nice as capt nicely was as solicitous to mr pollock as he behaved it was more a working supper than a social occasion with pollock singing for his supper almost from the start pollock had no gossip no books or plays or ear for music to discuss what he did discuss involved the fetching of charts and maps of sketching with his forks handle or a wellhoned pencil stub as he laid out the situation anent spanish florida and spanish louisiana well i rather doubt your prize ship went into port at mobile or pensacola capm lewrie pollock said with a chary expression once the reason for their supper had been explained to him other than the small spanish garrisons a few priests and government officials there arent enough customers for the looted goods or the slaves and not more than a handful of people with more than two silver escudos to rub together no prize court to adjudge and condemn the ship either he said rubbing the side of his nose a nervous gesture that he evinced more than once that evening nossir id put my money on new orleans there or havana what spanish captaingeneral of florida there is hes no more than governor of the mildew the mosquitoes and palmetto bugs mr pollock also had a nervous habit of jerking his head up and to the right now and again with a wee throatclearing whinny it was quite unnerving that and watching his adams apple bob pollock bore the complexion of a longtime sailor or huntsman as creased about his eyes and lips as a scots ghillie he was slender and wiry stood about two inches shorter than lewrie but appeared to weigh no more than ten stone and that with his suit and shoes on he was highcheeked and leanfaced with rather remarkably vivd green eyes that seemed to droop at the outer corners and a nose that put lewrie in mind of a welshman or cornishman it was long prominent and aquiline with a hookbump forming the bridge not exactly english in his speech either mr pollock sounded decently schooled as if he might have been a second or third son from the squirearchy who had strayed from the expected church law military or naval careers or been remittanced overseas to hush up a scandal he sounded above the station of tradesman but below the idle elegance of a gentleman less british more american somehow capt nicely had introduced pollocks firm as being thoroughly british established in the colonies long before the socalled french and indian war as the colonials had referred to it lewrie imagined that hed been among the yankee doodles dons and french so long that their patterns of speech had corrupted those pollock had been born with we have offices in new orleans dye see pollock continued and i manage to get up there five or six times a year believe this gentlemen when i say that anything and everything is for sale in new orleans and the cabildo the spanish government house could float on the bribes a thoroughly corrupt people are the dons not that their ostensible subjects the original french settlers were a whit better itd be an easy thing to circumvent the prize court just sail your missing ship over to the south bank opposite the town circulate some flyersassuming your customers can read that isand open her as an emporium once your goods are gone you sell off the sails and fittings then the ship herself the slaves well there are itinerant dealers the caboteurs whod meet you at the head of the passes and buy them off you plunk them into their barges and flog them off in the backcountry thout hide nor hair of them ever appearing where the authoritiesd have to take notice governorgeneral carondelet banned the import of slaves born in the caribbean in pollock said with a rub at his nose and a jerk of his head an ahemish whinny and a tug at his costly neckstock theyre sposed to be inspected and certified as genuine africans at havana mostly but black ivory is black ivory what with planters expanding their holdings theyre switching over to cotton rice and sugarcane and for that the landowners need thousands of slaves er how is it mister pollock that you a british subject come and go into the spanish possessions so freely after all we are at war with spain lewrie asked puzzled bless me capm lewrie pollock chuckled over the rim of his wineglass not without another of those ahemtwitchwhinnies our firm damn near keeps spanish florida and louisiana a going business without us theyd have no goods no arms for their indian allies no comforts for themselves though merchants from charleston or savannah cut into us something frightful we do manage to hold onto a profitable lions share so far gods sake sir surely you dont think that spanish merchants could do it no no their goods have to come direct from spain and are far too costly and the bulk of american colonies neither make or export much of use to louisiana or florida dons rape pillage plunder and exploit deuced well pollock sneered but theyre utter failures at manufactury or trade no highnosed haughty spanish hidalgo d be caught dead dirtying his hands with lowborn doings ranch run plantations government work but never in commerce my family rode weeth el cid pollock mockdeclaimed in a castilian lisp worthy of the royal court at madrid we drove ze moor from espana weeth our swords we sail weeth colombus we conquered mehheeco beside cortes sheenyor how dare you shoogyest so their goods cost more than yours lewrie supposed and i expect theyre overtaxed too so you undercut perhaps bribe but of course pollock admitted preening frankly were i king of spain id wash my hands of louisiana and florida for theyll do no more with em than the indians will theyre deadbrokespiritually morally and financiallyand havent a hope of keeping them in the long run no spaniards emigrate there but for government appointees and soldiers and outside the port towns there arent two of em in every hundred square miles but for priests or barefoot squatters they simply wont change their climes to better themselves as our good anglosaxons will pollock declared so sooner or later they will lose em to the americans til then we at panton leslie will stave off the inevitable therefore the dons need us pollock said with a sly wink and another twitchwhinny once peace had come after the american revolution the yankees had exploded westward over the mountains up rivers gametrails or warpaths longhunters then settlers then traders to service them surveyors speculators and schemers hadnt been far behind each new sovereign state had veterans to reward with vast vaguely bordered land tracts in lieu of pension monies which soon became speculative stockintrade some for as little as a farthing an acre spain had one idea where her borders of florida and the edges of the louisiana they had purchased from the french lay the yankees had quite anotheror simply didnt give a tinkers damn for them spain claimed the inland indians were allies and clients whose territories expanded spains claims as far east as the hiwassee river in the tennessee valley and along the tennessee or tanasi river the industrious jonathons though befuddled the tribes with a host of trade goods better than anything the spanish could offer with an ocean of rum and whiskey they rented grants the size of ireland for the loan of a musket a stack of blankets a cookpot a good horse and saddle and it was months or years before the rare roaming spanish soldier or official might stumble upon the unofficial invasion then hie back to the coast to complain about the entire towns that had sprung up since their last visit georgia virginia and north and south carolina had sent out a host of land agents to form development companies that issued speculative shares of dubious claim and value on these same tracts when not arguing among each other as to who owned exactly what the yazoo company muscle shoals company cumberland company georgia alone had carved out a bourbon county the size of france and had threatened war on the spanish possessions on spain herself if not certified north of spanish claims the new state of kentucky had come into existence in then the closer and morethreatening state of tennessee in which resulted in fresh hordes of hardhanded cussedly independentminded americans coming to the eastern bank of the great river the mississippi itself down the yazoo river to natchez down the alabama into florida almost in sight of mobile to baton rouge or manchac inside spanish louisiana down near new orleans pollock thankfully had the proper maps handy for his spiel indeed new orleans was becoming the main entrepot for yankee frontier goods rafted or barged down for shipment back east on american merchant ships which was much quicker than overmountain upriver trade to the original thirteen colonies spanish and french companies either died or got coopted went broke or grew obscenely rich from the influxwhich unfortunately filled new orleans with chawbaccy yankee merchants and louisiana with unwanted landgrabbers spitefully the spanish had banned american traffic on the river in new orleans but that had been a failure and the ban had been lifted the year before in nothing seemed to avail the dons dont know what to do pollock let out a snicker which accompanied by a twitchahemwhinny looked positively ghastly on him at least with american goods a lot of money changes hands and goods off yankee ships that come upriver for cargoes are firstrate and cheap so they cant really complain too much my company thrives on wilderness goods as well i must avow your indian trade though with the spanish lewrie asked well the old indian trade is not as profitable as it was mr pollock replied with a wry smile just as perfectly offputting the american trade makes up for it theyve no money in the backcountry but both they and the indians have hides furs whisky and tobacco to barter with and so far from east coast manufacturies and so hard it is to get finished goods westward in carts small waggons or muleback the small poled flatboats well here panton leslie is with british goods at decent prices heh heh heh gawd he sets me teeth on edge when he laughs like that lewrie thought with a cringe was i a yankee or indian he did that just once id run like hell or scalp him so sooner or later the americans overwhelm louisiana and the floridas you expect sir lewrie asked indeed captain lewrie pollock gravely agreed theres a good chance all this trade ours and the americans through new orleans is drawing even more settlers than do the empty lands id give them no more than five or six years before the yankee doodles just up and take the place and have done either the united states acting as an organised polity or the frontier states acting on their own indeed capt nicely harrumphed in surprise kentucky and tennessee their settlers below the boundaries are so isolated from the rest of the states they might as well still answer to london sirs pollock chuckled physically and politically too dye see ahem the backwoods have little in common with those civilised sorts cross the mountains the settlers are rankled by the games played by speculators and diverse state governments the broken promises of pensions like the whisky rebellion lewrie asked with a knowing smirk very much like it aye pollock laughed americans are the most stubborn anarchyminded personally independent folk ever i did see some overmountain people aspire to personal fiefdoms like the rebellious state of franklin that sprang up in east tennessee just a few years ago the indians are no real challenge not really and the spanish arent much better at protecting their holdings so might be a good idea to encourage that sort of thing captain nicely posed since it should be in our interests to rein in the americans before they get too big and powerful to deal with hmmm well i dare say heh heh pollock responded sounding as if capt nicely had broached a topic best left alone to lewries puzzled look captain nicely softly imparted there are plans afoot captain lewrie i may tell you in all confidence o course for some ah lands lately in rebellion against the crown that might be recovered admiral sir hyde parker has corresponded with our british north american forces to ah effect the taking of the mississippi if necessary to that happy conclusion we would need free entry to a strong military and commercial base mobile or new orleans control of the west bank of the mississippi if nothing else hence to control its entire length and hold the yankees snug in their kennels enticing the breakaway backwoods americans in the new western states to ah lewrie gawped what have i got into he wondered depend on us for their economic wellbeing aye nicely said i thought we were to speak of finding pirates my missing i only give you the background sir capt nicely cautioned sir hyde instructed me to reveal this much to you before you sally forth to haunt the coasts sir hyde told me that mister pollock in his capacity as a trader allowed into spanish possessions could aid your search provide information anent new orleans the identities of notorious brigands who mightve been involved in taking your prize and committing their atrocities then send you coded letters by way of his smaller vessels i assure you captain lewrie that i know where all the bodies are buried pollock intoned with another of his ghastly grins and who is most likely to be your perpetrators i cannot give you active assistance without ahem revealing my and my firms ties to the crown thout being garotted as a spy by the dons but in the meantime whilst i haunt the coasts youll really be spying anyway to aid any future ah descent on new orleans or louisiana lewrie sourly realised aloud one observes one notes quite innocently ahem pollock rejoined looking quite happily slyboots and here comes dessert nicely suddenly exclaimed as supper plates were whisked away by his houseservants and an intricate cutcrystal serving bowl was trotted out a jumble or trifle mostlike a shit cobbler lewrie dubiously thought as he took note of the dishs brown colour all streaked with what looked like crust and some whitish creamy layers there were some suspicious yellow lumps too youre reputed to be a man possessed of a fine palate captain lewrie nicely enthused hands arub in gleeful expectation but i dare say youve not tasted the like o this in all your travels i dare say not sir lewrie squeamishly confessed his eyes fixed upon the dollops being spooned out in smaller bowls what caribbean and new world sir nicely boasted all regional ingredients rum and sugar molasses for thickening bananas fresh off the bush and sweetened chocolate beans pulverised and boiled to a milk paste i call it a chocolate pudding pie taste sir good god in heaven lewrie had to splutter in amazement once hed had a tentative tiny spoonful its ambrosia why i never bloody marvellous once weve eat our fill well retire to my parlour captain nicely simpered twixt avid bites of his unique concoction where we may have our brandy or port and consult the charts so mister pollock may further enlighten us regarding our mission lewrie our mission is it lewrie thought with a brief check iknow hes bored shitless but oh well at least the puddings good chapter six so mister pollock whats the best way to get at em in your estimation capt nicely eagerly enquired once a parlour table had been cleared of decorations and the maps and sea charts assembled he took a slurp from a snifter of brandy then used it to anchor a corner of a chart should it be necessary of course well sir ahem mr pollock carefully began you will note that new orleans is situated a fair piece or better up the mississippi river an hundred miles or more the river is somewhat unique in that its silt deposits form this massive delta on either bank that extends so far out into the gulf of mexico the rules of nature do not obtain in louisiana the streams dont flow into the river they seep out in sloughs and bayous and those meander and divide into a trackless maze the land south of baton rouge is flat as a tabletop and but a few feet above sea level ahem no cellars or basements in louisiana sirs nor will you find the dead buried in the ground hah hah and what appears to be solid ground is so saturated you may sink into spongy saturated quaking prairies if not an outright marsh rich soil yes refreshed by the annual floods where its arable but it also makes for swamps you must see to believe grand place for frogs then swamps lewrie japed as to getting upriver to new orleans pollock continued what the devils that tdo with capturing my pirates he asked himself cocking his head to one side as pollock prosed there are several nevigable entrances to the mississippi delta the southwest pass south pass and the southeast pass i prefer the southeast myself as closest to jamaica so they want me ttake proteus into the mississippi lewrie gawped lewrie took note that the chart was british reading the description the entrance of the river missisipi misspelled at fort balise taken in the kings ship nautilus in the year oh christ rather a long time ago with fathoms indicated in roman numerals and soundings in feet shown in arabic rather a lot of arabic numbers hmmm there was a mud bank there was a large white expanse he took as a featureless alluvial island and a hellishshallow swath of soundings in feet betwixt a narrower channel to the west of the featureless island where fort balise was situated and a note above the fort indicating that ships anchored there to lighten themselves before attempting to cross the river bar east of the blank mightbeanisland was illustrated what lewrie first took for the faithfully reproduced tracks of several drunken chickens or wee little fishies more on the eastern mud bank hmmm a closer perusal with a quizzing glass revealed that they were supposed to be an enormous maze of trees that had washed downriver heaps that had drifted to the mud bank and had aided its formation hmmm printed for r sayer j bennett no fleet st as the act directs july rather a long time ago too more trees littered the north bank of the trifurcated channel well just thankee jesus he exultantly thought a formidable fort is this balise sir nicely asked not really captain nicely pollock said shrugging simple stone water bastion faced with earth and its guns old and rusty lewrie turned his concentration to his glass of brandy let his eyes roam the parlours furnishings and stifled a yawn giving mr pollocks explanation but half an ear and ready to stroll to a large bookcase and pull down a novel hed heard of but hadnt yet read pass a loutre was a shortcut to the head of the passes where all the forking channels came together bloody grand for someone up halfway at a northwest bend was a better bastion fort saint phillip hohum halfway to new orleans was pointe a la hache but no fort so who cared ninety miles up past the head of the passes was the great noreast bend called the english turn and fort saint leon a substantial obstacle though know why they call it the english turn sirs pollock japed now thats unattractive on him too lewrie thought grimacing when the french still owned louisiana we actually put a fleet this far upriver pollock said with a lopsided smile but the old governor bienville i think it was made such a belligerent display daring us to come get slaughtered that we fell for his bluff and put about right there he said tapping the map with a forefinger whats the current nicely enquired frowning five to six knots sir pollock supplied it takes nearly a week to ascend the river boresomely slow passage in small vessels and with the help of hired locals one could approach the city up the various minor rivers and bayous bayou teche bayou la fourche from atchafalaya bay or from barataria bay further west where there is a lake and a major bayou of the same name very few people live on the coasts but they make wondrous hideyholes and privateers and pirates have been reputed to use them now and again lewrie abandoned the idea of borrowing the novel and returned his interest to the chart at the mention of pirates and the coastal lairs they might be using do you envisage an overland expedition pollock grimaced in distaste for such an endeavour through the swamps nicely said shying from the idea too wouldnt have a corporals guard left by the time you got to new orleans lewrie said chuckling half his mind on that topic too still intent on the passes into the aforementioned bays snakes and hornets alligators biting bloodsucking insects god help the poor tasty british soldier subjected to that captain lewrie when a lieutenant in the last war sir did a stint ashore in the spanish floridas capt nicely explained with the creek indians up the apalachicola was it not lewrie aye sir once was enough for me lewrie said mockshivering does sir hyde intend a descent upon spanish louisiana i could think of no worse way to go about it um then nicely grunted sounding hellish disappointed if it must be a coup de main and nothing stealthy then mister pollock what about coming in from the east these tempting bodies of water this lake pontchartrain or lake borgne for instance looks to me as if our pirates could hide in there too hey lewrie how large a vessel was it pollock asked a large twomasted topsl schooner nicely quickly answered might have six to eight feet of draught if laden with booty well one could enter the mississippi sounds and get to lake borgne below ah here below cat island there is pass maria and a vessel could find sufficient depth to enter as for any ships they captured though hmm ahem theyd be much larger with deeper draught and thered be no place to strip them of goods and fittings less they did it in plain sight and getting to new orleans itself from there nicely added from the west shore of lake borgne its fifteen or so miles to the city or one could enter lake pontchartrain from lake borgne by the rigolets narrows pollock hazily surmised but that pass is guarded by fort coquilles and once into pontchartraina very shallow body of water i must tell youthere is still fort saint john on the citys northern outskirts to guard that approach and the fast water route down bayou saint john if we did invade new orleans from there lewrie capt nicely prompted sometime in the future ah how does it look to you if our pirates could use it to get their goods into the town couldnt a military expedition use the same route perhaps well sir lewrie stated then took time to read the depth notations and slowly shook his head mister pollock is right the ships of the line and the troop transports would have to lay off this cat island outside the sounds and youd need hundreds of cutters and barges to pull it off lots of gunboats and bomb ketches to reduce this fort coquilles too i spose i could sail proteus up there and take fresh soundings for you if mister pollock thinks the pirates mightve used this short approach to the main market for their loot yes hmm nicely grumbled sounding guarded if our presence scouting and sounding their water approaches didnt give the game away of course sir lewrie added for later perhaps a covert approach nicely posed in a civilian ship flying oh an american flag might suit sound and scout this way to the city perhaps even sail up the mississippi right up to the town take a look at their garrisons their river forts ah just in case we are forced to use blunt force and risk the english turn once more hmm whilst im looking for pirates sir lewrie asked grinning widely at how eager yet cagy capt nicely looked to have an active part in whatever it was that admiral sir hyde parker the general in charge of their canadian possessions and faroff london might have in mind of course my frigate could back you up should you get into trouble just so long as youre near the coast not actually upriver beyond that what did you call it the head of the passes poor fellow bored to tears lewrie thought sympathetically do you personally wish to scout the city though sir posing as an american lewrie japed the so pleasant and goodhumoured captain nicely id strongly advise you to learn how to chew a quid of tobacco and how to spit tis hardly a skill one quickly learns and im told that neatness counts sir hah hah ah ha nicely rejoined though not looking quite so amused by his joshing as lewrie would have imagined lewries first command was a captured french corvette im told mister pollock he added as he turned to face that worthy admiral hood renamed her hms jester given captain lewries wit one does not wonder why hmm hes such a droll young wag nicelys smile was feral an igetyouforthat why ain t he laughin lewrie had to wonder did i put him in a pet fact is he couldn t pass for american in india excuse me sir nicelys longtime coxn now the majordomo of his unwelcome shore establishment interrupted as he slid back the pocket doors to the parlour your other visitor a mister peel is arrived sir peel lewrie gasped to himself feeling his supper and two bowls of chocolate pudding pie turn to liquid in his bowels shit and god help me is he apart o this whatever it is and whatever it was that capt nicely was so sphinxfaced about lewrie feared that it would not be a duty quite so straightforward as hunting down pirates chapter seven a pleasure to see you once again captain lewrie peel said once the introductions were done i just wish i could say the same jemmy lewrie rejoined with a tart grimace not when you wear your official spy phyz though who says that i wear it now lewrie the darkly handsome and wellknit foreign office agent said with a smirk youre here damn my eyes lewrie spat back thats proof enough for me oh ye of little faith mr peeljames peelmocked with a mournful tsktsk and a shake of his head oh i of scars aplenty lewrie said right back scowling you know each other sirs pollock dared ask yes no peel and lewrie said in the same instant tis good to see you again mister pollock peel said your business thrives indeed it does mister peel pollock allowed wellmet sir oh christ lewrie whispered passing a hand over his brow as he realised that pollock and peel might have worked together before and what that signified thank you for coming mister peel capt nicely bade him i spose youve already eat but aye i did sir but thankee peel poohpoohed perhaps coffee and a dessert would not go amiss hey your chocolate concoction captain nicely peel brightened that would be capital indeed we were just discussing where captain lewrie could best search for our murderous pirates mister peel nicely said inviting all of them to sit and some details of that ah other matter nicely concluded with a wink towards peel have you learned anything as to the identity of who some of the bastards might be sir i did sir peel rejoined turning to lewrie pardon me for taking the liberty lewrie but i spoke with your surviving crewmen at the hospital was toby jugg or whatever his real name is involved lewrie demanded no i dont think he was peel stated not that he isnt a shifty fellow at bottom but hes innocent of your prizes taking wrong place wrong time that sort of thing im convinced of it mr peel steepled his fingers under his nose an unconscious imitation of his old mentor that master spy of lewries past acqaintance the nowretired mr zachariah twigg however peel alluringly added thats not to say that jugg didnt know at least one or two of the leaders the one who declared himself when he marooned them who called himself boudreaux balfa for one mister pollock peel said swivelling about youre much more familiar with louisiana and new orleans that name ring a bell ive heard him mentioned yes mister peel pollock intoned ahem twitchwhinny he made a name for himself during the revolution as a privateer an exiled acadian from old french canada he is i think he lives somewhere down bayou barataria now used his profits to buy land and retired from seafaring so ive been told a widower i think i also heard went by the sobriquet of laffame the hungry at sea your toby jugg sailed with him years ago lewrie peel said with a sly delight to impart that fact your jugg admitted to me he didnt want to be recognised something about cheating this balfa of a share of old booty and in the years since hes thickened aged and wears that thick beard so thankfully balfa didnt tumble to his presence else he mightve lost his ears jugg told me put him to the question like the spanish inquisition did you lewrie cynically supposed hardly that extreme peel laughed heartily though i did get him in quite a sweat when i interrogated him alone good was lewries sour comment to that news the long lanky one who impersonated him in your bosuns mates clothes peel prosed on your jugg might have known as well got it garbled o course the other sailors another name to conjure with mister pollock peel said turning about again lanxade oh him pollock exclaimed in instant recognition he has a fair amount of fame in new orleans too ahem twitchwhinny he and balfa must have ended up with four or five privateers at sea towards the end of the last war jerome lanxade made umpteen thousands from privateering some say from piracy too fore the war and perhaps for a time after spent it like water though gambled deep and lost most of it or spent it on the ah ahem the faster ladies pollock actually looked as if he would blush what is he doing now and where could he be found peel asked in any bbbordello in new orleans actually pollock admitted hes infamous for it highborn french creole lady or tavern drabs no matter and tis said no husband father or beau sleeps sound if jerome lanxades on the town we have a good physical description of balfa from lewries men what does lanxade look like youve seen him yourself mister pollock peel casually pressed his eyes alight as the game took foot each time i return to new orleans yes pollock supplied them hmm very tall and lean very long and spiky waxed mustachios in the spanish style uncommon vain he is still tries to twinkle in style but oh hed be in his fifties by now i think so his appeal of old is fading dresses in the highest fashion garish loud colours but very fine material pollock told them head cocked most parrotlike in forced recollection im told that he employs dye to keep his hair and mustachios dark and rapierthin though he still is good living put a gotchgut on his middle so theres some say he wears a canvas and whalebone corset to maintain his manly figure and his activities of late peel asked oh i do believe he only sails the mississippi now pollock responded snickering a little at any man whod held such a fortune and squandered it now reduced to the prodigal sons beggary works for some trading company captaining shalopes up to natchez manchac baton rouge and the west bank settlements like saint louis jerome lanxade pollock pondered with a long sigh ruminating him i can see returning to a life of piracy and looting from what little i know of balfa though id have thought hed have more sense and lanxade was known in his privateering days as the ferocious le feroce peel almost happily concluded that was the name connected to his repute yes mister peel pollock assured him once gained how hard it must be to dim theres your principals captain nicely captain lewrie mr peel told them beaming turning away from pollock as if he had wrung him dry of all that was necessary a description of their schooner and the names and descriptions of the leaders lewrie said pleased as well so ill know who to whack when i cross hawses with em excellent work mister peel well there is the matter of where a penniless jerome lanxade got the wherewithal to outfit a ship and hire on a crew peel said in caution what he promised this boudreaux balfa to come out of retirement your sailors also spoke of some others aboard the schooner the morning they were put ashore on the dry tortugas the young uns dye mean lewrie said recalling what he had heard in the hospital ward the titterin crudest ones it is also quite intriguing to me peel continued that our pirates but for the seizure of your prize ship lewrie seem to take great pleasure in only attacking spanish vessels hmmm capt nicely sagely stuck in as peels coffee and pie at last appeared silencing them until theyd been set by peels chair on a round winetable and the servant had withdrawn who backed them and why you wonder nicely supposed once they were alone again where the seed money came from mostlike they both fell on hard times as mister pollock suggests lewrie dismissed theyre bored and piracys the only trade they know that pays reliving their wild and misspent youth began with a cuttingout raid in a brace o rowboats and moved up from that the schooner might be their best and latest capture is all mister pollock peel said turning to that worthy again after a pitiable grin at lewries supposition whats the mood among the old french creoles with whom you deal have you heard any expression of dissatisfaction with spanish rule of late of course mister peel pollock quickly assured him they barely tolerate em in the best of times theyd despise anyone other than their fellow frenchmen ruling them no one else in the world is ahem cultured enough to even rub shoulders with em theres a longsimmering revulsion ever since old king louis sold louisiana to the spanish anything beyond a grudge of late though mister pollock peel further enquired the talk in parlours and streets your store any more fervid any rumours of revolt my dear sir there has always been ahem pollock told him with an amused chuckle and a twitchwhinny creoles though are an excitable lot as are most folk from catholic lands who speak their romance languages talk is all theyre capable of to hear the rants in the cabarets oned think they were on the edge of armed rebellion but perhaps its something in the climate that enervates them or something but they are quite incapable of ever really doing anything in the end the food and wines too good heh heh but what if it was different this time peel posed what if a small group of malcontents young excitable and endowed with the will to take whatever act is needful very like the cruel ones your sailors experienced lewrie was of a mind to rise up against the spanish do recall what your men told me of their schooner she had two names le revenant or the ghost and la reunion reunion with whom with the new republican france hmm and you want to go sound em out lewrie scoffed feed em money for their little revolution then spring a british invasion on em well good luck to you exciting as that sounds peel seemed to demur as valuable to crown interests as that may turn out to be assuming that such a cabal exists and would be more amenable to british possession than spanish or american eventually i fear i have more pressing items to pursue mister pollock is our eyes and ears in new orleans he can smoak out any hint of actual rebellion which his majestys government would be more than happy to abet and encourage and exploit if this suspected cabal indeed is violently antispanish with the wherewithal to succeed peel grimly added unless it turns out to be a forlorn and pointless geste only a piratical cabal arranged merely for profit in that case naturally it must be scotched youre saying i cant whack em til mister pollock tells me i can lewrie snickered between sips of brandy you have an uncanny way of making simple things hellish complicated james mister peel is correct though captain lewrie nicely praised with his eyes alight with what lewrie deemed a crusaders fire this must be explored should orders come to proceed against the spanish we must scout out new orleans s defences determine the best route for invasion for admiral parkers part of the expedition and put paid to these pirates all in one you spoke to sir hyde mister peel lord balcarres the royal governor as well dined with them sir peel smugly told him soon as i ended my interviews with lewries sailors it would appear your mission has grown lewrie nicely stated sir lewrie nigh squeaked in dread secretly crossing fingers in his lap heres what well do nicely declared up and pacing energetically all but swinging his arms at full stretch to clap hands sir hyde has allowed me to ah coordinate things so mister pollock your ship will sail soon for new orleans good your role will be to discover whatever intelligences that mister peel requests lewrie sir lewrie reiterated even more concerned of a sudden you are to go to new orleans with mister pollock me sir lewrie managed to splutter taking a brief moment to glare hatefully in peels direction take your quartermasters matejuggs his namewith you so he can identify as many people from that schooner as he may nicely forcefully ordained they didnt recognise their old shipmate the first time theres good odds they wont the second take some hands along your real brawlers and scrappers pass yourself off as an american or hindud be easier sir lewrie spluttered some more tittery with disbelief selfamused too sarcastically so to imagine that he could be taken for anything other than british for longer than ten seconds hindee or chinee might be easier what ever nicely snapped pausing in his pacing to bestow a glare at him if as mister peel suspects someone funded the lankdiddle and belfry whatever their names are we must learn if theyre in it for the money or for france if for france discover as much as you can if for the money make sure you stop their business blood in the streets bodies floating in the river the ships burning at dawn if you cant get at em at sea carry the fight to their parlours and let em see the reach of the royal navy and his majestys government when were aroused thats not ahem the sort of aid to the crown my firm usually supplies captain nicely pollock objected leaping afoot in consternation subtlety dye see to the dons im a mere trader a useful trader if i take lewrie and a pack of bullybucks to new orleans all my years of ah covert good works will end i and panton leslie could be banned at the best we could all be arrested exposed and publicly strangled at the worst besides pollock continued turning to point accusatorily at lewrie what does he know of covert doings how obvious may he be i conjure you sir why hes damned good really peel interrupted idly spooning up chocolate pudding pie trifle jumble whatever as if pollocks thin shrieks of alarm and lewries redfaced surprise were a street raree of only fair amusement i am lewrie roared last time you thought me an idiot my dear lewrie it aint like you havent done this before peel pointed out apalachicola in the far east in or so genoa and leghorn in actually captain nicely i rather doubt if you really wish blood in the streets a thorough soundingoutd suit our purposes anent the pirates financing and organisation a viable invasion route well lewrie is a most knacky sea officer who knows the practicality of transporting troops and guns to the best place for a successful and quick victory and whats needful to support it so it is successful really alan thats your main task sea officer jemmy lewrie fumed wouldnt an army officer be better for gawd whod put trust in a soldier nicely guffawed nought but idle fools who bought their rank and havent worked a day since peels right lewrie youre better suited though it would be nice could you eliminate the known leaders of our pirates without their expertise men of less repute might find it hard to keep their crews together put an end to em far be it from me to cry croakum sir lewrie tried to say as calmly and reasonably as he could though he was nigh shuddering with anger to have been bamboozled again but i thought i was to hunt em down at sea just how did ihow did thisturn into spying your record precedes you lewrie nicely told him obviously trying to praise but failing badly sir hyde the governorgeneral the admiralty mister peels foreign office he said waving one hand in peels direction prompting a brief bow from the seated peel all think you can do it sir hyde said youre the very man for the job no error it wont work wont work at all pollock mournfully groaned i cant see how it possibly could lewrie heavily sighed fine were agreed nicely declared it went downhill from there o course book three gonzalo all torment trouble wonder and amazement inhabits here some heavenly power guide us out of this fearful country the tempest act v scene william shakespeare chapter eight crack shitten goddamned son of a whore quickly followed mere seconds later by another faint crack take that you son of a bitch crack and that crack and heres one for you too you phfft well shit damn me eyes sor sorry ordinary seaman liam desmond in the stern of the ships gig congratulated in his own fashion thats five outta twelve this time an on th wing too sor shouldve been six but for this thing capt alan lewrie griped holding the rifled musket out from him as if it were a stunnedrigid viper well lets round them up he said with a sigh needs spaniels we do landsman furfy desmonds inseparable friend commented in a throaty aside warter spaniels wot kin swim for em right liam out oars give way all toby jugg ordered from the sternsheets waggling the tillerbar a few times as if to scull the gig to faster motion so the rudder would bite against the river current it had been a wrench to lewrie but taking his longtime coxn andrews to new orleans would be a bad idea pollock had sternly advised coxn andrews was black a former house slave from jamaica whod run away to sea and freedom disguised as a civilian though his protection of being in the royal navy and therefore untouchable by slavers couldnt be of help to him if taken up by the spanish authorities even a forged certificate of manumission would be of no avail since it was issued by british authorities so volunteer to go despite the circumstances as andrews had as had several of the black sailors who had stolen themselves from the late ledyard beaumans plantation on portland bight on jamaica to sign aboard proteus lewrie had reluctantly left andrews and the others behind lewrie in the eyes of the bow with his rifled musket levelled a chary gaze on toby jugg once again as he steered the gig towards the nearest slain duck wondering still if the man was truly trustworthy and dearly missing coxn andrews whod been a strong right arm several times over now though he must place faith in the enigmatic jugg who had let his beard grow even longer making him look even more piratical and outre ware oars larboard jugg grunted hauling off to starboard as a drifting log approached on their left from upstream the mississippi looked sluggish at first glance its surface as smooth as a marble slab under a nearly cloudless sky reflecting blueness and the sun like a lying masquerade but beneath that mirror it was an onrushing hungry beast roiled by deadly undercurrents and eddies and it kept its secrets evils and perils in its silty brownred depths mere inches below its opaque surface where no eyes but those of the dead and riverdrowned could ever probe now and then would come a visible dangertrees or giant snags some entangled into rafts as big as a house foundation ripped from the banks an hundred a thousand miles upriver surging along deceptively slowly and it was the wise boatman who steered very wide of them the banks were littered with tree limbs whole forests of them so convoluted that geese ducks snakes turtles and other local creatures made homes in them next to the carcasses of unwary deer elk and cattle it took two of the gigs six oarsmen by turns to keep the boat abreast the current and even with all six straining to put their backs into it upriver progress was slow thankfully the mississippi wafted most of his kills down within reaching distance lewrie could even reach out from the tiny bow platform on his stomach to pluck one himself and drop the duck lollinglimp and dead into the boat leaking blood and river water he could not swim had never learned and it was a rare sailor of any nation who could excepting the dutch of course swimming so the old salts said just prolonged the inevitable and attracted some finned horror to come eat you alive deliberately drowning might be preferable with brisk oarswork and much shorttacking about they recovered three of lewries latest kills the mississippi took the other two last seen bound downriver for the southeast pass and the sea at a rate of knots to chase after them would have required a halfmile descent of the river and an hour of hard rowing to get back to where theyd started fetching the last fat greyandwhite goose caused their gig to stray close to the southern bank where the tangled deadgrey trees and snags had piled up deepest and abounded with wildlife this set his boat crew to goggling oohing and aahing over the creatures new to them since the crack of gunfire had died away the beasts had reemerged and acted as if theyd never seen humans this close before ooh eys another possum ordinary seaman mannix exclaimed in wonder carryin er babbies hangin off er tail kin ye magine snowy egrets said burly seaman dempsey deres plenty o profit dere lads qualitys mad fr egret plumes dwe shoot some cottonmouth snake toby jugg laconically commented spitting over the side get ye fore ye get th plumes ya daft bastard baby raccoons yonder a teenaged irish topman named

desmond looked forward each with a silent plea in his eyes like children at a parish fair as if begging their captain to shoot trap or fetch them something to order the boat put in so they could scrounge about among the rarees to pet or adopt some adorable but befanged something a splash and a crackling racket among the dead branches whipped their attention shoreward once more the cottonmouth snake had nabbed one of the baby raccoons and the rest were scurrying for their lives eyes in th boat then an mind yer stroke jugg commanded as if bored with the ancient struggle of survival this things had it lewrie said of his improvised fowling piece back to the ship if you please jugg and three of our fat ducksll be your supper tonight lads that promise perked them up considerably and turning athwart the stream they made the gig fairly fly across the river towards the northern bank where mr pollocks broadbeamed and shallowdraughted trading brig the azucena del oeste was anchored jugg kept the gig aimed a bit wide of her jibboom so they fetched up closeaboard and just a bit to the right of the starboard entryport and the mainmast chain platform it wasnt an officers place to do such but lewrie reached out with the boathook to play the role of bow man snagged the foremost deadeyes and stays then passed the gaff to the larboard bow oarsman as he swept the gigs painter round the aftermost and tied it off a perfect arrival all in all he should have been cheered by their prowess at smallboat work by his recall of rusty skills there were a round dozen ducks or geese heaped on the midships sole of the gig confirming his reputation as a keen shot yet it went without saying that cheered he was not the how of being here the fact of being halfway up the lower mississippi and not on his own quarterdeck still rankled he was in fact still irkedpissedmight even attain to mad as the very devil if he stewed on his situation for a bit it did not help his sullen mood that no courtesy due a captain could be shown by the trading brigs crew either the second mate on her quarterdeck leaned out and peered over the bulwarks for a second then disappeared leaving lewrie and his hands to scramble up the manropes and battens with only casual notice taken as a postcaptain he was of course first out of the boat and aboard yet without all the usual twittering naval ado hed come to take for granted after years of traditional welcomesaboard lewrie was reduced to the status of live lumber a mere passenger jugg as senior hand and liam desmond were allowed to paw over his string of kills to select two ducks and one of the wild geese for the hands mess whilst the brigs typical oneeyed and pegleg ships cook and his helper came to take the others for gutting stanching in boiling water plucking and roasting it appeared that tonight would be a gamefeast for whilst he and his navy sailors had been birding others from the brigs wardroom had been hunting ashore in the forbiddingly dark woods on the northern bank two daintily lean yearling doe deer hung over wooden buckets on the larboard gangway stanchions they had already been gutted washed out with river water hooves and scent glands axed off so their meat wasnt tainted and their throats cut to drain into the buckets so the cook could try his hand at making blood sausages mr caldecott the brigs hearty first mate was just beginning to skin and butcher them surrounded by a clutch of hecklers and bemused advisors the azucena del oeste had become becalmed the afternoon before and had been forced to come to anchor for the night dawn had brought a contrary light wind with fitful zephyrs from out of the eastnortheast which in this stretch of river just below the english turn made for a dead muzzier right down her throat against which the brig had no chance to make a foot of headway unless backbreakingly rowed with long galley sweeps not being navy and in no particular hurry to get hernias pollock and his ships master a mr coffin had decided that theyd take a make and mend day of ease secured with both her best and second bower anchors with the river chuckling about her hull and frothing from her anchor cables as if she still was making three or four knots once secured about two long musket shots from the north shore they had tried their hand at fishing last nights supper had been a mess of catfish big ones lewrie had been enthusiastically informed the catfish had resembled bewhiskered shinyhided sharks scaleless and as bigabout and long as a stout mans thigh and just about that meaty pollock had said they were reckoned a fine treat after being breaded with crumbled ships biscuit and powdered dayold toast fried in deep iron skillets and lard just be wary of the bones pollock had warned least im eatin well lewrie could conjure to himself in consolation he had also thought that for a rare once aboard a ship he could sleep in as late as his idle nature desired but one night out to sea and the sounds of the brig making a goodly way the sounds from the watchstanders changing at four in the morning had roused him and that had been the last night hed enjoyed a lubberly allnightin a half of his life spent at sea had engrained wary and wakeful habits in him and it was a rare morning when he could roll back over and caulk even for a slothful extra hour even if the brig belonged to mr pollock and his company even if she had a most competent master in mr coffin with a full complement of tarryhanded mates he still haunted her deck in fretful and enforced impotence like a coachman who was forced to ride inside for once far from his familiar reins well how was the airrifle sir pollock enquired coming up as cordial as anything in hopes perhaps that lewries approval as if that held sway with admiralty might result in a profitable contract fine does it work sir lewrie replied as he unslung the gun from his shoulder when it doesnt it might serve as an oar a club or a punt pole yet you bagged a dozen i see ahem pollock twitchwhinnied and beamed like a horse dealer trying to palm off a halfdead swayback for a thoroughbred did he wink and smile often enough ah but the ones lost to misfires lewrie told him as he held the airrifle twixt thumb and two fingers as if the firearm was that aforementioned dangerous asp about what the austrians said too pollock said with a disappointed sigh still theres hopes the yankee longhunters the local swamprunners and indians find them knacky so quietlike fastfiring tell you what sir ill make you a present of it een so lewrie was tempted to tell pollock where he could shove such a handsome offer that he wouldnt take it on a penny wager but suspected that mr pollock might think repacking it more trouble than it was worth after all he still had eight dozen of the girandoni airrifles crated up a dozen to the crate and stowed below back in england the girandoni might have a curiosity value to someone did lewrie hold onto it long enough surely there would be a collector so eager hed trample small children to lay hands on one to say he had it if nothing else there were other airpowered sporting arms made in europe but usually only to single custom orders whereas the girandoni rifle was the only one massproduced for military service in the austrians had ordered nearly two thousand of them from bartolomeo girandoni for sharpshooting skirmishers from several regiments light companies it fired a lighter calibre ball one even lighter than lewries prized ferguson breechloading musket that hed picked up during the revolution or the fusilmusket hed gotten as a grim souvenir after his disastrous florida expedition in the girandoni looked more like a sporting arm the forestock was half the length of a typical threebanded musket ending about one foot ahead of the trigger guard the firelock mechanism looked much the same as a flintlock but it lacked the dogsjaws the flint and the raspy frizzen to strike the flint as well as the powder pan that ignited a powder charge its buttstock was detachable made of iron and formed the pressurised air flaskit came with three what was most promising about the girandoni airrifle was that a skilled user could get off twelve shots in about thirty seconds and never have to ram a ball down the muzzle twelve lead balls could be loaded down a tube in the forestock all at once pull back the brass lever along the bottom of the forestock and a ball would pop into the opened breech from below return the lever to its slot and the breech was sealed cock the lock take aim and squeeze the trigger and a complicated clockwork spring valve opened from the buttstock and there would come a faint barely perceptible crack as the ball was propelled at feet per second it was said by pollock who was hot to flog them off on somebody that it was accurate on mansized targets beyond one hundred yards not the fifty or so of a smoothbore musket nowhere near as good as the two hundred yards of a european jaeger or pennsylvania rifle but they were very slow to load and needed a greased patch to grip the rifling perhaps this time quantity could make up for quality and incredible accuracy the main drawback was that the user might as well hire a clockmaker to go along and keep the girandoni working properly and the oilsoaked leather seals on the air flasks leaked like an entire litter of puppies as lewries last shot at ducks could attest there had been a serpentine hiss then aphfft of lowpressure air and sealing oils which put lewrie in mind of a sailor betrayed by his bean soup and to pump the flasks back to full pressure propping the detachable rod against a tree or wall in his case the ships mainmast for the last hardest strokes looked like slow strenuous buggery well lewrie responded shamming real gratitude it does have its curiosity value thankee sir most kind of you even if his rounddozen waterfowl had used up all three flasks and four dozen lead balls and he was a better wingshot than that well be under way by dawn pollock informed him turning his face northward going gloomy again the wind will come westerly or souwesterly in my experience enough for us to weather the english turn and fort saint leon another stretch of river one more big bend and after that tis an arrowshot the last twentyodd miles to new orleans he sounded loath to arrive then well be about our business whatever it is lewrie rejoined it had not been a joyful yachting voyage pollock was in a permanent fret of exposure of letting his firm down ruing the day hed made peels acquaintance and had begun to nibble round the edges of espionage as the frogs called it he had never before been asked to do anything quite so overt and was definitely off his feed with qualms ruing the night hed dined with the forceful brookmenoarguments capt nicely too lewrie shouldnt wonder on peel and nicely at least he and pollock saw eye to eye if on little else god help us pollock said all but chewing on a thumbnail might get lucky lewrie japed murder those two whose names we know straightaway and put the wind up the others hey pollock shuddered glared at him then toddled off without one more word to share muttering a fair slew of imprecations though lewrie leaned on the bulwarks and plucked at his costume cotton shirt most slack and lubberly fashion pollock had advised that he and his small band of navy men dress as anything but sailors they had been forced to don thighlong hunting shirts over rough trousers older battered tricornes or lowcrowned farmers hats ruing costs like the meanest skinflint pollock had issued them all powder horns and deerskin cartridge pouches long hunting knives to hang on their hips to make them appear more like huntsmen or a pack of bullybucks hed hired on to escort his goods into the hinterlands or protect his newlanded assets in his new orleans warehouses and store all of whichthe clothing arms and accoutrements surplus to requirements infantry hangers and suchhad been produced from pollocks warehouses in kingston and sold at a socalled discounted price to capt nicely lewrie could sourly suspect that he and his handful of disciplined sailors had been charged passengers fare just to come along as well lewrie heaved a befuddled sigh and contemplated once again just how he had been finagled into this dubious adventure capt nicely had proved to be much cleverer than lewrie would have credited him and not half so nice as he appeared not a day after their shore supper capt nicely and mr peel had been rowed out to proteus at her anchorage and had come aboard in stately manner with a strange young lieutenant and midshipman in tow with nicely wearing a gruff butmenobuts expression on his face and jemmy peel cockedbrowed with a sardonic youpoordensebastard look nicely had introduced the young lieutenant as one thaddeus darling the midshipman as one mr the honourable darcy gamble since proteus had lost the unfortunate and regrettable young mr burns admiral sir hyde parker had decided to appoint the much tarrier and more promising mr gamble into the frigate he came off the flagship and such an appointment usually was a signal honour for the recipient captain the lad was upwards of his majority eighteen or so and while attired in a welltodo lads best uniform and kit of the finest quality right down to his ivoryandgilt trimmed dirk he was touted as a bright lad whod been properly seasoned at sea duties since his eleventh birthday a welcome prize indeed youre short a midshipman captain lewrie nicely had almost gushed in seeming sincerity and i prevailed upon sir hyde to assign you his very best and one close to his heart nicely had added in a confidential whisper with an encouraging wink in reward for your previous good service to the crown honoured indeed to welcome him aboard captain nicely sir lewrie had bowed back temporarily disarmed though still a dab leery if you do not mind then sir i will read myself in and put up my broad pendant according to sir hydes orders nicely had said further whipping an official document from his coats breast pocket beg pardon lewrie had gawped all aback say uh lieutenant darling produced a paperwrapped packet containing a red pendant much shorter and wider than the coachwhip commissioning pendant that forever flew from proteuss mainmast he handed it off to midshipman grace and bade him hoist it aloft and to lewries chagrin the red broad pendant bore a white ball indicating that capt nicely would have no flagcaptain below him there was much too much blood thundering in lewries ears for a clear hearing of capt nicelys bellowing recital of navy officialese but the sense of it was that sir hyde had temporarily appointed him as a petit commodore without the actual rank privileges or emoluments of a permanent promotion and take upon yourself accordingly the duties of regulating the details of your squadron in making the necessary distribution of men stores provisions and in such other duties as you shall think fit to direct nicely had thundered casting a baleful eye at his flagships goggling captain lewrie had whirled to seek confirmation or aid from peel but peel could do nothing but offer him a sidecocked head and a helpless shrug that distribution as you shall think fit to direct sounded hellishominous to make matters even worse proteus crew thought they had been done a great honour in recognition of their prowess and they had actually cheered nicelys pronouncement and his decision to splice the mainbrace and trot out the rum keg for a drink free of personal debts the sippers or gulpers owed among them had raised an even heartier second fickle bloody ingrates lewrie had fumed ah sir um lewrie attempted once nicely had turned to face him you speak highly of your first officer mister langlie nicely had said sweetly nearly ready for a command of his own as i recall you praising so perhaps a spell of actual command with me as his advisor as it were will properly season him for better things in the near future hey no fear captain your order book shall not be supplanted or amended while im aboard as ah supercargo or acting commodore i shall not interfere in your officers habitual direction of your ship though i did bring along lieutenant darling to stand as a temporary third lieutenant i assure you that he shall strictly adhere to your way of doing things and will be subordinate to lieutenant langlie not me what squadron lewrie had baldly asked after jerking his chin upwards to indicate the broad pendant we ah stand upon it nicely had had the gall to confess with what seemed a dab of chagrin to pressgang him out of his command so hed be available to fulfill the rest of his scheme christ on a lewrie had spluttered close to babbling we may add two cutters later on once youve reported mine arse on a lewrie had fumed nigh to mutiny so youre free dye see captain lewrie needs must black lewrie had squawked shaking his head in ashen awe at how deftly hed been made available he hadnt seen this coming sir hyde and lord balcarres insisted dye see nicely hurriedly added once id laid our enterprises sketch before em so you must adopt the old navy adage growl ye may but go ye must mine arr lewrie tonguetangled gahh so glad you understand nicely had cajoled well im dry as dust and i fetched off a halfdozen of my best claret shall we go aft and toast the success of our venture sirs and damned if after the wine had been opened and lewrie had sloshed down two impatient glasses his cats hadnt come out of hiding and had made an instant headrubbing twining fuss over captain nicely as if theyd been just waiting for his arrival their whole little lives damned traitors lewrie could but accuse in rebellious silence and nicely had been so maddeningly bloody nice that hed cooed mewed and conversed with toulon and chalky to their evident delight even suffering chalky to clamber up his breeches roll about in his lap to bare his belly for wubbies and scale nicelys heavily gilttrimmed lapels to play with his epaulet tassels touch noses with him shiver his tail to mark him and grope behind his neck with a paw at his ribbonbound queue christ what a he sighed to himself sagging weary on the bulwarks on his elbows and crossed forearms what an eerie place this is hed been up the hooghly to calcutta and had thought that lush and exotic hed been to canton in trading season tween the wars and had goggled at the many sights of the inaptly named pearl river below jackass point both had been asian crowded teeming with noise and anthill busy with seeming millions of strange people intent on their labours louisiana though first had come the barren shoals bars and mud flats of the mississippi river delta so far out at sea the siltedup banks on either hand of the pass and the lowermost channels desolate ribbons of barrier islands with the gulf of mexico stretching to horizons when seen from the maintop platform just a few miles beyond them skeins made from dead trees silent and uninhabited only heightened the sense of utter desolation once past the head of the passes the land spread out east and west to gobble up the seas the salt marshes and quaking prairies impossibly green and glittering framed by fardistant hints of woods yet still devoid of humankind and abandoned now here almost within two hours sail of the english turn and fort saint leon the river was darkly gloomily shadowed by too many trees all windsculpted into eldritch shapes adrape with the spanish moss that could look like the last rotting shreds of ancient winding sheets or burial shrouds after the ghosts of the dead had clawed their way from their lostforgotten graves to the sunlight once again the cypresses standing in greenscummed deathstill ponds the hammocks of higher land furry with scrub pines bearing fringes of sawgrasses like bayonets planted to slice foolish intruders oh here and there were tall levees heaped up to protect fields and pastureland rough entrenchments of earth that put him in uneasy mind of yorktown during the francoamerican siege raised as if to hide whatever lurked behind them from an interlopers view there might be a gap in the levees where someone had a seasonal sluicegate to flood and replenish his secret acres there might be the tiniest peek of a farmhouses roof and chimneys faint wisps of cookfire smoke at times the larger pall of bittersweet white smoke as a field was burned off for a fresh seeding with sugarcane or cotton but all in all it seemed such a thinly settled place a spookily offputting land so daunting that only the desperate the forlorn would dare attempt to tame it or wrest from it a farthings profit or sustenance there came a promising little zephyr of wind from the west at last a welcome bit of coolness after the sullen dampwashcloth heat of even a winters day in louisiana lewries flesh beneath the stifling closeness of his clothing goosepimpled to that zephyr as if to a forewarning but of what chapter nine lewrie wasnt sure exactly what he was expecting once azucena del oeste weathered the last bend of the mississippi abeam a westerly wind and began a long reach up the centre of the rivers widening channel to hear mr pollock capt coffin and his mates gush about new orleans it was a blend of old port royal jamaica the old pirate haven londons east end docks for commerce lisbon for quaintness and macao in china for sin lazing on the starboard foremast stays and ratlines just above the gangway bulwarks using his telescope on things that caught his interest he watched new orleans loom up at last like most realities though the city proved a letdown compared to the myth near the city the levees were higher and betterkept on the east bank at least with a road atop them bearing waggon traffic and light carts the road sometimes crossed wooden bridges above sluicegates and canal cuts that led to planters fields even here though spanish louisiana still looked thinly populated one would expect a modicum of commercial bustle so close to a seaport of new orleans s repute but the river widened and ran arrowstraight finally and lewrie could espy buildings and wharves another vast sloping levee in front of low but wide warehouses dead bare trees turned out to be masts of a whole squadron of merchant ships tied up along the quays along with a confusing tangle that looked like a gigantic logjam nearer up the logjam turned out to be a fleet hundreds of large log rafts or squareended flatboats that had been floated poled or sailed to the docks from the settlements far upriver those would be sold off and broken up for their lumber once their voyages were done mr pollock had told him but for church spires and a few public buildings nothing was taller than two stories though within the last mile lewrie could estimate the city as only ten or twelve city blocks wide and might straggle north towards lake pontchartrain another halfdozen blocks within throwing distance of the town swamps marshes and forests took over again brooding foetid and primeval thats it lewrie grumbled in disbelief thats all there is to it what a bloody gyp the river wind brought the tang of civilisation from toilets and garbage middens from horse mule donkey oxen and human shite from hen coops and pig sties and the mississippi wafted even more evidence drowned rats cats and dogs wilted vegetables and husks of fruit butchers offal and turds evidently not only was no one interred belowground in marshy louisiana but no drains or sewers could be dug either the river that close to town had gone from leafmould and silt tobaccobrown to a pissyellow shitbrindle colour it aint that bad sir mr pollock said from below him on the gangway having heard his disappointed muttering tis a very wealthy town for all that a most pleasant and delightful one too wealth there in that village lewrie scoffed consider it a london bristol or liverpool in their youngest days pollock replied with faint amusement so recently settled a port city much like a newfound ostia serving an equally unimpressive rome a generation or two after its founding an athens or piraeus in the days of demosthenes a genoa or marseilles when the gauls had em even in their heydays the fabled ports of antiquity were nowhere near as impressive as presentday london or say lisbon lewrie ancient alexandria jerusalem in the times of the temple fabled babylon or the hellishrich troy of homers myth werent all that big either nothing like paris or london though i doubt the modern world has or the ancient world had new orleans s match when it comes to wealth and vital location it looks no bigger than kingston english harbour or sheerness lewrie said with a grunt as he jumped down to the deck think of baltimore on the chesapeake sir pollock countered with a wry grin philadelphia or charleston neither are particularly impressive to look at but rich oh my my ahem pollock gushed making another of his throatclearing twitchwhinnies portauprince or that shabby hole cape francois on the north shore of saintdomingue youve been to both im told nothing to write home about but consider the vast wealth that passes through those ports each year sodom and gomorrah lewrie queried with a smirk neither known for trading wealth mr pollock primly replied less you consider that their ah reputations drew hordes of rich visitors as does new orleans the most um entertaining town within five hundred miles in any direction ahem well hmmm lewrie speculated though even at less than one miles distance now new orleans still appeared small and sleepy with no sign of anything wondrous amusing or sinful about it tis a mortal pity its so hard to get at pollock said on half wistful and half wolfish for its sacking by a british expedition would go a long way towards erasing the crowns war debts that rich lewrie gawped turning to regard the approaching town more closely seeing it in a much better light of a sudden at least i see what makes him happy lewrie thought comparing pollocks relaxed stance and evident appreciation of new orleans to his earlier sullenness on the voyage all the wealth of the west pours down here to new orleans mr pollock nigh dreamily praised eyes alight with pound sterling symbols from the joining of the ohio and missouri rivers spanish louisiana extends to the great lakes and our hudson s bay companys territory then far west across the great unknown to spanish california there for the taking lewrie speculated idly fantasising if anyone would miss a wee chunk of it the size of scotland or ireland say and dare he call it lewriana for the settling eventually pollock mused on most happily for once theres very little there now but for indians and game a few wretched settlements like saint louis crossroad or river hamlets but someday as the americans spread out as we spread west from canada the wealth flowing down to new orleans is certain to be tremendous of course panton leslie company already trades with the isolated rustics and tribes up yonder lewrie asked smirkily we ah and the hudson s bay company ahem are laying the foundations for a british presence should the crown desire such sir pollock assured him with a soft voice hemming the americans in lewrie decided even if they get to the east bank of the mississippi and south from tennessee to the gulf in spanish florida hmmph take em a century teat that more than enough room for them let us reclaim a bit of spanish west florida as far east as mobile say and we will have an unassailable buffer against any american expedition against the meat of the matter new orleans pollock speculated fiddling at his open shirt collars and throat capt coffin ordered the brigs hands aloft to reduce sail now that new orleans had finally been fetched her helm though was put up not down to steer away from the quays levee and other shipping pointing the brig towards the opposite bank we never go to the town docks first pollock told lewrie in answer to his puzzled look we go alongside our hulk yonder to unload the lighter goods the ah most desirable luxury items why not use the piers sir lewrie wondered aloud land cargo direct to the warehouses captain lewrie and the spanish customs officials must levy their duties pollock said with a wry smirk and not get tuppence in bribes a portion of our goods are always partowned by em on the sly bulk cargo is charged duty which keeps their superiors in havana and madrid happy and what sells on this side of the river is pure profit to the dons in the cabildo so you sell directly from these decks i take it lewrie asked oh no we transfer the goods aboard our store ship heh heh ahem that hulk i spoke of yonder pollock told him pointing towards the south shore damn my eyes those bloody yankees theyve a new store ship ahead of ours the conniving in actuality there were four hulks opposite the city all half sunk or permanently mired in the mud and silt of the south bank all cut down to a gantline with masts above their top platforms removed and cargohandling booms rigged below their maintops in lieu of course sail yards just above their waists and main cargo hatches the one that pollock had indicated the secondmost downriver had once been a threemasted ship of about four or five hundred tons he judged she was very old with a steeply steeved jib boom and bowsprit still jutting upwards from her wide bluff bows she had like an aged whore though been tarted up to the point of gaudiness her wide and deep gunwale was painted a bright but chalking and peeling red her upperworks and bulwarks canary yellow remarkably a permanent shed had been built over her long quarterdeck making an open and airy peakedroof awning a second construction had been erected over her forecastle from figurehead to the stump of her foremast with the onceopen heads and roundhouse toilets fully enclosed all scaly with shingle siding and roof she now sported two entryports leading to her starboard upperdeck gangway each with two pair of stairs and landings of sturdy wood planking and timbers permanently attached each beginning at the waterline atop a pair of floating platforms to accommodate patrons sailing or rowing boats where even now a clutch of boats and some extremely long lean and narrow and very lowsided strange craft were tied up even more oddly a wide entryway had been cut into her side as wide as double doors down level with her lower deck where a rd rate warships heaviest guns would be housed instead of stairs though a wide long ramp led up to that entryway from another timberandlog landing stage and all were so arranged that the stairs and the ramp would float up or down with the tide bold white lettering on the red gunwale stated that she was the panton leslie co store with further information in smaller letters announcing her days and hours of operation and touting the significant range of goods readily available along the gunwale near the tops of the stairs and ramp were giltwork frames tacked on about white bare spaces which were daubed and littered with both new and old printed broadsheets regarding newly arrived goods for sale the hulk flew a company commissioning pendant and the redgoldred crowned merchant flag of spain as did their trading brig lewrie thought that it would hardly be possible to fly a british flag in this port not without instant seizure by the dons or boarding and burning by the sullen french creoles yet it was another outre wrench to his alreadywary sense of vulnerability so far from british aid told you shes a store ship not a storesship ahem mr pollock hooted belowdecks weve goods counters storage shelvings and glass display cases good as any emporium in london aisles wide enough for the most fashionable ladies skirts too you need to repaint lewrie said with a droll grin pointing at the newcome american hulk that sported redwhiteblue on gunwales lower hull and bulwarks and huge white stars on the blue giant american gridiron flags flew from every mast stump astern of pollocks hulk was a small dowdy store ship flying a french flag the american was just upriver of pollocks and a fourth that flew a spanish flag lay beyond damn those interlopers to hell and gone lewrie damn em all pollock fumed do i show half the usual profit this time i will be flat amazed you sir they wont know you you could go aboard her and see how fine their goods how low their prices browse about spy lewrie drolly thought me he was just about to say it when jugg ambled up wringing his widebrim farmers hat in his hands as if loath to intrude and clearing his throat for attention beg pardon sir but at th head o th line jugg said cant rightly say from here sir but damned if she dont look peculiar like our missing prize dye not think so capm lewrie looked nonplussed for a second wondering if the task of finding her could possibly be this easy then spun as quickly as decorum allowed to eye her with his telescope the azucena del oeste was edging in nearly alongside her store ships landing stage making the viewing angle acute so he couldnt make out all her details perhaps half her stern gallery and transom but a slice of her starboard side yet she seemed at least a tad familiar a ship hed seen before know her mister pollock lewrie asked his gaze intent upon the strange ship never clapped eyes on her before sir pollock glumly stated lewrie could make out royal blue upperworks and bulwarks that tweaked his memory she bore ornate carvings about her stern gallery and sash windows her arched taffrail and lanthorn posts and quartergalleries mermaids cherubs seahorses and dolphins all the work of decent carpenters and painted in white pink and pale blue decorated with gilt filigrees and they twanged his chords of memory too that last sight hed seen of her in daylight after her midnight taking as she sailed off for dominica her nameboards did not match though nothing decorative but merely rectangular planks that didnt equal the size or shape of those that might have once adorned her leaving faint bands of pale timbers not darkened by sea sun linseed oil or tar at his acute angle he could barely make out a crudely paintedon name not carved intaglio fleur de sud that name most definitely did not match his dimmed recollection her lower hull her quickwork his last sight of her shed been heeled over heavily exposing a badly maintained hull below the waterline and before hed turned away to deal with proteuss demands he could recall thinking that she might not fetch the highest price at auction for she hadnt been completely coppered against barnacles and shipkilling teredo worms along her waterline and for about two or three feet below it shed been coated with linseedsoaked felt tarpaper and stark whitelead paint before the proper bronzegreened chequerboard of copper sheets began pennypinching ships husbands a miserly master or a dearth of sheetcopper in the french antilles where shed departed after her last slapdash beaching to burn off seaweed and chip away barnacles forced to make do with all the copper that could be had outside a european port tacked on down where it mattered most on the hope that if she got weeded it might be where it could be gotten at by her sailors when still under way heeled well over to leeward as her people hung in bosuns chairs on her windward side damn my eyes lewrie exclaimed at last taking his telescope from his eye i do blieve youre right mister jugg thats her to the life damme we found her right off why this all could turn out simpler than we first thought uhoh lewrie thought a second later fate forget i said it saying such hopeful things he had learned from hard experience was about as bad as whistling on deck a dare to dame fortune to come boot him up the arse as she usually did again chapter ten silks satins cambrics and lace cards of steel sewing needles and pins from sheffield bolts of cloth from sheerest cotton or linen to winterweight hardfinished broadcloth and kerseymere wools dolls so lifelike one expected them to move or speak dressed in miniature to exhibit the latest styles from paris for one of which lewrie greedily spoke up as a gift for his daughter charlotte there were stacks of gentlemens hats in every style gloves for gentlemen and ladies from canvas duck or deerskin work gloves to the thinnest snuggest kidskin there were cases of elegant shoes and boots readymade readytowear that went swaying up on a yardarm from azucena del oeste to the stout landing stage thence by ramp or yardarm into the emporium hulk wooden casks and strawpacked crates bearing gin sherry fine clarets ports madeiras and aged brandies emerged followed by bales of readymade shirts boxes of neckstocks boxes of spooled ribbons and flouncings ornate penknives workaday jackknives needlethin smallswords and scabbards slim hunting hangers oldstyle swept hilt rapiers and matching daggers pocket watches fobs and chains ormulu clocks mantel clocks and hallway clocks duelling pistols cased dragoon pistols by the dozen to the box pocket pistols rifled german jaegers and pennsylvania hunters fowling pieces blunderbusses coachguns flints powder flasks bullet moulds and lead nippers and vent picks spices sealing waxes tallow and beeswax candles for entertaining thick votives and short stubby prayer candles and coffee beans sugar cones and licorice whips cinnamon sticks bitter blocks of chocolate teas and tea caddies mote spoons everyday tableware sterling silver compotes and candelabras coffee and tea services complete sets of silverware and the trading brig was only half unloaded the rest will be landed on the quays the rougher goods mr pollock announced as they took a break for supper aboard readymade slop clothing cruder shoes and such for the planters slaves rough muskets and indian trade goods the sort of junk our agents will fob off among the yankee settlers too another day and well empty her of the quality goods then slant over to the docks to unload the rest then what do i do lewrie asked as they shared a succulent supper aboard ship do i just loaf about go ashore and prowl or don the guise that your mister peel chose for you mister willoughby pollock said winking craftily as he reached for a bottle of hock being back on his home turf had cheered up the little fellow most disgustingly wondrous lewrie thought stand with a tally as the cargo is broken from the hold you are ostensibly in charge of my newhired protective force ahem temporarily employed in support of our dowdy commercial doings such a dangerouslookin chap really pollock stroked a finger down his left cheek to sketch lewries teenyears duelling scar on his own face lewrie knew he was being twitted paid back for all the bloodthirsty teasing hed used upon the unsettled pollock on the voyage i still dont know as i care much for lewrie objected willoughby s a common name after all pollock breezily said with a dismissive wave of his hand you might even claim to be american its so common on both sides of the atlantic and your accent isnt so oxonion or toplofty that you could not play the part of a newcome american to the spanish and creoles at least an emigre from old england to the new world as are so many and it is your sires name so well lewrie replied sulkily accepting a glass for a bit i thought peel was having too much fun building me a persona without a thought as to whether itd be plausible in a private moment ahem mister peel might have said to me that willoughby was a name youd not forget were you ever flustered pollock twinkled barely concealing a grin aye pollock was enjoying himself at last and that right maliciously too in my cups a melting moment lewrie gravelled were i stuck for an answer to hello damn that smarmy bastard you cant pose as anything but a former serving officer mr pollock pretended to commiserate losing his grin youre much too weathered and roguishlooking to play a clerk after all sir even the way you walk will cry sailor soon as you step ashore to be a cashiered royal navy officer fled to the united states in search of a seafaring post to remake your fortune is frankly perfect ahem and so easy for my dim wits to remember lewrie groused i see the sense of it aye i think i know how to play it assure me pray do pollock entreated im an overaged lieutenant lewrie almost singsonged what peel had had the gall to write down for him to study on the voyage was rather little patronage or interest lived mostly on my pay and never had a speck of luck with prizemoney one command early on a despatch cutter glorious fun but then i was advanced aboard a third rate seventyfour and that was boresome blockading with no chance to advance and no adventure or fun either mmmhmm pollock encouraged tween sips of pepperpot soup competent but no ones pet lewrie impatiently recited his false biography one slightly borrowed from his own past aboard the gun hms ariadne as a midshipman the despatch schooner hms parrot started in the american revolution second or third son of a freehold family but nothing grand im thirtysix so i spent a lot of time tween the wars on halfpay knocking about in the merchant service so i can bore people to death with tales about the far east canton in china calcutta and know what im saying mate aboard a country ship not with the east india company thatd be too grand for me quite pollock primly simpered over the bowl of his spoon back in the navy in when the war broke out lewrie went on by then bored with repeated recitations impress service not sea duty though deptford cause my old captain lilycrop held that district as were you for a time pollock pointed out aye i did damn yer eyes then lewrie muttered taking time to sample his soup and take a drink of wine um i learned one could make a shower o tin crimping merchant sailors even with legitimate protections farm lads fiddled the books too over the costs of recruiting claimed more than i brought in took bribes from merchant captains tlook the other way and and you ended out here in my employ pollock concluded for him as if laying a permanent claim upon him the very sort of tarhanded fellow we need who knows his way with artillery good with an assortment of weapons knows how to lead men useful but ruthless none too squeamish if heads need knocking together hmm though pollock stopped of a sudden and gave lewrie a skeptical appraising up and down like a disbelieving london tailor presented with a crude countryput ape to garb what you now wear will do aboard ship but he speculated for a long moment before i turn you loose on the city to do whatever it is youll do to seek your pirates i fancy you should adopt better togs now employed you might be accepted all the more as a flash dandy now you have the chink new orleans is hipdeep in dandies think of it as a way of ah blending in do you own shoregoing attire mister willoughby ahem never had need of em lewrie gruffly replied wondering what new horror might be foisted upon him evry stitch o long clothes i own are back in england then we must come up with something suitable mustnt we mr pollock decided with a lazy feral smile and a chuckle worthy of a covent garden pimp cant have you looking too elegant but i think that a bit of the gentleman with a bit of the captain sharp will suit your needs right down to your toes heh heh oh bloody joy lewrie warily groaned sure hed despise mr pollocks choices even if he did know his home ground and its tastes to a tee and half worried that the wretched little man would charge him for new clothing couldnt i lurk about in what im wearing lewrie asked him youd look like a costumed spy right off pollock warned him best to appear as close to the locals style as you may and be taken for what the town expects to see from a man of your new station as for lurking how else do we find the pirates who time enough for that pollock assured him all in good time chapter eleven christ im a covent garden pimp lewrie sourly thought taking in his new suitings in a wavy speckled old cheval mirror aboard the emporium hulk one o the canting crew a pickpocket an amuser mr pollock had suggested a touch of captain sharp and by god hed delivered a tawdry ensemble usually sported by buttock brokers and confidence men professional gamblers and neerdowells or those who blew snuff in a cullys eyes in a dark street then robbed him of all he hadthe amusers of ill repute hed been given a tightly woven and widebrimmed planters hat made of the slimmest straw or cane fibres from cuba nigh as big about as a washtub what local settlers called a wideawake since it was nearly impossible to see whether the wearer was asleep or awake underneath its cooling shade if one had ones head down below that he now was clad in an exaggerated tailcoat assured that it was all the go in paris london or madrid the lapels were extremely wide the square cutaways didnt come down to his waist there was no way it could button together over his chest and its long scissortails fell to the backs of his knees the sleeves were almost excruciatingly snug and puffed up where they joined the shoulders putting lewrie in mind of a gown his wife caroline was partial to the tailcoat was bottle green but made from an extremely glittery fabric under that he wore a shiny nubbysilk waistcoat weaved in vertical stripessalmon burgundy white and tan with lapels of its own best displayed overlaid upon the coat lapels so very snug shortwaisted and doublebreasted that he found it hard to breathe sensible neckstocks were no longer the ton no one had to wear a florid paisley frog invention the cravat which even tied could do double duty as a childs bib or a diners napkin and tickled his chin every time he moved it was so big wide and puffy pollock let him keep his own watch fob and chain but tricked him out in trousers much snugger and more stylish than his accustomed slop trousers at sea they were white and fitted so close to his calves that he had no trouble donning a horsemans topboots a small pistol fit into his coats breast pocket its twin in the small of his back he could wear his own gills hanger but on a flashier snakeclasp waist belt finally with a cherryebony walking stick to fend off riffraff and mendicantsit hid a slim eighteeninch sword as wellhe was simply the crack and all the go before pollock trusted him to survive on his own versus suspected pirates though that worthy sent lewrie and jugg still dressed as an idle bullybuck aboard the yankee emporium hulk to check out their wares and prices think of it as a dress rehearsal mr pollock had chirped jugg also went well armed his clothes were so loose he could carry a whole armory so much so that lewrie feared hed give himself away by the clanking damn pollock and commerce lewrie thought after only a few minutes aboard in the main display area on the lower deck the prices were chalked on slate or penned on brown paper scraps atop the baskets or bins altogether a mindboggling array of international currencies and exchange rates louisiana should ask payment in centavos escudos or silver dollars even old piecesofeight but like the rest of the caribbean and the new world local currency amounted to whatever was at hand including austrian maria theresas all dated as well as dutch danish french or portuguese coinage try as he might to make the calculations in his head to recall prices and what sold the quickest lewrie couldnt keep things straight without a surreptitious jotting with a pencil stub and a foldedover sheet of foolscap with his nervousness over being caught out and without any decent ventilation belowdecks and a winters day in new orleans sullenly hot and muggily humid he was quickly reduced to a muddleheaded puddle people always said i was too dense tmake change but lord he fretted and whenever sales clerks looked his way he broke out in a fresh sweat reducing his original sour opinion of his appearance from pimp to a whore in church or a guiltylooking potential shoplifter and pollocks list of prime items to be compared in price which he thought hed mostly memorised had quite flown his head what hed do when spyingout pirates he couldnt imagine the american emporium seemed to be doing a thriving business at that somewhat early hour in spite of the closeness elegantly gowned creole ladies and their everpresent slave maids swished about slowly more sashaying or parading than shopping as if borrowing the spanish custom of strolling the city squares each evening eligible young ladies circulating clockwise and the young men strutting in the opposite direction they tittered behind their fans and they softly giggled and peered over the lace fantops hang pollock and his junk lewrie thought theres women afoot and some of them were quite pretty and fetching some of mixed race but almost white some ravenhaired but blueeyed the majority with sandy or light brown hair and green blue or amber eyes which put him in mind of caroline this gave him a check for an instant but did not deter him from circumspect ogling fantasising undressing them with his imagination he looked down for a moment into a discreet bin back at the rear of a glass display case of medicaments and saw a pile of paperwrapped cundums priced at um pesos to pounds thats one pound seven shillings to the dozen or two shillings thruppence each and thats highway robbery he rapidly figured then felt his mouth almost drop open in astonishment amazin what you can do do you put yer mind to it he told himself pepper salt and thimble prices might be chinee chicken tracks to lewrie but something prurient ever would spark his interests help you sir another roving clerk suggested from behind the counter no no just looking about lewrie tried to reply glibly languidly though the interruption almost made him leap from his own skin with an eep fresh sweat awoke he blinked rapidly but of course ya are sir the clerk sarcastically accused ye kin help me then jugg said at his elbow id admire a halfdozen cigaros them slimuns no biggern yer little finger an a wee flask o whisky yer payin are ye not mister willoughby as ye promised jugg hinted all but digging him in the ribs with an elbow all chummylike um lewrie stammered turning to peer bugeyed at jugg who was smiling fit to bust well this once i spose he said though feeling the urge to clout the impudent bastard silly clap him in irons in the cabletiers then have him flogged bloody for his egalitarian sauce sailors and officers english and irish were akin to oil and waterthey never mixed need a deal more of em for th rest o th lads so we will sor fore we saddle up an head for th backcountry jugg continued prospectin for land are ya the clerk asked in a friendly manner no longer considering lewrie a sneakthief hopin tdo some tradin in the east bank country aint we jugg confided as if inspired got th lads tgether got the capm here tlead an only lackin trade goods tmake a payin proposition right mister willoughby why the bastard had the nerve to wink huh what lewrie silently flummoxed peering at the bearded rogue as if hed never clapped eyes on him before perhaps find some land to claim as well lewrie said at last as if that was a secret wrung from him his reply certainly was wrung store or trading post eventually um might as well let me have a flask of whisky too the clerk fetched out their purchases then produced a flintlock tinderbox with which to light juggs cigaro making him lean over the counter to do so with a fiendish little grin jugg handed lewrie one and he had no choice but to get his lit too and puff it into life the clerk named a figure lewrie dug into his coinpurse to show british coins paid the translated rate and then at the clerks request went up the civilianstyle stairs of the awning weather deck to smoke them thankee sor i owes ya jugg gleefully muttered round his lit and glowing cigaro bloody hell jugg now see hear my man aint on th ship sor jugg idly pointed out rocking on the balls of his feet and exhaling a jet of smoke before pulling the cork of his quarterpint flask of whisky with his teeth and spitting it out overside an this aint playactin not gainst th sort o people wot took th prize ship an marooned us kindly beggin yer pardon an all capm sor youre tbe a cashiered awfcer im t play an irish neerdowell mebbe spent some time among th yankees an caught at democracy fever man like med never tug is forelock nor scrape an bow thim

even in a sham just till were back aboard good ol proteus capm sor then im back in yer harness like jugg vowed turning earnest we step outta character dye see my meanin an them piratesll scrag us in a

some parts them actors played looked to be more fun than others capm sor christ just dont develop bad habits you cant break later jugg lewrie cautioned unable to do much more to the man not in public at least not as long as they were stranded so far from the navys discipline oh aye and i wont on me honour swear it yer honour sor jugg vowed quite theatrically dropping into a deeper oirish brogue on me poor mithers eyes i tis faith and arrah jugg japed an ant these th foinest swayet cigaros mister willoughby and oi thankee kindly fer em and atall and atall oh stop yer gob lewrie said slumping in surrender though ready to turn away run to the nearest rail and laugh in spite of all he took a puff on his cigaro but it had almost gone out after being amateurishly neglected lewrie hadnt even been tempted to partake of tobacco since hed hocked up half his lungs among the muskogee indians in the last time hed been involved in a similarly covert expedition jugg blew ash off the glowing tip of his own and offered it to relight lewries he was bent over and sucking to reignite his when a boisterous pack of shoppers came tramping up the sets of stairs leading from the landing stage and lewrie turned his eyes to look at them what the devil he whispered half coughing for the pall of fresh smoke had been trapped beneath the wide drooping front brim of his wideawake hat making his eyes water yankees sor jugg muttered from the side of his mouth an a rare lot they are sure outre might have been a better choice of words for the yankees rather than rare they were frontiersmen of a certainty clad in longfringed hunting shirts of homespun cloth or supple but stained deerskin they wore homespun trousers stuffed into the tops of kneehigh boots deerskin trousers laced inside calflength moccasins or loose and napping over anklehigh beaded moccasins at every hip was a fighting knife that looked as if it had started life as a doubleedged broadsword or scottish claymore some wore nearly civilised coats and shirts though none of those wore neckstocks or cravats and their headgear ran the gamut from tricornes to flatbrim farm hats shapeless spreading conetopped slouch hats castoff army cocked hats jacobintype stocking caps an assortment of ratty straw things and several masked and tailed fur caps that departed life as honest and upstanding foxes raccoons and possums one man a particularly blanklooking and pimply malevolence whose eyes almost crossed had on a blackandwhite fur cap that fixed lewries gawping teary blinking attention whut the fur cap wearer truculently said noticing that he was being ogled like a whirling persian dervish in hyde park air ye lookin at me mister which growl brought the others to a halt i uh lewrie spluttered back i dont believe ive ever seen your species of hat sir it isnt cat is it polecat the wearer of that hat snapped back ye wanna make somethin o hit now georgie the much betterdressed apparent leader of the gang cautioned as crosseyes thumped closer to lewrie and the rest sidled behind him to watch the confrontation he heaved a little sigh as if to say here wego again as he stayed by georgies side as if to intervene or referee should it come to blows polecat is what they call a skunk lewrie asked determined to stand his ground and glad for all the weaponry that he bore of a sudden hit is georgie said an what ohit with georgie only six feet away from him lewrie could note that the skunks mask had been left on as well as its long bushy and luxuriant black tail with two white stripes tiny yellow glass beads had been sewn into the eye sockets and the lips of its long sharp muzzle had shrunk back from two rows of wee teeth as if it still grinned dont they ah smell rather bad lewrie enquired taking what he hoped was a casual but expert puff on his cigaro yeah ey do so georgie rumbled from deep in his throat well id expect it took a deal o work to skin and tan it lewrie replied with studied nonchalance upwind all the time id wager this close to him the unforgettable odour of skunk merely a slight tang of it reawoke lewries memory of the genuine undiluted article and he strove not to wrinkle his nose huh soaked hit near two weeks in a cold fast crick afore i could touch hit georgie boasted partially disarmed from his anger wisht georgied spent at long soakin in wawter another of his buckskinned companions hooted whyever did you kill it if it took so long and smelt so bad lewrie further enquired hit piss me awf georgie said with an affronted snort got inna mchicken coop astealin ayggs an en hayud th gall tspray at me huh ats th las thayng he ever done lewrie couldnt tell which reek was worse the skunkfur cap or georgie in general both shared a sourcorpse musk mixed with wood smoke crudely braintanned leather old sweat and wet tobacco sourwet wool and felt mudsoiled feet and toes and scrofulous crotch and armpits taken altogether the frontiersman was a positive melange of aromas and could have kept his cats toulon and chalky sniffing in sheer ecstacy for hours their little jaws as agape as miniature lions to savour the subtlest effluvia stout fellow lewrie exclaimed to further disarm him holding out his unopened flask of whisky capital work georgie stared at him glareful as if wondering if he was being twitted then at the offered flask eyes aswim as if having trouble in focussing on anything that close georgie finally took the flask bit down on the cork pulled it with his brown teeth those remaining that is and spat it to the deck he shifted a quid of chawbaccy to the other side of his mouth tipped the flask up and drained it in two or three long gulps i dont spose theres a market for skunkfur caps lewrie wondered aloud to the betterdresed fellow who seemed to be their leader during the revolution benjamin franklins coonskins were all the rage in paris the frogs were mad for em no i doubt they is the man chuckled as the tension evaporated georgie ripped off a stentorian belch then beamed at lewrie with a dank quiddribbly smile youre a tradin fellah are you mister ah alan willoughby lewrie said extending his hand and pleased that despite peels cynical sneer he had no trouble recalling it jim hawk ellison the other said shaking hands were down from tennessee say thankee for the whisky georgie thankee mister georgie said almost bobbing now so what line o goods ya handle then mister willoughby oh this and that what sells best upriver or on the eastern bank lewrie shrugged off were asking about first before we buy any goods jugg and i this is toby jugg one of my men say hello to mister ellison jugg he smirkily suggested getting a bit of his own back after jugg had twigged him mister jugg ellison offered how do mister ellison sor jugg said knuckling the wide brim of his hat first then hesitantly taking ellisons hand as if that congenial social convention was only for gentlemen outside his experience british and irish ya sound sirs ellison decided his face tweaked up into a wry expression a long way from home are you well werent you british before the revolution as well sir lewrie posed about ready to hock up another lung in dread that theyd been found out not an hour after setting off on their own in a manner of speaking that is hah mr jim hawk ellison hooted with mirth flinging his head back for a second i spose we were at that and some of our rich folk from the coasts the first states sometime act as if they still were at times from tennessee lewrie speculated that makes you a long way from home yourself mister ellison what uh line do you follow land speculatin ellison replied as if it was of no matter on the eastern banks he added as if to mystify with a shrug and a wink oh youre with the yazoo company then lewrie asked no theyre too big a fish for me ellison chuckled call it a private venture some friends and associates of mine in nashborough thats our new state capital ya know thought to put a company of their own tgether the robertsons donelsons and overtons got the real power but theyre lookin west to the mississippi tother side o the tennessee river now they got the middle of the state sewed up i come from north carolina first off right after the war ended i read for the law in salisbury but sorta followed our militia overmountain teast tennessee liked it better an never left had a hand in startin the state o franklin with john sevier and them til virginia an both carolinas run it under drifted on over tnashborough just before tennessee got statehood an ya know what mister willougby not a bit o credit nor profit ever come from any of it oh what a pity lewrie commiserated though it was disconcerting to be the recipient of such a tale of woe right off english gentlemen would never blurt out the details of their lives so early in a passing acquaintanceship nor nighbrag upon their failures in life to anyone english or not close kin or not though he could recall a unique colonial american trait in the loyalists hed met when serving with them during the revolution ask what day it was and hed get a full hours discourse he put it down to yankees springing from a much smaller circle of society their rusticity and isolation resulting in a belief that everyone they met was almost kin besides he could sneer when you came down to it americans had no other diverting amusements so youve come south in hopes of better lewrie asked and ya know what they say hope springs eternal ellison almost gaily admitted oh i had a land grant from servin with the army for a spell sixtyfour hundred acres the continental congress and the state o north carolina said i was thave but by the time they got through squabblin over who could issue my grantcongress an three statesand all of it in franklin i hadta sell up for ten cent an acre not much tshow for four years o fightin the cow pens and kings mountain camden and you whipped banastre tarleton lewrie exclaimed and kings mountain i still own one of major patrick fergusons breechloader rifles that he clapped his mouth shut but a sorrowful second too late trying to be congenial and sociable he was betrayed by his dislike for tarleton and his enthusiasm for fine firearms do tell ellison cagily said almost peeking from beneath the brim of his hat thought wed captured em all at kings mountain well some fewd been bought before lewrie flummoxed he could almost feel juggs eyes rolling behind his back perhaps hear a sotto voce christ youre hopeless movement of his lips so you were a loyalist then ellison enquired a tory royal navy lewrie confessed with a grunting sound got it from some cape fear loyalists before they went north with cornwallis to yorktown they put it up on a bad wager when we put into wilmington and thankee for whipping tarleton too met him there briefly when he was stabling his cavalry mounts in the pew boxes of saint jamess church the haughty bastard and i ran into him in england too at bath it was in the long rooms one night lewrie continued and most of it true whilst hed been at sixes and sevens on halfpay after paying off his first temporary command the shrike brig he and benedict arnold both the same night in point of fact still wearin their uniforms as if theyd ever be employed again lewrie felt that some unenglish loquaciousness was called for so he prosed on tarleton was the same toplofty arrogant shit but arnold well i spose it was because his wife peggy was with him at the time but he was almost pleasant skint and miserly with his poor stack o coin but pleasant when he wasnt frettin over what he had lost at the tables and doin sums in his head tsee could they afford another bottle o wine that is and howd a british navy officer and his man get into spanish new orleans dont ya know theyd throw ya under the calabozo if they learn youre here ellison asked with a cynical snort ah but im not british any longer dye see lewrie rejoined with a sudden burst of inspiration and jugg well what irishman would claim that if america s open to one and all looking for a fresh start i ask you amen tthat sor jugg seconded with enthusiasm an after wot admiralty did to ya an all arrah jugg for gods sake lewrie spat spinning to blow juggs ears off but stopping a rant at the sight of the mans sly look it is not a subject i bandy about to just he spluttered admittedly he didnt know where jugg was going with it nor did he have a single clue what else he should say to reestablish his manufactured identity knew id muck this up he scathed himself the very details of his false background a sweatsoaked confusing muddle in his own head just got here did ya mister willoughby ellison probed ah two days ago aye lewrie told him dare he say that theyd come on the panton leslie ship azucena del oeste would its spanish registry save him from exposing the whole enterprise or was it widely known as a spy ship the company that owned it deep in the crowns pocket on the azucena del oeste he cautiously added yeah i saw her come in ellison casually said with no more suspicion than previous to his tone panton leslie carries good wares have some arms aboard do they youd be amazed how the easterners from the wrong side of the mountains think tsettle without decent arms nor enough flint shot and powder like all the indians just up an flew away soon as we became a state i believe they do lewrie informed him most especially a quantity of austrian airrifles quiet as anything but very accurate better than a musket but not as good as a pennsylvania rifle decent price theyre asking too i think you ought to at least take a look at em if for no other reason that theyre a rarity sir hmmm maybe i will at that ellison mused aloud rubbing his chin well i haveta go catch up with my wild men before they wreck the place he added with a wry grin they get a snootful and theyre like the old bull in the china shop dont ya know maybe we will run into each other again long as were both in new orleans i favour the pigeonnier cabaret if youre lookin for entertainment on the town got hired rooms nearby thankee for the suggestion mister ellison lewrie said with a relieved grin shaking hands with the fellow once more though he hadnt the first clue as to what a cabaret was or what sort of amusement might be found in one especially one called the pigeon coop mister willoughby mister jugg ellison gallantly said as he doffed his hat and sketched a brief jerking bow in conge forcing them to lift their own lids and show a leg ellison had not taken two steps when he turned about though by the by mister willoughby that was quick thinkin the way ya handled georgie ellison told him greatly amused er ah thankee mister ellison for a minute there i thought youd riled him beyond all temperance when that happens hes a very short fuse the most warning ya have is him sayin ahll kee ye then its katie bar the door ah kee ye lewrie parroted head cocked in query thats country for kill you sir ellison warned not half as jovially as hed been just a moment before then knuckled the brim of his hat spun about and went below to the emporium proper think i blew it do you jugg lewrie felt need to ask once they were alone at the starboard rails by god i do permission tgit ragin drunk sor jugg replied that bad fr when e comes sniffin about an askin me bout ya sor an gits me three sheets tth wind tdo it sure jugg added with a wide grin of expectation ill set him straight no fear sor by god somebody should lewrie bemoaned back turned so he could not hear juggs scathing mouthed amen chapter twelve the de guillerishelio hippolyte and charitewith don rubio monaster and their cousin jeanmarie were at home to receive guests to the casual passerby who took note of their guests arrival nothing could seem more innocent first came monsieur henri maurepas the prim and eminently respectable banker a man known in new orleans as the de guilleris parents factotum and financial advisor who stood in loco parentis to keep the youngsters reined in whilst their elders the dashingly handsome hilaire and the beauteous marie pursued rounds of country pleasures on their upcountry plantations their other two guestscapitaines lanxade and balfamight have drawn more attention as they arrived more envy than anthing else for those two old rogues and their tales of derringdo were always welcome in french creole parlours nothing could seem more innocentcafe au lait sweets and freshbaked biscuits bright laughter and vicarious thrills though inside the grand upperstorey appartement on the rue dauphine everyone sat stiffly upright in expectation or slumped in boredom as henri maurepas droned on through his dry financial summary results in a profit to the reunion enterprise of four hundred fifty thousand spanish dollars maurepas fussily related monsieur maurepas was one of those gotchgutted minikins what crude americans would call shadbellied though a fine satin waistcoat and a gold watch chain tautly spanned that appliance the balding maurepas patted his shiny pate and fiddled with his little oval spectacles awarding them a wee smile as he summed up his report the bank has deducted its tenth part as your agent a twentieth part goes to monsieur bistineau to cover those bribes he paid the spanish authorities at the cabildo to land untaxed goods another fortyfive thousand dollars i shifted into the revolutionary fund for purchase of weapons shot and powder to arm new recruits less a further ten percent each due capitaines lanxade and balfa and shares to reward their sailors ah that leaves ten percent to be divided equally between you young people as the principals that is to say nine thousand silver dollars each he ended with a short seated bow to every person present which shares are now deposited in your accounts to draw upon as you wish if he thought hed made them happy then he was wrong rubio monaster went poutily redfaced penniless jeanmarie rancour whose family had fled bloody saintdomingue with nothing went pale and gaping in disappointment as for the doughty pirate capitaines you cheeseparing bougre boudreaux balfa erupted leaping to his feet you an dat bistineau salaud too him he gets dem goods for nothin den sells em dear an bribin de spanish he done did all de time by damn normal bid ness wit bistineau eh merde we cant go back to our crew with promises or bank slips we need to take them their shares in coin now capt jerome lanxade demanded rising with his left hand on the hilt of his smallsword and with a wee creak from his own appliance that bonestayed corset that kept his own boudins from resembling the bankers they will not wait for their money they signed on for a quick payout with nothing up front but wine rum and rations and had to provide their own hammocks and sea kits theyre waiting aboard le revenant where we hid her for their money and i tell you banker they will not wait long they have no trust in lubberly accounts they want silver and gold but capitaine that much specie in one batch will weigh so much my bank does not hold reserves that maurepas tried to demur your bank m sieur and you yourself entered into our scheme with assurances to us that you did so from pure patriotic fervour do you now wish to see everything fall apart because you refused to take risks helio de guilleri accusingly spat still slumped upon a table edge by one arm this is for louisiana s freedom for france after what the gallant french people did to throw off the despotism of king louis and the ancien regime charite de guilleri chid him from her seat at the other side of the table she sat erect and prim hands clasped together in her lap as she would at mass with her family after the example even the bumpkinish americans showed us when they wrote their declaration of independence m sieur maurepas that they pledged their property their lives and their sacred honour to oust the perfidious anglais freeing louisiana from spanish tyranny and declaring ourselves part of republican france is just as noble a cause shame msieur maurepas for shame mademoiselle i would do anything for our coming revolution but a successful revolution must have a sound financial footing and i cannot assure you that foundation without being somewhat circumspect m maurepas insisted dabbing at his face with a handkerchief ready to polish the lenses of his spectacles of the irritationfog that his skin had generated money is power young people as powerful as massed artillery for it buys the guns the shot and powder it clothes and feeds the brave pays their damned wages capitaine lanxade nastily growled keep de ship dat make money afloat an ready to fight money balfa gruffly added he had sat back down and was now squashed into a hairy hogpile of muscles his arms crossed over his chest an not enough money by gar forty percent for de men dats only uh one hundred eighty tousand dollar only four tousand dollar apiece and dey can drink dat up in a week mebbe the bank only take five percent and dat revolution fund go short dis time mebbe so hem but we agreed upon a maurepas said in a scandalised gasp two hundred and forty thousand silver dollars to be shared by our hands lanxade proposed stroking his mustachios and twirling a tip as if the matter was settled thats fairer that will be over five thousand dollars per sailor he loosely guessed perhaps msieur maurepas in the pure revolutionary spirit charite sweetly and calmly suggested might reduce his banks share to seven and a half percent just this once and perhaps our wise advisor will also speak to msieur bistineau about reducing his firms upfront cut as well since he will make such an outsized profit from our goods which cost him nothing but his complicity if you take pains to point that out to him m sieur i am sure he will act in the patriotic spirit but maurepas spluttered and we still have the prize ship to sell charite continued in her sweetest parlour manner the epitome of a softspoken and wellbred creole lady which might reap another fifty thousand dollars or so if not here then at havana veracruz tampico or cartagena i think our capitaines are right m sieur maurepas if our crew is not well rewarded they will melt away and well lose the means to earn future profits no more money for the revolutionary fund and no hope of freeing ourselves of spanish rule until those despicable anglosaxon americains take all the southwest from them then where would we be don rubio grimly added always eager to second anything charite proposed theyd make us american please god save us from that fate brr he mockshivered in disgust no more than five percent to the fund brother helio proposed to the banker when the ship is sold a second deposit of course five thousand dollars per sailor maurepas haggled making a total of um two hundred twentyfive thousand else you would have to wait until i purchase coins from veracruz or havana pah balfa hooted scrubbing his grey locks in frustration six thousand be better dat be two hundred seventy tousand and i better be on my way wit it down bayou barataria tonight sixty percent for de crew like de ol days dat then perhaps you and capitaine lanxade for the good of the revolution monsieur maurepas slyly countered might agree to reducing your share from twenty percent to fifteen to be split between you merely for a short time til the ship is sold of course for my part i will agree to seven and one half percent temporarily after all the sailors requirements come before the officers nestcepas you thieving bougre capt balfa roared in protest take de food out de mouths of ma famille you nom dun chien only til the ship is sold off messieurs charite quickly seconded batting her eyelashes at balfa who was immune and then at capt lanxade who most assuredly was not despite his deeply held reservations about her ruthlessness still and all lanxade considered shed be a delightful temporary lay lanxade preened his mustachios a bit more and struck a noble pose intended to impress the mort naturellement msieur maurepas lanxade declaimed the wise leader sees to the needs of his men first bon seven and one half percent to me and to boudreaux as well just this once hein it is necessary though that balfa and i take the crews share to them as soon as possible tonight would be best banker maurepas quickly scribbled on the back of his prepared notes heaved a wee sigh then removed his glasses with a pittance of two and one half percent in the revolutionary fundthe crew will split fiftyfive percent or fiftyfive hundred dollars per man and that i regret to say is the best i can manage until the ship is sold off the de guilleris sister and brothers their cousin jeanmarie and their hired buccaneers shared equally glum expressions with each other then reluctantly gave their consent to such a division bon maurepas said gently slapping his expensive calfskin book shut and rising i will make the adjustments once i get back to the bank and will have the specie ready no later than tomorrow evening tonight is out of the question capitaine lanxade but tomorrow for certain will you bold gentlemen require your shares in coin at the same time he asked forcing himself to be genial fingers crossed i will gladly let you carry me as a depositor in your strongboxes m sieur maurepas but for a mere thousand in silver dollars ox pesos capt lanxade grandly announced with an elegant bow and leg you gimme five thousand balfa tetchily demanded my famille need tings from town dem it shall be done well maurepas said brightening i think that concludes our first successful work towards the freedom of louisiana dont you adieu mademoiselle messieurs the banker said as he made a graceful bow and leg in conge clapping his narrowbrimmed highcrowned townsmans thimble hat over his heart and departing the cool and airy apartment on the second storey of the elegant pension despite m maurepass apparent gaiety he once more felt the pangs of serious misgivings that hed ever been damnfool enough to become part of their bloody scheme his reputation his neck did the spaniards discover his complicity those brainless brats who were sure to overreach themselves or boast immoderate to the wrong people dear as reunion with france was to him sweet as it would be to oust every last arrogant shamhidalgo spaniard surely it could not rest on such a slender bundle of reeds where were the wise adult patriots need a drink me balfa huskily decided wash de foul taste of bankers away lets go jerome now we so damn rich ill buy dont you have shopping for your famille to do first capt lanxade reminded him if we head down the bayou tomorrow night ill meet you at the cabaret later lanxade only slowly gathered up his hat and cane his elegant new kidskin gloves bought by the dozen on credit from m bistineaus store mile charite had crooked a finger and glanced to the empty chair by her side when balfas attention was distracted and lanxade was curious to see if his sham nobility and selflessness had improved his chances at putting the leg over oui later cher balfa glumly said gathering up his things as well mademoiselle charite helio hippolyte jeanmarie adieu he bobbed them each a sketchy bow then clopped out through the hall door his feet shod for once in silverbuckled shoes and not the wooden sabots he kept for mucky weather or town visits drumming on the parquet and i thought there was money in piracy cousin jeanmarie moaned absently chewing on a thumbnail there is jean helio said going to the side board for wine there would be if you didnt spend all your time at the pigeonnire playing boure next trip therell be more hippolyte prophecied joining his brother for a glass as well theres sure to be we could sail off to the west and take a rich ship full of mexican silver and gold that would require a better ship than le revenant young sir lanxade idly responded carefully seating himself beside the desirable charite who today was forced by societal conventions to wear her hair up and a gauzy but somewhat chastely lined highwaisted puffsleeved gown with dainty flat shoes on her silksheathed feet instead of knee boots her light citrony scent was maddening to lanxades senses but did we take another fast schooner as fine as le revenant charite eagerly said turning to face capt lanxade and batting away like billyo with her long lashes her blue eyes glittering may not two small ships equal a bigger capitaine i know you are our most experienced mentor in these matters but could not two schooners crewed by oh perhaps no more than sixty men double our chances well mademoiselle lanxade replied with one experienced eyebrow cocked i dare say two schooners would suit me better for the taking of a much bigger and wellarmed treasure ship oui but and with two ships we could place dear old capitaine balfa on his own quarterdeck again as he most desires charite suggested once we have the two schooners of course with two we could seize a single ship full of coin and reap three or four times the profits of a string of poor captures could we not m sieur assuredly mademoiselle charite lanxade all but simpered then we could afford the arms and pay with which to raise our rebel army charite almost giddily fantasised fanning herself with a laced silk and ivory folding fan and approach even more capitaines to join us then there would be no shortage of sailors quel dommage that for now we seem to have so many men for our one little schooner two capitaines why at this rate it will take us years to build our secret fund with m sieur maurepass bank it would be a grave mistake to pay off crewmen just to save a few sous lanxade frostily said as he twigged to what she was driving at all for her foolish rebellion but nothing for those who make it come about he sarcastically thought shes mad the rest are just greedy after all who will form the backbone of our liberation if we disenchant the ones we first recruited we carry a large crew so we can sail and fight the prizes that we take and defend le revenant you see lanxade explained striving for patience with them did he make them angry hed lose his berth and the loot that went with it more than hed made in three years of the river trade lanxade knew in his bones that nothing would come of their scheming but at least it was profitable while it lasted this is so aboard any privateer in wartime the cost of doing business non if we do not lavish profit on our hands theyll jump ship even strike out on their own in competition with us n estce pas he instructed with the simpery bemused air of tutor to pupil capable and ruthless sailors cost dearly but they are worth their weight in silver ah mais oui i understand mile charite said with a heave of her chest most wondrous to lanxades lascivious covert oglings you are right as usual dear capitaine lanxade forgive us our ignorance and lack of experience with such things but it is so frustrating for the coffers to fill so slowly to glean but not to reap the funds to reunite us with beloved france we all know that but for you and capitaine balfa and your sailors we find so little support so thin the contributions from other patriot creoles our poor people she bemoaned as she drew a delicately embroidered handkerchief from her tight sleeve and dabbed at her eyes we creoles so proud and prone to florid speeches we can be so enthusiastic but so lacking when it comes to conclusions or acting on them so many swear they wholeheartedly support what we propose but will they join us fund us or take up arms act really do anything she sneered like those snails maurepas and bistineau all is profit profit profit and gain and freedom is someday someday someday if it isnt too much trouble she heaved another heavy fetching sigh nigh a hiccough forgive me capitaine lanxade but my lack is patience i quite understand mademoiselle charite lanxade cooed with a comforting avuncular warmth to his voice had they been alone without her brothers or calfheaded cousin or that prinking dago don rubio with his sheeps eyes he would have put a supportive male arm about her offered a broad shoulder on which she could incline her weak head we all share your impatience my dear lanxade did lean closer like a parish priest taking confession in the open countryside on his rustic circuit charite de guilleri bestowed upon him a grateful wideeyed grin for his support then slithered to her feet in a rustle of satins and crossed to the sideboard for the glass of wine that helio offered bitch lanxade thought seething she did it to me again the minx the mort the lanxade knew he was being played like a flute but thered come a time someday when hed take what he wanted if there is another matter capitaine charite said once she had taken a sip or two of an excellent and effervescent white wine that odious british trade ship from panton leslie company has docked and has more people aboard than usual helio has heard rumours that panton leslie has close ties to the british government do you think they might be trouble capitaine lanxade oh in the american war they might have had a contract to the british army in florida lanxade airily dismissed with a soft chuckle they still profit off the indian trade with the cabildos connivance the american trade up the great river too but i myself have met many of them sailed upriver or down and camped with them many times and there is nothing mysterious about them if they have extra people aboard perhaps it is to guard the mule trains or learn the trade half a dozen hard wellarmed men helio contributed frowning in concern led by a man with fighting experience i sent a slave to look the ship over and he heard this man respectfully called capitaine he has a scar on his left cheek so hes certain to have been a soldier but he walks like a sailor they all do what need has panton leslie of sailors to guard their trade by land might the anglais send a pack of cutthroats or spies to look for their missing ship and the ones who took her jeanmarie cried leaping nervously to his feet a lone prize taken so far from here lanxade scoffed not even the british are that vengeful theyre fighting a war with both france and spain their hands are already full nonetheless it is disturbing don rubio said slinking near charite as if to offer needful male comfort to allay any fears which offer almost made capt lanxade curl his upper lip twirl at his mustachios and sneer at the hapless lusting fool or turn gruff at the importunings of a possible rival shouldnt we look into it hippolyte suggested fearfully as if jeanmaries dread was catching well if you must lanxade replied with a shrug this fellow and his bully boys will be easy enough to locate in a town as small as new orleans and if they are british sailors sailors of any nation they must come off their ship to get drunk and pleasured must they not hein watchers to track them even talk to them once theyre in their cups you can manage that i expect all five of them stared at him as if silently demanding more i can ask around as well lanxade allowed them shrugging as if it was a bootless chore but one hed do despite how futile such a task would surely turn out to be he got to his feet at last since it didnt look as if his employers and fellow conspirators would offer him a glass of that white wine you should worry more about a crowd of americans who just sailed down from tennessee backwoods rustics in stinking skins but they are led by a man who also has the bearing of a soldier and he was asking about the procurement of large quantities of arms powder and shot another pack of wouldbe filibustero freebooters by the look of them let them have a slice of the east bank helio sneered the damned spaniards have all but given it away already the lower muskogees choctaws and chickasaws will make short work of them they might be useful though lanxade tossed off as he gathered up his hat and cane from the commode table by the apartments door americans helio and hippolyte scoffed hah many of them war veterans promised land instead of pensions but have neither lanxade drolly pointed out shuffling from one hard patch of ground to the next when the land plays out or the rich and powerful snap it up messieurs mademoiselle such motherless neerdowells will do anything merely for the promise of better and if part of lousiana was promised to them far north of here of course what sort of army would they make to oust the spanish theyre heathen protestants don rubio exclaimed with all the disgust that both his hidalgocatholicspanish father and the french creole catholic bergrands had drummed into him with his mothers milk theyre anglosaxons and they have no spanish much less knowledge of our beautiful french we creoles would be drowned in a flood of heretics helio de guilleri quickly added our glorious language our genteel way of life our people jeanmarie rancour piped up turning even paler theyd sweep us from the face of the world theyre hideous theyre ambitious and powerful in their numbers lanxade interjected draw a border far to the north along the arkansas river let us say the yankees are not at war with france not a real war and are mostly of two minds about the french or creoles without us they would not be free of the british and for that they are thankful still their priests direct their anger at spain and its inquisition mon dieu americans are so english they still despise the spanish for the armada the united states may end up with every last stick of florida east of pensacola but with american settlerveterans fighting to carve out their own little empire in our service in the northern half of louisiana all the way to lake michigan hmm but were so few and those bumpkins breed like rabbits they would swarm us under in a generation lanxade don rubio objected ah but what if an entirely new country louisiana came to be for that do you not think that the directory in paris might not suspend their wasteful war against the british to recover just as much empire as we lost in steal it from the haughty anglais and the grasping united states the chance of such a coup would assure our reunion with france that we all hold dear lanxade dangled before them almost playfully hmm oh well its just a thought adieu messieurs and mademoiselle i will do what i can to sniff out those newly arrived and mysterious anglais for you before balfa and i take the silver down to pay our impatient sailors i will send you a report before we go once more adieu what an odious idea middle brother hippolyte declared with a grimace once lanxade was gone even temporarily associated with those brutish animals pah the americans press us so closely even now though hippolyte the time may be shorter than we think before they march into florida the time we have in which to raise a rebellion charite glumly considered pacing the parlour with a silent graceful gliding motion that her town clothes enforced upon her the artful attainments drilled into her by her parents tutors and dancingmasters if that happens louisiana and our city are doomed cousin jeanmarie brokenly muttered as if contemplating being driven from a second refuge and we think its bad enough under the spanish good for business though said helio the most levelheaded among them the eldest de guilleri who would inherit the bulk of their lands and the resulting responsibilities new orleans is already the most thriving port on the gulf with yankee industriousness shame on you charite stormed so outraged that she stamped a dainty foot on the floor does the struggle to become french again mean so little to you after all weve done after all our hopes and plans saint domingue martinique and guadeloupe are bursting with thousands of good frenchmen who would flee here and join us swedish and danish ships come here to trade as thick as mosquitoes how many stout republican soldiers and settlers could be smuggled here in those neutral ships once paris is aware of our movement we must send another letter many of them each of us writes two claiming to be ah maurepas bistineau bergrands and boisblancs lemoynes and dablemonts the leading citizens urging them to come to our aid on the sly sister cherie helio had to point out the spanish are the only allies the directory has in the world even if they meant to betray the spaniards how would they sneak an army here with the anglais stopping and inspecting every ship they come across if they could though don rubio objected the spanish cant spare troops or ships to fight them and with our schooner and soon even more vessels the decrepit spanish navy could not move soldiers from mexico or cuba as long as that british navy blockades them oui more letters to paris and what if we did hire on a few bands of americans what but i thought you jeanmarie blanched as backwoods troublemakers rubio monaster expounded with an evil snicker to raid spanish posts massacre the soldiers and loot them wed let them keep all they take so we would not have to pay them we begin a campaign of torching spanish properties around the city dressed in buckskins so american visitors get the blame i think yankee patriots dressed as indians when they dumped the teas in boston harbour ha ha id rather try to make a pet of an alligator helio objected you cannot trust them no matter how destitute and dogeyed they look at the moment give a yankee a cubit and hell take an arpent they have no lasting gratitude in their souls look how thankful they were after yorktown and how they turned on the france that saved them not twenty years later and now make war on our commerce did not declare war on the british to help our revolution in did not give grain to keep the suffering french people from starvation but sold it enough cher helio charite demanded pressing fingers to her forehead as if suffering a mal de tete capitaine lanxade is a fool useful in his way but still a fool helio is right we can never rely on the americans they would betray us eventually but until we can urge the directory to come to our aid and quickly we must do something to rouse our sleeping fellow creoles rubio your idea has some merit we must look into that don rubio monaster almost wagged his nonexistent tail at such rare praise from her and lets not forget that we must look into both the american backwoodsmens arrival and those strangers off the panton leslie trader charite announced theyre men after all and men always find themselves a cabaret a grog shop or a bordel after the hard journey is done who knows they might even come right to us in our favourite boites she chuckled if either party looks to be a danger to us then what better could we do than go to sea to take even more prizes while they search for us here nestce pas chere charite i swear if you are not the heart and soul of all we do of all we dream her brother helio exclaimed with heartfelt admiration for her quick and clever thinking yes and sometimes it seems i am the only one with any sense at all charite angelette de guilleri smugly thought as she gave her elder brother a hug for his praise a young woman who would make any fortunate man a most formidable and sensible wife don rubio monaster dared to say colouring at once to blurt out his dearest desire why thank you rubio arent you so sweet charite brightly sugarly replied batting her lashes and acting the guileless creole coquette for a moment a nice boy she deemed him though good puppy sit up beg but so slavish mon dieu oh quel dommage he has his uses too chapter thirteen ah well mr gideon pollock said with a heavy sigh of disappointment once lewrie had related the results of his hours spent shopping and comparing prices i suppose i must delve into things myself sorry mister pollock lewrie replied with a whimsical shrug but i fear my forte aint in commerce without making notes whichd have got me thrown out on my ear i couldnt keep track of it whereas you know to the farthing whats a fair price no scribblin necessary with you dye see its all up here he said as he tapped his forehead um yayss ahem pollock said with a somewhat dubious expression and another of his coughtwitchwhinnies questioning perhaps whether lewrie possessed anything inside his skull at least jugg and i did meet with that ellison fellow him and his reeky gang lewrie pointed out seemed quite the captain sharp to me he admitted he was tied up in that state of franklin affair well that would depend on who are his employers mr pollock grudgingly allowed fretting round the supercargos spacious cabin on the azucena del oeste transferring possessions from his sea chests to a leather valise tuttutting and hahumming to himself as he sorted out clean shirts stockings neckstocks underdrawers and his slim wardrobe of waistcoats and trousers i would expect that ellison most likely is an agent for richer men as he baldly stated to you in what capacity however ahem after he left your ken though mister james hawk ellison came aboard our emporium hulk as i suggested lewrie reminded the man hoping that his days work had borne some fruit that he look at the airrifles and which he and his fellows did pollock said with a crafty grin interrupting his packing long enough to turn and smile at lewrie and they were all most desirous of arms and ammuniton not merely muskets or pistols but heavier ordnance as well hmm mister ellison asked of the availability of brass fourpounders or old regimental guns brass sixpounders or grasshopper guns coehorn mortars and such aha i knew the man wasnt straight lewrie boasted since it looked like he might be the only one to do so over his covert delvings so hes the vanguard of a yankee invasion his service during the revolution which ellison revealed to me as quickly as he did to you pollock smugly said as he carefully folded a pair of white silk stockings does worry me a bit oh that hes involved with some sort of filibustering expedition i have no doubt i fear though that is our mister ellison still a serving officer in the american army he just might have been sent to new orleans by an incredibly aspiring man by name of general james wilkinson lewrie an aspiring man indeed ahem and damn all spies foreign office amateur or otherwise lewrie sourly thought twigg pelham peel this clod theyre all the same smug when they know something you dont and damn near pissin themselves for you t beg em ttell it to you and who is james wilkinson when hes up and dressed he asked finally in almost a rote monotone which lack of enthusiasm stopped pollock dead in his tracks and made him turn twitchwhinny and glare wilkinson is the senior officer in charge of the american army which garrisons the states of tennessee and kentucky lewrie pollock archly cooed which is rather ironic since before kentucky became an established state in the union in wilkinson was scheming to seize the whole damned thing and make it a personal fief he might have done the same for tennessee had he not been opposed by a set of politicians lawyers and planters even richer and more influential than he could ever hope to be general wilkinson came down to new orleans himself in when the former captaingeneral of louisiana recruited him as a secret agent hes known to the dons as agent thirteen bad luck for someone hey wilkinsons well thought of by many in the congress and just may end up the commanding general of the united states army in a new administration hes rumoured to be close to mister thomas jefferson and his faction and jefferson s rumoured to be planning to oppose their current president john adams horrid idea that pollock quibbled looking disgusted with democracys machinations set terms for public office keep bad men in place too long and depose gooduns when our way lets us call a byelection if one of ours proves himself a criminal or a fool theyre an odd people our yankee doodles lewrie snickered the way that fellow ellison just blurted out his whole life story to me in the first ten minutes prosed on worse than a jobless irish poet you think ellison and his crew were sent here to spy out things for wilkinson if he cant have kentucky or tennessee he still hopes to strike out on his own and take louisiana for the united states or himself a very good possibility given his past proclivities lewrie mr pollock sagaciously leered before returning to his packing if ellison reports on how weak the spanish garrisons are wilkinson may invade the muscle shoals yazoo or alabama river country right off the spanish have very little control there acting on jefferson s behest he would raise his political prospects to the top of the heap with such a landgrab and eclipse any of his potential opponents if the americans start a war with spain it wouldnt be much of one lewrie surmised not with reenforcements so distant not as long as were at war with em and the royal navy in the way and the american navy to guard the approaches to the gulf unless we side with spain against the yankees lewrie so we gain concessions in louisiana and florida to buttress the dons then we also tear them away from france s embrace mr pollock dreamily speculated head cocked to one side didnt think o thatun did ye hey ahem my word i cheaper than mounting an expedition from jamaica and another all the way downriver from canada pollock wheezed with merriment at the possibility my firm with an exclusive franchise from the crown in these lands for good service ah pollock took a long moment to savour that outcome then suddenly sobered unless he grumped ellisons been sicced on me to catch me selling arms acting on suspicions inside the cabildo or general wilkinsons way of eliminating a british firm he suspects or is in competition with commerical cronies backing his secret plans either way avoid ellison and his men like the plague lewrie youve bigger fish to fry heh heh youve our mysterious pirates to smoak out lanxade and balfa need running to earth for now those yankees are an idle distraction for my part i shant sell them more than a few trade muskets profitable though such a transaction would be theres too much risk from exposure and a very public trial for spying quickly followed a public garotting pollock warned involuntarily massaging his own neck executions in spanish lands didnt required a gallowsgoing for the high jump doing the tyburn hornpipe the dons preferred sitting one down in a stout chair then slowly strangling the convicted with a garotte one agonising twist of the ropes at a time such qualms on pollocks odd features quite made lewrie feel at his own throat and swallow a few times no sense in arming the competition sir lewrie asked instead quite so lew pardon mister willoughby pollock beamed i might even aspire to report ellison to the dons do they importune me for a large consignment of arms or try to bribe me and all of it well witnessed by my clerks heh heh commerce mister willoughby is not quite so dull an enterprise as youd imagine ahem when spryer and younger and moving packtrains among the cherokee and upper creek indians in the revolution fiercely in competition with americans such as mcgilliveray sons out of charleston well it was a war to the knife and no quarter pollock modestly preened over his past derringdo and skullduggery panton leslie gave as good as it got sure as hell i wont mention desmond to him lewrie considered well i think were ready to go ashore pollock announced whyever are ye not packed mister willoughby ashore lewrie gawped back first ive heard of it oh so sorry pollock gaily said not sounding sorry at all best for your persona do you take shore lodgings in a modest pension or boardinghouse the cost is middlin and the local cuisines most delectable bein french dye see best get cracking willoughby or it will be completely dark before we get you settled i dont have a shoregoing bag lewrie complained springing to his feet no one told me i needed one and no matter pollock objected for im sure we have a suitable valise aboard for which i may gladly offer you a handsome discount seeing as how it will go towards furthering the crowns interests what if i just lease or rent lewrie dubiously wondered oh no thatd never do lewrie pollock quibbled for once we come back aboard itll have been used and i could not in good conscience flog it off on someone else as good as new damn him i knewhed find a way tpry me loose from a guinea or two lewrie thought tradesmen bah well allow your navy lads shore liberty along with the brigs crew as well pollock further blandly announced but i havent warned em yet lewrie quickly rejoined fearing whatall they might blab when in their cups ashore without a stern lecture would some of them run was another instant worry then youd best be at it shouldnt you pollock said tapping a foot in growing impatience and eagerness to savour the citys joys if you do not mind i will take part in that ahem your man jugg should be given a roving brief and a freer hand since he most likely in my cautious estimation has been to new orleans before and knows his way about and knows the names and faces of those we seek from his past ah employments i propose that jugg temporarily report to me not you now til next morning say til eight bells and the start of the forenoon watch for your hands return so they may carouse ashore thatd do i expect lewrie begrudgingly said uh whatll i need ashore how much should i pack then oh no more than a change or two of clothing pollock guessed your current sporting togs and a fresh shirt and stockings will do take those shipboard things you wore on the way upriver the hunting shirt and such as if thats all you own at present a full purse it goes without saying and all your um weapons one cannot tell what sort of footpads one may come across youre so reassuring lewrie said with a faint sneer as he opened the cabin door to go forward to his own small accommodations not one hour later he was ashore and cozily ensconced in one of pollocks open and airy appartements as the frogs termed them in a pension at the corner of bourbon street and rue ste anne his rooms were two storeys above the ground floor up narrow rickety stairs and any felons who wished to scrag him couldnt help making the most hellish racket on their way up to get at him he cautiously reasoned it actually was a promisingly pleasant place a tad spare when it came to elegant furnishings but it was clean and relatively bugfree with bed linens towels and drapes still redolent of boiling water and soap fresh washed the airy part came from three complete sets of glazed doors that served for gigantic windows all of which led out to a wraparound upper balcony fronted with intricate wroughtiron railings and even the stench from the bricked streets with toonarrow sidewalks and no drains or gutters by the kerbs wasnt that bad for all the detritus seemed to end up in the sunken centres of the cobbled streets where lewrie suspected it stayed till the next rainstorm flushed it asea or down the street where another neighbourhood could enjoy it not a true set of rooms really hed gotten one large open highceilinged chamber as a parlour fitted out with a mismatched set of chairs and a settee corner tables end tables a faded carpet and some castoff horrors for framed paintings and such aligned along rue bourbon a wide stubwalled archway at the ste anne end delineated the bedchamber further separated from the parlour by a pair of sham chinee folding screens hed packed in a hurry though taking time enough to place his pair of twinbarreled manton pistols deep in his new valise a pair of pocket pistols in his clothes his hanger on his hip new swordcane in his hand and a wavybladed and razorkeen mindanao krees knife up his left sleeve a remembrance hed picked up off a piratical lanun rover in the far east lewrie had had time too to warn his men about the parts they were to playadventurers signed on as mr pollocks musclesand that they should not get so drunk that their time in the royal navy got blabbed as presentday status poor furfy had the hardest time understanding desmond a private word lewrie had bade the happygolucky irish rogue youve a sensible head on your shoulders though i fear your mate furfys not the quickest wit was ever dropped an that he is sorry tsay sor desmond commiserated a grand feller furfy is a fast friend but nary th sort o man teven sham clever youll look out for him special desmond lewrie charged him furfy is a good sailor aye and id hate to lose him or let him get in trouble if liquor frees his tongue or ties it oill see to it sor swear it desmond soberly vowed though how sober hed be himself within the hour was doubtful let sailors get at drink and theyd be senseless roaring drunk in a turnabout of your head faster than you could say luff i knew i could count on you desmond lewrie had replied not quite relieved but close you might keep the lads together keep an eye and ear cocked to their doins too and not a word about proteus or our mission just enjoy the first day and well probe later ye kin count on me sor desmond had assured him though all but dancing in place from one foot to tother to be away and ashore in search of pleasures and deviltry now lewrie was on his own pollock had quickly steered him to this pension a place hed obviously stayed before for he was on good terms with the proprietor and his wife then had nearly jogtrotted to his own lodgingsa much nicer place pollock smugly and thoughtlessly informed him located in the middle of rue royale twixt ste anne and rue dumaine pollock said that they should breakfast together next morning at eight that lewrie willoughby rather should not spread himself too widely on his own spree among the creoles and should keep a clear head a caution more than one to not go off halfcocked should he encounter lanxade or balfa straightaway merely on their descriptions he just might end up accosting the wrong man do one of them in too publicly even should he slit the throat of the rightun and end up arrested at which juncture thered be nothing pollock or panton leslie company could do for him but deny theyd ever heard of him and wasnt it such a shame for a newminted american whod come aboard their ship to go lunatick and kill somebody the damned rank stranger rest assured mister willoughby mr pollock confided close to him and chummy enough for the passersby to witness smiling wide as anything but his cautions were muttered from the side of his mouth and an unattractive sight that was for mr willoughby in truth so no passersby could actually eavesdrop i shall begin my own probes in the morning subtle casual nought that draws attention he said as if despairing that lewriewilloughby could do the same new orleans can be a delightful port of call pollock said practically dancing like liam desmond to be on his way theres a cabaret not too far off the pigeon coop many locals are regulars there you may casually pick up an earful just dont gamble with em the games are all crook see you in the morning ta and with that lewrie was abandoned on his own he reentered his pension and clumped up the stairs to unpack once there utterly alone he wandered about the confines of his set of rooms intently studied the wallpaper for a few minutes and took a refreshing sundown riverwind turn on his wroughtiron upper balcony oil or candle lanthorns were being lit in front of the many residences even as those outside shops were being extinguished folk were strolling below him softly speaking and chuckling at their ease in a gather pure parisian french or in a mangled local patois that he suspected was acadian there now and then was even a snatch of lispy highborn castilian spanish along with another garbled version spoken by the poorerdressed pollock had told him that the bulk of the spanish in new orleans were humbler peasantraised catalans some portuguese some german smallhold farmers from above new orleans on the cote des allemands even some spanish canary islanders had settled in louisiana undoubtedly very desperate for land or a new beginning or perhaps the spanish authorities were desperate for settlers of any kind dammit im stuck in this dumplewrie groused to himself as he leaned on the railings which gave out an ominous creaking im famished im badly in need o wine and pollock just up and leaves me trot the hideous ahemmin bastard what selfrespectin spyd leave me free tblunder about without a minder or something a bearleader looking back on his previous fumbling attempts at masquerading civilian and innocent lewrie ruefully realised that hed been the sort who needed minding why one could almost imagine that pollock trusted him to acquit himself well on his own aye did one have an optimistic bent and a very creative imagination perhaps it wasnt neglect at all but grudging respect that hed survived those previous missions and had implicit faith that lewrie could be circumspect enough to survive til morning had mr james peel had a private word with mr pollock and buffed up lewries dubious credentials to convince him to take him along or lewrie glumly suspected pollock was simply too eager for a rencontre with his shore wife the captain and first mate on their passage to new orleans had discretely hinted that no matter how prim and upright mr pollock publicly presented himself he was a mere mortal after all and had found himself a luscious bright free black to warm his bed when in new orleans kept her in some style yearround at his permanent lodgings mr caldecott had even winked and alluded that pollock mightve succumbed to blind lust for an octoroon female slave and had bought her for thousands his usual parsimony bedamned damme am i scared tgo out on my own lewrie asked the newlit stars above the streets mine arse on a bandbox if i am after all im better armed than most press gangs a succulent meal even a froggish kickshaw a made dish in savoury but suspect foreign sauces a bottle of wine or three even an idle hour or two at the cabaret both pollock and ellison had named then as benjamin franklin had advised early to bed early to rise hah how much trouble could i get into in that short o time lewrie asked himself as he went back inside for his hat coat and cane chapter fourteen le pigeonnier held another whole new set of scents that wouldve entranced toulon and chalky for a day or more the acrid smell of hot tobacco leaf and the headhigh pall of smoke from it the wet reek of chewing tobacco and ejecta in the metal spitkids along the long bar and spaced conveniently round the clubs stygian interior more hot smells from candles with badly trimmed wicks beeswax cheap tallow or frontier rush dips there was the faint aroma of bad breath and winebreath combined of elegant clothing too long unwashed bodies that suffered from the same benign neglect the slightest tinge from a hastily rejected supper spewed up somewhere in the cabaret and slovenly swabbed at the reek that arose from the back of the club and wafted through the opened rear doors from the outdoor toilets hungary water and cologne mostly sweet and flowery tried to mask human stink but they could only do so much and there was the enticing odour of drink the musksweetness of wine the sweet tang of rum the even more noticeable but mellower scent of aged brandy or corn whisky down from the hinterlands the icepinchy smell of juniper berry gin the yeasty sourness of a variety of beers or ales though it was a long way from english porters stouts and malts and lewrie had never heard a good word said for spanish or french brews here and there in pools of somewhat honest light dice rattled in leather cups and clattered on tabletops in others men even a few bawdily gowned women hunched over cards van john to the english or vingtet un to the frogs was being played some jostled and perspired round a pharoah table or a numbered wheel lewrie supposed was a roulette game he caught a few words here and there enough to inform him that most cardplayers played piquet a popular local game called boure or an american game of incomprehensible nature it sounded like it was called poke her msieur a bartender asked from the other side of a long oak counter ah let me have a whisky lewrie decided having grown more than fond of the american decoction the aged corn whisky not that waterylookin poison hed been warned off that last year lamericain the servitor said with a faint sneer as he got up a stone gallon crock removed the stopper and poured a small glass half full stating its price as twenty pesetas in a tone that accused lewrie of having no palate no class and no business in a real creole establishment even tossing the man a silver british crown made no impression on the publicans hauteur the custom of the house was to elbow up along the counter rest a foot on a wood rail and drink standing up were one sitting then one was mostly gambling lewrie only saw a few seated patrons risking the house cuisine at some tables mostly far in back lewrie could espy people hunched over their glasses and muttering conspiratorily with each other to his mind it looked as if they were conspiring greasy leers rubbed money fingers gallic shrugs and stony glares christ they all look like wellpaid pirates lewrie goggled at some tables though it was men and women draped upon each other in the dim candlelight now that his eyes had adjusted to the gloom lewrie took note of scantily clad young women in morning gowns and sheer dressing robes traipsing up the stairs to the upper storey on the arms of jaunty eager men whilst others clumped downwards almost alone trailed by jaded and spent patrons who barely held hands with them the womens hard eyes already prowling for the next client it took lewrie a long minute or so to unmoor his gaze from the whores it had been rather a long while since hed had a free moment for doing the needful and some of them were more than handsome he all but shook himself from the idea there was work to do he scanned the vast dim rooms expanse recalling his crewmensand mr pollocksdescriptions of lanxade or balfa but after ten minutes he had to admit to himself that those cutthroats werent present he looked the room over again to see if there was a single soul he knew but none of his hands were in the pigeon coop nor could he spot sailors off pollocks ship obviously this cabaret was too hightoned for the common tars he did think he saw one of the azucena del oestes mates trotting up the stairs past the music gallery on a whores arm but he wasnt so sure hed wager on it a fetchin whore he has lewrie decided to himself noting that his glass was empty of a sudden and turning bellyfirst to the bar to whistle up the serving man for a refill in the private screen of his coattails he felt a tightening in his groin a pinching from the fork of his tight trousers crutch as his lubricious nature awakened glass topped up lewrie turned back to face the room just as a nigh nakedly dressed mulatto demimonde came slithering by her arm brushing mens fundaments or thighs all quite by accident he gawped gulped looking at the size and springy rounded shape of her poonts exchanged a brief redfaced smile before a patron down the counter looped an arm round her waist drew her to him and gnawed at her bare neck like a longlost lover off they went up the stairs lubricious nature began to whisper which awoke his old companion amatory fever who began to gibber leer and cajole damme im tryin t spy here lewrie pointed out to his groin it was a forlorn hope though any continued spying on both sides of him it was all elbows and shoulders troops of foreigners in full cry in alien tongues and the local french patois was so nasally hawnhawn and rapid he could barely make out one word in four those mostly harmless and plebeian he was being jostled at the bar just a whisker short of intentional insult for an english gentleman who held a larger personal space than most even the music played by a string trio from the oldstyle gallery irritated him a jiggerypokery of gay but jangly airs when not some mournful dirges halfspanish halfmoorishly minor keyed he thought of crying off and heading home to bed but surely his first night ashore in untold months out of uniform and anonymous in a port town as sinful as old port royal on jamaica how dull itd be to wash out his stockings and underdrawers alone yet the press at the counter got to him he scooped up his change waferthin foreign tin felt to see if he still had his coinpurse then began to wander the main room mon dieu jean hippolyte whispered maliciously where did he get such a tawdry ensemble that fellow there in the wide hat why is he walking so oddly all hunched over helio asked an americain clown jeanmarie rancour dismissed back to what we are discussing we know msieur bistineau cheats us why does he get five percent off the top when ive heard that criminals who deal in stolen goods pay the thieves first to get them lanxade said its his normal cost of doing business jean insisted in a hot mutter both elbows on the table round a wineglass and how do we know we can trust henri maurepas either if he misreports on papa trusts him implicitly jean helio declared not once has he ever doubted him he manages all our affairs papa knows papa knows how to spend cher brother charite impatiently countered he has no real head for the intricacies of business it is beneath true gentlemen of course msieur bistineau is cheating us and there is little we or old henri maurepas can do about it so long as bistineau is the only trader wholl accept our goods dare to have them in his store later on well later on perhaps well confront monsieur bistineau with steel helio as the eldest announced his son claude will inherit isnt claude one of us the one who presented the scheme to his father out of patriotism perhaps we should talk to claude he is the only outlet hippolyte grumbled turning his glass round and round if not the bistineaus i cant think of another of french blood whod be bold enough all the rest who could handle our goods are americans these days anyway he glumly stated mori dieu business business business charite exasperatedly complained we are here to celebrate nestce pas our cause gains cash it advances we have hurt and frightened our spanish masters and we have money to spend like sailors she twinkled to buck them up like buccaneers of the grand old days a votre same she gaily proposed raising her champagne glass charite de guilleri had enjoyed the freedom of movement that a buccaneering costume had given her on their first raiding cruise and even before that shed found it extremely droll to go out at night in the company of her brothers or other sporting young males of her set disguised as a man who could witness the games pleasures and amusing places that men could enjoy whilst proper young ladies were forced to sit at home to hear the curses and uproariously funny and lewd stories and jests that a staid husband would never bring home to a genteelly sheltered wife after a night out with his contemporaries tonight charite wore a silk shirt with a stylish broad cravat a snugly tailored waistcoat over that and a mans widelapeled nipwaisted coat unbuttoned and loose enough to disguise her breasts a pair of fawncoloured trousers snug as a second skin and riding boots covered her legs her long chestnut hair was pinned up high and concealed beneath a taperedcrown tall hat that was forced to ride far back on her forehead as if cocked in a saucy devilmaycare manner and like her brothers or any new orleans gentleman charite bore a small pocket pistol in her coat a pencilthin dagger in a hidden sheath up her left sleeve and a gilthandled swordcane behind her chair to help her disguise along she had fashioned a narrow mustachio from gauze and her own hair clippings attached to her upper lip by paste admittedly it required a lot of fiddling to assure her that it wasnt coming loose and it didnt take well to wine or brandy but the surprise she elicited with it had been amusing should papa or maman any of her respectable family ever learn that she went out without a female chaperone or body slave that she went out after dark and to such low dives as the pigeon coop dressed as a man especially well charite would end up on one of their isolated dreary swamp plantations and it could be a year or longer etre dans la merdeup shits creekbefore they relented nor would it help for them to learn that charite long ago had become tarnished treasure that she had surrendered the particular commodity that fetched a high bride price charite wasnt sure which would shame her family more to be caught in her disguise as a false desexed carouser to have squandered her precious virginity or to be tried and executed by the spaniards as a dangerous revolutionary pirate each though all of it together made life so piquantly exciting down with your tired old conventions and morals was in her mind as revolutionary a slogan as down with tyrants and aristos in the place de bastille it was thrilling to be to act so modern look helio said of a sudden as the tawdrily garbed stranger wandered over to a nearby gaming table your gaudy fellow hippolyte see that scar on his cheek our slave aristotle said the man who leads the bruisers off the panton leslie ship the one he heard them calling capitaine has such a scar he is fairerhaired than that americain that el elisson i think its the same man why is he walking that way charite wondered snickering tootight trousers helio sneered cheap readymade a stiffleg sailor hippolyte tittered ah but which leg mes amis cousin jeanmarie giggled is he a sailor hes one en rut hee hee zut jean helio chid him our sister is present your sister is not here tonight mes freres charite pointed out i am armand comprende she leaned back in her chair one arm slung over its back in studiedly male fashion appraising their potentially worrisome stranger over the rim of her champagne glass with her eyes halflidded mmmm the scar makes him look dashing very intriguing almost handsome she cooed half to herself then she abandoned her male pose to whirl and chirp girlishly at her tablemates we must talk to him one of us get him to drink with us tell him some jokes or something get him drunk and sound him out to see who and what he is see if he is trouble elisson or that capitaine fellow hippolyte quickly objected blanching its best if neither of them know us we must beard him charite insisted in drink he may blab or even wish to befriend us to help him with whatever it is hes come for if capitaine lanxade is wrong and hes seeking pirates we could pretend to help discover them oui charite exclaimed to their appalled expressions we send him on a goose chase down the bayous looking for truly desperate cutthroats la fourche or bayou terre aux boeufs not barataria you see and if hes not a spy we learn it come on one of you have you no spirit must do it oh la how delicious charite thought suddenly which would be sweeter to sham the idle elegant creole gentilhomme and befuddle the mans wits or reveal herself beguile him with her novelty her modernity perhaps even to seduce him then get him to talk unguardedly halfsodden and nigh spent true jacobin patriot girls heroines of the glorious revolution in france had applied their wiles in such a fashion to ferret out aristos and sympathisers could she do no less for their coming liberation she looked back over at him no it wouldnt be such a horrid chore charite decided her lips parting in an expectant smile with a frisson of pleasuretocome swelling inside her he is certainly not unattractive charite felt her nipples harden at the thought felt them swell and pucker against the caressing silk of her shirt the tautness of her waistcoat that made her squirm a bit more on her chair blaming the snugness of her trousers crutchfork for the restless warm feeling that ghosttickled up her innards and clasp her knees together clutch her buttock muscles as if the devil take you all she said with a bold laugh draining her champagne glass and tossing her head in frustration in a madcap finality ill be the one to beard him just you watch this you timid garconnets with what appeared to others as a dashing stroke of her mustachios but was really reassurance that that appliance was still firmly stuck on charite de guilleri sprang to her feet and began stalking her prey chapter fifteen bonjour msieur you are new to le pigeonnier alan lewrie had been trying to make sense of the dealing discarding and redealing of the poke her game yet not get so close that the players might object when that sweet voice stole his attention hey was his bright rejoinder i ask if you are new here msieur you are not a familiar face came the reply from a slim short overelegant fop who put him in mind of cheap dolls sold at fairs a bartholomew baby lewrie beheld a saucy possibly half drunk cockawhoop so palecomplexioned he couldnt have seen sunlight since his christening so leanfaced and pertchinned so young he had no need to shave yet but with an oddly lush mustachio three or four inches shorter than lewrie even with the help of ridingboot heels the idle jackanapes lazily twiddled an empty champagne glass twixt the lean fingers of his right hand with the other challengingly poised akimbo on his hip for a second another whippetthin fellow came to mind horatio nelson his old squadron commander lewries second recollection was sorrier his sodomite half brother gerald or others of that mollys idle and depraved windward passage crew you buy me champagne m sieur the wee fellow asked his blue eyes twinkling his cheeks as dimpled as a randy chambermaids sorry lad lewrie gruffly responded not tgive offence but i dont think were in the same regiment you are new to new orleans i take it the mininkin persisted smiling even wider british or american vous parlez pauvre francais peutetre the poor french perhaps un peu but a little you will need the translator and i am he msieur vairy bon marchepas cher he gaily beguiled that is to say inexpensive the cheap he added with an amused titter nothing personal young fellow but i dont need help with the language and i wont buy you a drink and you aint my sort so do toddle off wont you lewrie rejoined beginning to get irked if you arent a pimp un entremetteur ive no need of you or your services thankee comprendre no thanks try someone else ah yes i can introduce you to a girl msieur the elfin imp brightened attempting to step closer which set lewrie to backing up a matching step or two none of these drabs non you would be interested msieur your name escapes me sorry didnt set it loose lewrie huffed willoughby now do willoughby the cheeky little bastard slowly struggled to say nodding somberly for a moment as if the name was a talismanic spell to be forgotten at ones peril very solid very anglosaxon you are new to new orleans and you wish a girl you are un americain come down the great river on a long lonely and pleasureless travail or you came upriver on a ship a long lonely and pleasuredenying time aussi n estce pas you have heard of the creole ladies and come to the pigeonnier to seek one but alas they never come out to such a place they sit lonely and sad in their rooms m sieur willoughby you have a christian name they wait for you bold traveller i oh bugger this lewrie growled and bugger you too scat shoo i dont like boys comprendez but i am not a boy m sieur the fellow whispered so alluringly and girlishly long lashes batting that lewrie was stalled in his tracks despite whatever revulsion for the backgammoners brigade he felt damme is he or isnt he he wondered he she a specialty of the house oh the devil with it him she it adieu msieur or whatever lewrie all but snarled back exasperated enough to risk open insult and a knife fight bonsoir hasta la vista vaya con dios auf bloody wiedersehen bye such a pity the wee chap said with a disconcertingly fetching pout raising hands to hat and lip adieu and bonsoir to you as well msieur willoughby same tyou as jesus lewrie gawped in astonishment as the hat was lifted high enough to reveal a bounteous beehive of silky chestnut hair as half a broadly grinning upper lip was mockingly exfoliated the sheheitwhatever dimpled prettily and laughed aloud sticking out a taunting tongue as the hat was quickly clapped back on and the false mustachio got restuck shelewrie wasnt exactly certain that she wasnt truly a girl at that momentsashayed away swaying slim hips that swayed the female way leaving him redfaced to be so twitted the butt of a gargantuan joke he shrugged and shook his head to cast off his puzzlement then toddled back to the bar for a very needed refill of drink leaving the publican an extra peseta or three this time once there he tossed off the heeltaps of his last one then craned his vision about the large cabaret to see if someone he knew had deliberately set him up for a wry jape and was now chortling in a dark corner but no not a single familiar face form or distinguising article of clothing could he spot not a single guffaw grin or smile directed at him was she or wasn t he dammit he speculated nursing his insulted feelings on smokysweet and mellow aged corn squeezings was she bait tget me somewhere dark where some hostile bullybucks could knife me all quietlike or just rob me down tme skin he leaned both elbows on the bar hunched over his whisky like the creole dandies catalan peasants and few rawboned yankees did it lewrie would have hauled out his pocket watch to find how late it was would that act not perk up potential pickpockets much like a red flag waved at a bull the pigeon coops clientele certainly seemed to boast more than its fair share of cuttyeyed sharpers one more glass he gloomily determined still stewing over his mocking and hed be off to his hired set of rooms no matter how dour a prospect that was call it an early night and a sharpish clack sounded from his left as a gilthandled cane came down flat on the bar counter to claim space for its owner and to summon the publican i am so sorry msieur willoughby the smoothcheeked fellow chuckled as he insinuated himselfherselfalongside him but it was very amuse amusing to see your face when i accosted you to see your etonnement astonishment over my little jest and which bastard put you up to it lewrie snapped why no one msieur came the reply with a soft intimate laugh i do this to many people to pretend to be a man is the only way a girl could enjoy a cabaret they are such fun but as you see ladies are barred only the putains the whores come here and i do not wish to be taken for one n estce pas i sincerely apologise for causing you any uh embarrassment m sieur willoughby and i do earnestly beg your forgive forgiveness well hmmm lewrie growled turning to face whatever though he still had his doubts dreading an even crueller twitting did he relent hmmm though he thought looking down in the short time since their parting the whatever had untied the broad cravat and let it dangle like a short scarf undone the upper buttons of that laceruffled silk shirt and had freed the top buttons of the satin waistcoat revealing hinting at there were damn few boys in lewries broad experience could sport such a flawless decolletage nor spring free such neatly bounteous breasts not even rolledup stockings could sham those if you buy me champagne msieur willoughby she definitely a she lewrie was now almost completely certain inveigled with her eyes and mouth lazily grinning for knowing exactly where he had been gazing and i will teach you how to play boure a most amusing and very creole card game i am charite charite bonsecours though i disguise myself as armand she told him their gazes now directly bold and all but inseparable she borrowed the surname of another proud and respectable creole family of long standing on the spur of the moment for when i wish to go out and play that sweet expression on her face that tone of voice and her play on words those female long lashes being batted at him and her angelwhores coyness all but made lewrie go eep and snatch at his suddenly reawakened crutch what else do you play he barely had the wit to ask other than boure and jests on johnny newcomes oh there are many other delightful games that i enjoy she sultrily intimated shifting from one foot to the other which slyly shifted a hip to brush against his i promise you will not be disappointed m sieur ah i must know your christian name if we are to be intimates she cooed tis alan alan willoughby he replied coming nigh a cropper over his own masquerade grinning it off with an appraising leer ill allow you the champagne and the cards for now just so long as you dont play me again charite in a gruffer warning tone he added fool me once shame on me fool me twice then look to your life i stand warned cher alain charite throatily chuckled back not daunted in the least let us get a private table in the back a deck of cards and a bottle of champagne and i assure you cher i shall have no reason to fear for my life her false mustachio had sagged completely off one side of her mouth and her eyes and voice were so sweetly soberly candid that he could not help but assent and whistle up the publican for glasses and a bottle she leaned close enough to gently touch her rather cutely formed nose on his near shoulder for a flirtatious second as if sealing a bargain before breaking away to waft towards a dark rear corner of the cabaret to claim a table for two damme this is daft he chid himself as he flung coins on the counter is she a sham ill never live it down if not well it might be the sort of tale ye dine out on for bloody years chapter sixteen law jim hawk ye wont blieve hit georgie insistently whispered reeking of timekilling whisky fried chicken from a street vendor and

blushing as red as ripe vine peppers come nigh tchokin on ma chaw way they wuz apawin an agropin at each other an with another man jim hawk gawped well he is english but thats a surprise a bigun ellison scrubbed his chin thoughtfully speculating on how willoughby s secret proclivity could be used if he turned out to be a british spy he hadnt bought the mans newcome american pose for a second hed come off that panton leslie ship hadnt he and that company and the british government might as well be tight as ticks together sure it wasnt a way tsneak a fellow spy up there sos they could have

an i coulda swore i thought i saw a titty but ellison lowered his chin to his chest and slowly counted to ten as his mentor had told him to back when hed thought to read for the law in salisbury north carolina before blurting out foolishness when in court he pinched the bridge of his nose and heaved a heavy sigh mightnt it o come to ye georgie ellison asked in a slow drawl of seemingly infinite patience that your little fella mightve been a girl dressed up in mens clothin wull georgie began then subsided abashed oh comes th dawn jim hawk ellison sourly thought oh indeed wull ats unnatral too

delight but yew figger this out yell tell me wot hit means wont ye jim hawk be th first tknow georgie ellison promised ellison slunk into a dark shop doorway and wrapped his coat snug against the pastmidnight river and swamp mists thinking that if the sky started raining whisky georgie prater would be the sort to hold a fork and hed mostlike drop that the game was getting even more complicated than hed imagined when hed been appointed to scout new orleans by congressand without general wilkinson finding out about it ellison had been limited in his choice of skilled and smart backwoodsmen and volunteer soldiers to go along with him men unknown to the tennessee or kentucky garrisons who were likely already enmeshed in wilkinsons schemes so beyond a few men of past acquaintance and a surveyor or two borrowed from civilian pursuits he was pretty much stuck with dregswellmuscled wellarmed dregs whod be good in a fight but jim hawk ellison now strongly suspected that this englishman this captain willoughby was on a mission very much like his own to new orleans and louisiana a new american citizen as he claimed or not willoughby couldnt disguise his educated accent for very long no matter how aw shuckins he tried he was a man used to command his sobriquet of captain either naval or military with a volunteer pack of muscle accompanying him who toed the line when he spoke but who was he working for general wilkinson was out of the question hed never trust the british even someone formerly british to be his eyes and ears before he put his own invasion scheme in play there were secret but widely known whispers of a british move against the hapless spanish though ellison doubted an expedition could make it all the way down the mississippi quietly past american settlements on the eastern bank it made more sense to launch it from jamaica overwhelm the few defenders in a few brisk brutal days combat and take new orleans as the main prize without the city louisiana was useless anyway jim hawk had long before realised or willoughby couldve been hired by virginia south carolina or georgia and was here as part of a sectional landgrab there were already secret agents aplenty in the town from those governments he had been warned yet hed come on a spanishflagged britishowned ship in the guise of a bootless adventurer ellison had spent half the night dashing from one oddity to the next from watcher to watcher to hear their reports and was in the backcountry vernacular bout plumb tuckered out even more outre was what happened in the alley behind the maurepas bank as sack after sack of money had been spirited out the door into a couple of farm waggons surrounded by a gang of heavily armed men as piratical a crew of cutthroats as ever he did see and what was that about ellison wondered a bold midnight robbery hed been tempted to whistle up his own lads and try to rob the robbers a sudden flood of money could when delivered to congress be the funds to pay for america s foreordained growth the united states government was mighty skint still paying for the revolution years after their independence had been won with enough money they would not have to wait for a more assertive president in office but at least ellison had sicced one of his better men on the trail of those waggons to see where theyd gone that had been the best he could do since most of his others had been let go for the rest of the night and were mostly drunk as cootie brown by then and there went a shot at a little personal profit too profit beyond the promised reward for his covert service which he doubted if congress could actually pay there was land he craved in the powells valley of east tennessee among good people hed come to know like the mcleans and bowmans good neighbours with a few pretty daughters to choose from did he ever have a chance to put down roots and marry jim hawk ellison drew a quid of tobacco from a pocket and cut a chew off hed prefer his pipe but that was impossible if he didnt wish to betray his vigil damn you willoughby he whispered eying the candles glow enviously whatever youre up to youre costin me sleep even if ye are a godcursed sodomite you can lay down on th job mmm mon amour formidable charite coomuttered draped delightfully light incredibly smooth and babysoft half atop him as lewrie billowed the sheet high above them to float downwards creating a cooling zephyr alain mon coeur she added with a sleepily sated smile as she shifted her lazy embrace charite ma petite biche lewrie answered in kind chuckling deep in his throat recalling endearments he hadnt used since phoebe aretino his mediterranean mistress he was pretty sure he had just called her a little doe and charite was certainly that only four inches above five feet without her boots with slim hips and the weeest little bottom the faintest wisps of pale blond fluff below her knees above her quim and beneath her arms a narrow waist that gently tapered inward above the talcsmooth swell of her hips narrow shoulders and slim arms but with the most heavenly perfect breasts ever he did see or kiss or suckle or lick with darker tan areolae and cunningly puckering square nipples to worship as well with her hair unpinned in the privacy of his rooms a positive flood of chestnut hair spilled down her back to her waist and now lay like a light blanket over both of them they had shared two bottles of champagne whilst shed taught him boure which had surprisingly resembled ecarte with antes tossed out first five cards each dealer announcing trumps but before any play one could discard or fold completely build ones hand with the replacement cards then follow the leaders play in the proper suit or trump with a higher card or overtrump with a higher card of another suit thereby taking tricks the second dealing and the discards she told him were similar to that rubeish yankee doodle derivative that they called poker or poquet not poke her as lewrie had imagined he had heard it two other young creole gentlemen had joined them once lewrie had picked up the game introduced as the darbone brothers the older one as claude the younger as baltasar pardon messieurs lewrie had taken note but you and ah armand bear a striking resemblance most creoles do the elder brother claude had replied with a smirk lightcoloured eyes and chestnut hair many from normandy arrived first in louisiana before the acadians or the spanish and we do marry back and forth nestce pas armand your mustachios slipping again fais attention hed singsonged as if they and she were long familiar with each others company in the pigeon coop this had set lewries sudden possessive teeth all atauntto jealous even before having her hed lost fourty spanish silver dollars at boure and that was at smalltomiddling stakes the lions share to charite or armand at five british shillings to the dollar that was only ten pounds at leastnowhere near gambling deep and a cheap lesson at the price and the darbone brothers had bought two other bottles and once the last bubbly had been poured and drunk charite had bid them a firm nomoregambling goodnight and had requested a gentleman to see her safely home and though the darbones seemed to grumble over that more than a bit they had stood aside as lewrie had seen her out to the street and round the corner towards bourbon street and his pension once in the relative anonymity of the dark streets she had flung herself into his arms admittedly lewrie had taken a callous common moment or two to grope her like a sack of grain to discover if hed been gulled again intensely relieved to reach inside her open shirt and determine that she definitely was a girl and not a lying set of laundry items that there was no wedding tackle artfully tucked away somewhere it was only then that he committed himself to a kiss then they were off to the races barely able to stay clad as they jogtrotted breathlessly to his appartement and dashed upstairs past the scandalised concierge vous comprendez cher alain charite had seriously insisted even as she was slinging coat waistcoat and cravat to the wide and hoptugging to get a boot off this does not mean a commitment of any sort between us completely lewrie had most happily barked back shedding his garments in fervent flurry none offered on my part and damn thoughtful of ye tmention it i say ma cherie take a pew on the settee and ill have those boots off quick as a wink giggling guffawing tugging first from the front then turned away from her with her boot twixt his legs her other foot shoving in the middle of his back or the cleft of his buttocks and then lewrie attended to her trousers her ankles on his shoulders and she laughing and squirming as delighted as an infant tickled midbath a bold hearty laugh not usually heard from genteel young ladies all but one candle snuffed the amber shadows and flickers of light gilding them charite stood and slowly lifted the long hem of her laceruffled shirt performing for him as he sat to wrestle out of his boots and he was struck dumb completely entranced for the girl looked him right in the eyes as she did so her coltish young thighs almost chastely crossed at the same time and her laughter turned much softer and huskier as if it was a dare oh that charite said with a sheepish expression when she unstrapped the sheath of her poignard from her left forearm and tossed it into a far dark corner of the sitting area and oh this un lewrie echoed unbuttoning his cuffs and pushing up his left sleeve to expose his own sheathed krees removing it and tossing it to join hers in the corner completely nude as perfect as a young venus on the halfshell she knelt to help him take off his boots only pretending to struggle with the right one so she could turn about and present her delightful wee derriere then chuckle deep in her chest as lewrie helped out bracing a bare left foot on her mounds and enticing venus dimples and wriggling his toes finally barefooted he stood to peel his shirt upwards and off but she knelt again and unpinned her hair to let it fall like a glossy silk avalanche spilling down her back and over her breasts she shook her mane to free it all then swept it forward like a stage curtain as she scooted forward on her knees to press her face into his groin and lewrie gave out a groan of instant pleasure as soft sweet lips were put to his straining member as dainty little fingers gently took his measure and tickled featherysoft down the shaft he tossed his shirt away and lowered his hands to her shoulders as charite made yummygood appreciative moaning sounds and whispered oh la grosse verge cher alain si grande et dure si ardente pour moi big hard eager for her bloody right he exclaimed as he flung back his head and shut his eyes lost to her tantalising ministrations he felt like he sported a marlingspike a belaying pin and if he didnt top her that very instant his heads would explodeboth of them and where did a girl that fine learn that lewrie wondered in a brief moment of concern one that quickly passed was she so experienced so widely ploughed that hed need to dig into his valise for a sheepskin cundum before he did burst like a pounder he drew her up and away from his groin got her to her feet swept that concealing hair behind her shoulders and embraced her savouring how smooth soft and wee she was as she eagerly pressed against him lifting her arms about his neck and silently urging him to lift her off her straining toes she was not quite as light as the elfin phoebe aretino that he remembered but he had no trouble hefting her up her face level with his to support her bottom with his hands and slowly walk towards the bedstead as she rained kisses on him now making faint kitteny whimpering sounds he sat her on the high edge of the bedstead her legs scissored about his waist and began to reward her kiss for hot wet kiss slowly roaming to her eyes her ears down each side of her neck then to her breasts charite leaned back on the palms of her hands luring him to a matching lean forward her head thrown back and her mane beginning to whip and toss with each pleasured roll of her head her hips starting a slow metronomic sweep from left to right and back again supporting herself on her hands and the strength of her legs beginning to thrust and recede even squirming impatiently to snare his prick and lure it in and lewrie squirmed as well to lower his member now stoutly upjutting as a jib boom to meet her quim and cock met at last darker wrinkly nether lips gently parted as the head slid so easily into her one heavenly inch as if dipped into a brazierwarmed pot of honey oooh alain she whimpered freezing in place mon dieu le preservatif langlais please the protection arrr he goodnaturedly groaned a single second of madness away from spearing her to the root but he turned away and went to his valise spare shirt and hunting shirt went flying as did rolled stockings a clean pressed neckstock and spare underdrawers flung upwards without a care to where they landed as if he was a highwayman rifling a coach passengers bags for hidden jewels he heard her softly tinkling laughter and turned shed rolled over on her stomach and was peeking between the bedstead curtains in full amusement chin resting on her forearms crossed atop the massive mahogany footboard lewrie shrugged and grinned back at her at last found his cundum packet and unbound the tied ribbons to lift the flap and pull out a whole handful showing them to her before returning to the side of the bed by then charite had rolled back to the bedside quickly eagerly posing herself her hands grasped the upper canopy railing and half standing on the short assisting ladder with one dainty foot and with her other slim leg resting on the mattress thighs far apart she pretended to swing slightly almost childlike as she watched in wideeyed wonder to see him sheath himself and bind a cundum on once done her welcoming warming growing smile was all the invitation he needed he embraced her about her thighs pressing his face against the softfleshed and fragrant warmth of her firm flat stomach kissing up to her breasts again to restore his slightly cooled ardour squeezing gently at her bottom kissing slowly downwards over her belly that was almost shuddering quivering under his lips and the tip of his tongue sliding over and sitting down where shed been when he left her charite leaned back on her hands again parted her sweet thighs lifted her knees and resumed the leftright squirming of her hips and the upward forward hungry thrusting of her groin as steady and gentle as waves breaking at a slack tide mon dieu please maintenant now cher i cant take any more charite huskily begged clawing him upwards sliding her body to the very edge of the high bedside then embracing him in a death grip as frantic as someone about to drown lewrie rose stepped up dragged her to him with one hand at the base of her spine and guided himself back to the pleasure seat succulently hot nether lips slick and engorged that first inch into paradise swiftly even more easily regained both of his hands seizing her hips and another short half step to the bedside gliding in gliding upward half his manhood all at one steady gentle thrust an inch more then one more drawing back and hearing her sob in shuddering want then all of him ramming himself home eliciting a startled shout as he felt his cap bumping against the seabed of her depths sunk to the root and she clung to him desperately legs clasped high around him ankles crossed on the back of his hips and demanding quickening his pace head and long glossy hair tossing and turning she whined and groaned whimpered and laid her head on his shoulder for a little time softly bawling like a newborn calf a trickle of saliva from her gasping panting mouth on his skin je vais jouir charite cried at last i am going aahhh a baby shriek a broken quiveringwhimpering sudden sinking away arms and thighs turning flaccid and limp though her quim pulsed squeezed and suctioned like a chinee fingerpuzzle as if to draw all of him in and keep him secreted forever and for a few floating moments of absolute ecstacy nothing else in the universe existed for him but their groins his shaft her gulf even the sounds she made the endearments she grunted receded and all he could hear cared to hear was the hot sweet liquid sound of sex before his own moment arrived a long inarticulate deepvoiced lions roar and he burst so deep into her losing all cognizance a siegemortars shell exploding trails of violent smoke spreading outward outward behind the redglowing jutting embers of his passion and his arriving restored her strength for a few minutes to clamp damply sweet thighs and arms about him forcesqueeze her belly muscles to match the last upward jerkings he used to tease her fiercely clinging kissing and stroking in pleased reward she fell back onto the soft yielding feather mattress finally one arm over her eyes to get her breath back legs wide apart as if to wish him gone from her but charite needily moaned in limp protest when he finally shrank away and withdrew he stripped off his used cundum and clambered up into bed with her scooped her to him and pressed his length along hers gently nestling her close and both of them all but purring in delight fantastic he whispered into her ear drawing forth her happy chuckles and fondly closer pressing her head on his chest charite darlin you are simply marvelous so sweet so handsome i please you she asked almost hesitantly her head averted as if fearing he hadnt been two steps past saint peters gate into heaven itself lewrie truthfully avowed youre a little peek of paradise cherie you do not ask if you charite said sounding small and meek as she turned her head from one cheek to the other to peer up at him sort of got the ah impression that i did lewrie teasingly muttered back giving her a warm squeeze a cozy jounce she slowblinked her eyes and nodded her recumbent head then the most beatific smile slowly blossomed on her face a longtime committed lovers expression that told him all she slid up his body til they were face to face draping herself on him one stickydamp thigh slyly insinuated between his as she said oui tres bon aussi you did you will encore or should i go now and let you sleep sweet little dearun lewrie protested holding her tighter cundums in london came by the dozen one down eleven to go hah she cried in bawdy delight laughing with joy you are that formidable then as our backcountry cadiens say laisser les bons temps rouler chapter seventeen and the bons temps did far into the night charite entranced him amazed him with her eagerness even stunned him a few times with her expertise one moment she was as sweet loving and fond as a blushing new bride purring like a cat with halfslit sleepy eyes the next moment she could be as fierce in her ardour at kissing and foreplay as a milkmaid a jill tearing at her jack with only five minutes to spare in the dairy barns loft and she was so skilled at other times almost suspiciously so she chuckled so pleased with herself like the costliest courtesans who had experienced it all yet still beguiled with believable eagerness shed start half the fun shyly bridelike one time then as demanding as a boa constrictor the next she could slink across the room to fetch something wine or a washcloth and taunt him with her nudity certain of her comeliness and its effect on him shed hike a leg over a chairback twine about a bedpost and bare everything as bawdy as the cheapest jade ready to take six pence for a kneetrembler in a dockyard alley and she must have seen a good collection of risible artworks somewhere good as any his father sir hugo ever had squirrelled away for some of the poses she struck looked damnably familiar to him lewrie reacted of course just as he had in his wideeyed pubescent days to the detriment of their upstairs maids and serving wenches then there were good oldfashioned christian fucks with him on top plunging away like billyo followed by turnabout with charite riding st george atop him like a jockey whipping into the last corner at the newmarket race course followed by a return to the side of the bed ankles crossed behind his neck and squealing like a shoat followed perhaps finished off by another turnabout bent over facedown and her legs thrashing and dangling before him and her nails clawing at his hips her teeth gnashing on the bed linens oh la alain mon cher amour charite said with a sleepy sigh spooned with him in the light of a fresh candle watching his face in the conveniently placed cheval mirror i am so glad you come to new orleans to le pigeonnier tonight of all nights what does bring you to my city a dowdy brig with a weedy bottom he lazily quipped nothin at all like yours sweetlin uhmmm he purred taking some more fondling strokes of the temptingly yielding aforesaid no do not tease she prettily pouted making a moue at him you are british i think so many things you say that i do not hear americans say is it not dangerous for you with britain and spain at war used t be british love lewrie told her dredging up his new biography just in case he was too sated drinkmuzzled and jaded to make a mistake even with an intriguing girl with nothing to do with piracy used t be but they sort of got tired of me so off i went and turned american new start you were a criminal fleeing british law charite posed with a fearful fretful sound of sudden concern tossing herself over to face him abruptly no im not outlaw dearun lewrie assured her with a grin ive already faced my court and been sent away a courtmartial in london i was in the royal navy once lieutenant willoughby if you can feature it commission sea officer god crown and country oh la what happened she all but wailed in commiseration he fed her the whole fiction chapter and verse that peel had penned for him that hed rehearsed with pollock before coming ashore drink made it come out slurred slow and believable weariness after all their sporting made it sound plausible even to his own ears with just the right touch of tiredness with his own life even bitterness damme i couldve become a drury lane actor he cynically cajoled himself as she seemed to eat it up like plum duff especially the part about india and the far east the great south seas how grand charite marvelled what fun to see elephants or tigers rajahs or even real pirates she was as excited as a tot on christmas day pounding pillows so she could sit up on the headboard and listen raptly you must tell me everything of your adventures the next evening we are together that is she shied going missish and meek uh if you wish to oh aye lewrie swore no doubt o that sweetun suddenly engorged with desire to have her again night after night of heavenly bawdy bliss truthfully i cannot get enough of you she rewarded that ardour with a soulkiss snuggling him down alongside her after a long purring moment she asked you had to come back when the war began from the far east aye but late too late for a shipboard commission lewrie said spinning his lie again he departed from the script creating a chapter on the fly from his own experiences i finally got aboard a perfect scow of a third rate ship of the line as fourth lieutenant fourth out of five d ye see went to the mediterranean worked out of gibraltar thats a place t see too ma cherie we took part in the toulon expedition in the time of the first coalition when the damned spanish were our allies i rose to third officer but we sailed home for repairs and she ended up dropping her bottom in porsmouth harbour too long laid up in ordinary weeded wormed and dryrotted so they had to scrap her that was it was i thought id board another ship but things didnt work out the way i wished he sketched a miserly three months ashore on halfpay between assignments before being forced to beg for employment the best and soonest opening being in the impress service ashore midshipmen making lieutenant if they turned up two hundred recruits by christmas intercepting merchantmen in soundings and pressing most of the crew leaving just enough to work her into port splitting the seamens pay with the ships masters to boot brothel tavern raids in connivance with publicans and mother abbesses of inflating perdiem pay and the rum and ale bought to gull volunteers lodging costs and pocketing the difference the bribes from weeping parents wives and employers to spring a sweptup man and you profited from all that charite asked him hesitantly though his tale had lit her merry blue eyes with delight had to lewrie gruffly seemed to admit cause i needed the money so perishin bad he cynically barked for that was his fathers excuse for disowning him and shipping him off to sea life ashore costs more than sea duty and every officer but the titled wealthy are forever in debt and even a goodly share o them everyone else was working a fiddle on the kings money but me they caught i never seem t be able to prosper or hold my luck for long d ye see love how terrible for you for your family quel dommage she actually sounded affected by his fraud the candles glint revealed a hint of moisture in her eyes to lewries chagrin no family to shame really lewrie lied i was a third son and we were never that close poor alain she groaned hugging him close to her and was there ever a young lady whose heart was broken to see you shamed were you ever affianced or she meekly asked in a wee voice her head nigh buried in the crook of his shoulder what the money was for lewrie told her forcing a credible hitch into his voice i was wed daft thing for a mere lieutenant t do our navy thinks married lieutenants are useless lost to the service with their minds halfashore but she died he blushed tomatored covered his chagrin by busying himself at his wineglass that was a lie most damnable to say as if a word was parent to the wish as if hed called fickle fate to heed him and harm caroline mon dieu no pauvre pauvre poor dear man she said in a shuddery tone quivering against him sweetest kindest not a rich match no but caroline was my landlords daughter when i lodged in portsmouth he grunted damn damn damn he chid himself whyd i give her real name this wont do its gettin too personal shouldve said no never wed should ve said cheapside stead o portsmouth where really was with the press christ lets hope she wasnt listenin all that close or geographys not her strong suit else ill never put a leg over again and god help me i want to how did it charite asked and he could feel moisture on his shoulder she was really weeping for him he felt like such a cad but in for the penny in for the pound it was too late to recant she got sick soon after we wed lewrie continued his voice most believably husky with many a pause to marshall fresh stages in a tale of woe all the coal smoke she began to suffer a wracking cough sometimes spotted her handkerchief we tried an apothecary at first then a naval surgeon i knew he sent us to a proper physician who sent us to a london physician and it all cost so bloody bloody much and nigh onto an hundred pounds yet she still went weaker and paler wasting away and carrying our first child as charite flung herself on him trembling fingers pressed on his mouth she kissed him with a fierce lifegiving hunger for almost a whole minute then sank her head into the small of his neck sobbing you misrable fraud bastard lewrie scathed himself glad that she could not see his face he wanted her yet wasnt sure he could look her in the eyes not after this his wife caroline had sickened once when hed been so far away in the mediterranean and it had been a nearrun thing that shed lived and recalling that and his being so estranged from her sweetness now his own eyes grew moist but the shudders that took him that could have been mistaken for response to his old grief for a dead wife were the result of sour amusement at himself mostly for being such a charlatan for being such a good liar you stole to save her oh alain that is so noble she said at last rising on one elbow and swiping her tears you were almost admirable didnt help though lewrie said flinging an arm over his eyes as a mask i was courtmartialed and flung out signed aboard a yankee ship in falmouth as a mate and got by but the captain an idiot wrecked her off the cape fear ran her on a shoal they call the lump twixt old and new inlets into wilmington i decided to be an american new world new life and damned if aboard my next ship as second mate a british frigate didnt stop us and nearly press me cause they said my certificate was fraudulent hah so you come on a yankee ship to new orleans she asked and he fretfully caught what sounded hellishlike connivance gentle beguiling probing in her tone this made him forget his false tales and perk up and take notice no he answered wondering why she sounded so curious about his means of transport i came on the azucena del oeste shes the panton leslie company brig britishowned but spanishflagged if you can feature it they hired me on at charleston after i cooled my heels there a few weeks looking for another ship where i washed up when wilmington had nothing to offer he quickly stuck in about to confuse himself as a new american i can go inland up the mississippi to the yankee settlements they talked up the opportunity and this part of the world like it was the promised land get in on the beginning they swore a little outside my normal line o work but for command of river boats now and then but it sounded damn promising and he paused allowed himself some bashfulness as if coaxing a shy miss to bed back on his stride once more indians to see hundreds of miles of unspoiled wilderness i spose i like the idea of a a fresh new adventure and nothing the same twice a share of the profits for my share of the risk and do i find a parcel of land that suits well start my own freehold that is what you do for panton leslie alain filled in as a ships mate on the way here head up guards for their packtrains lewrie speculated as if he meant it hoist my own broad pendant someday commodore of the canoes or barges if their river trade from new orleans gets that big so you would come back often to new orleans mon cher charite teasingly asked her blue eyes merry and beguiling once more she leaned against him stroking him with a sleek soft thigh breasts pressed against the side of his chest and lewrie was delighted that her nearside nipple was beginning to stiffen now would you find that so extremely pleasurable he teased right back immensely relieved that they seemed done with his bogus curriculum vitae and were back to intimate trifles he stroked her bare hip purring to her his voice deep and inveigling alain charite posed frowning in thought and coyly biting on her delectable lower lip for a second or two new orleans is going to be a tres important seaport no matter how far from the ocean the american trade up the great river what our planters grow not only the cane for sugar molasses and rum but now the rice and cotton and both so much closer to get than from india or china nestce pas if our businessmen need to send goods out where they can make profit other than in spanish ports she sneered we will need ships of our own else the yankees or spaniards rob us blind the uh the carrying charges aye lewrie said with a nod and a sip of his wine the freight so upriver up and down all the bayous there are so many rich men charite slyly enthused cuddling up to him so she could look him directly in the eyes men who would pay to have ships of their own to carry their goods to bring in the fine things they desire even from china or india they would form the ah syndicates oui to create a fleet of their own ships and those rich men would pay a capitaine extremely well to manage the nautical details that they do not know n estce pas mon amour ami what d ye mean theyd hire me on lewrie laughed picturing that fantasy so i could be an underpaid mate again non alain a capitaine of your own ship charite cajoled the sort of ship our rich men would pay you to design and have built then command with a share in the profits perhaps and later after the profits grow very huge you command all the ships one of the syndicate directeurs a seat on the board of a firm as important and rich as your old british east india company peutetre a seat on the board of a bank a planter with hundreds of arpents of land with the town house and the country mansion aussi hundreds of slaves to work your lands and make you even richer to serve at your every beck and call and im t mount you every time you feel an itch hey he thought in amusement though damme it does sound tempting lewrie shammed a faroff speculating expression one eyebrow cocked was charite posing a legitimate proposition or was it merely a girlish daydream she could not be much older than nineteen or twenty in his estimation not that long away from dry tutors and even drier chaperoning nuns raised as bleakly as most catholic girls were though she had galloped a good distance from whatever tutors and nuns had driven into her lewrie cynically thought and dammit she was absolutely lovely from her speech and mannersminus her odd penchants for drinking cardplaying mens clothing and fucking notwithstandingcharite obviously came from good family and ran in rich though sporting circles so why aint she married off and cloistered already he worried thats the way they do it in popery aint it get em engaged soon as theyre fourteen wed em off at seventeen damme why hasnt some beaunasty put in a bid or does she scare most of em off black sheep blotted her copy book has she now thatd be ah thatd show the bloody royal navy alan decided to tell her just to see where it would lead for if someone in new orleans wanted his own ship they came much cheaper if pirated and even an innocent interest in a ship of his own might smoak out a seller whod been involved in stealing ships and charite would be the one who might steer him to that seller that supposed syndicate that backed the piracy and her all unwitting and in the meantime shed be his temporary ride even if nothing came from it oh what fun lewrie lewdly chortled to himself captain alan willoughby of the willoughby navigation company i rather like the sound of that he exclaimed charite broke out in giggles gave him a congratulatory embrace then sat back and took away his wineglass to set on the nightstand on her side of the bed lewrie snuggled down in bed expecting a hug she spun about and leaped atop him pinning him to the mattress and his hands to the pillows shifting demandingly astride of him you have the six preservatifs remaining mon cur charite cooasked writhing against his groin her face and eyes alight with greed ooh tres bien laisser les bons temps roulerlewrie hooted in return chapter eighteen mr pollock appeared to be in fine fettle when lewrie trundled into the eatery he had specified for breakfast brighteyed and bushytailed as some might put it in point of fact and bubbling over with bonhomie as he untucked his napkin from under his chin and courteously rose to greet him ah good morning to you mister willoughby i trust you slept well the set of rooms i suggested proved pleasing pollock gushed barely a wink lewrie replied as he dragged back a chair and sat down at the table smirking despite his seeming complaint oh so sorry mr pollock said frowning in concern as he sat down himself twas a quiet place when i lodged there nothing too disturbing or dangerous i trust the company i kept actually lewrie said with a worldly leer ahem pollock shied primly nighappalled this will not descend to common talk will it mister willoughby a gentleman never tells after all ah ahem what what a fine hymnsinger he is lewrie wolfishly thought after what my lady concierge told me about him and his shore wife kept her there beforehand a lovely near white octoroon she said put me to spyin my man youl never know what discover i didnt intend to give you chapter and verse no lewrie said to soothe pollock most pculiar though i wandered into the pigeon coop cabaret you mentioned and there was this most adorable wee fellow hey what pollock nearly screeched blanching ahem she was a girl mister pollock playacting in mens togs lewrie quickly assured him made sure o that a full inspection keel to truck she said she was from a proper creole family here in town out for a stolen night of gambling and fun whilst her folks are in the country wellspoken and mannered obviously educ well i rather doubt that mister willoughby pollock drawled back once hed gotten over his utter shock and no longer looked like hed dive out the window shutters in disgust now he was condescending and simpering with superior local lore proper young creole ladies never indulge in such in such low haunts sons however are expected to are even encouraged to sloth indolence and vice daughters gooduns might as well be raised to be nuns no no sir i suspect you were spun a merry tale by a cunning bawd who earns a high socket fee ahem for her ah novelty pollock tuttutted blushing didnt ask for tuppence lewrie rejoined quickly boasting a bit well a brace of champagnes and she did take me for ten pounds at boure before we left the cabaret intriguin game that but never a word about being for hire oddest most intriguing girl too pollock winced as if lewrie would descend to billingsgate smut to describe his evening but was saved by the waiters arrival a cup and saucer was placed before lewrie without asking and a stout coffee was poured the omelettes are quite good here pollock said instead french style pissrunny and underdone lewrie scoffed a catalan spaniard owns the place so theyre properly done pollock advised quite succulent with their ham or bacon to which suggestion lewrie took heed and placed a hearty fouregg order his coffee was stout and strong the best ever passed his lips but with an odd bitter aftertaste a tang that put lewrie in mind of the inkblack council brew the muskogee indians inaptly termed white drink that caused copious perspiring pissing and purifying puking south american or mexican coffee beans hereabouts pollock explained though i do prefer the turk or arabica the climate and soil in louisiana is much too damp for coffee and sometimes subject to frost with the war on the locals eke out their imports with the local equivalent chicory tasty once you develop a palate to it with sugar and cream lots of cream id advise which makes what the french call a cafe au lait hmmm better lewrie agreed after a liberal admixture and a second taste a smallish platter of little crescentshaped sugared rolls sat between them on which pollock had been snacking before his own breakfast arrived and lewrie tasted one or two or three a french breakfast hed found in his mediterranean travels always did lean towards a lot of breads towards the end the girl seemed quite taken with me lewrie continued his tale in a confidential voice indeed mr pollock frostily commented ahem she mentioned the possibility that exlieutenant willoughby rn might make his fortune as captain of a new orleansowned merchant ship maybe even end up master of an entire fleet of merchantmen did i play my cards right all sorts of hints that their new crops of rice and cotton are the coming thing and that she was on good terms of some sort with a fair number of the rich and powerful whod fund the ships id design or go survey and buy for em damme but these whatevers are good she did did she pollock mused aloud perking up and giving at least one ear to lewries tale well well oh but that might have been but weehours pillow talk he piffled a moment later as he tore one of those little rolls in two stared at both bites as if unable to decide which to swallow first and mulled all that over not the sort of offer one hears from a common trull dont ye know lewrie pointed out usually the wellpleased strumpets hint at going under the protection of the lout is he a gentleman of any means or making him her bullybuck and pimp for a cut of the profits t keep her safe on the streets lurk near her rooms indeed pollock icily glared at him well or so ive heard lewrie replied shiftyeyed making a throatclearing ahem of his own before furthering his point the way she suggested it her understanding of syndicates and such and her air of actual gentility was what convinced me that it might be dressed in mens attire i blieve you said she was pollock interrupted aye and with a false mustachio pasted on her upper lip too lewrie sulkily insisted well surely ahem pollock brightened bestowing upon his breakfast partner an almost pitiable look a girl out on the town who dresses so perhaps wellraised once as you described i grant you might delight in spinning phantasms about herself about what she could do for you telling you everything or anything she thought you wished to hear once shed sounded you out either for your monetary support and uh protection later on or scalping you for ten pounds or fourty spanish dollars was her nights earnings anything she dreamt up afterward was moonbeams and you her ah pleasurable but unwitting baalamb lew willoughby well now really lewrie objected though not too strongly there was a sordid possibility that hed been gulled god knows it wouldnt have been the first time he crossed his arms and grumped and was this after you fed her your ah alias aye lewrie replied tightlipped and did she supply one of her own pollock asked nigh leering charite bonsecours she said she was lewrie told him and in the course of our card game she introduced me to a pair of brothers by name of darbone who sat in with us oh sir pollock commiserated with a worldweary shake of his head she was their handmaiden mostlike an attractive lure to get you bedazzled off your guard and skinned by a pair of sharps they barely won five silver dollars each off me ten at most lewrie countered and they each bought a fresh bottle of champagne to keep the game going cause well i got the impression as we were intent on leaving for my rooms that they seemed more jealous than disappointed and sir if she was their mantrap why wasnt she in a revealing gauzy gown with her poonts hangin out why suited booted and damnnear spurred i know of the darbones though i cannot recall mr pollock deeply frowned almost chewed on a thumbnail i know most of the established creole families if just in passing what were their names one was baltasar tother ah claude lewrie dredged up at last they were all fairhaired chestnutey id say and blue eyed in fact they all three bore a striking resemblance to each other oh half the creoles in louisiana fit that description mr pollock poohpoohed they all marry their distinguished cousins so one of the darbone brothers said about the resemblance nothing about the crosseyed cousins part lewrie replied she was a very fetching girl most hmmm pity you were not intrigued enough to follow her home and get to the bottom of the matter pollock grumpily commented by cockcrow twas all i could do to hand her down the stairs to the door lewrie countered with a smug look had an old captain said whenever he made a grand night of it ashore by the time hed come back aboard he hadnt had a wink and one more passionate kiss or a cold breakfast wouldve killed him and one had hopes you wouldnt boast ahem pollock despaired with a heavy sigh still charite bonsecours didje say hmmm how old under twenty or about twenty ahha i cant say that i am able to place her though french creole families dont trot their females out in the main not quite as bad as hindoo purdah but well perhaps your wife being a local lady might know em lewrie offhandedly suggested slyly watching pollocks reaction my wife pollock instantly bristled how did you my concierge your former landlady told me she took the young lady you boarded with as your epouse lewrie said intrigued and wondering what it was hed said to nettle the man yes well ahem pollock said strangling purpling and tugging at his neckstock my wife of course once weve eat shouldnt we call on her to ask what she knows about the bonsecours and the darbones lewrie coyly hinted his mien as seemingly guileless as the densest most uninterested cully i doubt theres need of that mister willoughby he snipped back as if scandalised by the suggestion colette is ah ahem indisposed she that ugly lewrie maliciously thought is he ashamed about her cause she s not lilywhite or hes propermarried somewhere i just have t clap eyes on her fore we leave new orleans wouldnt it be worth it to run this charite bonsecours to her lodgings then lewrie suggested to see if she knows what she was boasting about if i posed ready to bolt your employment and enter theirs it might lead to the ones who back our pirates i might even get hired to be a pirate captain myself i spose we could pollock somberly mused it might not cause too much harm could you dissemble well enough ah breakfast he cried instead glad for the interruption middling large platters were slid before them holding omelettes as big as roof shingles oozing cheese and done to a perfect firm turn laced with bits of red onion and bell pepper each platter bore slabs of ham as largeabout as ox hooves half an inch thick a woven straw basket of pipinghot croissants arrived too a fistsized ball of soft and sweating fresh salted butter and an array of local preserves tasty pollock enthused over each ravishing bite and all for a song dont ye know youll not find this in an english fourpenny ordinary which is the equivalent cost here ive come to love new orleans though not its summer climate or its current owners he muttered from the side of his mouth i expect itd be much cleaner were someone other than the dons in charge lewrie said snickering put in gutters or something shovel up the horse dung hire indigents to sweep the garbage into the river at least town drains gurgle gurgle gurgle well not talk of that pollock warned in a faint whisper dung and garbage lewrie twinklingly quipped why not the ah change of ownership ahem pollock hissed leaning closer in the act of reaching for the salt cellar oh an only slightly chastened lewrie replied as for our other matter sir pollock continued to mutter both lanxade and balfa have been seen in new orleans within the past two days done up in new finery balfa in shoes and stockings for a rare once and shop ping like an unexpected heir you ride well do you mister willoughby pollock suddenly queried putting lewrie off his stride with the question hmm aye mainwell in point of fact lewrie answered at a loss we plan to gallop out to their secret rondy and scrag em in broad daylight their present whereabouts are unknown to me their exact location pollock said shying back again by lewries aggressive air i merely suggest that we go for a long ride today youre new here i as your putative employer must show you the sights orient you to the city pollock explained buttering a roll it may be that whilst gadding about we either spot them and their lair or make discrete enquiries of them do that part im known and ah harmless ha in the course of things we could also survey lake pontchartrain what the lay of the land looks like to you well i wasn t going to draw sword yell yoicks tally ho and charge at the first sight of em lewrie told himself i ain t a total fool a passinfair fool at times but are we not successful today we could ride tomorrow as well does the weather turn off fair pollock suggested louder this time as if nattering with a new employee for real playing the genial host to a brandnew city out east theres still land going begging if you can believe it well take a good look at it shall we we find lanxade and balfa though we whistle up my sailors for a hoarding action and leave em bleedin on the cobbles like steers in a wapping slaughterhouse lewrie grimly decided to himself steeling himself to action aye lets be at it and that other nonsense chapter nineteen shameless helio de guilleri spat still seething after what shed done had been seething since she and that lout a common sailor a despicable englishman had left the pigeon coop hours before do quit stomping about cher charite lazily scolded covering another weary yawn or madame dablemont below us will be angry and send the concierge after you i told both of you that someone had to sound him out to see if he was dangerous to us and i did she concluded with a wellhidden secretly pleased grin oh please helio snapped angry enough to want to seize her and deliver a good shaking you debased yourself charite paused over her light breakfast of melon strawberries and rolls fixing him with an imperious glare one elegant brow cocked in vexation if my good name and our familys worries you so much mon frere why is it only now that you deplore my nighttime prowlings when you were more than aware of my nature before nom dun chien charite helio barked the man is a lowly a common anglosaxon an anglais a protestant anglais ah charite responded as if her brother had announced a revelation so i am only to play with dashing and proper creoles of good family cher is that what you demand i am always the soul of caution and discretion and so i was with him besides he believes i am a bonsecour so no gossip will touch the de guilleris she switched from a frostily arch coo of annoyance to a twinkly merriment the next moment i had the courage and skill and the allure of my sex to beard him when you never could and i think him harmless to us alain weelooby she said butchering the name was a british navy officer but he was courtmartialed and found guilty of theft in their impress service now a mere hired hand with panton leslie he is a widower an embittered lifelong failure just scraping by though he dreams of making a fortune at last in the americas she told them outlining all she had learned from him in the wee hours it was almost hilarious to her to see the stricken looks on her brothers faces as she laid out his bleak biography he will go north on the river leading his companys shalopes or help guard their packtrains charite blithely informed them he has read all about the noble savages the indians and is panting to see them the usual printed lies and monsieur rousseaus idiocy she sneered between sips of cafe au lait so he says younger brother hippolyte objected a skeptical frown on his face but what is an anglais navy officer doing here just months after we took one of their prize ships it doesnt sound like coincidence to me panton leslie is said to have ties to the british government even if the spanish let them come and go as they please everyone knows that they might have sent a clever spy cher hippolyte charite replied with barely patient scorn in her voice what sort of man steals from his own navy is that their idea of a trustworthy spy a thief stupid enough to be caught out would they even trust such a man with expense money for his espionage lest he drink it up or abscond with it if the british do send a spy to new orleans i think they would choose someone more upstanding i believe him she stated dismissing their qualms his arrival is coincidence and he is harmless and malleable she chuckled charite nibbled on a melon slice whilst her male relations sulkily dithered men she had found were hopelessly easy to manipulate her new alain might be even easier than most though he was a sweet gentle but hungry amour rather endearing and impressive in his own fashion she happily recalled but a man one too easily distracted by his sensual side his greed to ever be a real success at anything so easily led by his verge wherever she wished yet he did possess nautical knowledge and skills she thought alain was an experienced fighting officer hardhanded oh but how those hard hands delighted could she lead him one cautious step at a time into their service charite found herself fantasising he could be just venal enough with piles of loot gold and her as his reward which way would he jump charite had planned to go right to bed after a cool bath and a restorative light breakfast yet here it was well past eight oclock in the morning and helio and hippolyte were still intent on belabouring her daring her long shameful absence shed always thought it so unfair that they were allowed to rut like yowling tomcats to strut preen and stagger but she had to be cloistered with sewing music lessons in grace and wit and those few books her house would claim when younger shed been the apple of her fathers eye and had been allowed to learn riding fishing and swordplay as papas condescending jape his amusing girl toy with never a thought that she might enjoy such things she was crushed when on her thirteenth birthday maman had demanded she be corseted straitened and reined in and papa had so easily agreed that playtime was over and she must become just another limp pretty useless young lady as for her brothers worry about her amours despite the pious claims of society the bishop and priests the severe ursuline nuns and city fathers charite could count the real virgins among her contemporaries on one hand as for those already showing when led to the altar pah once inside their familys city maison charite had deftly deflected their sullen anger with a concocted tale of fearing shed been followed home by some determined skulker even if shed had the foggy street to herself shed hooted with glee to see them clatter off in high dudgeon swords and pistols at the ready by the time theyd clomped back upstairs having discovered not one whit of her skulker shed just been emerging from her bath which kept them redfaced and at bay til shed taken her own sweet dawdling time getting patted dry have her hair dried and combed by her maid she took even more time in choosing a gauzy morning ensemble sure to scandalise them by its sheerness charite knew that she was being unspeakably cruel to them but damned if they didnt deserve it for being so hypocritically censorous and scolding it might have been that anglais you spent helio grumbled censoring himself to name what shed been doing so bluntly or one of his men it was not my alain charite sweetly wheyface lied we saw that american elisson walking towards his lodgings hippolyte pointed out he might have been coming from our street i know what he looks like and it was not him charite said daintily nibbling on a buttered and jammed croissant besides what would the americans care of my doings our doings are they not in competition with panton leslie if the newcome americans are spies i would think they were only keeping an eye on alain well think mes freres charite insisted abandoning her breakfast for a moment to look them in the eyes the americans scheme to seize louisiana and our dear city if they suspect that panton leslie is helping the british do the sameyou said everyone knows that but for our dim spanish masters it seemsthen the americans keep an eye on them my alain is a strange new face leading a band of hard men to expand their trade advantage or to scout for an invasion but someone followed you hippolyte insisted mere curiosity charite dismissed covering her guilt over her lie by busying herself pouring a fresh cup of coffee would you not be curious to see alain with an elegant young man who becomes a girl at dawn was i armand the raconteur or charite nestce pas stop calling him alainyour alain helio shouted why not helio she asked with a halflidded leer when we are on such intimate gahh youre immoral brazen it runs in our blood charite shot back shutting helio down for shed touched a sore spot on their familys escutcheon papa was a devilishly handsome distinguishedlooking roue who enjoyed amours in every quarter reputedly even comely house slaves their elegant maman perhaps in spite spent protracted visits on nearby plantings ostensibly on a round of good works with the poor but and helio and hippolyte cousin jeanmarie even that hopeful grandee don rubio they were all of a piece let us be honest about our forebears charite soberly intoned our men were never bold christian adventurer chevaliers obeying king louis to conquer these lands our womenfolk werent virtuous virginal bourgeois filles a la cassette come straight from a convent in france to the ursulines convent here charite hippolyte exclaimed all but covering his ears no sweet little casket girls with their dowry trunk direct from the king for their goodness charite scoffed oh la never the street whores swept up to be auctioned off as wives never dregs from prisons excess peasant girls turfed off the estates of the great heavens no you are so scandalous so helio spluttered we may be richer but no better charite remorselessly continued louisiana then as now is still sans religion sans justice sans discipline sans ordre et sans police sans moralite too the lot of us and nothing the hated spanish the americans if they take us over or the british will ever be able to change our creole soul no matter how long they hold us in bondage if thats so charite hippolyte gently asked near a broken heart then what is the point of our hopedfor rebellion if we free ourselves from spain yet remain so if we reunited with beloved france but oh hippolyte charite laughed worldlywise for her tender years and rising to go to him and take his hands in hers we will he free to be french again free to take joy in being sans moralite of being ourselves creoles then laisser les bons temps rouler and to hell with rest of the world even so helio the far more practical brother said you must not see your alain again he somberly decreed playing the role oi pater familias in their papas absence even if he doesnt spy on us hes drawn the americans attention and sooner or later hell draw the spaniards our cause our movement must grow in secret til were strong well armed and ready to strike we cant afford the risk of exposure i told you helio he thinks im a bonsecour charite calmly explained though chafing at being told what to do he only knows you two as the darbone brothers he has no way to find me or either of you he could spot you one of us in the markets and follow one of us here helio fretted anyone he asked could steer him right then i will cut him off as a passing amusement charite was quick to rebuff alain aspired once to be a british officer one of the gentlemanly class and we know how mannerly and reticent les anglais are n estcepas she said chuckling they do not press themselves where they are not wanted i snub him in public deliver a cutsublime it would tell him that i am unattainable does he find our address i do not have to answer his notes one from me to him at his lodgings saying that i am affianced and never to be his well he had his one glorious night like a footman with a great lady charite affected to sneer though her heart was not in it and hell know he is much too lowly to ever aspire to then do it helio demanded only if he becomes tedious charite snapped whirling back to her breakfast table to sit down and spoon sugar into her coffee pour fresh cream and stir she saw that that seemed to satisfy them though lowly footmen have their uses she could not help suggesting twiddling one foot under the table in anxiety what he is a trained naval officer or was once alain might come cheaper than capitaine lanxade or that buffoon balfa she schemed aloud making it up as she went along unwilling to be ordered about certainly to give up a pleasureable relationship just because helio said to averse too because alain weelooby however one said that had amused her gratified her touched her heart and she doubted if she wished to give him up unless her brothers fears were proven non non mon dieu non helio erupted squawking like a jay what are you thinking if the british didnt trust him why should we he has no love for creole freedom for us charite younger brother hippolyte chimed in in similar screechy takings hed sell us out in a heartbeat he might be a spy what a horrid idea were in more danger of being sold out by faintheart creoles hippolyte charite pointed out both of you are illogical alain is a spy or he is not he is trustworthy or he is not he may be useful or he is not the only way to discover if hes a danger to us is for me to continue seeing him sounding him out you cannot argue both ways she said as if the subject was resettled whether this weelooby creature is a british agent or not helio gravelled disgruntled at his sisters refusal to obey his dictates perhaps it would be best if we all avoided any involvement with him before he discovers were not the darbone brothers or that you sister arent charite bonsecours and he becomes suspicious even if alain is really harmless charite asked smirking over the rim of her coffee cup capitaine lanxade has paid our crew from our last cruise but he said they could spend it in a week and drift away from us without a good chance for more helio reminded them if we left town went back to sea on another raiding cruise made another pile of money yes we could hippolyte enthused suddenly in better fettle if agents look for us here we could fool them and be where they cannot find us the gulf of mexico is a very big place before poor jean loses all his booty money at boure brother helio snickered even if the cruise is fruitless by the time we get back msieur bistineau and old maurepas will have the prize ship sold and therell be something to show for it and we can set aristotle and the other boys to keep an eye on alain and his party charite chimed in if he goes upriver or inland with trade goods doesnt linger in new orleans and ask after us then hes harmless will that satisfy your worries helio hippolyte mmm her brothers grudgingly allowed bon charite chirped then i can continue seeing him after we return and if were to leave town i must give him a reason why after all a mysterious sudden disappearance might spur him to ask too many questions no think of it she insisted to their sudden querulous expressions if i must go upcountry to the family plantations to comfort my sick grandmere and you two darbones must tend to farm business or take a hunting trip a harmless alain will accept the tale and make no enquiries you see they may not have liked it but they could see the sense of it charite both sated and pleased with their surrender dabbed her lips with her napkin and rose from the table secretly thrilled to have one more meeting with her entrancing yet possibly dangerous englishman oh la dear brothers but i am going to bed she said rising if you wish to scheme or plot or continue to complain about me then do it quietly in one of your thoroughly masculine coffeehouses peutetre bonsoir chers bonjour rather and dont clatter going down the stairs she added swirling at her bedchamber door to face them for a moment your chase after my pursuer has already upset poor madame dablemont once this morning better safe than sorry helio said in a harsh whisper as they gathered up their stylish hats canes and gloves to go out for coffee and their own breakfasts what did the old buccaneers say dead men tell no tales not a word to charite about it but before we sail i think we should eliminate this pesky anglais that american elisson too he was too winded and too hurried like he had followed her when we saw him what do you think hippolyte both at once his brother casually happily agreed we get rubio and jean to help theyre both excellent shots and rubio will love it oui bon lets kill them chapter twenty another day another guided tour lewrie thought theyd not found lanxade or balfa indeed theyd been rumoured to have departed new orleans for parts unknown even with toby jugg the only witness theyd dared bring along on the expedition wandering the port on his own for days on end theyd not turned up one familiar face from the pirate ships crewor recognised a single one of the elegant young sprogs on the buccaneer schooners deck the morning that lewries prizeship crew had been marooned so this morning involved that other nonsense that lewrie and pollock were charged to perform and frankly though lewrie thought it a bootless endeavour he had to admit that it was pleasureable work the morning was slightly overcast but balmy there was a faint breeze that felt refreshing and it was not mosquito season though a goodly tribe of flies were present round their horses hed been shown the cabildo and the cathedral their first days on foot strolled the streets and pretended to shop round the fort guarding the town centre and the levees out rue de larsenal to the garrison barracks and the storehouses to count spanish noses one day rode to lake pontchartrains shore through the reclaimed marshes that were now greengrocer produce plots to sniff round decrepit fort saint john and the reeky bayou st john that threaded right into the city this morning pollock suggested a brisk canter out to the east along the chef menteur road towards lake borgne across the plain of gentilly near bayou bienvenu with a promised alfresco dinner at the end of it lewrie was a good horseman but it had been a while since hed spent that much time astride in point of fact his thighs were chafing and his bottom was stiff and sore damme mister pollock i didnt think you meant to emulate alexanders march into persia he griped at last trying to rub his ass almost there no worries pollock gaily replied almost where the middle of another swamp lewrie carped as pollock checked his horse to a slow walk from a canter in the shade of a tall cypress grove what do you make of the country hereabouts sir pollock asked well its green frankly lewrie said with a scowl as he cast his gaze about hellish lot o trees and such all these fields the usual marshy sponges i spose neath the prairie grass quaking prairie such as weve seen before no not quite his guide told him sounding a tad pleased with himself take note of the variety of the grasses the sandier nature of the soil oh rainy season will turn the sand and clay into a perfect quagmire but in the winter or a warm and dry springtime its passable grazeable lewrie took note that their horses hooves left fairly shallow prints and didnt throw up much mud except for the lower places but theyd crossed a fair number of rivulets and seeps not much quicksand out here either sir pollock mused nor much market for it either id expect lewrie quipped bad for egg timers and watchglasses hey the bulk of the grasses here mister willoughby mr pollock irritatedly explained are not marsh grasses like those round rills and along the bayou channel theyre dryland grasses if the soil along lake pontchartrain wont support troops artillery or waggons do you not think that this terrain might be more practicable please leave off your japing and take a good look i conjure you well aye i spose the land here is higher and dryer lewrie allowed dismounting and squatting to dig up a handful to crumble in his hands wondering again why anyone in his right mind would send a sailor on a chore like this instead of a soldier or a farmer he was at best a gentlemanfarmer on his rented acres in surrey one who might raise his hat but little else that was his wifes bailiwick what her experience and knowledge from an agricultural childhood in north carolina had taught her what their hired estate manager and day labourers tended to without lewrie having to do much beyond shout encouragement heartily agree like the vicar of bray then toddle down to the olde ploughman tavern for an ale firm enough to support things perhaps pollock hinted aye i think it might be lewrie dumbly agreed mount up then and well ride on to the end of the road and have our meal pollock suggested pleased with lewries opinion bring any liniment lewrie asked with a grin taking time to massage his buttocks with the reins in his hands sorry no said you were a horseman pollock snickered they dismounted and spread a groundcloth at the end of the chef menteur road on a sandy beachdune hillock on the western shore of lake borgne a vast expanse of open waterseawaterstretched out before them to the south and southeast the lakes horizon mostly limitless except for due east where cross a fairly narrow channel or river the swamps began again and made a vast reedy and marshy island that blocked the view here and speckled with a few straggling groves of scrub trees once the horses had been hobbled and let to graze once theyd been led to fresh water to drink pollock did provide a decent spread lewrie had to allow there were crusty fresh baguettes mustard and butter in small stone jars and pickles in another a choice of roast beef or ham was wrapped in one cloth and several pieces of crispily breaded and fried chicken were wrapped in another a glass apothecary jar contained cold cooked beans in oil and vinegar and there were two bottles of imported hock pewter plates and utensils spare chequered napkins and proper wineglasses pollock had seen to everything another thing lewrie had to admit to himself as he concocted a thick meaty sandwich or was it as his cabinservant aspinall had cheekily termed it a shrewsbury for the real lord whod first built one at an allnight gaming table and took a bite risky though this expedition might be he was actually beginning to enjoy it a night or two in a comfy shore bed with fine coffee or hot chocolate delivered to his bedside by one of his pensions servants of sleeping lubberly civilian allnightins with no emergencies to summon him on deck and a myriad of coffeehouses cabarets wine bars or eating places from which to choose had seduced him utterly and the victuals the viands the delicious variety all but a few low dives preparing piquant unforgettable dishes ah and charite bonsecours and her enthusiastic amour to savour to contemplate another bout after the first and second well he was but for a troop of nubile and nude nymphs feeding him ambrosia or grapes in the fabled lotus eaters paradise out to the noreast yonder is cat island mr pollock intruded rattling out the folds of his inevitable chart to lay between them as they dined between cat island and the mainland is the inlet they call pass maria ah here ahem pollock indicated with a forefinger which left a dab of mustard on lake borgne there is deep water on the seaward side you see near to ship island as well this swampy island before us tother side of this channel has a fort at the north end fort coquilles to control the pass into lake pontchartrain but theres nothing to guard against ships entering lake borgne coming right to the shore on which we sit willoughby in your valued opinion could fort coquilles prevent a landing here what calibre are their guns lewrie asked measuring distance twixt thumb and forefinger and laying them on the charts scale it was a full five miles from the fort to the channel mouth ive heard boasts that theyre twentyfourpounders pollock supplied ships guns on naval carriages theyd not have a hope in hell lewrie told him sure enough of artillery one of his chiefest delights since his first experience of a broadside on the old ariadne no mortars no biguns only light coehorn mortars on the landward walls i have discovered over the years pollock guardedly declared our spaniards are a boastful lot when shopping do you use my telescope you can almost make out the fort to the north and east of us its placed on firm ground so im told at this islands tip the pass the lakes are too shallow for deepdraught ships so i suppose the fort was set in place to counter small vessels and gunboats from getting past it could i get some bombketches in here within three miles of the place shallow improvised bombs up this channel a little way with teninch sea mortars i could pound it into ruin lewrie stated standing and peering through the borrowed telescope buoyed up with camels to either beam to get em up this slough woodbased light coehorn mortars in launches and pinnaces to sail right up the islands west side that d keep their heads down and their buttocks clenched he hooted in anticipatory mirth two three combined companies of marines from off a few ships of the line could go with the small boats and assault it from the rear landward walls of a sea fort arent designed against a strong assault he lowered the glass and looked down at the channel though i dont much care for the current looks fast to me he said frowning at the eddies swirls and bentover reeds take a slack tide and how long thatd last else the mortar boats could not breast the tides under sail and rowingd be sheer buggery make less than a mile an hour slower than a man could walk it or fort coquilles could be ignored if it cant reach to this shore with its guns mr pollock mused as lewrie sat back down handing him the glass to stow away then in your professional opinion could a large force be landed here where we now sit its not over thirteen miles from here to new orleans over a fairly good road too mister peel being a cavalryman at one time suggested that this might prove the best route when we talked before leaving kingston beats sailing an hundred miles up the mississippi river from the gulf lewrie cautiously allowed or god knows how far down from from canada aye how large a force could be landed here though lewrie mused shrugging he fixed pollock with a sharp leery eye and grinned and did mister peel drop a few hints hey mister pollock as to what he thought the size of the force required could be well ahem he did mention a squadron of horse merely in passing dye see pollock responded oh im sure he did lewrie said laughing old habits die hard tarratarra draw sabres and charge peel no matter his influence in london or kingston no matter his knowledge of any secret plans already drawn mister pollock aint a sailor he and his army contacts see the problem from this hillock inland with nary a worry bout how theyre tbe gotten here he really shouldve chosen an infantry officer in disguise for this part of our mission not me mister peel ah pollock hesitantly explained said that the crux of the matter was the getting ashore and that you sir had the wits to solve it or ahem scotch it should it not prove to be practical mine arse on a bandbox peel said that lewrie gawped it is news tme that hmm well well and all this time peels good as told me im an idiot lewrie thought a useful idiot now an again but hmm well well horse transports are even rarer than hens teeth sir lewrie laid out to his guide suddenly in much better takings even finding professional delight in sketching out a plan on the chart i expect only one or two might be available on short notice so lets say no more than two or three troops of cavalry not an entire squadron a couple of batteries of horse artillery nothing heavier than four or sixpounders too troop transports arent that common either so no more than three or four regiments of foot with their fourgun batteries of equally light artillery pieces hed anchor the invasion fleet off cat and ship islands in deep water sail or row barges launches pinnaces and coehorn mortar boats from there into lake borgne dead of night all that even tow some astern of the extemporised bombs which could fire far inland to suppress any opposition as the troops were going ashore light infantry fusiliers and such ashore first to scout and skirmish their way west to protect the fairly small landing ground which was not quite as big as a cricket pitch really some light regimental guns next their limbers stuffed with cannister and grape not solid shot then cavalry and horse artillery followed by the rest of the regiments the line companies and grenadier companies the marines for the bayou bienvenu near where they sat aye the bayou by god a heavensent highway in its own right that so mr pollock assured him meandered right into the northern suburbs of new orleans itself fed the marigny canal hard by the many farm plots and cart paths behind fort st john and the shore of pontchartrain takes most of the supply waggons or packmules off the single road lewrie said chuckling supply boats gigs launches cutters shallowdraught stuff off every vessel can get up bayou bienvenu pole em if they cant be rowed cuts down on the number of draught animals to transport or feed too less hay and oats more shot and powder more troops who are fed worse than horses really hmmm swivels and twopounder boatguns on the bayou boats to keep the dons well back and up to their necks in muck seven miles from new orleans the chart showed a large tongue of higher dryer ground to the north of the chef menteur road framed by great groves of cypresses the surprised scurrying spanish garrison would in his limited military judgement think that the perfect place to rally to form a defence line and fight firm ground on which to emplace heavier guns than the landing force could boast and lewrie couldnt see a way round it without a thrust into lake pontchartrain in boats to land infantry behind that solid ground to take the spanish in flank or rear before they could get sorted out and unlimber their artillery pieces or just after and sweep them up thereby shattering the frantic resistance even further or could cavalry do it on their own unsupported lewrie grimaced as he imagined that it might take a whole squadron of horse to be landed after all its feasible lewrie said at last grimacing with doubt despite his tentative statement of approval with a brigade of foot a battalion of marines and peels damned squadron of cavalry one day to land sort out and march past here fight a battle here on this firm ground if cavalry cant seize it right off then whistle up the bandsmen for the march into new orleans land a second brigade once new orleans falls a second or third brigade could sweep up the forts down the mississippi one at a time pollock contributed whilst a squadron of frigates sails up to help reduce them by direct fire lewrie supposed then what small wretched garrisons there are at mobile and pensacola could be overwhelmed pollock asked nor more than fifty or an hundred men to each really mounting guard over the mosquitoes and the mildew heh heh pollock scoffed a touchy endeavour even so mister pollock lewrie counselled where do we get that many tropicseasoned troops and transports in sufficient number if they come from england it would depend on whether its hurricane season or not or how long they have to languish aboard their ships and still be healthy whether they go ashore on jamaica for long during fever season before the army has things done all tiddly and yellow jack kills twothirds of them you have pen and paper lewrie sat crosslegged and jotted four brigades say and infantry average transport to tons with two men per ton of displacement to men eachsay no more than to for health reasons in the tropics it would take twentyfour transports with another dozen for supplies nearly cavalry mounts plus artillery nags assume a quarter died or broke legs onpassage so plan on seven or eight rare specialised horse transports and an equal number just for fodder and oats and the light artillery could have eight animals per gun not the usual six in case the soil was soggy he broke off and gazed out at lake borgne and the open sea in disgust hundreds of barges and cutters all coming tthis wee patch o mud and our army in charge of it hmmm i dont know something wrong pollock asked taking fret from his tone anchored so far off bloody miles of choppy shallow sea they must cross lewrie gloomed unless its flat calm itd take days to land them and the spanish would have time to react our wonderful army just doesnt have quick in its vocabulary mister pollock a large force would hamper itself a small quickun could be knackered saw at at toulon in and and that was a proper harbour with wharves cranes and all this sand spit aint itd be treacly chaos to get em landed and sorted out quickly then march them west up a single sandy track one weeded bayou did we get a regiment ashore per day id be very much surprised id be surprised all the more did the general in charge dare lurch into motion before a weekd passed our soldiers cant be that slow can they pollock asked with a crushed look on his illformed phyz wolfe montreal a fluke lewrie spat hah you know mister pollock it might be better did we just slip the dons a note and ask em what theyd take for louisiana cheaper in the long run especially when it comes to the lives of our soldiers ha ha trade em gibraltar or something oh for gods sake lewrie pollock grumped so nettled that he quite forgot the agreedupon alias ill write admiral parker and mister peel an appreciation lewrie promised digging into their food basket to build a roast beef sandwich this is the quickest easiest route to the citys conquest though i will have to include its warts and my reservations that is after all one of the reasons captain nicely mister peel as well insisted on your presence pollock told him sooner or later we must have new orleans louisiana and spanish florida too to keep the americans hemmed in and humble on their side of the mississippi to pay the spanish back for switching sides and taking hand with the french in to boot well thatd be sweet i grant you lewrie chuckled damme is that a twist of ground pepper by your leg thats whats missing on this beef pollock handed the paper twist over then picked up the sheet on which lewrie had marked his figures he carefully tore it to bits as fine as confetti then let the soft breeze scatter it put nothing more on paper pollock warned him trust all to your head or let me ah translate the numbers into innocent debits and such in a ledger book things to be ordered shipped sold or as items in stock harmless code words dye see whatever you wish mister pollock lewrie happily agreed in thrall to crunchy bread and succulent meat zested with mustard you do a lot of business in codes commerce is a ah cutthroat business mister willoughby pollock said with a cryptic smile ahem they rolled down the sloppy streets along the waterfront levee once theyd returned their hired mounts to the stablery savouring the sunset and the cool riversweet air a trifle stifflegged it must be admitted from spending nigh the whole day in the saddle and their fundaments chafed thighs and challenged leg muscles complaining watching their passing image in one of the rare large glass storefront windows lewrie was put in mind of a brace of virgin girls toddling homeward after their first experience at allnightin and theres your men mister willoughby pollock pointed out as rue toulouse deadended at levee road drunk as lords ill warrant lewrie growled to see them all asprawl at their ease in canebottom chairs round a rickety table by the entrance to a lowly sailors cafe damn em i warned em to stay sober much good that does with sailormen he despaired they look fairly sober to me willoughby pollock countered back in his fully civilian and innocent role once they had returned to civilisation hoy capm willoughby quartermasters mate toby jugg lazily called lifting a wooden piggin by way of salute without rising or doffing his hat playing his own role to the hilt and loving every second of it lewrie was mortalcertain aye capm l landsman furfy that dim but capable irish side of beef began to say just before his mate liam desmond kicked him beneath the table ow liam whadye do at oh neck burning at juggs impertinence but knowing that he would have to play up game lewrie only sauntered to their table his hands jabbed deep into his trouser pockets most unlike naval officer fashion to join them clenched into fists but jabbed deep havin a free day are we lads lewrie casually enquired of them rocking on his heels with his widebrimmed wideawake hat far back on his head and with a faint grin on his face not gotten all three sheets to the wind yet today oh nossor jugg idly

managed to croak at last faith but thats filthy muck sor jugg hooted in mirth as he finally got to his feet and came within arms reach showing lewrie the yeasty contents of his piggin no tis real

table to pour himself a glass of vin ordinaire from an earthenware jug aye jugg we should take a short stroll with mister pollock all three took a few paces apart from the rest of the crewmen facing south across the river to the prize ship and the emporium hulks where belfry and taffrail lanthornsoil lights or candleswere now cheerfully aglow for late shoppers casting long dancing glades across the mississippi which itself had put on its gay bluegrey nighttime masquerade instead of its daytime muddybrown shes our prize sure nough capm mister pollock jugg imparted rocking on his heels and wearing a grin as he lifted his mug to take a leisurely sip using that gesture to point at the hulk we went aboard her this mornin so we did capm coffin and th first mate mister caldecott actin like we might buy her like absolutely certain lewrie stated oh aye sor jugg said with a snicker turning to look at him for id left me mark on her by way o speakin when we woz anchored at dominica an

talkin but seems i do recall a banker feller name o merrypaws was tied up innit too mebbe bought inta her as a ships husband even help with th financing did anyone buy her sure bistineau and maurepas was it pollock pressed perked up as sharpeyed as an owl aye em names sound more like it certain sor jugg agreed aha pollock chortled half aloud rubbing dry palms together now were talking now were in business at last gentlemen for i am familiar with both those worthies monsieur bistineau is as crooked as a dogs hind leg a right captain sharp hed steal the coins off his dead mothers eyes and maurepas monsoor henri maurepas hes rumoured to have been involved in some shady dealings in the past the plantations hes scooped up for a song off people who fell behind with their loans i imagine either or both can provide us valuable information do i put the thumbscrews to em ye would sor jugg asked surprised fer real an all manner of speaking pollock offhandedly quibbled aww jugg rejoined sounding hellish disappointed shes floating high above her waterline lewrie said so i spose her cargos long gone evry stick gone sorry i am tsay sor jugg told him with a mournful look her holdsre as empty as an orphans pantry not just her holds neither capm sor er second bower an least kedge aint there no longer an all her spare spars an sailsve been sold away cabletiers are empty too though i spect at had more tdo with a need tlash her bow stern breast an springlines t th shore tkeep her moored agin th river currents then who do they expect to buy her i wonder lewrie said with a snort recalling again his one reading of the prizes manifest imagining middlingsized bags of prize money winging away mostlike that bastard bistineau would be more than happy to play ship chandler and sell you her own fittings back as spanking new at a hellishdear cost mr pollock sneered with a matching snort yes captain coffin and mister caldecott could tell me more well a bit more and for your sharp eyes and ahem sagacity i thank you mister jugg i do blieve i should look them up at once after your trip aboard her jugg i do believe we have a lead at last thankee kindly sor jugg replied doffing his hat from long practice though peering quizzically at lewrie for the meaning of the word sagacity good clever work jugg lewrie congratulated er ah thankee capm sor jugg said to him plumbing to the approximate meaning of his praise hoy aint she a handsome wee thing there sors at cutter comin upriver they all turned to gaze upon a smallish singlemasted craft not so far downriver coming up slowly against the relentless current with all her fat jibs and huge gaff mainsl winged out into a starkly white cloud of canvas against the blue of the river and twilight she flew a spanish flag and mr pollock cupped his eyes with his hands to peer hard at her even without the aid of a telescope spanish navy cutter pollock announced at last an aviso a despatch boat from havana or veracruz mostlike making the round with the latest mails though they do have a few like her at mobile and pensacola for guarda costas a problem for us is she lewrie fretted half aloud oh i rather doubt it mister willoughby pollock amusedly dismissed had the dons tumbled to your presence youd have been in cells in the calabozo days ago hah hah ahem had the spaniards a single clue about our business theyd have sent a frigate well thats reassuring lewrie said scowling at the man being spaniards they wont land the mails til next morningpollock chuckledafter a good supper and a run ashore as well known as i am no onell think twice of me wandering over to the cabildo and asking the latest news in the place darmes its what everyone else does god knows tonight though ahem it might be a good idea if you and your hands being strange new faces didnt do their drinking and carousing near yon cutters crewmen hmm make it an early night aye ill see to it lewrie vowed though after his carouse with charite bonsecours even an orgy in the pigeon coop cabaret would prove anticlimactic and making it an early night held no charms whatsoever twiddle his thumbs in his rooms alone polish his boots and bed down by ten it sounded like a hellishdull evening book four prospero lie at my mercy all mine enemies shortly shall all my labours end and thou shalt have the air at freedom for a little follow and do me service the tempest act iv scene william shakespeare chapter twentyone well before noon the following morning more than a few events came to pass in the parlours offices taverns lodging houses and streets of the town of new orleans at the corner of rue royale and rue toulouse jim hawk ellison was breaking his fast and taking in the latest informations from his men pipinghot cornbread white hominy and a rasher of bacon with a pork cutlet aswim in gravy and strong rumspiked and sweetened chicory cafe au lait kept hands and mouth busy while his watchers reports occupied his mind dont see how wed manage comin upriver one of his men silas bowman said in a hunchshouldered low mutter over his plate of eggs and bacon fort saint charles and the rampart batteriesre too strong got eighteen heavy pieces twelve and eighteenpounder guns an set for a wicked crossfire jim hawk crossin pontchartrain dont look too good either another man a disguised us army sergeant named davey lumpkin told him fort saint john can slaughter anybody tryin to cross the produce fields even with all the swampdrainin theyve done it stills too marshy for anything but men afoot too guess itll have tbe done from the inside then boys jim hawk ellison decided as he slathered molasses on a buttered slice of pone come prime trading season well have to float men downriver in flatboats rafts and keelboats dressed country the spaniards wont think a thing of em and everybody comes armed with rifles or muskets and theyre used tseein that too peyton whatre those englishmen been up to been keepin a sharp eye on em hell jim hawk peyton siler another disguised soldier said yestady they rode way out east all th way tlake borgne and ate a meal outten a basket never could get all that close but i could see em with my glass spent a long time pawin an headcockin over some map they brought with em pointed north and east a lot they did up that way theres fort coquilles hmmm knew they warnt straight well i do declare ellison chuckled over his laced coffee tore some kinda paper inta ittybitty bits fore they left siler said on winking oncet they got outta sight i picked up what i could of it whole lotta numbers was all couldnt make no sense of it thats all right peyton ellison told him they were up to some kind o devilment and now we know they got something thide they stopped bout halfway back ttown siler continued i saw em get down an paw th ground its high an firm they looked right pleased with whatever it was they saw there ellison already had a map of the environs engraved in memory he smiled at that news firm ground sounds tme like they spotted a good place tplace defences an guns so maybe the rumours arent true wont come down from canada like we thought they mean tland somewhere out th end o the chef menteur road an strike fast twelve or fifteen miles away from the town you see anything out there could stop em peyton thatd be th onliest place that might hold em up jim hawk siler decided after a long contemplative rub of his unshaven chin if they come so far south o fort coquilles that is but itd be a chore less they had a whole lotta small boats ellison snickered keeping his own counsel as he sipped coffee the american army even if that bastard general wilkinson did lead it could muster militia plus regulars and infiltrate around into new orleans half the rest would march on natchez and overwhelm its pitifully small garrison the other half would sail down from kentucky or the wolf river bluffs to pick up the natchez detachment once theyd won with natchez silenced the spanish would have no warning until the makeshift armada swung round the last bend above the city which would be the signal for the infiltrators to cause general havoc and pave the way for the main force to land anyone have any luck talkin up that crew o theirs ellison enquired as he set his cup aside no one had the newcome strangers usually made taciturn early nights of things and what desultory conversations that ellisons men had drawn them into all that could be learned from them was that they came from ireland or england once and were loyal to their courtmartialed former naval officer who was a fairly goodnatured sort and a terror with the ladies wide open out there ellison muttered once those reports were done east o town wonder why the spanish havent fortified it or even planned against a lake borgne landing too marshy really jim hawk siler said with a shrug that roads the only way and hits not much tspeak of wish we had a navy big as the british do ellison said with a scowl oh well maybe someday but theres twenty thousand fightin men in kentucky an tennessee just rarin tgo does president adams and congress ever get done wranglin and jabberin give us the signal tgo ahead well hey what bout at ere girly feller jim hawk silas bowman asked with an eyerolling leer er wuz heun really a sheun after all oh i was pretty sure she was a she soon as she came outta th lodgin house silas ellison whispered back took off her hat and shook her hair out fore she got to her door right before those two bastards come boilin out an tried tslit my gizzards i still dont know who she is and for damn sure cant stick my nose anywhere round her street after that silas maybe you could sniff around there ask a slave who owns that house or whoall lives there so i can narrow it down gotta admit im damn curious bout that little gal and what her connexion might be tthat mysterious willoughby fellah ahll do er jim hawk bowman assured him with a deep nod well maybe ya shouldnt get that close to her silas jim hawk teased with a leer creating a bit more mirth at his crowded table rest o you boys today it might not hurt tsneakify round all the forts an such get a count o th garrison an whether they live in barracks or sleep out then meanwhile back at the pension at bourbon st and rue ste anne capt alan lewrie or willoughby take your pick heard the rumbles of a dray waggon in the brick and cobbled streets and all but levitated off the mattress as he flung himself from his left side to his right he crammed a fluffy cool goosedown pillow over his head to shut out the creakyscreechyrumbly din then fell back asleep aboard the panton leslie company emporium hulk hippolyte and helio de guilleri along with their weedier cousin from saint domingue jeanmarie rancour and the elegant don rubio monaster bought some few things with their illegal gains that they thought might come in handy on their impending new piratical foray fresh and reliable british gunpowder pistol and musket priming powder most especiallywas paramount in their purchases jeanmarie bought himself a new longbarrelled pistol one with rich and glossy walnut stocks and grips and a glossy blued finish intricately chased with hairthin silver inlays with a bright brass powder flask replacement lock spring and a bullet mould and sprewsnip all in a velvetlined walnut case jeanmarie already owned four pistols but a man could never have too many besides hed been awed by a woodcut print of the infamous buccaneer blackbeard of the last century blackbeard was depicted bearing an awesome number of pistols on his person in his waistband the pockets of his coat in his hands and even more holstered in a long and wide canvas rig that hung down on either side of his chest like a priests scapular blackbeard had also been shown with burning slowmatch fuses in his wild hair and beard that might be a touch outre jean thought but the firepower he would have at his fingertips his new weapon matched the calibre of three others in his collection and had a narrow steel shank on one side so it could hang from his waistband just like the real oldtime pirates he would gladly have bought its twin so hed have six but hed lost at boure and the pharoah tables two nights running so his funds were very tight so dear though jean mon cher ami rubio monaster said with a sniff after they left the belowdecks stuffiness for the fresh air on the covered former quarterdeck and shared a round of ginger beer but longbarrelled and rifled rubio jeanmarie enthusiastically answered with my grandfathers duellers i inherited now i own three rifled pistols i would trade my two smoothbores if i could for this english pistols mate in a boarding firepower is ev shhh jean helio cautioned with a growl with the spanish navy cutter here the less talk of such things the better everyone in the place darmes was talking about the missing havana guarda costa for now they think a british warship or privateer took her but indeed jean don rubio said with a languid smile we must be as bland as a blancmanger til they are gone and slip away down south as quiet as mice though it would be pleasing for our fellow creoles to know that someone struck a blow against our oppressors think of the wonder that would cause perhaps it might light a fire under the many who sleep through spanish occupation helio gruffly commented perhaps all the bluster and bold talk of freedom would not be so damnably idle well we could start a rumor that bold local creoles did the deed jeanmarie suggested in a much softer conspiratorial voice an anonymous letter dropped at the doorway of the newspaper hippolyte posed but would they dare print it helio countered the spanish would shut them down in a heartbeat bastards don rubio fulminated under his breath no time anyway chers helio said scowling were off to sea in a day or two dim and slothful as the spaniards are a letter like that and us suddenly absent even the fools in the cabildo could put two and two together weve other business first one of the americans trailed our sister home from le pigeonnier yesterday lurked outside as if he meant her harm when we rushed downstairs to confront him he escaped us in the mists but we know him salaud son of a whore who is he don rubio said with a malevolent hiss bristling up in an instant i will kill him myself he calls himself elisson helio informed him stepping even closer and lowering his voice to a faint mutter the leader of those newcome buckskin barbarians we suspect are here to scout the city for an american invasion rubio our body slaves have made careful note of all the skulking they do we know the lowclass tavern where elisson and his band lodge a filthy gloomy place he would violate her he would lurk and hope to seize her and ravish her nom dun chien i will call him out at once don rubio hotly vowed no time for the niceties rubio comprendre helio hinted tipping him a grave wink and nod he is no true gentleman so challenging him to a duel would mean no more to him than gold to a hog he seems more the sort to cheat anyway besides duels take such a long time to arrange and what sort of insult would it be to your honour to waste highborn niceties on a jumpedup peasant who would sic his minions on you in the dark of night and backshoot you hein helio de guilleri had known don rubio monaster and his family the bergrands since he donned his first pair of boys breeches knew him and his touchy sense of honour to a tee and his sheeplike lust for his sister all it would take would be one word to launch him at their foe and rubio would wade in with all guns blazing if given the chance to do something impressive to redeem charites honour or guard her delicacy from the advances of a beastly scoundrel even knowing his sister and her little games helio himself would have sprung to her defenceit was what brothers were supposed to do to guard the familys precious honour but rubio was such a wonderful weapon a murder do you mean not a duel don rubio replied nodding in grim but pleased understanding exactly helio said with an equally grim nod without their leader the other american wolves will melt away run scared back to kentucky with their tails between their legs the knife in the heart jeanmarie rancour breathed eyes alight with evil mischief and expectation no no too messy hippolyte de guilleri drolly quipped you would stain a good suit of clothes up that close with all that blood remember on that trading brig when i stabbed that a pistol is better helio suggested shushing his brother one more time in the dark as he staggers back to his lodgings oh better yet helio jeanmarie excitedly piped up with a rifled musket one of those girandoni airrifles they showed us not five minutes ago theyre so quiet the clerk said one little snap or crack no louder than a twig and if you miss your first shot your game cant take alarm and bolt before you get off a second or third though rubio is such a fine marksman i doubt he would require more than one isnt that so rubio twelve shots in half a minute the fellow assured me think of the advantage a man could have in a melee hein a decent shot half a dozen men of passable skill firing ten or twelve shots in half a minute would massacre a ships crew six men could equal the volleys of a whole regiment oui oh i wish we had enough money to buy more than one for rubio to use when he pots that american hippolyte exclaimed catching his cousins enthusiam and picturing in his mind the crew of a proud royal spanish frigate being slaughtered like a cloud of passenger pigeons in a boarding action if we asked monsieur maurepas for an advance took some of the seed money account as a material investment hmm four at least for us jeanmarie added they arent that expensive we could put down payment for four now then get the rest from old henri for the balance jeanmarie was almost tailwriggling and prancing in place like a tot at first sight of his birthday pony we would be invincible hippolyte gushed his elder brother helio thought that over for a second he was seized by visions of a stalwart battalion of rebel creole gentlemen marching under bright french tricolours with a band playing la marseillaise as they strode bravely near musket range of an entire spanish brigade taking aim and strewing them flat as easily as reaping sugarcane stalks we should get six helio announced for now with them we gain more profits from our cruise and can buy more later with six we could ambush the american upstart and that damned anglais too hippolyte softly crowed all at once the same night pay him back for what he did with charite even if and what did that dog do to her don rubio monaster demanded before helio could even think to slap his brothers arm to shut him up rubio though knew the answer to his jealousy even before they could confirm it their tight faces stiff postures and queasy shrugs said it all she came out with us to le pigeonnier hippolyte had to admit redfaced with embarrassment in her usual costume nestce pas the anglais willoughby came in too and she dared us to engage him to see if he might be dangerous to us and you know how bold she can be when we wouldnt go one thing led to another boure then drinks then they ah left together round he spent the night with her rubio gasped with a cold twinge under his heart even as he darkened with rage the salaud that english bastard the cochon pig ravisher he spluttered so dearly did he crave her it could never be her failing that made her go off with the englishman could it womengirlswith heads so easily turned were frail weak and biddable even ones bold and outre which boldness and unconventionalism in charite made her even more maddeningly desirable no charite was so young still so in love with life galloping through it with her head thrown back in a laugh once her enthusiasm palled surely she would settle down at last would consider becoming the wife of a stalwart bold and assuringly steady fellow from a lineage as distinguished as hers would take as a lifelong lover one who had gladly shared all her adventures had been dashing and brave they are both dead men don rubio monaster stiffly promised manfully fighting the tears of disappointment that stung the corners of his eyes for being denied her wholehearted love though his for her was boundless he would not unman himself with tears before his future inlaws he would disguise his upset with righteous anger they are dead men mes amis at my hands both of them in the same night he heatedly vowed mr gideon pollock sat down to a light first breakfast with his wife a mere piffle of cafe au lait half a canteloupe and only one croissant hed take a second more substantial breakfast with business associates but colette would feel neglected if he didnt humour her desires for close intimate and talkative domesticity a semblance of a righteous man and wifes routines colette was little darker than pollocks heavily creamed coffee as lightbeige as expensive letter paper with long straight and lustrous ravendark hair now demurely pinned up behind her ears with deep bangs over her brows and crimped springy coils depended on either side of her face her eyes were hazel nearly as green as dark emeralds and almost asianalmond shaped the palest yellow morning gown she had on perfectly complemented her hair eyes and complexion colette smiled tweaking up the corners of her generous lips as she poured them both refills of coffee which smile forced an appraising wry grin on pollocks face too recalling the night before when her hair had been free of pins and combs and had fallen loose to the top of her sweet round buttocks had fanned out across the pillows as she had lain invitingly her body dusky against the paleness of the bed linens mr pollock congratulated himself again for having her despite his lack of height imposing physique or handsome features wealth mr pollock had found atoned for almost anything and he was nothing if not very well off after his years of neckornothing adventures and toils if it hadnt been for a legitimate wife and three children back in bristol where he ventured only once every three years he would have been sorely tempted to avow colette his only woman for she was the most pleasing most passionate and abandoned yet finemannered lover ever he had had five hundred english pounds she had cost to buy from her former owner and keeper two thousand silver spanish dollars even more to set her in this grand pension and furnish her appartement in a style worthy of her sham status even more to provide her with a slave cook handmaiden housemaid and an elderly yet wakeful footman and fees and bribes to the slothful spanish authorities to start then expedite her manumission papers and the price paid in embarrassment as those authorities leered and nudged each other to see the proud little inglese twistface prig turn red to free his paramour whom he could have kept in bondage as his harem toy at half the cost and trouble the way they maintained their own loco utterly besotted behaving like an old coltstooth a witless cully of a boy over his first milkmaid he certainly was and delighted in his folly did panton leslie company allow him mr pollock would gladly chuck return voyages to england gladly shed kingston and settle for a lesser post as company factotum permanently assigned to new orleans for the entrancing town its burgeoning trade its future promise and colette were equal opportunities to his mind he could keep an eye on her faithfulness and escape the damnable hellish pangs of jealousy and dread he felt whenever he had to sail off and stay apart from her for months and months on end he knew they could never really marry even in a city so casual about its licentiousness so hypocritically sinfully catholic mr pollock himself was a rockribbed scot presbyterian you wish me to ask in the markets about your mysterious young girl cher colette quite innocently posed seemingly innocent hmm what pollock flummoxed with a twitch of his head at the picture of her sauntering and sashaying past hordes of leering and lustful idle creole gentlemen returning the sly grins of a muscular free black dandy even of an impressive slave horseholder no no can it be you tire of me cher gideon colette gently teased and your msieur willoughby s white creole girl in male clothes fires your imagination hmm oh rot pollock replied with a shuddery laugh to realise he was being lovingly twitted as all older lovers would be by their much younger and more desirable paramours my dearest love colette said turning serious as she put down her coffee cup and folded her hands together on the table you allow me to be decorative but you never let me be the wife partner that i am to you cher hermione and i she said naming her stout and darker older maidservant have many sources she knows the slaves to all the grands blancs families and they see everything nestce pas i am on casual speaking terms with many of the towns young ladies the jeunes filles de couleur who are kept their masters and beaus share their gossip when they come home from the cabarets the pillow talk the amusing tales i know you wish to protect me from no dearest i must insist that pollock began to splutter as dearly as colette actually loved her wry little englishman there were times that his notsohidden jealousy his fear of losing her was maddening allow me to aid you please gideon just this once she almost begged reaching across the table to take his hands in hers and squeeze reassuringly batting her long lashes like a fearful kitten i already know hermione and i have already learned that this girl is not a bonsecour they have no young unmarried daughter and the darbone brothers you mentioned have not been in new orleans for at least a month their manservant boys were disgusted that they had to leave the city and go up towards pointe coupee to the darbone lands they despise the crude field slaves and are terrified that anything could happen to them so far away if old man darbone or madame takes a dislike to them three sassmouth darbone house slaves already died of whipping after the pointe coupee rebellion gideon comprendre well let me call hermione in please cher gideon let her tell of what she has already heard colette cajoled hmm i spose ahem pollock grudgingly assented unable to deny his entrancing mistress anything almost anything he did desire an answer to lewries mysteryjust so long as he could keep colette from laying eyes on the impressive lout hermione colette said tinkling a porcelain bell by her place setting ici sil te plait mamselle wish the husky older woman asked coming in from a mostly unused kitchen wiping her square hands on a dishclout swiping at her garish satin headcloth oh la dat girl who go about at night like ze gentilhomme mon dieu the gist of her gossip gleaned from a kitchen maid who was friendly with one of the oyster shuckers owned by the proprietors from the pigeon coop cabaret was that the girl who was uncommonly pretty was no bonsecour at all but lived in a grand pension on rue dauphine and could be seen sneaking home arm in arm with two young men always the same two both a groom and a girl body servant belonging to one of the houses on rue dauphine no bettahn dey should be and mon dieu don get me started on dem msieur gideonsaid that they had both seen her sometimes with the two young men when all three of them would go into a house together sometimes the girl alone dressed in suitings but with her hair free would come traipsing in at cockcrow for sure if hermione asked a slave who worked a produce plot on bayou st john and came into town at dawn with his owners cart of greens to sell hed tell her the same and could show her the right house even tell hermione which floor where the candles got lit after she went up to her appartement oh dey say she a highborn creole gal msieur gideon but not de finest sort hein hermione concluded but we could ask about her for you cher colette perkily assured him and id lay you any wager you wish that the secret is not a secret at all that sort of delicious gossip surely is already the common coin in this town let us try for you mon cher well just so long as you dont stray into a neighbourhood where hermione could not protect you dearest perhaps you had best take scipio along to chaperone both of you he may be getting on in years but he still can appear forbidding does he put a scowl on ahem pollock at last conceded you are the dearest man gideon colette murmured her eyes locked on his with the promise of a most magnificent night of reward the mails msieur henri maurepass personal assistant and clerk announced with his usual unctuous air as the banker entered his inner sanctum a fashionable thimbleshaped hat gloves and cane were taken from him and placed securely in a tall oak armoire that had come all the way from paris as maurepas strode to his imposing desk and sat down with a sweep of his coattails without a word spoken a slave in formal livery tiptoed in with a tray bearing a coffee service and a candlewarmed silverplate pot merci m maurepas said in a distracted and bored grunt as he almost always did to indicate that he had taken note of the service done him but they should both now get out and let him get to work he sorted through the many letters there was one pile that was local business those he shoved aside to concentrate on the few others that had come aboard the naval cutter to his disappointment none of his latest correspondence was from france not even from distant kin certainly there had yet to come a reply from the directory in paris to his many letters urging support for a rebellion in louisiana though there were some outdated newspapers ah two letters directed to the bank one from havana with a date scribbled on it that was much earlier than the second which came all the way from ciudad de mexico both were in spanish a language he detested no matter how flowery and elegantly written spanish could not hold a candle to the grace of a cultured mans french to inform you most esteemed senor maurepas that given your previous requests directed to his excellency the captaingeneral combined with the humble pleas of your fellow bankers in the colony of louisiana and the city of new orleans his most catholic majesty has graciously given assent to the shipment to the colony of a considerable sum of silver specie with which to ease the regrettable shortage of coinage which has of late caused such a hardship upon his most catholic majesty s subjects residing in louisiana due to the regrettable outflow of specie which the import of diverse american trade goods has caused the captaingeneral of his majestys american possessions having received his majestys gracious permission the captaingeneral at havana has ordered the captaingeneral of new spain at ciudad de mexico to order the mines at potosi to refine mint and prepare for shipment piecesofeight and dollars to the amount of sacre nom de dieu henri maurepas almost screeched in amazement choking on the smoke from his mornings first cigaro doubling over and hacking for a good two minutes before he could trust himself to reread the sum and breathing very carefully til he had managed to pour himself a restorative throatclearing tot of brandy it was followed by a second larger one that he sipped in a celebratory but very thoughtful fashion coined money gushed northward into the coffers of the barbaric yankees to pay for their flour wheat corn lumber and such their whiskies and furs hides tobacco and cotton with the war most of the merchant ships that came to trade in new orleans were american too yankees ending buying yankee goods passing through the city and very little of the profits stuck to french or spanish fingers hence louisiana new orleans and maurepass bank were forever short of coin which shortage drove up the price of everything needed or wished even local goods spain had ignored the problem for years halfheartedly closing the mississippi to american traders for several years which had been a disastrous policy that had fomented mass smuggling and even greater corruption and graft was such a thing possible now with the river open again but spain locked in a war even wealthy bankers had to scrimp and scrounge to maintain comfortable cash reserves to loan out and as to what their borrowers offered as payment pah m henri maurepas had to lease several warehouses to hold consignments of molasses sugar rice and cotton til it could be sold to someone someday before the mice insects or the everpresent damp ruined it and he thought himself fortunate did he make a percent profit shelling out so much silver to lanxade and balfa to reward their sailors paying shares to those foolish youngsters who would foment a rebellion after the hellish cost of buying artillery weapons and the pirate schooner for them to play with had put him in a worse spot and if they ever tired of their little adventure or failed to take more prizes to sell on the sly failed to bring in more free goods for the scalpers like bistineau to front he and his firm could go under now though six million dollars in hard silver coin could be his salvation his banks share was to be a fifth of the total charged against his holdingslands future crops outstanding planters loans or warehoused goodsand with that money he would be solvent again for a few more years at least his loans could be repaid in coin for a change he could loan more or maurepas quietly mused taking another sip of brandy and picking up the letters to reread them he leaned far back in his chair with his brandy glass resting atop his substantial paunch all would come aboard a single undistinguished fast ship from veracruz one not too obvious as a treasure ship nor one so grand as to draw the attention of any prowling british man of war or privateer nor the freeroving socalled privateers of other nations soldiers would be aboard of course a full company drawn from a trustworthy regiment based in new spain a navy crew to be provided skilled gunners both letters cautioned that the shipment was a matter of strict confidence that upon receipt and perusal of the letters they were to be handed back to the governorgeneral and that any idle mention outside his firm could result in harsh punishment etc hmmm maurepas further mused a sly grin creasing the corners of his eyes and lips hmmm again aloud this time a fast ship was it and undistinguished a shallowdraughted one he thought most likely so it could ascend the river quickly and cross the bars near fort balise without the risk of unloading all or a part of the cargo thus exposing it to greedy prying eyes guarded by a trustworthy company of soldiers well that was a wry jape the local garrison was made of weary jaded placeservers and halfilliterate peasant clods half the original spaniards had run off or died replaced with neerdowells too lazy to work an honest trade so what would a regiment in new spain consist of a few hidalgo fops as officers a few grizzled overaged sergeants and the rankandfile mostly localborn mestizos even indios straight from the bean fields still jabbering away in nahuatl or some other savage language illtrained illclothed poorly led and indifferently armed crowded elbow to elbow and at sea for the first time in their lives perhaps shed not be a royal galleon perhaps not even a fast frigate what did the letter say how did it phrase it ah manned by a crew drawn from the marina real the spanish didnt dare send one of their few valuable warships to sea afraid of drawing too much attention fearful of losing it and neither tampico nor veracruz were good harbours for ships of worth new spain mexico lay far to the west down at the bottom of the caribbean s and the gulfs prevailing winds henri maurepas knew though he had never been a sailor he knew that much a squarerigged ship could spend weeks beating windward to the mouths of the mississippi a brigantine barkentine or schooner would be more weatherly hmmm maurepas pondered whether he should tell the de guilleris about this this punishing war could last for years and years and spanish colonies would continue to suffer as spain grew even weaker less able to defend her american possessions what guarantee was there that all the local trade would not be american in five years the united states and the british had designs on louisiana already could his bank survive an invasion by either even if by some miracle a french fleet and french army fought its way through the british blockade sailed upriver and reclaimed them what surety could he have that the radical directory in paris and all their jacobin rabblerousing sentiments would be amenable to money to rich men like him now if he had all six million secretly cached at his plantation and only tapped now and again for working capital he could easily explain its partial presence as betterthanaverage fortune due to his conservative and sagacious business sense and he already knew all there was to know how to make things look legitimate on paper well not all of it if he told the de guilleris and those oafs lanxade and balfa and they actually succeeded in taking it hed have to go shares would not realise more than the fifth that the spaniards originally intended his bank to have but that would be dollars more than any of his competitors and all of it free and clear of pledged assets and sureties such a windfall was certainly nothing to sneer at and finally could such a sudden shower of money actually create a real rebellion result in a real reunion with beloved france henri maurepas shudderingly hopefully wondered laclos venez ici sil vous plait he called out oui msieur his reliable longtime aide asked from the door these letters from the captaingenerals how did they come the usual post clerk brought them msieur with all the rest the same as any letter laclos maurepas pretended to gasp well oui msieur why well see about that maurepas answered with a deep scowl he shot to his feet shouting for his liveried slave those hapless idiots i shall be at the cabildo laclos giving them a piece of my mind at how slipshod they are what a wonderful pretence that would be maurepas thought as his liveried slave handed him his hat gloves and cane he would hand the letters over as instructed but would fume that theyd lain on someones desk overnight able to be read by just about anyone if not his then what of the letters sent to his competitors hah if anything happened to their precious consignment of silver it would be all their fault meanwhile back at the pension capt alan lewrie rn sensed a slight buzzing noise round his head and idly swept one free hand to shoo the pesky flying thingy which herculean effort woke him just long enough to take note that it was a good hour past dawn and a slit of honest sunshine blazed in the gap in the nearest window draperies that he could for once sleep in like the idlest civilian ever born and that his lips were dry yet his bottom pillow was damp with drool and stuffily warm he rolled over cramming the cooler top pillow under his head with his face towards a dark corner not that demanding daylight and for good measure both smacked his lips and essayed breaking a bit of wind mildly eased and with gritheavy eyelids the bold adventurer drifted off once more to what he deemed a damned wellearned rest at the grander much more spacious de guilleri city residence charite finished packing her rakish seagoing piratical mens clothes in a single heavy sailcloth bag and drew the rope strings taut knotting it to keep it shut a second change of clothing to be worn on the trip down bayou barataria was already laid out on the bed this one consisting of a rough ecru shirt and a nondescript skirt of dark blue cotonnade a short decorated carmagnole vest and a gardesoleil a sun bonnet cotton knee stockings and her wellpolished boots stood by the foot of her bed though she might go in disguise as a backcountry woman riding in a pirogue charite would be damned if she would squish and slop through bayou and swamp muck barefooted at capt balfas vacherie she could change into her pirates rig damn what the backward local women thought of it her smallsword sash dagger and pistols were cleaned and oiled the pair of smaller pocket pistols already loaded but not primed with tompions in the muzzles to keep out the damp her slim poignard that shed strap to her left forearm she had honed to razor sharpness for the rest of her last day in new orleans though more feminine things awaited her a highwaisted gown of the brightest cornflower blue that almost matched her eyes one that fell straight without the aid of confining corsets one with an only slightly daring scooped neckline puffy shoulder flounces and tight sleeves with it was a wide straw bonnet adorned with gay ribbons and flowers and the tiny matching silk parasol with which to flirt white silk stockings and cunning little slippers dyed dark blue even if heeled common shoes were better suited to the perpetual slime of new orleans streets she had finished her toilette seated in front of her dressing table had lotioned powdered and pampered her face neck and shoulders before carefully daubing on the minimum of makeup allowed the genteel daughters she crimped and brushed her lashes though to nigh the bold look of the demimonde for she was not yet a matron and frankly did not think that she could ever submit to such a stolid and boring childridden propriety not til their grand design had borne fruit charite stood before her cheval mirror and unlaced the ties of her sheer dressing gown then tossed it towards her bed she slid her palms down her sides to her waist over a tightlaced bustier atop a thinly woven chemise turning slightly to either side to appreciate her slim and youthful body lifting her hands under her breasts as if to press them together for a deeper cleavage she smiled and blew herself a teasing kiss as she shifted both feet a bit more apart lowering her rapt gaze to her slim and shapely thighs revelling in recalling how shed wrapped those fine legs about that coquinthat rascal alan willoughby looking up into her own eyes again she tried out a sultry smouldering pout non non she whispered giggling discarding that passionate look for a wideeyed innocent comehither all but biting her lip in trepidatious desire better oh la she chuckled before making a crosseyed face and sticking her tongue out at herself hunh was her black mamans sour comment you hush charite told her rewarding her maidservants sauce with another crosseyed tongueshot and dont tell me theyll stay crossed if i keep that up push me into my gown she stood patiently to be gowned shod tucked laced and adjusted to be adorned with earrings and matching necklace swaying from one foot to another and crooning to herself sleepyeyed but her head cocked in wonder at her own beauty as she was rigged out for the day became an adorable desirable perfection before her very own eyes one more time a little shopping a delicious dinner and a few glasses of wine some coy flirtations with her lashes parasol and laced fan with the town swains of her acquaintance perhaps a former lover or two punctuated with the pouty tale of being summoned upcountry for a family gathering on one of their plantations to explain her and her brothers absence it would be more a necessary chore than her usual pleasurable stroll and sampling of her beloved citys treasures they would depart after full dark taking a closed coach to the nearest boat landing on bayou barataria and then it might be weeks of enforced solitude aft in a wellguarded cabin aboard le revenantthe celibacy of an ursuline nun or capuchin monksurrounded by swaggeringly masculine sailors hmmm fetch me pen paper and ink maman charite ordered suddenly impishly inspired i must write someone a note she consulted her tiny cunningly wrought timepiece it was not yet nine in the morning would alan willoughby still be slugabed or was he the sort to be out and doing at the crack of dawn she wondered a note to his pension or would it better serve to be sent to panton leslies shore establishment hah both just to make sure chapter twentytwo an th top o th mornin to ye capm sor toby jugg said with a jovial tone to his voice and a sham tug of his forelock as if making salaam to an asian potentate or a poor irish crofter to his landlord an wot a foin mornin hit be at all an at all oh pack it in mister jugg lewrie replied with a groan and a weary scowl tis too foin a morning for your jack sauce have you seen mister pollock yet come an gone sor in a bit of a dither jugg informed him as lewrie hefted the teapot off the candlewarmer in the panton leslie shore warehouse offices there seemed enough to make a cup so lewrie poured himself a mugfull hoping for the best did he say whatd dithered him then lewrie asked making a face at the bitterness of the tea despite a liberal admixture of two spoonfuls of sugar and a hefty dollop of cream borryed dempsey an mannix said he needed eyes tdo some watchin an loped off sor jugg said taking a sniff of the teapot and slinging what was left out onto the cobbled street to start a new one desmond furfy an tothers are keepin their eyes on th americans an th yankee doodlesre keepin an eye on us too sor at lout cross th street sor been strollin back an forth th better part of an hour an about wore is eyes out lookin in th same shop windows each lap he makes lewrie flung his mug of tea into the street taking the time to peer at the buckskinned raccooncapped watcher who spun suddenly on his heels and took an intense interest in the creaking overhead signboards that jutted out from the storefronts clumsy buggers they is sor jugg said with a faint snicker liam said some o their lads skulkin round th town forts was so obvious they might as well been carryin surveyors rods well pray god our lads are better skulkers lewrie breathed though i rather doubt it th local cuffiesre best sor jugg said spooning tea from the unlocked caddy into the pot then turning to stoke the fire so he could get a fresh batch of water to a boil i spect ye niver took a bit o notice that a slave followed ye all th way here capm nor did th yankee feller who trailed ye take note o him neither jugg pointed out with a droll wink they what lewrie responded with an urge to go eep or run out into the street and search for his pursuers where so many of em they blend in damn well they do sor jugg almost chortled whod spot one cuffy in a crowd when new orleans is et up with thousands of em and most as alike as peas in a pod sor to th likes o us anyways lewrie had sauntered down to the streets after shaving a sponge bath and a change of clothing completely oblivious to anyone lurking or following him he couldnt recall being stalked on his way to a hearty breakfast all the way to the warehouse and store he had idly ambled savouring the sights tastes and smells and hadnt suspected a blessed thing even if jugg took him by the hand and led him to his trailers he doubted if he could remember seeing them mere minutes before and that shameful lack of awareness gave him cause to shiver with dread lewrie could understand the competing americans tailing him but had the spanish authorities sicced watchers on him and his men had they tumbled to his true identity at least were not at war with the yankees lewrie thought out loud theyre up to no good for certain but it aint all directed at us thank god and for toby jugg of all people to enlighten him that nettled him too the cuffy though he might be a spanish spy and that is a danger amen tthat capm sor jugg gloomily agreed though i beggin yer pardon an all capm lewrie but it dont seem tme a don would trust a cuffy tdo his spyin not a blueskin slave cuffy even a fancy bright in livry such works fer freeborn spaniards mostlike clerks an soldiers an such sor ese creole frenchies they aint quite as cruel an haughty with th blacks as th dons are even do they own most o th slaves here bouts so you think the black watchersve been sicced on us by the local frog creoles for some reason then jugg lewrie speculated with one eye screwed nigh shut in a quizzical expression perhaps our pirates who got wind of our presence somehow atd make th most sense aye sor jugg cagily answered in faint amusement could be one o mister pollocks competin traders done it but theres no way o tellin not without we grab one of em an make him talk like that sounds like a good idea lewrie said perking up at the idea of doing something to forward their endeavour and to atone for his blissful blindness in the streets lets take a stroll get one of them to follow us somewhere quiet then grab the misrable bastard and wring it out of him aye we could couldnt we sor jugg mused aloud scratching his chin whiskers in sly delight might be wed have need o furfy oner two tother lads tkeep watch fer us block im in from ahind the kettle came to a boil and began to rattle its lid claiming their immediate attention they were british well english on the one hand irish on the other and a fresh pot of tea could bring even bloody donnybrooks to a temporary halt lewrie saw to the teapot as jugg took up the kettle with a filthy towel to guard his hands so he could pour boiling water over the fresh leaves the second thing to claim their interest was the arrival of one of those aforementioned black slaves this one in a muted livery with a short white sidecurled wig on his head and a letter in his hand i ave ze letter fo a capitaine weel uh weelo thatd be me willoughby lewrie announced and the neatly garbed house servant left off trying to puzzle out the odd name on the outside of the folded letter and handed it over his hand remained out in silent demand oh lewrie said clawing into a trouser pocket for local coin whatever denomination of peseta or peso he produced wasnt the liveried servant s going rate it seemed for the fellow heaved a weary sigh all but made an audible sniff of disdain but closed his palm over it and stalked away can you follow him mister jugg i could give it a go sor aye cautiouslike good cause i dont know him or his livery from adam and as for whod send me a letter if it aint pollock lewrie muttered as he broke the stillwarm wax seal one without any identifying impression stamped into it of either aristocratic crest or the initial of the senders surname and read it quickly well damme aint mister pollock sor jugg asked mystified by lewries sudden elation er no jugg lewrie gruffly told him from a lady but a lady whose servant you must follow all the way home if youre able thatd be th one wot dresses like a man then sor jugg enquired slyly blandfaced and innocently hiding his droll simper well the one who claims she knows rich men who want their own ships jugg lewrie sternly retorted and mostlike arent that choosy over how they get em her names charite bonsecours but i dont know if thats quite true after talking to mister pollock i need to know as much about her as i can if she does lead us to the people who back our pirates pollocks trying too but we cant trust to him alone we leave this place abandoned then sor ill leave pollock a note lewrie impatiently stated nettled again by juggs impertinent quibblings were to dine at a place name of de russys he said referring to her note round one plenty of time for pollock to get here and get caught up speaking of you dawdle much longer that slavell be out of sight jugg arrah then sor aye aye jugg reluctantly responded as if he wished to dispute being sent on a fools errand but did put knuckles to his brow in salute before sloping off damn the man lewrie fumed to himself his eyerollin impertinence too like i dont know what im about and he knows best if the spanish were alerted to their mission were keeping eyes on him and his people today he must take a chance and rush things with charite press her on her mystifying offer of a ship and get her to introduce him to those rich men shed boasted of knowing pollockll have a fit lewrie decided as he quickly wrote a note to the man on a tornout ledger page press charite for her address so lean write her whilst im gone hah call on her and her lordly creole family bet thatd make em dance a pretty jig he warned pollock that he suspected that hed been followed by whom well that was the question was it not despite the risks he felt it necessary to keep his outwardly innocent appointment with the girl with no one to watch his back despite the risk of arrest as a british spy lewrie found that he was vibrating with excitement like to jump out of his skin there was a tiny frisson of dread of course but the girl was the real lure maddeningly outlandish and entrancing so desirable would they have another long afternoon bout of the needful lewrie pegged his note where pollock was sure to find it then impatiently drew out his pocket watch to check the time his dinner appointment was two hours off and the tea leaves had steeped so he poured himself a fresh bracing cup and forced himself to sit down and sip it fretting over just how he would frame his questions how subtle hed have to be if charite knew the people who financed the piracy did she know more than she let on about their business too damme lewrie muttered of a sudden my cundums hed have to rush back to his set of rooms and fetch them now they were freshwashed and lightly oiled before with luck all dozen he fretted i bloody hope so chapter twentythree he had been forced to pace and stew in front of the restaurant she had named de russys for charite had been coquettishly and coyly late but more than worth the wait once she had turned a corner and had sashayed up to him her tiny parasol spinning flirtatiously and her blue eyes aglow with both impishness and delight as intriguing as she was when garbed as a young gentleman when properly gowned as a young lady she was a vision of femininity dinner had taken the better part of two hours with light and mostly innocent and inconsequential conversation though lewrie did get a chance to suggest that he wasnt long for new orleans if pollock had his way she had expressed regrets over that news but her innuendos promised both a grand sendoff on his trading expedition and a hearty welcome upon his swift return hidden meanings crossed her features along with halflidded girlish innocence mixed with part sultry seductress and delayed wanton abandon making him squirm on his chair he trusted to her taste let her have her head when it came to the menu that charite almost knew by heart a thin and tepid celery broth had resulted just right for a warmish tropical day then a zesty crabmeat remoulade followed by a palatecleansing mixed green salad fresh from the lake pontchartrain garden plots that had gotten them ready for grilled shrimps as big as his thumbs and lemony seafood crepes that contained a meaty fish melange and sauce that was heavenly from the first hot bite to the last cooled forkful lastly had come a syrupy sweet trifle sort of pudding lush with local oranges so many wild oranges grew thereabouts so he was amusingly told that the local farmers fed most of them to their hogs which made for a succulent sunday ham my last fine meal aussi cher alain she sadly imparted for i must leave the city and go visit my papa and maman upcountry i hope i do not have to stay as long as easter but certainly i should be back about the time you come back from the wild indians if they do not scalp you n estce pas she giggled then quickly went serious reaching her fingertips to touch the back of lewries hand i will pray earnestly that they do not for you have such a fine head of hair mon cher and the savages have such horrid habits when it comes to shearing white people of their hair and their other things hein she teased with a fetching blush and grin i do believe i would miss them all equally oh la laddition will you take care of it cher then we shall go for a stroll it will be good for your liver nothing wrong with my liver charite lewrie had said claiming intimacy with the use of her christian name in public to which she made no prim objections oh you english you do not understand how important ones health depends on la digestion and proper care for ones liver she teased look at your john bull so choleric and pastyfat so full of nothing but roast beef and beer no wonder he is always so red in the face hein a long walk did you intend then lewrie had wondered aloud oh lazybones charite fondly teased him if not a long stroll you have another healthful exercise in mindpeutetre hmmm he leered oh oui charite squealed plus vite plus fort mon etalon and lewrie gladly obliged picking up his pace and slamming his groin against her firm and springy young buttocks the taut bedropes supporting the mattress groaned and skreaked the wooden bedstead parrotsquawked at its joins and lewrie himself groaned panted and uttered triumphal steerlike grunts as he thrust as she commanded harder and faster certainly not deeper for he was already sheathed up to the hilt in her upraised kneeling body charite clawed the pillows the sheets face pressed into a pillow now and then when her pleasure made her squawl out loud shudder then writhe and thrust back against him like a maddened serpent grunting and lowing like a heifer being taken by a rutting bull her grunting a counterpoint to his that increased in fury and urgency til ahahh she screamed i go i go so mon dieu a moment later it was lewrie who threw back his head roaring incoherently as he burst in her like a flaming carcassshell jerkily thrusting through the last melting moments til he had to rock back on his heels and gasp for air dragging her back with him his grasp firm on her soft sweatycool hips charite still sobbing with ecstacy but as if in need of yet even more shuffled back to him quickly on palms and knees to half squat splayed wide across his lap rocking up and down to either side petulantsounding to milk the last frissons of sensation from him to keep him pressed hard against her innermost flesh he slid his hands up to cup her breasts from behind wrap his arms about her and hold her close to his heaving chest her arms took hold of his to keep him there her head weakly lolling on his chest formidable so formidable mon amour she barely croaked you are indeed sweetun he responded muttering huskily in her damp mane of hair some of which stuck to his mouth vraiment you have lied to me she accused suddenly hah lewrie gawped stiffening in shock you can speak french when you care to charite chuckled only enough to get in trouble dear he laughed greatly relieved that her plaint was harmless to further distract her he slid a hand down her sleek stomach and belly to her thatch playfully twining his forefinger in her lovematted hair flirting even lower round her clitoris where his member was still sheathed inside her making her roll her head moan and giggle i am split i am ruined forever charite vowed in a weak whisper zut she cursed a second later as lewrie limply slithered from her at last matteroffactly without shame she flung herself forward to the headboard and piled pillows rolled over face upwards and swiped her damp hair from her forehead with her fine slim legs still wide apart knees slightly raised as if welcoming another romp before sunset or suppertime lewrie shuffled forward to recline alongside her admitting to himself that he might not be the allnightin corinthian he had been in his wilder twenties after four blissful bouts he was just about utterly spent and a longish nap wouldnt exactly go amiss he snaked an arm under her neck and about her shoulders getting no closer for a bit as they lay there and genteelly glowed perspired on the nearly soaking sheets you will miss me among the savages mon alain she pressed at last rolling to her side to face him propped up with a hand under her head desperately ma cherie he earnestly nigh honestly vowed rolling his head to look at her and seeing her impish expression and you et vous et tu alain charite amusedly insisted not the impersonal vous but the intimate tu mon etalon she stroked a hand over his hot chest a fingertip circling his nearside nipple your stallion hey he chuckled feeling risible after all as she teased ah oui the stallion le plus puissant you spoil me for after you the most powerful what man could ever compare mon amour charite said frowning for a second and lowering her eyes as if she had said the wrong thing had come close to reminding him that other lovers had existed would exist in the future then id best hurry back to new orleans before you run across a better lewrie suggested tongueincheek so we can have days and days like this days and nights early mornings the crack of dawn oh la i tempt you so much you would surrender all your other lovers for me alain she asked trying to be light but with a slight edginess in her voice as if his reply actually mattered hah what other lovers he barked with laughter damme if you havent spoiled me dye know if i had one or a round dozen a wife in evry port id toss em all off a cliff aye charite you are sans pareil lovely passionate abandoned maddening there ye see another french phrase we keep this up ill parler she rolled half atop him embraced him twined with him and bestowed a dozen fond kisses to reward such gallantry oh pooh she said after suddenly breaking away pouting very prettily and desirably it would all end in tears i could not have an anglais lover you are not even catholique a heretic protestant bloody born and bred to kill the french and catholics never not in a thousand years could you be acceptable what papa and maman would say my brothers well dont they say that love conquers all lewrie jested oh we marry and i am disinherited charite huffed though still pressed against him up on her elbows i must go to a british seaport as your kept woman your wife when you admit that you cannot even keep yourself zut putain well nobody said lewrie began daunted by her intensity and then you give me babies charite further fantasised one hand flying in objection as if swatting flies and after a few i am the fat dull matrone and you take your pleasures elsewhere kein i become hideous to you non i wish never to be a matrone no matter how grand the man there is so much more to life certain i wish to do more with my life than marry breed and die anonymously alain well think youre famous he essayed much confused even so charite said her heat evaporating as she turned pensive and lay down atop him again her head on his shoulder and her voice muffled against his neck i would have your babies alain i would be your belle amie just so long as i am the only one she concluded with a mockfierce nip at his earlobe and when you are among the indians you do not take a lover there well i might be more among the yankee doodles than indians lewrie said yelping as if really nipped and playfully wrestling with her til he had her under his weight her wrists pinned by his hands oh they are even worse she snarled wriggling and thrashing how fair could they be in their homespun junk and all muddy barefeet lewrie snickered feeling even more risible as she squirmed most fetchingly under him belly to belly even pinioned as she was you wouldnt trust me out of your sight would you would you i thought so youd have me clerking for pollock here in new orelans all ink blots and smudges on my nose in a countinghouse instead of adventuring no you can have your adventures alain she insisted just so you come back to me often always she softly fondly added but what could i do to earn a living if i dont go venturing for panton leslie lewrie innocently asked thinking it about time to try to dredge some information from her i told you cher learn the river trade from your adventures prove yourself then meet with those wealthy men i mentioned who wish to own their own ships before the americans control all the shipping trade charite reiterated turning still between his thighs if you wish to begin at once i could introduce you to monsieur maurepas the banker he is in touch with oh im alors putain i cannot you must go upriver i must go to my parents plantations it will be weeks and weeks before i could introduce you properly theres a name tconjure with lewrie silently exulted to hear one of pollocks suspicions almost confirmed though he is many of his associates charite hemmed and hawed writhing beneath him as if spurred more by dread than pleasure they are proud creoles alain tu comprends f french creoles who hate the spanish subjugation and wish to be a part of la belle france once more france is strong and spain is weak and they believe that someone must save them before the americans or you bloodies eat us up she spelled out for him though turning the traditional epithet for englishmen to a joke instead of a taunt you must be careful in your dealings with them mon coeur before one of them spins out some fanciful dream about revolution against spain oh how do you english say to she asked frustrated take it with a grain of salt dye mean love he chuckled dye mean that one or a lot of em might want me to smuggle arms start a louisiana navy turn privateer or some such and take spanish prizes bein a former naval officer might tempt em damme that was knacky of me he quietly chortled perhaps i can do subtle oui with the grain of salt vraiment charite quickly agreed but youre happy enough under the spanish he further asked mon amour i am most happy this moment under you she teased with a coquettish stirring under him mais non the spanish such a horrible set of tyrants and so bad for trade as well everyone i talk to says so papa monsieur maurepas our factors if i were a man would be tempted to do something rash to rid louisiana of any taint of spain even their idms when i met you you came close to being a man lewrie pointed out though thank god you arent most surely arent he said sliding down her so he could kiss her nipples and circle her areolae on the tip of his tongue she knows more than she wants ttell me lewrie furiously schemed her papas in on it ill wager maybe even her brothers damme have i already met em two nights ago they were aliso alike and oh la alain charite said sounding as if she was mournfully wailing in exasperation at mens folly i fear if someone gave you a chance to fight do what you were trained for you would leap for joy and turn pirate if you thought it would be grand adventure and paid enough men mon dieu she spat in a flouncing huff something in what ye say charite darlin he frankly seemed to confess breaking off his teasing ministrations to look her in the eyes i never did get many opportunities to swashbuckle boring blockade work in all weathers paper wars and ink smuts boresome hellishboresome most of my undistinguished naval career was but i doubt id really do anything that damn fool bon she approved with some heat good not til they promised id be an admiral lewrie cagily japed not til it looked like itd succeed look at john paul jones that yankee doodle catherine the great of russia made him an admiral over her whole fleet why theres been dozens of ambitious royal navy men taken service under foreign colours some with the admiraltys connivance and blessings too who didnt look like theyd ever make senior postcaptain in their own service the swedes even made me an offer not much of one but he added with a deprecatory shrug suddenly inspired to feel her out even farther not a command actuallynot a ship of my own arsenal clerking counting cannon barrels or some such i turned em down and tried for merchant service where id at least be at sea he lied you would be tempted charite stated peering closely at him not in the expected disapproval at such insanity that she had evinced just moments before but in a speculative calculating weighing of his sentiment with the faintest hint of a smile touching the corners of her mouth and eyes as if hed said or done something clever well if they threw you in he japed shrugging again and forcing an inane grin onto his phyz to quash her slightest suspicions oh la oh zut alors mon chou charite suddenly snapped as she turned forceful in her attempts to slide out from underneath him the hour it is growing dark and i must go oh damme no lewrie said with a crushed groan surely you could stay for a little longer darlin just a quarter hour more he entreated gone all pleading puppyeyed he sat up though rocked on his heels once more as she lithely sprang down from the high bedstead au naturel as boldly bare as shed been born fetching her discarded chemise off the back of a nearby chair and wriggling it down over her head damme we were almost there too he thought this close to lace me up cher she asked clapping her undone bustier to her chest perkily impishly smiling i must be home quickly what if i wont lewrie pretended to pout then i must walk home as undone as a whore and i will blame you for it mon chou she threatened and there will be two dozen challenges to duels slipped under your door she added cocking her head at the doorway to his set of rooms well as we said in the navy growl you may but go you must damme he cried springing naked off the bed he seized her burying his face in the hollow of her neck i simply cannot get enough of you me girl nor i you cher alain she conceded but i leave in the morning you go upriver in a few more days so we must part sometime only for a little while mon amour i promise how do you say that a parting is somethingsomething she crooned embracing him with her fingers caressing his head and his hair against her as if to give comfort a short absence absence makes the heart grow fonder lewrie recited lifting his head to swing her length against his nudity ill make you a newun tgo along with that too brief partings make rencontres all the sweeter and urgent yearnings the passion even fiercer hmm you just made that up aye you are a rare englishman with the romantic soul of a true frenchman charite admiringly declared are you certain you werent born french quickened in holland but born in london son of a penniless rogue and a disinherited heiress dammit all lewrie snickered no matter mon anglais charite said wideeyed and serious all but biting her trembling lips as she bestowed the sweetest little kiss on his mouth forje taime alain mon chou je taime darlin lewrie gasped stunned right down to his curling toes by her sudden declaration of love not intimate fondness but her true love wondering what the devil to do with it but when in doubt lie like blades lewrie told himself it surely wont cost me much and she might even halfway believe it je taime aussi ma cherie ma petite biche he growled in reply his forehead pressed to hers you darlin little doedeer i adore you too evry lovely inch of you well that seemed tmake her happy he thought as they embraced even tighter and despite her protestations it did lead to a frantic tumble back onto his bed and one more glorious feverishly passionate romp spare cundums her expensive chemise the lateness of the hour her family or societys expectations bedamned oh make him happy charite told herself at the same time men so easy to entrance and enlist he will aid us forme and it will be pleasurable for both of us and he is so adorable i think i truly am falling in love well perhaps i could it was well past seven in the evening when he handed her down to the street and walked her the short block from bourbon street up rue ste anne to rue dauphine where she insisted that they must part at last now on public view their behaviour had to be most circumspect and formally courteous lewrie gallantly doffed his hat and swept it across his chest was just about to make a leg in conge she about to drop him a brief curtsy and elegant incline of her head in parting as well when it suddenly struck him that he still hadnt plumbed the matter of her address hed had other things on his mind when i return and wish to see you again how do i reach you he asked suddenly where do i send my best regards to mademoiselle charite she seemed to stumble for a moment before resuming her gay coquettish airs write me at la maison gayoso twentysix rue dauphine not mademoiselle bonsecours lewrie pressed hat in hand and shamming amiable fond confusion our concierge will see that i get it charite attempted to explain for one brief instant almost snippish with him before relaxing into her customary air of flirtatiousness my parents and family for now mon chou for only a while longer just my given name please until you are well settled in new orleans nestce pas well he quibbled shuffling from one foot to another and you will keep your lodgings while you are upriver alain she asked with a disarming smile when i return i may write to you there no ill lewrie flummoxed considering that he would mostlike never see her again that his secret doings would be finished by the time she got back to the city then hit upon a sudden inspiration when i come back i expect tbe much richer and ill take a grander appartement not a low single room where i may entertain you in proper splendour and discreet privacy hmm oh you could pick it for me choose it and help me furnish it to our ah our mutual satisfaction he said with the suitable anticipatory leer try the panton leslie offices first though and ill come running aye feather a nest he smugly thought women just adore that je tadore charite cooed under her breath her eyes glowing under the brim of her fashionable bonnet and the parasol carried over her shoulder spinning in delight but of course i shall be more than happy to help and i shall be distraught every day that we are apart alain mon coeur til then though alas she said with a tremble of her lip and a forlorn hitch of her shoulders and a heartfelt gulp in her voice au revoir mon cher alain trust that i do love you madly and i you charite as mad as a hatter as a march hare he declared english sayings ill explain them all to you soon you will have to she chuckled soon le plus tot possible mon amour as soon as possible my love again au revoir a slim hand gloved in lace net almost reached out for him but she remembered her distinguished place in creole societyin public at leastand dropped him a slow and graceful curtsy that elegant incline of her head then she was gone in a trice rising and spinning away down dauphine without a backward glance as if all ther fervent day had never transpired lewrie shrugged to himself and turned away as well clapping his hat back on his head and fiddling with his swordcane he walked a few paces back down rue ste anne as if to return to his rooms or to head for the part of town where the most eateries were located but then paused theatrically felt his waistcoat pockets as if he had forgotten something and turned back to lean his head round the corner once hed almost assured himself that no one was watching him a few lamplighters were sluggishly making the rounds with their ladders and port fires igniting the entire hundred some scoffed and said only eighty publicly funded streetlights of which new orleans could boast in the entryways above the high stoops of shops and houses private lanterns were already lit and feebly glowing throwing little pools of light and even deeper skeins of darkness but he could pick her out by the pale colour of her gown the flounces on her hat the nowfurled parasol in her hands as she flitted from one illuminated pool to the next a moment later and shed melted away into an irongated entryway of a blankwalled building close enough lewrie decided thinking that his sauntering past the place would blow the gaffe he would recognise the building again counted it off as the twelfth from his corner on the north side of rue dauphine and from the look of the place at his acute viewing angle it would most likely turn out to be one of the many walledcourtyard appartement houses no more than three storeys above the street but with spacious sets of rooms on all four sides to face the central courtyard eight appartements or twelve he speculated seeing no sign of commercial establishments on the ground floor with their own stabling out back itd be even fewer he deduced ste anne began on the east side of the place darmes the main city square by the riverbank rue st pierre ran down its west side so how did they number their houses outward from the centre the lowest numbers starting on those two streets or from rue de larsenal on the east straight to the west no matter he thought with a sniff she d said number unless she s been lying like a dog right from the start he shrugged again and drew out his pocket watch it was nearly eight long past time for him to hare back to the panton leslie company warehouse offices and catch up with mr pollock to see what hed learned today and proudly impart to him what he had garnered a growl from his innards warned lewrie that it was long past suppertime too frankly he suddenly felt ravenously famished now that the most important items of his activities list were done and he had only the idle spanish to fret about playacting and fucking lewrie happily pondered as he strolled along clacking his cane on the pavement both damn good for buildin an appetite ha ha lewrie you sly dog down ste anne to cross bourbon street then down to rue royale headed for rue charles where he thought he might take a little amble in the place darmes before diving into the commercial jumble round levee road where it was darker poorerlit and the streets narrower filthier and nigh abandoned at this hour the first two thin and muffled shots the twiggish crack crack made him slam to a stop head swivelling to track the confusing echoes that swirled from god knew wherecloser to the river or westward down royale a third crack and by god that was a shot quickly followed by a chorus of harsh shouts and the discharge of a weapon and a keen whine of a ricochet off brick definitely westward down rue royale near st pierre or toulouse lewrie took a hesitant step in that direction recognising the shouts as being made by english speakers his men from proteus or some of pollocks men instinct made him reach under his coat and pull out one of his doublebarrelled manton pistols then spurred him to turn in the direction of the commotion the fourth thin crack was much closer so was the musket ball that droned past his ear and spanged off a wroughtiron balcony pillar with a departing harpys howl inches from where hed stood dithering but an eyeblink before the fifth shot forced him to throw his body flat in one of the tweenlamp pools of gloom chapter twentyfour lewrie feverishly searched for a betraying cloud of spent gunpowder to mark the shooters position but saw nothing he perked his ears for the telltale sounds of a nearby marksman reloading the rattle of powder horn on a muzzle the tinkle of a ramrodnothing he got his feet under him spotted a deep doorway further west down royale popped up and turned as if to dash for it crack a second after he had flung himself down again a ball went zinghumming over his head and lewrie was up and running for the shadowed doorway reaching its shelter and flattening himself against the east side of the vestibule out of sight for a moment as he cocked both firelocks of his manton pistol tore off his wideawake hat and put it on his fisted left hand stuck it out as if fearfully taking a peek and crack came another shot that spun the hat like a top on his fist after the ball had taken a round bite from its brim he swung outhead shoulders and gun hand in plain viewto see the faint gleam of a brightmetal movement laying his gun hand over his left forearm he fired one round absorbing the recoil upwards for a second then levelling again and firing the second barrel towards the slightest vertical glint of lamplight off what he took for a muskets barrel the manton belched two large clouds of blackpowder smoke in which he slithered away low to the pavement in a duckwalk to another deep entryway farther off with his second doublebarrelled manton he fired off a round in the general direction of his last vague target then ducked under the resulting pall and sprinted the short distance to another entryway on the south side of the street this time he heard no more crack aimed against him after a long minute he took note that there were no more shots down rue royale either a loud chorus of shouts and curses aye but no more gunfire he traded the spent manton for one of those singleshot pocket pistols then set off down that way halfway there skulking from one shadow to another it suddenly struck him twigcrack no powder smoke or ramming four shots got off in less than a minute at me he furiously thought brightmetal not treated blue or brown hells bells someones got a girandoni rifle mine arse on a bandbox he seethed aloud i find out who it was ill have his nutmegs off pollocks henhead clerks soldpah he could not go back the way he had been walking that was for certain to attain the relative safety of the evening crowds strolling in the place darmes where one might assume the creoles didnt take potshots at each other all that often even if the shooter was long gone the commotion would surely draw the spanish foot patrol and the idle curious and hed much rather not have to answer their questions or be recognised and recalled later a slight distance more and hed be at the intersection of rue royale and rue dorleans but dorleans deadended behind the impressive cathedral and lewrie could not recall but one narrow alleyway leading to the square where the odds were good that he might reencounter the bastard who had shot at him or meet up with spanish soldiers whod block both ends and delight in questioning or arresting the first foreigner they came across there was nothing for it but to keep on westerly down rue royale at least as far as st pierre to get to the place darmes then levee roadright into the crowd he could see gathering at the scene of the first shooting hed heard at the least lewrie thought he could blend into a much larger crowd and sidle through it with eyes curious and wide playacting an idle gawker hoping that the reek of gunpowder on his person wouldnt be noticed one last desperate and intense study of the intersection he had fled and lewrie shoved his pistol back into hiding under the tails of his coat and he launched himself from the deep doorway swordcane in his right hand once more to peck out a languid pace down towards that hubbub and growing knot of people near rue toulouse hoping that once near there he could turn down st pierre to the square on a welllit and peopled street empty yore hands yew english sumbitch came a harsh whisper from an unlit doorway he had just passed almost in his left ear and chilling him to his bones he felt the prick of something sharp right through his layers of clothes in the small of his back i was shot at too lewrie managed to say though just about as frightened as he had ever been back there at sainte anne street huh came the faceless response with the slightest shove of the sharp object against his skin gimme at swordcane youre american one of mister ellisons men lewrie asked as he let his cane clatter to the cobblestones he winced to think that he hadnt spotted his assailant lurking in the shadows had not got a whiff of his stench as he passed him for up close now the reek of a crudely tanned deerskin hunting shirt or fringed trousers was overpowering damn you a rough hand groped under his coat discovering one of his twinbarrelled pistols lewrie could hear the man sniff the muzzles its just a cane and i shot back at whoever shot at me thats why the lewrie tried to explain insulted to be manhandled yeah shore it is the man sneered theres another manton both barrels fired a pair of pocket pistols too not fired and couldnt hit anything over ten paces if my life depended on it lewrie announced i heard shots rifle shots fired down your way before they shot at me like twigcracks quick together was that how it was down yonder if youre with mister ellison you came aboard the emporium ship with him you saw the austrian sharpshooter rifles the girandoni airrifles thats all of a sound they make a twig crack think man a hand hammered onto his left shoulder to spin him around to face his accostor and his widebladed teninch skinning knife as big to lewries eyes as a scots claymore and he was an american clad in a mix of homespun and leather glaring face and eyes beneath a massive coonskin cap with the mask on with glittering brass beads in its eye sockets winking from the street lamps lights how di know ye didnt have a hand in shootin jim hawk at ye didnt sic some o yore men tdo it the man accused why the devil would i lewrie shot back he doesnt even owe me money caws yore an english spy come here tscout new orleans fore ye take it fer yore own an we got in yore way an iffn jim hawk dies ill draw out yore innards an roast em on a stick right bfore yore eyes an atd be just fer starters he vowed with a feral grin when among the muskogee towards the end of the revolutionary war lewrie had heard of savage tortures so he could not help gulping in dread but and you and mister ellison are here to scout the place so you can take it before we do lewrie retorted but we came to hunt down pirates who stole a rich prize ship from us that ship moored highest upriver of the emporium hulks looking for a large blackhulled and redstriped schooner some of the men with me survived being marooned on the dry tortugas and they could recognise both the schooner and the faces of the pirates thats why were here the only reason i am a postcaptain in his majestys navy unless you and your party had anything to do with the piracy wed have no cause to shoot your leader and how is mister ellison by the way all that truth carefully mixed with lies discomfited the man lewrie could see his fierce glare subdued replaced by a thoughtful but puzzled expression we stand here with your knife drawn much longer man and well draw the spanish watchmen sure as fate lewrie suggested neither side needs that for gods sake keep my damned mantons if you wish but shouldnt we try to blend into that crowd yonder find out how it stands with your mister ellison hmm lewrie gently urged put yore hands down the man growled shoving both of lewries pistols back at him anybody gets caught with fired guns itll be you not me pick up at cane o yorn and well go mind now ill be right at yore back play me false and ill cut yore kidneys out the first frontiersman turned lewrie over to another member of ellisons gang while he went inside the mean tavern to pass on what he had learned lewrie and his guard stood near the door where he could see inside ellison was propped up on a threadbare settee biting his lips grimacing as a creole surgeon worked on him now and then hed let pass a faint groan then take a sip of whisky from a tall tumbler as the surgeon probed and plucked inside a plumpurpled wound high on his right chest they rolled ellison on his side so the surgeon could feel about then use a slim scalpel to excise a rifle ball from under his shoulder blade that forced a cry from him but ellisons torment came out in a battleroar or the snarl of a cornered bear from that incision a shiny calibre ball appeared one that ellison demanded be laid in his palm which plucky courageous geste raised great cheer among his anxious men and even made lewrie feel relief to the creole doctors chagrin whisky was poured right in the raw wound more poured over his needle and thread before theyd let him stitch the lips of the wounds together as he finished his work with generous batts of absorbent cotton and linen wrappings ellison sat up on the settee half reclined on one padded arm he had a long whispered conversation with lewries captor then crooked a finger to summon lewrie to him you got shot at too didjya willoughby ellison muttered with a girandoni airrifle the same as you it appears sir lewrie said pointing to the ball in the mans hand by the spanish mostlike why they didnt just arrest us ive no idea but theyve apparently tumbled to our doings and youre a captain in the british navy are ye mr ellison snidely smirked though wincing against his pain right enough lewrie breezily admitted and you are a serving officer under american colours or in a civilian capacity the army of the united states of america sir ellison admitted temporarily ah detached and were ye happy with yer beach out tlake borgne captain willoughby itll serve mainwell mister ellison lewrie confessed once he got over his surprise and your improvised river fleet he asked taking a stab in the dark much shorter distance to go im bound hah got it in one lewrie hooted to himself to see ellisons chagrined expression in his shoes thats how id pull it off i dont think ye had a hand in my shootin sir ellison told him but the spanish sink their teeth inta things theyll not care fer

meanin neither i nor my men were responsible sir pon my word of honour and my name is alan lewrie not willoughby so youll know who to damn do i prove false lewrie declared i sincerely regret your

that picturesque american wordskedaddle before the spanish find theyve failed thats my lookout ellison said retrieving his hand yours is th spanish and us luck to ye captain lewrie fer youre quite a plucky bastard but dont let yer string o luck run out goodbye sir skedaddle yer own self and adieu lewrie took that for as good an exit line as any and turned to shoulder his way through the anxious throng of hostile americans for the door thence to the far side of rue toulouse was just about to leave the vicinity by heading for rue chartres when a spanish patrol finally made its appearance he casually turned on his heel leaned on his cane and got on tiptoe to see over the crowd of onlookers as if he was just another curious ogler kentuckians lewrie sneered to no one as the hastily dressed soldiers shoved their way through the back of the crowd tennessee trash ought to run em all back to their kennels deal with that hint do lewrie fervently thought at the back of the spanish officer as he got to the door of the tavern and take that mister jim hawk ellison of the united states army now if i can only get back to the docks before the dons try t kill me again ill be a damned happy man chapter twentyfive lew willoughby mr pollock barked as soon as hed entered the dockside warehouse offices where the devil have you been weve been beating the bounds for you the last two ive been out getting shot at actlly lewrie drawled as if such happened daily me and that yankee ellison both and nigh the same instant two ambushes though ellison got the worst of his anything to drink he asked tossing his hat on a table drawing his spent pistols from underneath his coat and peering about for fresh powder ball wadding and wine liam desmond fetched him a glass of vin ordinaire which lewrie tossed down in three gulps shot at pollock gawped how when by whom why with an airrifle mister pollock lewrie scathingly replied halfway to here from my lodgings not a quarter hour past with an airrifle your clerks sold someone so was that american ellison saw the ball they cut from him fiftyone calibre i told him that we didnt do it that it mustve been the dons unless you ordered it and i lied to him unwittingly either way theyve tumbled to us and said were we still here come dawn hit wuz katy bar th doer or some such lewrie said in sarcastic imitation you didnt set up an ambush of ellison and his men did you mister pollock didnt sell the americans any girandonis they mightve used to potshot me didnt sell a few to the dons did you he cynically demanded no to all of it sir pollock retorted as if such nefarious doings were beneath him youre certain it was girandonis used damned certain mister pollock lewrie vowed crossing to the sideboard for a refill from the wine carafe as he poured the hinges of the door squeaked and toby jugg and seaman furfy came tumbling in oh there ye be sor jugg said sounding relieved for a rare moment before turning laconic once more twas a spate o shootin a little while ago big commotion round th tavern where them yankees lodge captain lewrie tells us someone shot their leader mister jugg pollock gloomily informed him took shots at the captain too whod want both of us dead sir lewrie asked the spanish someun shot at th capm furfy barked roundeyed in alarm hesh yourself an listen lad his mate desmond chid him i cant see the spanish pollock fretted nervously chewing on a thumbnail tis not their way theyve more to gain by arresting us and holding public trials the old firm and i live or die on their stance towards us and i havent heard the least rumour felt the faintest stiffness in how they deal with us not even the slightest sidelong glance especially on this trip given the ah ahem well if the dons didnt do it and the yankees swear it wasnt them lewrie posed with a grim frown then who our pirates maybe more likely than the spanish yes pollock agreed something we did or said our presence revealed somehow to them put the wind up them perhaps they recognised mister jugg and put two and two together lewrie wondered looking at the survivor of the marooning almost accusingly then why the devil didnt they shoot him stead o me i ask you hes the man could point em out and why shoot ellison at the same time far as we know he s not here thunt em down we dont know that pollock countered they seem to prefer spanish victims but the bulk of the merchantmen that dock are yankee ships they carry desirable imports and fat chests of coin that buy new orleans s export goods if the pirates had taken one of theirs ellisons a temporarily seconded american army officer lewrie told him we both ah admitted our bonafides said he hoped that we liked our dinner tother day out by lake borgne sir theyve kept us under their eyes almost from the first id expect and he asked did we find the lake shore suitable for our purposes ahha pollock responded like to strangling on that revelation ahem large twitchwhinny did he though two may engage in the same game sir and accomplish two tasks in one as weve been charged perhaps the americans even intend to use the loss of several of their merchantmen as a legitimate casus belli the elimination of a pirates nest as an excuse to the wider world for their invasion this revelation was news to lewries hands who had thought they were merely nabbing pirates whod harmed their mates they nudged and poked each other sharing confused but sly grins after all no one had yet laid out whether they were scotching yankee invasion plans or sketching out their own either one would suit so long as it made for a unique adventure could your firm have unwittingly sold the girandoni airrifles to whoever it was used them tonight sir lewrie asked might your ledgers contain names or your clerks recall faces by god yes pollock chirped excitedly we havent sold that many one had hopes theyd find a market but the novelty mayve then perhaps we might enquire of your clerks tonight sir lewrie impatiently said nigh snarling ill send for my head clerk pollock declared animated now um mister jugg might i impose upon you to row over to the hulk and fetch the fellow here aye sor jugg replied heaving himself off a tables edge in a trice quickern two shakes of a wee lambs tail an th first be aready shook he took the time to jape taking dempsey and mannix to do the heavy work that slave who brought my note lewrie had to ask before they could get out the door did you lost im soons he turned west on dauphine street sor sorry tsay jugg informed him with a hapless shrug then dashed off the ah bonsecours slave sir pollock asked the note you mentioned in your message to me from the suited booted ahem young woman the very same mister pollock lewrie replied pouring himself another glass of wine by the sideboard now that he was safe and alive surrounded by wellarmed men the usual shaky letdown that came nearly to overwhelming him had appeared and he needed some liquid fortification jugg placed her man in dauphine street but i managed to tail her right to her door mister pollock lewrie explained feeling rather slyboots and clever im to write her at the maison gayoso number twentysix rue dauphine no last name for now now whether she really lodges there or merely uses it as a convenience i still dont know but i saw her enter and it didnt look as if theres a handy back exist no stable gate so charite he waited for mr pollock the parttime joblot british spy to offer him at least grudging congratulations for skulking and observing so skillfully but a young lady by name of charite may very well reside there pollock somberly told him holding up an objecting hand but i must inform you that according to my own queries not a single bonsecours dwells on rue dauphine so its an assumed name lewrie said with a crestfallen shrug as if it didnt really signify indeed sir enquiries made by my ah domestics pollock flustered all but tugging at his neckstock which lewrie intuited as nervousness on his part to even come close to admitting that he had a shore wife not a domestic domestics lewrie silently scoffed mine arse on a bandbox is that what theyre calling kept mutton these days hah in point of fact the bonsecours family have no daughter certainly not one named charite prim mr pollock continued looking a tad redfaced to broach the topic of lewries mysterious young chit further captain lewrie they also learned that those young gentlemen who accompanied her your first night at the pigeon coop cabareti recall you mentioning them as the darbone brothers that wouldnt be possible since the darbone familys sons have been upcountry for at least the last month entire my ah people after nosing about the help at the pigeon coop have determined that your girls ah unconventional masquerade her true identity beneath it rather is an open secret among that cabarets habitues as is the identity of her companions sir pollock like all good spies fulltime or amateur paused then bestowing upon lewrie one of those detestable i know something that you dont and you must beg for it looks and lewrie archly demanded after trying to wait him out and not have to beg a losing proposition hed found after years of dealing with old zachariah twigg and his compatriot mr jemmy peel they are all three de guillens pollock almost simpered with a toplofty smugness helio and hippolyte and their sister charite so who are they when theyre up and dressed lewrie offhandedly queried pretending closer interest in his wine wishing to god that this was a private conversation with none of his seamen present to hear him proved a gullible cully again very rich distinguished longtime french creoles whove resided in new orleans fifty years or better mr pollock informed him looking as if he was manfully trying to stifle a look of sympathy for just how easily beguiled and bamboozled capt lewrie could be ah pollock exclaimed snapping his fingers before turning to his ledgers in a bookcase he leafed through one mumbling to himself then hah escaped his lips thought the name was familiar two years ago the de guilleri family placed an order with us for a china service made in paris settings sufficient for twenty guests ah ha well who am i to quibble with legitimate goods first sent to holland for transshipment hmmm delivered to ahem number twentysix rue dauphine ah ha devil of a row with madame de guilleri had to unpack it all to assure her none were broken all were there umhmm they live on the second storey does that comport with what you observed sir well i didnt actlly lewrie had to fuddle didnt get that close peekin round barrels corners and such final payment referred to the aha henri maurepas bank damn my eyes pollock chortled whacking the ledger shut in triumph and where have we heard that name hey lewrie agent for your prize ship cross the river factor for the de guilleri plantations up by the saint gabriel settlements and chief factor for that swindler bistineaus store as well intriguing how all these names cluster together mr pollock asked with a parrotlike cock of his head and a lopsided ghastly smile aint it so she could steer me to the people who back the pirates as she claimed lewrie further intuited taking what comfort he could from being played like a fiddle so i must see her again after she gets back from her easter visit to her parents leaving town are they pollock said wincing in thought for a few weeks at least i told her i was going upcountry on your behalf and we should get together once were both returned lewrie explained though given all youve learned for us we might be able to strike out before a disturbing information though lewrie pollock said with a shushing hand raised once more an oyster shucker and a swabber at the pigeon coop spoken to by my domestics further told them that the younger de guillens and an impoverished cousin of theirs by name of rancourjean rancourseem to have come into some money of late and are spending very freely more so than they did when on their absentee parents allowances at any rate and that the cousin who hasnt had two farthings trub together since his family escaped saintdomingue has been gambling very deep and doesnt seem to mind his losses all that much far be it from me to decide for you on this matter but were i in your position i might begin to whatever it was that pollock wished to impart was interrupted by a soft and hesitant tapping on the glass panes of the office door come pollock cried whipping out his pocket watch as if his head clerk had been fetched in record time for a row cross the rivers fierce currents hah he cried though once the door had opened damme what a vixen lewrie instantly thought seeing a woman enter her beauty and the richness of her ensemble halfconcealed by a light hooded cloak against the misty night airs for a second he could espy a stout older black who remained outside one who held his lanthorn on a pole in one hand and a cudgel in the other bright fancy an octoroon or better lewrie appraised to himself nigh to uttering woof and ruing that he hadnt sampled the towns more exotic females after all what a stunner he further thought as the woman tossed back her hood put in mind of the halfeuropean halfhindoo bints hed seen in the far east with her eyes so almondshaped and a teaspoon away from chinese or something gideon the young woman happily cried out stepping close to him her exotically alluring eyes alight with mischief or a victory certainly with affection which made lewrie think aha to discover mr pollocks closeheld secret at last mon cher you must hear colette ah ahem you shouldnt ah pollock flummoxed blushing hot as a farriers forge mean tsay madame pollock i presume lewrie brightly intruded from the other side stepping forward quickly allow me to name myself to you alan willoughby one of your husbands associates enchante madame the young woman inclined her head preeningpleased to be named madame pollock whether it was a thin fiction or not she offered her hand frenchstyle which lewrie dashingly took sketching a kiss on the back of it mr pollock actually growled as she dropped him a curtsy er um yess pollock hissed my dear this is mens we ave found the girl who meets with monsieur willoughby colette pollock gushed all but bouncing on her toes with excitement maman pardon my maid messieurs finds she is a de guilleri i and scipio our man find where she live oui a bayou saint john boy on is produce cart show us and as we watch you never guess gideon we know dear so pollock patronisingly tried to say the de guilleris they decamp colette protested a washerwoman who work for the dablemonts in the downstairs she say charite come home after dusk dressed tres fine then full dark come both her brothers come home tres rapidement that scipio and i are there to see they have hide guns under their cloaks and we have heard the shooting noises somewhere in town while we wait before christ shit on a biscuit lewrie thought his innards chilling as the implications of that struck him she no it couldnt be soon come two more young gentilshommes with guns aussi with a country coach colette breathlessly imparted almost gulping at her own daring dressed mos rough comme des acadiens like acadians i mean the huntsmen comprenez i ask scipio to go talk with coachman apres young men enter oui and i see them in the upstairs windows gideon et coachman tell scipio they hire him to take ferry over river to the bois gervais road only pay for short trip nestce pas tell him they will take boat down bayous there ensuite pardon then few minute later all come down and enter the coach and la jeune fille mademoiselle charite i am thinking is dressed a la rustique acadian aussi carmagnole bonnet skirted avec the boots all ave long and heavy canvas bag same as sailors the coachman whip away tres rapidement comme un fou like the mad holy god lewrie slowly breathed realising the guilty import of all that pollocks wife had seen damme ive been it would ah so appear sir mr pollock sadly commiserated sounding so earnestly sympathetic lewrie could have gutshot him on the spot if he didnt have a pack of witnesses my god ive been had lewrie scathed himself just about ready to reel off his feet and plunk himself down in a chair how big a fool have i been she was in on it all along she was laughing up her damn sleeve they all were playing me like a piccolo from the you are pale msieur willoughby colette pollock solicitously enquired of his pallor his febrile anxious look his silent lipmumbles and scowl too it must here be noted bloody wonderful lewrie distractedly grunted the tiny bell hung over the office door gave off a gay tinkle and in breezed toby jugg with mr pollocks weedy head clerk in tow one would spose this may be gilding the lily in a manner of speaking ahem pollock began but about our consignment of airrifles mister dollarhyde how many have actually been sold and to whom might you be able to recall locking the barn after the horses have shit some present almost heard capt alan lewrie disgustedly whisper i blieve only a dozen so far mister pollock sir the clerk fussily replied referring to his own ledger book after being told by jugg most likely why he was being summoned cross the river in such a hurry and at that hour one to mister willoughby here sold mine arse it was s posed tbe a gift lewrie thought four taken on by mister whiting for his trading post up at natchez one to a msieur columbe said the local rodents eat up his garden something sinful and the other six to a party of city men and might you have their names available mister dollarhyde pollock impatiently prompted most odd that mister pollock dollarhyde simpered i did a brief demonstration and they placed down payment on four yet not an hour later returned with the money for six and paid in full names ahem pollock harumphed a monsieur monaster don rubio monaster actually he was most insistent on that point really dollarhyde recited looking up from his book for a second one to a monsieur rancour j and the rest to a monsieur de gool de gweel damn all frog names de guillen hah pollock barked uncharacteristically slamming a palm on the top of his desk rancour colette mused aloud gideon is he not a cousin to the de guilleris oui i am thinking he is and don rubio oh la she chuckled looking as if she would fan herself his papa was the spaniard but his maman was the bergrand and they raise him for his poor papa die when he is little killed by the indians he is the tres handsome gentilhomme mos dashing aussi he isow you saythe crack shoot all girls adore him but he only has eyes damn pollock spluttered slamming a fist on the desk this time damnn damn damn gideon cher what as distressed colette asked i must ask you to leave things to us colette pollock gruffly told her youve taken enough risks tonight and theres an end to it scipio will see you safely home i fear we will be discussing our ah business matters far into the night theyd only bore you ahem ill be along soon as im able so why dont you you have done us a great service tonight madame pollock for which we all and im sure i speak for gideon as well lewrie found wit to say are extremely grateful as im certain hell tell you once he joins you at home merci madame merci beaucoup you were very brave and clever if you wont at least give her grudging thanks then i will he sourly thought and why she stays with a clot like you tis a wonder thoughtless churlishand ugly to boot wotd i miss toby jugg whispered to his compatriots who had been present the whole time once clued in he could not help musing aloud now i think upon it sor mongst them atitterin sprogs on at pirate schooner one of em coulda been a girl i fact and ye didn t recall til bloody now ye thickheaded irish bog trotter lewrie silently accused his anger building now that he was over his shock to a sulky but welldeserved pet never thought to even bother mentioning it til damn his blood gideon i do not comprendre colette gasped fingers flying to her lips and paling most fetchingly you speak of pirates but i i thought you merely wish to discover ah so that is why the two capitaines call on the de guilleris the other day what captains pollock cried the washerwoman chez les dablemonts we speak to cher she say two famous heroes both capitaine jerome lanxade and the acadian capitaine boudreaux balfa are visitors to the de guilleri appartement she say she see them the several time mos recent a few day ago she say oh gideon you are in danger mon coeur go home colette pollock insisted almost shooing her to the door relenting he finally said i am in no danger my dear have no fear theres ah underhanded commercial finagling afoot and those old rogues are involved with some noted families to pull a sly one over on we despised outsider traders a coup de commerce but with your quick wits and sharp eyes my dear mister willoughby and i are in a fair way to scotching it before it costs us tuppence ha ha you swear colette warily asked still upset and dubious cross my heart pollock cooed to her sketching on his chest blushing again even redder than before he vowed je tadore cherie and blushing herself but immensely pleased by his rare public declaration of love she pecked him on the cheek smiled and departed chapter twentysix she isnt aware of your ah lewrie somberly asked once the door was firmly shut chiding himself for being infected with pollocks characteristic mannerism i sometimes wonder lewrie pollock replied shaking his head well then ahem took the ferry to the south bank did they most odd indeed pollock clapped his hands together as if suddenly convinced of something then crossed to a tall desk to produce a map which he spread on the larger lower desks surface were they fleeing back to their parents saint gabriel plantings they wouldve coached round this way he pondered waving a vague hand over the northwestern end of the map couldve hired a shalope to sail them up the mississippi to one of their plantation landings but they didnt why mr pollock frowned at the map drawing a candle stand closer so he could see the better and traced an idle finger along the southern bank opposite new orleans fleeing down the mississippi lewrie idly speculated for that a hired shalope wouldve served captain lewrie mr pollock gravely countered had they taken a boat going with the current they could already be ten miles downriver by now getting away in perfect comfort and laughing up their sleeves he growled with growing frustration then whyd they dress so rough mister pollock liam desmond who had been present for most of their musings had the temerity to interject mostlike catching toby juggs attitude lewrie feared yer missuz said they wore whatchacallems rusticals wanit sor mauvaises pollock supplied offhandedly means tattered or threadbare a la rustique they say of the acadians who live to pass without notice mongst the acadian settlers by god balfa he lives down south mr pollocks finger traced a hypothetical route down along one pencilledin iffy track from the ferry landing on the south bank to a true plotted bayou tracing further to where the bayou intersected a river and theyre bound down the ouatchas river pollock exclaimed id stake my life on it pollock declared now all fervent brusqueness the ouatchas connects with bayou barataria where that rogue balfa farms and id not be surprised to learn that one of the plantations along the bois gervais road on the bayous is conveniently owned by one of our suspected conspirators aha they could hide their schooner this far up the bayous lewrie asked frowning over pollocks map it looks too god no pollock snapped even the ouatchas or the bayou barataria is too shallow narrow and twisting backcountry people use pirogues on the creeks and bayous pronouncing the word as peerohs and sounding impatient with lewries wits youve seen them not a foot of freeboard four inches or less actually in the water theyre poled or paddled trees overhang so low they cant be masted float on a heavy dew they do right through any swamp good as a highway damme dont snap at me sir lewrie retorted we must have pirogues of our own go after them youd blunder about like a blind man in vauxhall gardens hedge maze pollock scoffed right back theyd need a good guide to find their way which im sure they already have which you dont sir and i very much doubt you could buy one with a keg of gold coin with the best bein acadian and them so clannish acadiansd never trust an englishman not after we expelled them from canada after the seven years war secretive backward ill not sit and wring my hands lewrie declared his chagrin and anger at his gullibility and his attempted murder now bubbling over and directed at the handiest subject ill not allow em tget away and wail about what a shame it is sir all these bayous and such they lead to the sea eventually ah to lake barataria a muchchastened pollock said now cowed into politeness by lewries outburst thence into barataria bay which has deepwater passes into the gulf here lewrie almost snarled stabbing a finger at the mouth of the bay grand terre island right beg pardon sor toby jugg hesitantly spoke up i hear tell tavern talk from th auld gammers who mighta gone privateerin in their younger days dye see woz all some say grand terre island and barataria bay woz th grandest place twait fer passin spanish treasure ships sor he revealed eyes shifting in old guilt perhaps do tell jugg lewrie said with a knowing smirk say on good anchorage sandy holdin ground back o th island an sweetwater springs ashore sor jugg continued in a gruff offhand tone twelver fifteen foot o depth bay an isle brimover with a seafood bounty some say theres booried treasure on grand terre to this very day sor sure east pass bettern the western i heard deep enough for their schooner or prizes lewrie exclaimed balfas place conveniently halfway from new orleans so far up no one could pursue them a planter house and barns just over the river to cache stolen goods damme they must be running all the way down to grand terre theyre bound to sea where my frigate can smash em fearing very overt action pollock gave him one of those cringing mousepawed appalled expressions of his as if lewrie had gone madder than a hatter was about to run as amok as a rogue elephant your safe little world about tbe tipped over lewrie silently sneered damn right it is and too bloody bad hed been led by the nose since boarding pollocks trade brig since captain nicelys supper off his feed and balance led round by his member almost from the moment hed stepped ashore in new orleans too now their pirates identity had been discovered and it was his time to redon the royal navys brutal harness idlings over me lad lewrie thought steeling himself to the task at hand youve eat your last lotus ill run em that bitch that lying little whore how large a fool must i look to my sailors right now how much of their respect have i lost by being such a and here hed been feeling twingingguilty to abuse a sweet young girls adoration hah we must be got downriver lewrie firmly said soon as dammit sooner proteus is lurking off the mississippi passes i must get her underway for barataria bay at once what dye mean tonight sir mr pollock fretfully asked if not by midnight then no later than dawn aye lewrie said impatient to get back to doing what he did best where he did his best at sea how long would it take your brig to gain the gulf with the downriver current to speed her along well no more than four or five days downriver but ahem pollock whinnied having himself a twitchneck crooking fit i fear though that for my ship my firm to be involved so publicly would be quite impossible and why the bloody hell not lewrie barked hands clasped in the small of his back foursquare on his feet as he would stand upon a quarterdeck a chilly hush fell upon the gathered sailors knowing by their captains tone and the eerie change of his eyes from a merry blue to a flinty arctic grey that mr pollock was gonna catch it panton leslie company is only marginally associated with crown interests and ah activities pollock tried to exposit in a calm reasonable tone we are not never have been directly under foreign office orders not like your fellow james peel captain lewrie nor am i no matter what you might have told or assumed actively engaged as a crown agent nor have i ever been dye see i observe i listen might now and then make harmless and innocent enquiries when in town but i fear that either mister peel admiral parker or your captain nicely ah oversold how much direct aid to your expedition ahem i might render so you did intend to smuggle us away once wed cut a throat or two lewrie brutally stated left bodies piled in the streets so long as i or panton leslie were not ah exposed to the spanish sir yes panton tremulously confessed so long as you managed the task covertly without i am merely a businessman sir if not your brig then what about one of your shalopes or a lugger lewrie pressed one of your river boats stout enough for the open sea give us a few extra hands off the brig or your river boats and well manage things on our own could you manage that well of course sir that wouldnt ah pollock said in evident relief that nothing would stick to his shoes if things went badly a plausible excuse for your sudden departure would be necessary i do think though so the firm doesnt tell em you fired us for buggery lewrie quickly suggested prompting a hearty laugh from his hands for all i care let em believe we stole the damn thing too just so we depart soon well i do have have a decent seaboat and send correspondence aboard her to jamaica pollock allowed perking up a bit as an alibi sprang to mind you could claim to carry the door opened and that damnably merry bell tinkled again freezing everyone in a hostile tableau as mr caldecott the first mate off the azucena del oeste wandered in evnin all mr caldecott called tossing off an idle doff of his hat and obviously cherrymerry in drink heard the rumours in town shootins and harumscarums though the donsve only found one victim so far some buckskinned turd we heard both pollock and lewrie snapped at the same time even more excitement makin the rounds caldecott breezed on too tipsy to take umbrage the whole towns bellied up to the bar counters tcelebrate the treasure ship they heard was coming treasure ship was the chorus of everyone present making the idling sailors leap to their feet in sudden and intense interest bless me sirs dont know how much stock tput in the tale caldecott explained beaming what with how excitable dons and creoles can get but word is that the banking houses got told tons o money was tbe sent here fresh from the mexico city mint place darmes is so crowded youd think it was a saints day pageant fireworks band and all by and did they say ah how much was coming mister caldecott pollock asked his eyes slit in avaricious calculations oh bloody millions sir caldecott happily replied pouring himself a glass of wine from the sideboard carafe a million pounds in real money and that was the low guess the more wine the higher damme lewrie marvelled at their pirates daring theyre not fleeing mister pollock theyre off to try to take it henri maurepas pollock shrewdly mused is he bound up with the conspiracy he must have been the one that told them about it all the more reason for haste sir lewrie exclaimed catch them in the act nab em redhanded your boat sir instanter with the bloody treasure ship alongside arrah liam desmond muttered in awe of the possibilities jaysus joseph an mary god amighty lewrie frenziedly speculated a million spanish dollarsd be a quarter million pounds captain s share is twoeighths so sixtytwo thousand five hund jesus christ right lads were off lewrie cried banging his hands together in urgency theres nought we may do to the local villains this maurepas or bistineau mister pollock no time to scrag em but did someone put a flea in the spanish authorities ears once the money is taken hmmm let those idle bastards in the cabildo do our work i do imagine something could be ah arranged mr pollock decided with one brow slyly contemplatively cocked and look to the safety of your emporium hulk as we sail sir lewrie further said gathering up his discarded things bistineaus store is it nearby to anything you value i dont we came tget our prize ship back but that aint in the cards mister pollock lewrie quickly explained her cargos lost to us as well safely cached in that bastards store and warehouse we cant have either i mean to make sure no one profits from her just before we set off i intend to set em all afire and burn em to the ground and the waterline book five prospero now does my project gather to a head my charms crack not my spirits obey and time goes upright with his carriage hows the day the tempest act v scene william shakespeare chapter twentyseven boudreaux balfa squatted on the lip of the canvascovered cargo hatch horny bare feet and stout suntanned shins splayed either side of a smallish wooden keg a prosaic bulgesided gallon barrico that one could find anywhere liquid goods were sold though this one had neither tap nor bung the lid which had been hatcheted open had the king of spains royal crest burned into it so one might have mistaken the barrico for one containing only the costliest smoothest brandy for aristocratic tables but capitaine boudreaux balfa laffame dipped his hands into that gallon barrico and ran his fingers through silver not spirits if the mexico city mint workers hadnt cheated their masters a gallon wooden barrico should contain pieces of silver spanish dollars less the tare weight of the keg balfa knew from his previous lootings the mint simply shovelled loose coins into a barrico til the heavy scales balanced at pounds about as much as a government dock worker or slave employed at public works could lift by himself if a mint employee pocketed a few on the sly well it was almost expected balfa rather doubted that the count would come out exact but then who the devil cared ahhyeee balfa cried in a high thin twonote howl of victory by gar he shouted drumming his heels on the deck and tossing a double handful of coins high aloft without a care where they landed a pistol shot drew his attention that whippetlean boy jeanmarie rancour was flinging silver dollars over the side so his friend don rubio could shoot them like ducks on the wing most shots went wide of the mark but again who the devil cared when there was so much money for the taking a quick pair of shots belowdecks sounded muffled but distinct followed by the scream of a mortally wounded man and the keening howl of a survivor of the ships crew whose hiding place had been found as he was dragged from the side of his slain comrade and hauled up from below for the further amusement of the triumphant pirates balfa squinted with concern when he saw that one of the sailors who fetched the survivor up was his own son fusilier he was a bit relieved though to note how his son hung back from actually manhandling the poor doomed bastard no it was those two brothers pierre and jean who held the man by his upper arms and lugged him onto the deck laughing and taunting the fellow crying out to their fellow buccaneers that a fresh victim had been discovered fusilier trailed behind their victims scrabbling bare feet an ashen cast to his features eyes flicking right and left as if in some fever his cheeks red and gulping in trepidation boudreaux balfa did not want his son to follow in his bloodied footsteps hed adamantly decreed for his poor dead wifes sake that laffame would be the last pirate of their clan that he would make an honest living on the land that piracy had bought them that boudreaux would make sure that fusilier and evangeline would grow up respectable and in the fear of the lord if he had to kill them to do it he would leave them property six arpents wide and fifty arpents deep from their good dock on bayou barataria to far back into the cypress swamps with channels and sloughs for rice fields enough solid land for cotton and sugarcane enough cleared land where thirty or fourty head of cattle could graze on his vacherie twice the herd any neighbour could boast three hundred arpents over british acres enough to support generations of balfas in comfort and selfsufficiencyif it wasnt in debt now and then in bad years with bankers and crop factors in the city his old trade could provide a hedge against its loss so when the de guilleri brats and their cohorts had come ghosting up to his landing the night that boudreaux had invited friends and neighbours over for his monthly rustique to sing the old french homeland tunes and those of longlost acadia to dance barefooted on hardpacked dirt or softer grass to drink and feast and court and carry on well even if theyd come dressed down like the old feudal landlords or aristos of the court at versailles did when playing peasant among their lessers once theyd gotten him aside and had imparted their fabulous news the temptation had simply been too great his son fusilier had begged and pleaded for just one adventure by his side and fusilier had been too hotblooded and eager to be denied despite his promises to his dead wife madre de dios por favor senores no the fresh victim cried in a squeaky childs despairing voice crawling on his knees with tears streaking his face searching for just one with mercy in his heart instead he was hauled to his feet held pinioned from either side as a burly but sweetfaced crewman strode up to him laid a hand on his shoulder as if to reassure him then jabbed a wide dagger into his belly once twice and a third time roaring with laughter as he did so with a feral shout half a dozen buccaneers hoisted him up and flung him overboard cheered their own boldness then broke up to hunt down any other lurking survivors boudreaux nodded with sad pleasure to see fusilier blanch and dash to the opposite bulwarks to puke up his meagre breakfast at his side was the teenaged boy whod fetched up the latest victim he was heaving because he had no stomach for seafaring and even a moderate chop turned him grassgreen quite unlike his older brother pierre fusilier had no stomach for this bon balfa thought and this would be the last voyage for both of them there was so much silver stowed below their shares could support their lands for the next hundred years if they were frugal no buccaneering scum as friends pierre and the seasick younger jean those itinerant la fitte brothers had come up the bayou between cruises looking for land and opportunities theyd claimed they had idled on his hospitality did the least possible to repay it and spent most of their time spooning his lovely but naive daughter evangeline and turning fusiliers head with tales of loot and plunder balfa had trusted neither one out of his sight sure they were sniffing round for his hidden wealth hed been ready to run them off when the de guilleris turned up and once this adventure was done hed be glad to see the backs of the la fittes we did it boudreaux mon vieux we did it after all jerome lanxade cheered capering and performing a creaky hornpipe coming up to embrace him buss him french fashion on both cheeks then pound him on the back so easy it was nothing spaniards pah what a pack of toothless monkeys yes it had been easy so incredibly easy the intelligence in the letter to banker maurepas had been like all vaunting spanish selfdelusions but an empty sham that socalled company of stalwart soldiers had been thirtyodd idle seasick mestizos in shabby uniforms with poorly kept weapons halfaztec riffraff led by a fat sergeant a brace of equally lowdown corporals and a pair of downattheheels officers one of whom the senior capitano had offered to surrender if he could join their merry marauding band for a share of the money the cannon were good but their powder was poorly milled damp with age and indifferent storage and the welldrilled naval gunnersone per piece as guncaptainsoutnumbered by spiritless cowardly and clumsy guttersweepings only the schooners capitano and his naval officers had put up much of a fight once their vessel had stalked up to cannonrange and those hellish quickfiring airrifles had put him and his quarterdeck party and helmsmen down in the first minutes leaving the rest of the crew leaderless and adrift le revenant had more swivelgunsin the old days theyd not been termed murderers for nothingand theyd had those airrifles in the capable and deadly accurate hands of the de guilleris so the guncaptains loaders and rammers along with the frightened swaying infantrymen were blasted off their feet faster than any troops could bear with half the soldiers shot in a single brutal minute after that no one could resist their howling shrieking swordwaving boarders and the thing was done too bad we cant keep this schooner of theirs jerome lanxade went on might salvage her guns if we had the time but no disguising her balfa spat she gotta go down wit all de evidence by gar give her a good cleaning boudreaux a clean sweep down fore and aft she could serve as our second raider lanxade posed sweeping at his thin and rakish mustachios like scrubbin up a whore over in havana before you board her hah well get you a suitable ship never fear wont need one jerome balfa said in a covert growl telling truth if only to his longtime compatriot perhaps the only man aboard whom he could trust so much silver come to hand so easy like i gets de shivers dat another prize push our luck my luck hein by damn i see all dat silver i feels de rabbits runnin we get all o dis ashore and split up i callin it quits damn the bastards helio de guilleri was raging as he came stamping heavy bootheels up the companionway ladder from below bedamned to all lying spanish bastards cochons salauds what is the matter msieur lanxade broke away to ask him ive counted kegs capitaine lanxade counted them twice and there arent enough to make six million dollars de guilleri seethed lowering his voice at lanxades urgent hand gestures so their sailors wouldnt hear that theyd been denied a single sou there is not one tengallon barrico aboard just fivegallon kegs a thousand dollars each none of the ones that hold two thousand putain mon dieu lanxade spat blanching beneath his swarthy lifetime sea tan mon cul he gravelled teeth grinding my ass balfa groaned too dey didn hide some down among deir water butts an saltmeat kegs how many barricos you find only two thousand capitaine helio de guilleri told him in a grim mutter nigh snarling as if it was he whod been robbed that only makes fiftyfive tons of silver no gold here he spat making them look at a small ledger book hippolyte found this aft in their capitaines cabins in the mint officials bags it says they carried only a third of the total shipment by damn dose spaniards get clever after all balfa hooted with inexplicable laughter after a moment of thought sent one ship close inshore to texas province like lubbers feelin deir way scared o open water but dey done put de rest in two more fast schooners figure dey lose one but de rest sail far out at sea might now be off fort balise safe as lambs but mes amis he slyly pointed out we still got two millions of it lads wont be happy though cher lanxade griped plucking at his finery most fretfully they think were fools theyve been cheated somehow bad thing to do to fail in our trade ah mais oui balfa uneasily agreed grimacing over the tales of what had happened to even the greatest pirates whod lost the trust of their crews whod seemed to lose their magic touch for now there is rum wine food and loot lanxade supposed peering about the schooners decks to see his crew busy with newly captured muskets and pistols new cutlasses and infantry hangers hung by new baldrics over their shoulders dead mens hats were being quarreled over and gambled for as were coats waistcoats shoes and the few pairs of salvaged boots rest of her cargo the butts of mexicano wine and that peasantbrewed pulque and arrack that can keep them satisfied for a while quiet fuddled and too drunk for a proper counting proper thinking enough silver for each hand tget two three keg apiece right away balfa cannily speculated delay de reckonin nestce pas set aside dead mens shares in plain sight poor and poltroonish as the spanish resistance had been they still had managed to slay or mortally wound at least seven of their buccaneers before going under wives children and lovers were due a lost mans lay or what balfa and lanxade could later swear was a proper share after deductions those wounded but not mortally were owed bonuses too depending on whether theyd lost something off their bodies an eye hand digit or foot a leg a pension paid in one lump sum if their seagoing life was curtailed by disabilities you fear your own men helio de guilleri asked with a gasp of surprise but then he was used to absolute obedience and deference from house slaves and street negres those below his social class it never occurred to him would never occur to any of his cohorts that the piratical trade was the freest sort of democracy they discover the sum we took is off yes lanxade whispered wondering if old boudreaux might not be quitting the trade at the best time after all and might it not be in his interest to do so too well this schooner is worth a lot too so couldnt they wait until it and that british prize were sold and we helio asked non mon cher lanxade hastily objected this schooner must disappear and quickly before the spanish begin a search for her if they lose a guarda costa lugger a few local merchant ships that they could abide blame the anglais but a royal vessel with two million dollars aboard even they would be stirred to action well take her back to grand terre unload her and strip her of anything useful helio pressed sounding almost whiny to them tow her back outta barataria bay den sink her in deep water balfa cagily suggested so nobody ever see her again by damn sink her helio gawped louder than hed meant to why cant she be sold to some stupid yankees perhaps he plaintively posed as if ruing the loss of a single ecu of her worth sink her his sister charite demanded stalking up from astern to join them her dainty left hand fisted about the hilt of her smallsword in sudden dismay and her kneehigh boots drumming on the decks sink her will you messieurs shes the equal of le revenant with better guns aboard her we need her to begin building our own fleet helio tell them carriages could be built the artillery could then be used ashore for our creole army for our coming revolution we were just discussing that charite ma soeur uh he lamely stammered blushing under his sisters indignant glare capitaine balfa has been promised a ship of his own charite continued her colour high over any lessthanzealous enthusiasm for their cherished cause et voila here she is when word gets out hundreds of men will come forward to crew her capitaine balfa then can choose only the best the others can enlist in your regiment mon frere they will come like that she exulted with a boyish snap of the fingers of her free right hand tiens there is a difficulty charite helio muttered gazing away unable to meet her eyes we will speak of it later if let us speak of it now helio she countered or is it too complicated a matter for a mere woman to understand hein quel dommage were out of targets alas don rubio monaster pretended to mourn as he and her cousin jeanmarie casually sauntered up to join the leaders of the expedition which was to their minds a natural right they were still smirking over the hunters bag they had shot or skewered while there yet had been survivors from the spanish vessels crew or armed guard eh something is amiss why all the long faces we did just win a great victory did we not they insist that we must sink this ship after looting her charite informed him with the slightest plaintive sound as if looking for a supportive voice to champion her argument well i suppose we should rubio said with a simper when a blind spaniard could recognise her a mile off ha ha a pity surely but we can salvage her artillery and such hidden far up barataria bay shed be safe enough as safe as le revenant has been charite hotly pointed out cher capitaine balfa to command her with two ships to prey on the spanish cochons i quittin me balfa baldly told her what charite spat aghast at that news but you cannot losin dis ship de spaniards git too stirred up balfa laid out in a calm voice my share be moren enough tget by a long time got a bad feelin mademoiselle a longtime sailors sight he added with a shiver but charite spluttered for a moment then turned icy cold tres bien msieur she said distancing her demeanour if you have a foreboding then we could promote a promising mate for command of this schooner and honour you for your contributions we cannot keep her cherie helio gravely told her it is a risk we cannot take but we do need a second ship yes charite snapped rounding on him as if hed let her down too if not at once we could make a third cruise with le revenant and take a suitable merchant ship then add to her armament with this ships guns yes with news of this success recruit more eager volunteers to man her yes well of course but helio quickly agreed with a shrug of his shoulders mostly to cool her ardour then i have a promising man in mind who seems more than eager for adventure charite schemed that mercenary former anglais navy man willoughby she blushed as she raised that possibility to them the mention of his name and nation he is nearly penniless dismissed his service and will do anything for riches a very useful man who can be lured she blushed too to describe her lover in such a harsh fashion when the thrilling memory of his hands his lips his thrusting body was still fresh in her mind he would do anything for me nestce pas she intimated with a cruel grin forced to her lips not if hes run off in terror cousin jeanmarie rancour hooted with dismissive scorn and glee jean rubio cautioned but it was too late and jeanmarie waded in deeper despite the elbow aimed at his midribs we did for both of those uppity poseurs didnt we rubio the anglais and that nosey americain ellison who followed you charite that night you bearded the anglais what did you do she angrily demanded breathing slowly but hard enough to flare and collapse her delicate nostrils shot both of them rubio gruffly confessed nosehigh for his motives his actions to be questioned just before we gathered at your house to leave they were not gentlemen he haughtily declared oh you arrogant stupid charite raged surprising all of them by leaping at rubio to hammer her fists on his chest driving him towards the starboard bulwarks surprising them too by loosing a sudden flood of tears amid her ire rubio didnt kill him the anglais i mean charite jeanmarie cried trying to seize one of her arms as helio went for another he put a scare on him was all he ducked too quick for a clean shot he got off three shots at us and got away helio and hippolyte did for that elisson he and his men were dirty americain spies and i wager your anglais pig is one too so pompous idiot vain and jealous charite shrieked just as they peeled her off the startled don rubio squirming and kicking at his shins in vain don rubio monaster went as pale as a windingsheet slackjawed in astonishment at her reaction in that instant he realized hed never possess her that all that had passed between them had been kissing cousin teasing another a despicable other held her heart and rubio suddenly despised her hating that anglais with an equal revulsioncould have shot her as gladly as hed shot at the englishman a new weapon the mans agility and return shots to get that close yet fail because he didnt use his old jaeger rifle hadnt been familiar with the girandoni his own righteous action had slain his hopes and dreams and someone would have to pay charite calmed much too suddenly for any of them to credit as if the eye of a gulf storm claimed her rage her arms went out at her sides to fend off those who held her nodding in grim understanding brought her hands prayerfully together under the tip of her nose to think to bide tres bien she finally muttered very well you enrage the americains to find who shot their leader you enrage the british merchant company and they will try to avenge alain she bleakly sketched for them clearing her tootight throat several times we can deal with any her brother hippolyte disparaged no mon dieu you have even wakened the spanish she retorted better you had but it is much too late for second thoughts or sense is it messieurs she accused and like the gustfront of an ouragan her icily controlled rage sent a frisson of arctic chill over the bloodied deck zut putain goddamn your foolishness you have put everything weve worked for at risk you may have just destroyed our most cherished dream it was too much for her at last charite angelette de guilleri hitched up a wracking sob unable to master it and girlishly dashed at her tears damned if shed weep in front of them but she spun on her heels and ran aft for the looted spanish captains quarters for a precious space of privacy hmmm well then capitaine lanxade said breaking their stricken tableau he twirled one end of his mustachio frowning as he listened carefully it was much too quiet suddenly even the rowdy brawling drunken buccaneers had been silenced by her unseemly cries her attack on that arrogant halfdago fop monaster fierce and merciless as they could be le revenant buccaneers were sailors after all simple folk for the most part they carried their emotions close to the skin could slay a longtime shipmate over trifles in a drunken rage then weep for days over the deed once they sobered up superstitious even religious when all else failedtheyd been appalled to have a woman aboard ship at first for that was as dangerous as whistling on deck which might summon vengeful wind at such disrespect for the old sea gods yet mlle charite had proved so entrancingly lovely to behold so sunnily dispositioned that she had endeared herself to them and their string of successes with her aboard had made her almost a talisman the scrappy mascot that brings good luck and didnt she handle a smallsword or light hanger as well as a man wasnt she a passingfair shot also they could eagerly and had eagerly raped and murdered women passengers or slaves aboard some of their prizes but this young girl of theirs was different she was sacrosanct not to be groped touched taken or even spoken of by any hand in a scurrilous manner what upset her then upset them and if they got angry enough over the sight of their cet jeune fille raging in such a brokenhearted way so contrary to her usual demeanour then those who caused it stood in peril of being chopped into stew meat all lanxade could hear for several long moments were the creaks and groans of the two lashedtogether hulls the slats and bangs aloft from untended yards and booms and the drumslapping of freed rigging then there came a faint growl and rumble of displeasure from several sailors and he and his old mate boudreaux balfa shared a queasy look from their long experience of dealing with the fractious and unpredictable sort of men whod go pirating they both feared that there would be trouble over this even before the revelation of the shortage of expected loot women don rubio said with a lofty sniff as if he had never placed much hope in so frail a vessel were she not so foolish she might eventually come to understand shut up lanxade harshly barked at him taking sides in front of his men so they wouldnt end up turning him to chutney you men theres tons of silver to be shifted oceans of drink to salvage get back to work before a british or spanish manowar interrupts us mais oui balfa quickly seconded lets gather our spoils mes amis allez vite ahyee the de guilleri brothers with cousin jeanmarie wandered off to commiserate with poor old rubio closely grouped about him to give their condolences for the vagaries of brainless girls lanxade and balfa drifted forward towards the prize schooners forecastle and belfry where they could confide in each other casually stepping over the odd stripped and looted body that hadnt been tossed overside as if they were no more than ringbolts or coils of rigging un emmerdement jerome balfa said in a raspy voice weve really tromped through de shit dis time by gar we need to get this ship off the sea and out of sight vite lanxade muttered from the corner of his mouth a confident grin plastered on his phyz for the crews sake get de lads drunk an stuffed wit meat too before dey start cuttin dose bebe troats too our crew likes her boudreaux lanxade said leaning on the lee bulwark caprails and gazing out to the empty southern horizon where even more trouble might pop up all guns and officiousness do you remember what it was we said back at the dry tortugas about showing these amateurs what real piracy looks like hmm ouais balfa said with a shrug trying to recall two million dollars wont go that far with our lads lanxade fretted not with bistineau maurepas and that goddamned rebellion fund of theirs each taking a cut what is due our very young stupid employers too nestce pas how are your shivers mon vieux oh dere be a whole herd o rabbit run up an down my spine balfa told him with an uneasy chuckle why all of a sudden i feel them too cher lanxade confessed to him turning to smirk your talk of retiring makes me think that it may be a good time for me to swallow the anchor as well havana or cartagena they are both delightful cities where a wellrespecteddare i even say famousformer privateer could retire ashore he said preening at his mustachios and posing with a hand on the hilt of his smallsword like a grandee well settled famous and rich a wellbuilt house overlooking the bay perhaps an honourable and respected and wealthy gentlemen hein oho balfa gleefully grunted some aspirin lad of ours will take le revenant sail her away to better pickins we cant kill dat girl though he speculated making no real objection to a betrayal as he leaped on the most troublesome matter with his usual blunt acuity i stagger back to nawlins tell maurepas an dem a tale o mutiny when de lads see all dat money and i got away by de skin o my balls who know where dey go after dey cut dem bebesheads off haw haw and i was slain after a gallant and heroic bit of swordplay lanxade airily fantasised drawing in his corseted stomach to make a more dangerous figure to his own mind fierce as i tried to defend the poor young gentlemen ah quel dommage he said simpering oh mais oui you kill a dozen before dyin balfa snickered but then what will we do with our little mademoiselle lanxade quibbled with a sober sigh she lives shell talk sooner or later and her parents the spanish authorities will run us down i wish to fuck my way to my dotage boudreaux not get garotted before ive had a chance to amuse all the pretty wenches of cartagena we come up wit somethin balfa muttered though what that would be he hadnt a clue he really didn t want little charite fed to the gators and crabs but what other course was there chapter twentyeight ahoy the boat midshipman grace shouted from the entryport with the aid of a brass speakingtrumpet though his challenge was by rote since proteuss people had known who it was that approached her for the past quarter hour in mounting expectation and curiosity proteus aye aye quartermasters mate toby jugg senior hand aboard the shalope shouted back thrusting one hand skyward as if in triumph with four fingers spread to announce the arrival of a postcaptain as well gilding the lily that lewrie thought of juggs display for when coming back aboard lewrie was hms proteus four fingers and aye aye were for unknown postcaptains arriving to tell how many sailors should turn out as the sideparty after a long fretful civilian and covert absence though the more navy ritual the better for it meant a return to sanity security and his own identity lewrie almost squirmed with anticipation that itchyinnards legjiggling impatience he recalled from his boyhood when his father sir hugo had gruffly announced that theyd coach to town the next day the dawn would never come it seemed before he got that first orange from the fruiterers that first peek at new toys first sweetsticky candy after being good studious and quiet for so long his eyes flitted hungrily over his magnificent frigate proteus in his absence had been maintained in spanking bristol fashion with first officer mr langlie in his stead as actingcaptain aided by lt catterall and lt adair and that temporary third officer lt darling whom capt nicely had fetched him lewrie could find nothing to gripe about in her appearance or her readiness and there those worthies were by the starboard quarterdeck bulwarks wide grins plastered on their faces just about ready to give up sea officer stoic and whoop like punters at derby whose horse led the last furlong his whole crew looked to be gathered on the gangway and glad to see him happier than he had a right to expect their shalope a wretched craft only fifty feet on the range of the deck and never meant for extended seafaring sidled up to proteus like a timid trout shyly nuzzling up to a great sea bass after they left the mississippi delta even lewries castiron constitution had been challenged to seasickness aboard the shalope so it was with avidity that he took the single easy step from the shalopes low entryport to the mainmast channels manropes and boarding battens of the frigates starboard entry a moment later lewrie stood on his own decks once more doffing his muchabused widebrimmed hat in salute to the sideparty the wail of bosuns calls the stampslap of boots and hands on muskets from the marines and the doffings from both officers and crew once his honours had been rendered lewrie gleefully smiled and whooped himself to send his civilian headgear sailing as far off as possible he skinned off his hideous shinygreen coat and tore at the buttons that bound him into that tight striped waistcoat lemme help sir his steward aspinall joyfully offered as he came near god amighty sir but thesere a tad garish burn em if you wish aspinall lewrie sniggered then there were his officers to greet his middies bosun pendarves and his mate mr towpenny now returned to robust fullfleshed health after his ordeal on the dry tortugas and there was his coxswain andrews eyes alight with relief that hed returned at last wheres that bloody nicely lewrie fretfully wondered a glance upwards assuring him that capt nicelys broad pendant still flew aloft command of a hahsquadron o one gone to his head as if witched up by the very thought the bulkhead door to the main deck opened below him as he still stood on the starboard gangway the manne sentry on that door stamped and presented his musket in salute and nicely began to emerge beaten to it though by two balls of fur that streaked so close to capt nicelys feet that he staggered for a moment like a scotsman dancing over crossed blades as his cats toulon and chalky came flying up the starboard quarterdeck ladder in a fullout softly thundering feline gallop and there s my lads lewrie cried going down on one knee to welcome their arrival and he didnt care who witnessed it either so fondly happy to see them again and oh but didnt they twine mew and trill stand on their hind legs and sniff him over make snorting openmouthed sounds as he stroked their heads they kneaded and gently clawed at his trousers and made a great ado over him ah captain lewrie back at last i see capt nicely said once hed gained the quarterdeck standing a few feet off cocking one brow in wary fashion the deeds done sir our pirates foul business stopped i take it not quite sir lewrie told him looking up half his attention still fixed on his insistent creatures the prize was looted and stripped of anything useful a dead loss to us a dead loss for them too cause we set her afire on our way out of town set alight a yankee emporium ship too but that was accidental really let me get below back in uniform and ill tell you all sir we know where our pirates are bound dye see sir and theres a chance just a chance mind that when we catch em they mightve stolen a shipload of silver the dons were sending from the mexico city mint and silver nicely goggled a whole shipload o coined silver sir lewrie said rising to his feet despite the protestations of his cats chalky younger and spryer took hold of his trousers at the left knee and scaled him like a tree trunk we ow heard rumours in new orleans the sum might be at least one or two millions spanish dollars to british poundsd be jesus bloody christ capt nicely breathed in awe and you think you know where theyre bound sir he further asked his mouth moving afterwards in a silent mumble of numbersjuggling five hundred thousand bloody pounds i do sir lewrie said with a sly smile with chalky draped over his unbuttoned waistcoat and going for his shoulder as agile and intent as a squirrel where theyll likely be if theyre not at owl stop that chalky damn ye if theyre not at sea seekin the booty this instant sir lewrie looked down as he felt claws on his right leg as toulon gathered himself for a clumsy ascent of his own lewrie knelt to let the heavier older cat have his other shoulder to spare himself a few more bleeding nicks toulon nuzzled headbutted and snorted whilst chalky went in for more playful lovenips needless to say both were purring as loud and rattly as carriage wheels on street cobbles for what i have in mind sir well need to retain the shalope shes very shallow draught and can go ow mister langlie nicely bade swivelling about id admire if you order yon shalope taken in tow then get us back underway aye aye sir lt langlie said flicking a wary gaze betwixt capt nicely and his own capt lewrie for a moment now that lewrie was back aboard the request should have gone to lewrie first then to him lewrie cocked a brow at langlie as if to say that he would set things right once he and nicely were below in his greatcabins the course to steer mister langlie will be roughly norwest a touch of northing for barataria bay lewrie instructed know that place mister winwood he asked of his stolidly prim sailing master not personally no captain that worthy slowly replied after seeming to give the matter a long ponderous think though i have in my possession a fairly trustworthy chart of the area in question an out o date typical slapdash french or spanish chart an hopeful fiction mostlike but lewrie genially scoffed consult it anyway mister winwood and give mister langlie the proper heading then fetch it to my chart space so we may all refer plans to it aye aye sir mr winwood replied good christ lewrie said with a grimace once he was below in his private quarters inhaling the stench of ramcats aspinall he started to accuse have you slacked off your scouring whilst i beg pardon sir but the lad muttered wringing his hands the little fellers seemed ttake to capm nicely well enough so long as you were still aboard but oncet you set off for louisiana it got sorta grim sir spent half their time sulkin for lack o ya and tother half prowlin th ship in search o ya the poor little beasts did i spect they felt a bit put out with a stranger aft gave up their sandbox for is clothes the deck canvas his shoes an hat sir lurkin about peein on his pillows an bed sheets hissin an spittin wheneer they saw him too sir i tried tscour things fresh with vinegar een smoked th cabins with tobacco but the wee ladsre nothin but sneaky an clever the little pranksters capm nicely didnt take t them i tell ya too sir and what of my clothing aspinall lewrie dubiously said as aspinall bustled about prating and fetching him fresh breeches knee stockings and shirt lewrie held the shirt up sniffing it warily oh no harm tyours sir aspinall grinned when they were their lowest theyd curl up tgether on yer dressing robe it seemed tcomfort em but nary a whizz did they ever make on it though i did have tbrush off a couple pounds o hair now an then dye see now heres a freshpressed neckstock sir and yer waistcoat i got a pitcher o cold tea brewed just th way ya like it and it was all lewrie could do to walk from one end of his quarters to the other for his lovelorn cats who twined round his ankles right then lewrie said with glad sigh of satisfaction once he was properly and comfortably garbed in complete uniform less giltlaced coat and cocked hat do you pass word for captain nicely the ships officers and marine lieutenant devereux to attend me aye sir aspinall responded and uhm quartermasters mate jugg as well lewrie added well that should cover it lewrie concluded looking at his officers gathered round his desk and the pertinent chart spread atop it hms proteus bowled along on a goodly slant of wind her larboard shoulder firmly set to the sea and heeled over about fifteen degrees it felt good to flex his legs and balance again good to hear the hissing swooshing muffled roar of her hull parting the waters twopronged assault not so very far apart that either party is dangerously isolated from the other i trust grand terre was about five miles long and perhaps a mile wide at best a lowlying sandy barrier island it and its smaller eastern twin grand isle barred the southern end of barataria bay leaving a poor choice of entrances to the bay between the two was the deepest though proteus with her seventeenandahalffoot draught could not probe too deep between the isles the borrowed shalope would lead the assault armed with swivelguns and pdr boatguns whilst proteus would stand in as close as she dared to support with her pdrs it was an uneasy conference when all depended on toby juggs dim recollections of older sailors talk with many a so i heard qualifier flung about and jugg shiftily avoiding how hed gathered such knowledge or under which flag hed gained his experience jugg sketched out three possible sites that the pirates might use one was on grand isles norwest tip on the righthand side of the best channel the other was on grand terre island s noreast tip on the other side of the pass the last least likely so i heard of oncet sors was at the far west end of grand terre by the shallower inlet a schooner could get in there but not a deepdraught prize to be unloaded and stripped at both of the most likely sites there were freshwater springs and rills ashore dense stands of timber for firewood or huts off the ground like indian chichees to deter the venomous snakes that the auld sailormen had mentioned indeed there were reputed to be easily recognisable indian mounds therewide tall and slopesided erected god knew how long ago and for unfathomed uses there were mounds of oyster clam and mussel shells toogarbage middens from centuries of native settlement of fishing raking and cooking proteus and the shalope would close the coast once it was full dark launch a cutter and a spyingout party on the evening of their arrival to determine which spot the pirates might be using if they were even there of course if barataria was more convenient than any inlet farther west like atchafalaya bay or were they present all four of proteuss boats would be used to land a mixed party of seamen and marines who would march a short distance overland to take the shore encampment under fire at the same time the shalope would go for the pirates ship and any capture they might have made curling round behind to block their escape if theyd come down bayou barataria or the ouatchas river like mr pollock had supposed it made sense to imagine that they would run back that way if overpowered poling and paddling like mad m pirogues to escape to lose their pursuers in the maze of coulees or bayous that they alone knew the shalopes light guns and swivels could slaughter the dugout log canoes and flatbottomed boats now as to who leads which lewrie posed gesturing for them to take seats and accept glasses of claret now they were finished with the chart and this was the sticky part as commanding officer of hms proteus one who had already earned his captaincy lewrie customarily should have left the hard chores to his junior officers for how else could they ever gain notice with admiralty except by the successful doing of some brave deed mentioned favourably in their captains report of the action of such things a successful career was made promotion and advancement earned command of their own warships someday bought with bloody fatal risks yet lewrie wished to be in at the kill to see firsthand or cause firsthand the deaths of the de guilleris lanxade and balfa that cousin of theirs that don rubio monaster whod most likely taken the shots at him and was reputedly as tight as ticks with them all do something with that lying slut charite though he did admittedly feel squeamish qualms should she be slain mister devereux to take all his marines for the landing party it goes without saying lewrie declared with a grin knowing how his elegant and efficient marine officer relished independent action they lifted their glasses to each other devereux smiling wolfishly mister langlie as first officer to oversee our frigates approach inshore sir capt nicely said with a grunt knowing that lt langlie would be crestfallen if i as temporary commander of this squadron may deem best hmm with mister adair to assist lewrie said mister catterall to lead the seamen of the shore landing and take charge of the boats progress to the beach thankee sir the burly catterall hooted with glee ready to elbow everyone within reach to gloat over his good fortune even if he could be a bobbing corpse not two days hence we do have mister darling handy nicely posed your pardon captain nicely lewrie gently objected but he is not known to the ships people neither for that fact is mister gamble tarry and efficient a midshipman as hes served in my absence if i may sir as proteuss captain i prefer her own people to participate after what the pirates did to some of her people they have a personal stake if you will in the mister darling and mister adair with lieutenant langlie will manage proteus captain nicely decided whilst shall take overall command of the boat party and you captain lewrie shall command the shalope well sir lewrie gawped trying to finesse his objection politely and squirming uneasily in his chair dear as id wish to see things done to a proper turn dye really think that damme i do sir capt nicely rejoined all smiles and verve privilege of my seniority dye see oh well not get in the way of the younger lads who need to make their names but if those pirates are in there and if theyve been successful i would no more be able tsit by and fidget than i could abide twatch another man eat my supper then tell me how tasty it was hah are we successful i intend to write fulsomely of all participants in my report to admiralty so no onell suffer for want of credit call me an old warhorse if you must captain lewrie but i cant turn down the chance for real action and so i shant gold fever more like lewrie uncharitably thought in this case silver nightsweats very well sir he said knowing that further quibbling could be deemed insubordination in that case ill need mister adair and a midshipman with me mister larkins an energetic laddy and at least eighteen hands mister darling and midshipman gamble may stay aboard proteus to second the first lieutenant well have four more hands at any rate sir lt adair glumly told them still disappointed to not play a larger role the men mister pollock loaned you off his brig once word got round that we could be in the way of substantial prizemoney those four asked to speak with me and ended up taking ships articles since they already had their chests and kits their guinea joining bounties are all profit to them too sir in at the kill lewrie capt nicely cheered they desire to be in at the kill as to your request for your own lieutenant and midshipman to accompany you aboard the shalope i say done and done ha ha nicely slapped the desktop with his palm as if to seal the bargain and a full bumper with all of you gentlemen from my own stock of wines a toast to our complete success which boisterous slap and cry elicited ominous hissing moaning and some spits from toulon and chalky now well hidden neath the starboard side settee they even despise the sound of him by now lewrie sardonically thought as aspinall produced a brace of claret bottles either that or were in for a whole lot o trouble chapter twentynine theyre there sir lt langlie told him once hed gained the deck two big schooners anchored off the tip of grand terre on the west side of the channel mister jugg recognised the blackun that set him and our party on the tortugas but the other is even bigger a topsl schooner that we didnt recognise sir sop to his ego and career prospects lewrie told himself the bold unsupported probe but not the lion s share of any battle damn they did take a prize just one so it must be a richun talk about your silver fever for i think ive caught it how close did you get sir lewrie quickly asked just about shaking himself to clear his mind of avaricious images did you see any preparations dug batteries or watchtowers we grounded on the beach sir lt langlie proudly announced glorying in his small but risky part of the endeavour boldy done on those flattopped indian mounds we could see a few sentries we got within about half a cable id reckon it before we feared their firelight might expose us sir theyre celebrating sir three sheets to the wind as drunk as lords lots of caterwauling and fiddling capering and dancing lt langlie snickered his teeth shining in the darkness as he broadly grinned long as we observed em the sentries atop the earth mounds came and went spent half their time jawing with their shipmates down below and sneaking swigs from crocks or bottles when they thought no one was looking no batteries sir no entrenchments that we could spy though mister jugg thought he saw springs set on the blackhulled schooners bower and kedge cables so an hour fore dawn and theyll mostlike be fallingdown drunk and insensible lewrie surmised better and better a grand nights work mister langlie damned fine thank you sir langlie gladly replied and thank you for the opportunity to no one saw you and your party dye think lewrie fretted of a sudden dont think so sir no lt langlie told him pensive for a moment no hue and cry thats for certain well thats fine then lewrie decided letting out a muchrelieved sigh and thank you mister langlie for an arduous task nobly done er aye aye sir if you will sir id admire the shalope fetched alongside so i may go aboard her lewrie ordered turning stiffly formal i give you charge of proteus til my return or the completion of our little enterprise sir get her as deep into the channel as you think practicable mister langlie and her guns well within range even the carronades if thats possible directly sir langlie assured him damme i like this frigate hellishfine mister langlie just as she is paintwork included hmm lewrie declared chuckling as he clapped his first lieutenant on the shoulder ill take good care of her sir no worries i have none sir lewrie replied especially knowing that any scrapes and suchd be your sad task to repair once back in port boudreaux balfa and his son fusilier toiled away on the dark bay side of the captured spanish schooner shifting kegs from her entryport to the sole of a dowdy paintpeeling and flatbottomed lugger a singlemasted boat that could go almost anywhere up the bayous or the coulees that a pirogue could go if one knew the maze of waterways like the palm of ones hand as did balfa his son and several of his neighbours whod come along on the raiding cruise kegs of silver were shifted from the lugger to their flatbottomed boats and pirogues their shares for participating as well as a little something extra that balfa and his neighbours would rather not have the others know a thing about chere mo lemme toi oui mo lemme toi avec tou mo coeur mo lemme toi chere comme tit cochon lemme la boul he sang softly covertly perhaps to hide the sly guffaw at the trick he was playing on all of them else he would be roaring out loud dear i love you so yes i love you so with all my heart i love you dear like the little pig loves mud hee hee heel papa the others fusilier balfa fretted in a whisper if we steal dem blind dey come after us an kill us naw fusilier come dawn everbody gonna shinny up dere own side i tell ya boudreaux softly snickered we just takin our own shares a little early is all for safekeepin comprends mon fils i don know fusilier timidly objected counting off a new keg as it was manhandled across their lugger to a waiting pirogue that would make twenty kegs so far he reckoned and more was coming just in case a spanish guarda costa or one of those perfidious british menowar ran across them before theyd reached the safety of barataria bay over eight hundred kegs had been put aboard le revenant so if one ship was taken the cruise wouldnt be a total loss for the survivors fusiliers papa had told him on the sly that the take was nowhere near what their buccaneers expected but that he was to shut his mouth about that until the whole cargo was broken out and the truth revealed in the morning when their crew would be groggy and hungover perhaps gullible enough to settle for what was in hand there was enough rum and arrack enough barricos of rough mexican wine to keep the men pliable and hot enough to work the ships back to grand terre but not sober enough to wonder where the rest of the money was dread of being taken by a passing warship had sped their labours in shifting some of the cargo then breaking off suddenly and setting sail homeward with the rest soon to be discovered balfa and lanxade would declare that they would take less than their customary shares so the men would not be cheated just as soon as the de guilleris and their arrogant compatriots were accused of supplying them with false information a nebulous but hopefully believable plot would emerge with the banker maurepas to skim off some of the silver as soon as it landed in new orleans jerome lanxade would even suggest that maurepas bistineau and the de guilleris might have conspired to steal some of the silver from the prize during the night which would conveniently explain why boudreaux balfa was taking some tonight and wouldnt jerome be surprised balfa gleefully thought as he shouldered another heavy keg from one of his cousins aboard the prize and carefully set it by the others in the luggers amidships he reckoned that he might be able to make off with about silver dollars which he might split with jerome or he might not maybe even if the water in the creeks coulees sloughs and bayous was up and they could float that much away did he take a reduced share of the loot in the morning not the he was due but only say the balfas would be rich for life rich beyond imagining when he combined his public share with a little trifling miniscule private one even if he had to give half to lanxade to mollify him once he found that his imaginative fabulation was true hee hee and just to be on the safe side he had a second lugger for a quick departure once the shareout was done before anyone with quick wits could suspect him after all come dawn those witless playacting bebes would be feeding the crabs the prize schooner would be emptied stripped and burned and le revenant awarded to the strongest loudestvoiced and quickestwitted pirate who wanted to stay in business vite vite mes chers balfa stealthily urged un autre beaucoup dautres another a lot o others its so pagan charite tittered as she sat crosslegged on a blanket atop one of the ancient indian earth mounds where she and her brothers and kin had by right as leaders put up a trio of leanto shelters for the night like something out of an old book firelight flickered high and heathen from several bonfires on the beach from cooking fires where cauldrons simmered and blackiron pans sizzled up savoury things the flickering yellow and orange glow from so many fires lent an unreal aura to the shoreline for over fifty yards from end to end from the beach line to the scrubby bushes above the beach where the wood had been gathered and illuminated the tall trees that shrouded their secret lair nd the betraying sight of the ships masts from view from any passing searchers the light was reflected back onto the rough buccaneer camp by the bleachedbone whiteness of other lower mounds of oyster mussel and clam shells that had been heaped up first by aboriginal indians then added to by white fishermen wanderers and outlaws they were not as tall or as deep as the roughly flattopped earth mounds but they snaked along like a miniature mountain chain slumped into each other a bit inshore the camp could boast a few rare tents but most huts were of freshcut saplings and thin limbs over which scrap canvas or blankets had been draped more leantos hastily thrown up by their sailors or built for them by the many wild rovers who made a precarious life along the bay and the inland lake wild eerie and isolated as these remote isles were some few people did reside there and even more camped temporarily and barataria had been a pirates lair and hurricane hole for ages and where there were pirates and bold buccaneers there would be the chance for quick profits off their witless freespending almost as soon as their mast heads had been spotted redsailed luggers had veered down to them and somehow the word had spread drawing rowing boats swamp craft and pirogues full of hopeful entrepreneurs cooks had built leantos and fires shrimpers and crabbers had turned up with their catches farmers had arrived with bushel baskets filled with pod peas and corn for boiling or roasting ears fruit backcountry wines pigs chickens and goats carefully hoarded bottles of costly cognac or apple brandy from dearest la belle france turned up for sale flounder mullet and mullet roe even humble meat like muskrat possum rabbit and raccoon sizzled on little spits and peeled twigs their aromas blending with that of fresh cornbreads there were halfnaked spaniards and canary islanders very poor acadians and even a few french creoles whod fallen on hard times some lightskinned free blacks swarthier negres who just might be maroons escaped from their masters plantations and eking out a meagre existence as honest runaways or even a few slyeyed exslaves now in a predatory armed marauder gang like that of the devilish saint john whose murderous horde were known to lurk along the west shore of the bay there were cooks there were gamblers and there were putains too of all nations and races some of those women danced singly as the drunken sailors danced to the music of the itinerant musicians some nude and glistening put on a show to music to lure tossed coins then the socketfee from the pirate who was the most enflamed they flung themselves down under a leanto and grunted in time with whoever had found them fetching then sponged off in the salt water of the bay standing kneedeep between the many grounded boats before going back to look for a fresh customer capitaine lanxade said they only think they know how to celebrate helio ventured to say now that charite seemed to be her old self again after her hysterical tirade of a day or two before this is nothing to the old days he said these modern buccaneers of ours cant hold a candle to the wild men he knew in his youth and weve only seen three fights don rubio added with a disappointed sniff and none of them to the death warily don rubio still distanced himself from charites side for if she could forgive her brothers and her cousin even speak civilly to them again yet she still gathered her brows together and scowled at him whenever it was necessary for them to converse her voice distant and cold the night is still young jeanmarie rancour commented with a hopeful chuckle and shrug one never knows hmmph charite said turning to look at helio and hippolyte even if this is only a dim shadow of an oldtime pirate gathering it is still a wondrous show tortuga and topsail island port royal before the earthquake destroyed it nassau on new providence before capitaine woodes rogers cleaned it out and him an old pirate too no honour among thieves the saying goes cherie helio cited the firelight the blacks she rhapsodised in spite of him quite romantically taken by the scenes the smells so much nudity on display why one could almost imagine us transported among those savage corsairs of high barbary in algiers where the sultans buy beautiful virgin girls for their hareems christ hippolyte sneered with a disparaging groan novels romances written mostly by eunuchs in a parisian garret theres not a single thing worth a sou in fiction books most written by anglais eunuchs jeanmarie guffawed french writers at least have the necessities to write romances from experience not their imagination charite frowned over that comment her lips pursed in an argumentative moue as she thought of telling them a thing or two about how equipped with the necessities some englishmen were but didnt what was done was done she told herself and shed never see her englishman again there was tonight though this heady and rapturous pagan display to savour tonight she was not a patriotic revolutionary she was mary read or anne bonny notorious girl pirates of ancient fame she sat crosslegged on the ground in breeches and boots with a sheathed dagger in her sash a blade up her sleeve pistols at her hips and her trusty sword standing close at hand in her lap there was a coinsilver charger for her supper plate looted from a spanish captains quarters and she used heavy ornate silver utensils from a dead mans sideboard she dined on roast goat and pork like the bold caribbean boucaniers had on peeled shrimp and rice corn on the cob peas and cornbread by her right knee stood a large silver tankard the piratical rogues sort with a clear glass bottom so big it could hold a whole pint of beer half a bottle of wine or an entire flask of brandy or rum this night it was strong heady amber rum dining alfresco but hearty swigging rum in a savage firelight witnessing a bawdy raucous carnival to celebrate a victory a grand coup a magnificent adventure oh it was simply wondrous the bonfire smoke and cookfire smoke wreathed and melded with a rising mist to encapsulate the scene as if nature made for them a ghostly theatre she would remember this all the rest of her life chapter thirty fog dammit thell lewrie growled under his breath clinging to a larboard shroud aboard his borrowed shalope shouldve expected that shouldve known better they were standing into the deepwater channel between the isles both of which were now invisible behind the dank banks of mist astern of them would be proteus but she was invisible too and just before dawn there would be very little sea breeze and a nexttonothing land breeze either on what dying windmemory that still stirred the sea they barely made steerageway and their shalopes gaff mainsl and jibs limply sagged and rustled like a toolarge shirt on a starving man lewrie peered astern past the vessels tiny quarterdeck where the enigmatic toby jugg tended to her tillerbar proteus spread acres of sail and had a much longer waterline even on this slack wind shed amass a knot or two more forward progress and unless her lookouts were keen might loom up blind and trample the shalope under her forefoot even if she avoided colliding a drastic haulingoff would steal all her hardwon speed and it would take a quartergale to get her moving again worse sheering away crosschannel could strand her on one of the invisible shoals and shed be out of the fight before it had even begun leaving lewrie and his small party vastly outnumbered the bays shallower sir lt adair said coming aft from the leadsmen in the bows who swung for soundings passing their discoveries aft by hand signals not the usual cries yes and lewrie snapped wondering if there was a way to recall the landing party wait for a better fogless morning shallow water heats faster than deep sir adair said on as the bay heats it should make a touch more breeze and thin this fog this humid air though mister adair lewrie countered as the bay water warms itll make for a thicker fog to clear would take hours far past dawn round noon by the looks of it it has thinned a tad sir lt adair hesitantly opined but as if to bely that hope a thicker bank of fog loomed up ahead slowly rolling down to swallow them and cut their visibility to a mere stones throw ahead of the jib boom and bowsprit but it had been driven down to them by a slightly stronger breath of wind and the sails rustled and meagrely filled out tackle blocks and parrelballs clinkclanked or groaned and for a few moments lewrie could hear the burbling sound of the shalopes hull making a knot more way through the water and the fog seemed to thin a trifle bout a full cables visibility now sir lt adair pointed out aye sir thinning with a touch more wind now too fine for us lewrie muttered looking aft as if he could sear through the foreboding mist were gaffrigged foreandaft but it might be a dead muzzier for proteus square on her bows shell be stalled inirons and helpless and without his frigates artillery thered be no support for his assault on the buccaneers camp no support for the landing party either if lt langlie could not even row her into range much less in sight in this fog using her pounders at rangetorandomshot then lewries small and divided assault force might be massacred half by half and thered be nothing lewrie could do to prevent it worse it would take much too long to send a boat to shore to recall captain nicelys men to go about and try to find proteus in the fog lewrie crossed his fingers behind his back knowing that for better or for worse they were now committed but the breeze did feel fresher and the fog did look just that much thinner so damme that smell lewrie said as a sour odour arrived on that slight wind he lifted his face and sniffed deep like a hound cookfires sir lt adair exclaimed in a guarded whisper as he too picked up the reek of woodash and smoke spilled friedout fats and castoff gristle from meats and the lowtide tang of boiled shellfish we must be very close to the noreast tip of grand terre sir almost onto the camp alert the hands mister adair lewrie bade forcing down his frets and donning the steely determinedly confident air of a leader sure of success muskets and pistols loaded but not yet primed do you and mister larkin oversee that personally sir mister jugg helm over a bit pinch us up to larboard half a point no more in for the penny in for the pound lewrie grimly thought as he tried the draw of his sword in its scabbard and pray god dont let me get half these men killed in the next hour lt catterall simply bloody hated snakes and felt his skin go icy as he shied from another particularly dangerouslooking serpent his swordpoint aimed at its hideous cottonwhite mouth and fangs as he gave it two sword lengths of berth eyes darting all round to avoid stumbling into another as he fled the latest one grand terre island was working alive with the bastards and lt catterall was already miserable enough from the moment hed stepped ashore hed been swarmed by midges gnats whining mosquitoes and wrensized moths his exposed skin itched like mad from their stings or bites his face felt puffy and pebbled with mosquito welps grit and mud still filled his shoes from wading sightless through the marshes puddles and rivulets his feet chafed and squished with every step and hed splashed mud and foulsmelling wet something higher than his knee buckles catterall even vaguely envied soldiers they could wear spatterdashes from their shoe soles to the crutch boot would have been better but his single pair were new and he hadnt imagined hed need them this badly so their extremely slow groping march from the beach on the south shore through the forests tangles thorny shrubs and clinging vines had been a horror too utterly mystifying and confusing for hours it had been black as a boot and hed barely been able to see his hand in front of his face everyone was forced to shamble shuffle and put each foot ahead of the next on sheer faith led by a few marines whod been woodsmen the halts were many the progress treacleslow and the forest was an eerie foe to seamen marines and civilised gentlemen used to open fields and sensible terrain owls hooted unnamed things cawed and chirped insects sawed and squeaked all about them and armed men shivered and took fright at every unexplained rustle close by in the underbrush once off the beach the air had been dank and close too warm for woolen uniforms too dense to breathe comfortably stinking with raw oozing dankness and putrefaction with foul sappy odours then had come the fog just as it was almost possible to see making the march even more ominous and each scampering rodent was an enemy scout dashing off to give the alarm and there were baretailed ratlike things that grinned as big as bloody spaniels scurrying away almost at their feet ringtailed and masked beasts that chittered and growled possums and raccoons lt devereux had whispered to calm them and all quite harmless humped hardshelled lizardy creatures called armadillos disturbed squirrels in the trees whose sudden barks could startle catterall to crying out halt here a marine hissed ahead of him passin th word we halt here fer a bit hold here catterall repeated as loud as he dared both arms outspread to indicate a ragged skirmish line for his men it was all taking too long he thought in the dark and this predawn fog it was possible theyd gotten hopelessly lost and when the sun rose theyd find themselves far from where they were needed unable to hit the pirates camp in time to coordinate with captain lewries seaward attack the pirates would be awake and ready for them itd turn into a disaster and passin th word there awfcers front the marine said in a raspy weary whisper lt catterall almost tiptoed forward trying to go quiet but the many scrub bushes and palmlike swishing greenery made that a forlorn hope he finally made out two men who stood before the kneeling sailors and marines men in cocked hats peeking round a thick cypress at something devereux and capt nicely smell them sir devereux asked with a happy grin we are there they are there just yonder the other side of this wall a wall sir catterall said trying not to sound windy to his comradesinarms damme not a fortification is it irregular capt nicely hesitantly opined wiping sweat from his brows with a calico handkerchief not laid stone perhaps a dug entrenchment with a firing step behind it damme capt nicely groused softly all evening long all during the ferrying then the arduous trek through the swampy wastes nicely had practically boiled over with energy and enthusiasm now he was taken aback by an unlookedfor obstacle this fog though it was thinning as a light wind sprang up combined with the fearsomelooking fortification was almost the last straw and his eagerness seemed flown from him the imperturbable capt nicely was just about ready to chew on a thumbnail in worry in the fog the frigate and the shalope could not support them or even find them and now this and it was impossible to call off the ships to withdraw if the fog dissipated and the ships attacked without the shore party the pirates might just sail farther up the bay beyond reach without the landing party ravaging and surprising their encampment no sentries though devereux took note mightve heard us thrashin about and already mustered behind this wall just waitin catterall grumbled dont croak mister catterall capt nicely chid him their fields of fire havent been cleared lt devereux said in further assessment pointing at the stumps of downed trees and the many small trees that still stood the irregular clumps of scrub bush that remained damn shoddy way to maintain a fortification really the low places here and there could mask small cannon but were too few to attack that capt nicely sighed if it is manned our villains are alerted might there be a way around no time for that sir lt devereux said with a hitch to his voice and a fatalistic shrug he began to strip off his red coat and bright brass gorget unwind his scarlet officers sash and discard his sword baldric with its rectangular brass plate removing his sword from the frog and holding it scabbarded in his left hand you gentlemen will excuse me for a few minutes sirs devereux crouched down and warily sneaked from one large tree to the next til hed reached the scrub his spotless white shirt and breeches melding into the mists hoping that he was mostly invisible briefly praying that no marksman or sentinel behind the forbidding wall had already taken aim at him sweet jesus devereux whispered as he steeled himself then rose to a half crouch and sprinted to the cover of a clump of bushes halfway there drymouthed panting fearsweat popping on his skin he scanned the wall for danger it was one thing for him to stand by his men and order volleys he stood the same odds as a private facing enemy fire then but this there was more sand than grass near the foot of the irregular roughsurfaced impediment as if a lane had been cleared nearerto it didnt exactly look intentional its forward slope too gentle to impede a determined infantryman so what sprint again he crunched to the base of the wall gasping like a hound fears gibbering at his brain his nerves twanging like harpsichord strings chest upon its lumpy irregular roughness as he tried to quiet the bellows roar that came from his own frankly scared breathing wanting to shush noises that his slightest movement made the hollow tinkling and gravelly what the bloody hell his left hand came up from his sword hilt to take up a palm full of loose broken sharpedged but weathered shells clam and mussel larger sunbleached oyster shells the smaller shells he rolled in his hand like dice before very quietly putting them back in place fighting to contain his giggles he crept to his left under one of the high heaps til he reached a low saddle between mounds peeked cautiously over it and felt another giggling fit swell up which he quickly stifled then got to the business of reconnaissance wishing hed thought to fetch away pencil and paper it wasn t a wall at all lt devereux silently exulted just a garbage midden the sleeping pirates camp was just the other side of it stretching perhaps fifty or sixty yards along the far shore under the looming bulk of a series of odd flattopped earth mounds and them sloped so gently that he could almost mistake them for natural rises the shoreline wasnt an hundred yards further north with boats drawn up on the beach two schooners could almost be made out in the mists anchored perhaps two hundred yards from the beach in deeper water a blackhulled redstriped schooner and another lt devereux despaired that hed left his short pocket telescope in his coat after a long few minutes of observation he crept back beneath the cover of a high point in the mounds steeled himself once more for the unseen sentrys musket then dashed back to rejoin his fellow officers well damn my eyes capt nicely gasped when told the nature of that forbidding fort allow me to suggest sir that we bring our men up to the foot of the shell heaps lt devereux said as he donned his uniform again load muskets and pistols my men to fix bayonets as well then wait for our ships arrival once the camps well stirred to confront that threat would be the ideal time to strike right to the beach cut right through their camp and take possession of the earthen mounds so our musketry has the only high ground forcing the pirates to clamber up in the face of our cutlasses bayonets and muzzles sir damme i like it lieutenant devereux capt nicely chirped suddenly reinfused with pep and vinegar like it indeed hah hah and two schooners did ye say sir a prize theyve taken or one flies what looks to be a french tricolour sir tother has no flag aloft devereux replied as he hung his rank gorget about his neck once more and clapped on his cocked hat taking time to set it in the regulation manner though the wind is limp sir harbour watch aboard em nicely pressed couldnt tell sir devereux said with a wry grin as he took his telescope from a side pocket of his coat i quite forgot to put this in my waistband so then lets be up against your heaps sir and ill squint at em myself capt nicely cheerfully eagerly declared chapter thirtyone capitaine jerome lanxade has slept aboard the pirate schooner avoiding his soontobedisappointed and angry sailors as long as he could savouring the safe privacy of her masters quarters lanxade had slept alone too none of the churlish drabs who had flocked to their camp had caught his eye besides with so much loot soon to be his he could afford to be picky in new orleans where he would soon close out his accounts and pack up his valuables there were at least a round dozen young courtesans or bored and sporting wives of his acquaintance some obliging young unmarried girls whod be glad to give him a rousing sendoff on his honourable retirement across the sea to parts unknown the sorts who didnt laugh when he took off his finery and revealed his tautlaced corset a shambling steward fetched him a silver pot of hot cafe noir and he sipped from an ornate meissen china cup and saucer as he shaved himself never trust unruly pirates with razors to do itand combed in fresh hair dye then pomade through his thinning locks daubing new wax on his pointy mustachios and twirling them stiffly horizontal he then shucked his silk dressing gown and donned his constricting appliance jerome lanxade never let a steward or body slave do it for him that felt demeaning making le feroce an object of fun not fear he laced it as tight as it could go going almost purple in the face before he drew on his snug breeches and buttoned them up capt lanxade heaved a worrisome sigh then fully dressed at last went out on deck for a welcome breath of fresh but moist mistladen air the dawns first cigaro alit in one hand and a fresh cup of bracingly strong coffee in the other he scowled at the beach at the sleeping camp and was satisfied that most of their henchmen would be weeping with hangovers too fuddled to think straight when he and boudreaux balfa broke their sad news most of the scows and pirogues were gone the honest backcountry folk had packed up and left once theyd sold their last goods in the wee hours of a pirates celebration it was dangerous to linger too long among the redeyed murderous lanxade looked over at their prize schooner there stood old boudreaux himself just arisen and yawning like a shambling swamp bear stretching to get the kinks out scratching his hide and even grating his back against the schooners mainmast lanxade rehearsed his plan for betraying the youngsters in his mind once more once the hands were hot and outraged as he would make them bind them all first then do the reduced shareout then offer the ships to the unlikeliest most despised mate among them setting them to fighting among themselves whilst he and boudreaux made their getaway cross the bay and into the bayouswithout getting savaged like sick sharks by the rest of the pack and torn to bloody gobbets what happened to the de guilleri men their wheyfaced cousin or that arrogant peacock halfdago afterward was of no matter to him though he doubted the men would kill charite to ensure her silence she was too well liked they might turn her loose eventually lanxade imagined send her back to new orleans after they sailed under their new leader and thered be nothing she could do about itlong after he had departed for safer climes that was certain oh she might get used of course protected then raped by the strongest to emerge as capitaine jerome even wished he could stay to rape her himself after all her empty flirtations with him charite deserved a comeuppance the servicing of a real man who knew eh a sailor up forward by the fuming galley funnel cried he pointed over the bows eastward towards the main channel a ship what lanxade responded in a shocked screech blanching with alarm a drunken sailor roused himself in lanxades way as he strode forward got shoved to the rails where he began to puke overside strange ship the sailor up forrud added guns run out to arms lanxade bellowed seizing the lanyard on the ships bell by the forecastle and clanging away with it all hands on deck dammit dammit wake up you bastards up and man the guns he glowered at boudreaux aboard the prize was pleased to see him capering an alarm of his own among his few crewmen who had slept aboard her the camp though lanxade leaped to a swivelgun by the starboard bow jerked the tompion from its muzzle but found that no goosequill fuse was handy no slowmatch burning no tinderbox he swung the light guns barrel skyward stepped back puffed on his cigaro to a redhot tip then stuck it against the touchhole hoping that a pricked cartridge bag had been left loaded bang a faint howl of musket or pistol balls shot into the air and that stern startling noise was enough to rouse the campsite roust out the last pigdrunk heavy sleepers aboard le revenant nom dun chien lanxade angrily hissed as he saw to his own personal weapons the strange vessela goodsized shalopeadvanced on him bowson you spanish dogs have bitten off more than you can swallow this time well show you what a real fight is but what was this a stronger whiff of wind abeam the shalope flirted out her flag and it wasnt the crowned redgoldred of spain but the red white and blue crosses of the anglais the hellish anglais lanxade yelped in stupefaction realising that that distant prize theyd taken off dominica might have spelled their ruin vengeance had come upon them with lit fuses and bared steel small ship though lanxade thought imagining a small crew to put up against his cutthroat desperados he might win after all off the same american smuggling brig that had yielded toby jugg as a reluctant volunteer a year or so before hms proteus had also garnered a dozen or so deadlyaccurate yankeemade pennsylvania rifles bound for rebel general toussaint louverture and his officers on st domingue those that hadnt ended up in the hands of capt lewrie or the ships officers marine lieutenant blase devereux had appropriated for his keenest marksmen when posted aloft in the fightingtops picking off enemy officers might be deemed by some to be ungentlemanly or dishonourable but lt devereux was one as was captain lewrie who ascribed more to alls fair in love and war that fair fighting was for dimwitted fools i believe theyre sufficiently stirred up and misdirected lt devereux muttered once hed taken another peek over the top of a low spot in the shell midden noting how those pirates able to rouse themselves and stand erect after their nights excesses were all peering and gesticulating at the shalopes approach from out of the mists do you think sir that we should take advantage of their astonished condition even if the captain has yet to close with them i do believe we should sir captain nicely was quick to say aye drawing his workaday smallsword from its plain black scabbard up and at em mister devereux and god uphold the right marines shun devereux bellowed marksmen to the tops of the mounds rest form line marines level muskets came up to shoulders the fixed bayonets wanly glittering in the misty dawn cock yer locks take careful aim fire devereux howled barely thirty yards away stunned hungover pirates stumbled to their feet not understanding the orders in english but knowing that danger was present they came slithering out of their leantos fighting weariness and their encumbering blankets some saw the invaders whose red coats rarely worn aboard ship but for ceremonial duties and harbour watch blossomed atop or behind the bleached shell hillocks as red as poppies or blood the buccaneers barely had time to blink or rub their disbelieving eyes to shout a quick warning before those muskets barked and spat great spouts of powder smoke before some much sharper cracks from rifles stunned their ears reload devereux yelled marksmen look for ralliers proteuses up lt catterall shouted in an irate steers roar the leatherlunged sort of cry that could carry from the quarterdeck to the bowsprit in a full gale of wind level take aimfire catteralls sailors who far outnumbered the marine complement popped up from behind the shell mounds on either flank of the marines dressed in their usual sloptrousers loose shirts and tarred hats or head rags less used to musketry or the rigid weapons drill of their compatriots they were but there were more of them their targets were within a long pistol shot and brown bess would not be denied reeling scurrying buccaneers were scythed down at least ten by the marines initial volley perhaps another half dozen claimed by proteuss lessskillful sailors a few cooks or vendors were killed or wounded people whod stayed to sleep off the nights revels the gapemouthed nearly innocent who stood still too long in the wrong place at the wrong time fell howling beside the panicked bloodyhanded guilty while others spurred into witless flight amid scared buccaneers a raddled and terrified whore or two rushing from their borrowed beds were gunned down as well massed volleys of musketry were as uncaring as clouds of grapeshot recover and reload lt catterall roared over his frights in the eerie forests and never happier than when challenged to mindless combat he cocked his pistols lock took a huntsmans lead on a running pirate with a musket in his hands fired and whooped with joy to see him tumble over and sprawl instantly lifeless pick your targets make em count lads take aim andfire lt devereux commanded sweeping his sword blade chopping down merde boudreaux balfa gawped at the first shots eyes fixed on the approaching shalope with her gunports open oh merde we be up shits creek fusilier viens ici son come here quick hes not aboard pierre la fitte told him as he scrambled up from belowdecks he and jean went ashore after you went to sleep what i told him they went to see the girls get ah pierre confessed damn you damn your little

de cables an let dis bitch go on de tide move man vite vite allons i get my little brother pierre objected the spanish have us for certain all we can do is run for it and i wont let those salauds hang him im taking a boat for shore then pierre backed his decision with a hand about the hilt of a large dagger you can do what you like mutinous dog balfa sneered spitting at the mans feet go den run wit your tail tween your legs faithless son of a whore pierre was overside in a twinkling paddling like mad in one of the hollowlog pirogues balfa shouted for his remaining sailors to go to le revenant and man the guns hed take care of their prize and all their silver hed be with them in a twinkling or not that damned pierre was right things were all up with them and it was time to obey the old maxim of sauve quie peut run like hell and save what one could balfa ran forward and plucked a heavy boarding axe from the foremast arms chest he stood straddling the nineinch anchor cable a moment later and began to hack at it it took only a few powerful strokes to part it then leap out of the way as the last strands exploded apart the inner end snapping inboard and the bitter end slithering into the murky depths of the bay the spanish schooner began to sidle sternward driven by an incoming tide began to make a slight leeway even under bare poles to the faint land breeze balfa ran aft and quickly did the same to the stern kedgeanchor cable but realised that the prize would drift til she took the ground on grand terre perhaps no more than two miles to the west hed have to burn her bare feet thundering on the midships companionway boudreaux balfa dashed below and snatched a lit lanthorn from a hook set in one of the overhead deck beams and dire as things looked he started to grin a sly little grin he and his acadian friends and neighbours had gotten a bit more than carried away shifting coin kegs during the night like they would when snacking on the peanuts their slaves insisted on growing greedy arms and hands had loaded hundreds of silverfilled barricos aboard a fleet oi pirogues flatboats and luggers leaving only half the kegs that had been aboard six hundred thousand spanish dollars spanish never know where it go balfa mused starting to titter and wheeze over his little geste dem bebes and jerome never know neither by the light of the lanthorn in his meaty paw balfa lumbered all the way forward to the cabletiers and the spanish bosuns stores he ripped out fresh resiny spare planking rigging rope loose oakum bales and kegs of paint and linseed oil and liberally sluiced down the cabletiers and the decks another lanthorn hung overhead but not for long it was filled with whale oil already hot and runny from being lit all night and at once it made a dandy splash of fire amidships there were looted sea chests hammocks and bed linen by the bale too and a second lanthorn set them alight quickly aft the mates and captains quarters were full of papers and trash with even more lanthorns available his tortuous straw mattress torn open and scattered went up in a twinkling and serve it right for his itches by damn balfa went overside to larboard what had been the dark unlit side the night before where a last little flatboat trailed from its painter at the foot of the mainmast chain platform with two pistols in his belt a dagger and cutlass on the boats sole balfa freed the boat and began to row round the schooner to go save his boy take aim fire atop their earthen mound the first crackle of musketry snapped the de guilleris from their rough beds as if a bolt of lightning struck the hillock all sudden bluewhite light sizzle and thunder crack hippolyte and helio sharing a leanto both sat up quickly gasping as if throwing off a shared and terrifying nightmare cracking heads on the boundtogether saplings in a flurry of arms and legs and thrashing blankets their eyes blared owlwide in alarm they were bootless and coatless their weapons laid handily aside but for long moments any thought of dressing or arming themselves was lost in shaky fumblings as they tangled with each other even as a second harsh volley rattled out and shouts and screams assailed their ears hippolyte crawled to the open end of the leanto and began to stand with a boot in hand hopping as he raised his foot to draw it on but the humming of musket balls past his head and his older brothers sweeping arm threw him fiat keep down helio growled in his ear regaining his wits faster than hippolyte helio groped for his boots writhed on his side to don them then bellycrawled on his elbows and knees for his weapons rubio jean helio yelled were with you don rubio shouted back from behind the leanto he shared with jeanmarie rancour both had slithered out to hide behind its insubstantial shelter dragging boots clothes and rifled muskets with them charite stay down cherie well deal with it don rubio stomped into his boots and fastened his sword about his waist he clapped his egretplumed wide hat on his head flung up the tarpaulin that had covered the leanto and reached between the saplings for his pistols to jam into his waistband then warily stood up hands working the complicated mechanism of his girandoni airrifle a fresh airflask buttstock had to be screwed on the magazine under the barrel topped off with lead balls mon dieu merde alors jeanmarie quavered as he gathered up his clothes and guns hands visibly shaking and his white face pinched who is it rubio whats happening don rubio monaster didnt answer him the son of a pureblooded spanish hidalgo a genuine creole did not panic as that weakkneed rancour boy did he was horn to command born to lead lesser people his eyes did widen in shock though much as jeanmaries did to witness the camp and its doings their bold pirates the hangerson and the whores were dashing about like witless chickens scrabbling in their bedding for their portable loot or their weapons crying aloud in chaos and not knowing which way to stumble they swarmed as unknowing as bees from a hive that someone had shot from longdistance wheeling and darting ready for vengeance but unable to discover where the shooter was there at the shell mounds don rubio cried pleased that he could keep his head feeling that he was as sanguine as a professional soldier to react so quickly and so well jean your rifle quickly helio hippolyte the shell mounds shoot at them another volley was fired from the shell heaps the powder smoke almost hiding a ragged double line of men dressed like sailors garde vous mes bravesrubio bellowed down to their sailors there is the enemy in the oyster piles to arms i tell you and fight them on the next mound east where some sentries had been posted he saw from the corner of his eye a buccaneer or two raise their muskets and shoot back which cheered him greatly a second later there was a lone cracking discharge and one of the sentries screamed as he was struck in the forehead his skull and brains erupting in a gory spray behind him before he tumbled back on his heels arms and legs spread as if he was crucified don rubio spotted the shooter atop one of the higher shell heaps a soldier in a red coat white crossbelts white breeches and kneehigh spatterdashes with a whitelaced tall hat upon his head he wasnt from any spanish regiment don rubio had ever seen but he raised his airrifle took careful aim and fired as the soldier laboured to ram a ball down the muzzle of his weapon damn he swore as his shot merely clipped the mans hat making him jump back in alarm and slidetumble down the far slope of the mound don rubio cranked another ball into the firing chamber and recocked his rifle hearing a faint hiss as he did so as the demand valve opened the gun smoke was thinning as was the mist and he shot at another redcoated soldier standing behind a waisthigh slumped heap of shells this one he struck with a feral whoop of joy as he cheered his own skill though the airrifle still was shooting high as it had when hed tried to kill that damned anglais willoughby in new orleans his target flung a hand to his breast and dropped like a stone don rubio heard the cracks of other airrifles firing near him as helio and hippolyte finally got into action by his right side he heard another crack as jeanmarie summoned up his nerves and entered the fray shrilling thinly as he saw one his shots kill a sailor too stay down charite helio was yelping go down the back of the mound and get to the beach get aboard the schooner there came another murdering volley from the redcoat soldiers scything down a few more witless buccaneers in the camp forcing those with guns or cutlasses in their hands to duck and slink backwards in the direction of the beach and the grounded boats rubio noted that some of them were starting to form up and return fire there was another belated crack then the mallet thuds of balls striking flesh and jeanmaries left hand was clawing at the sleeve of his shirt as he sank to his knees with a look of utter astonishment on his face his mouth opening and closing like a boated fish a moment later and there was a flood of bright blood spilling from his mouth down the front of his fine white shirt jean poor jean oh no charite wailed standing in the open with her hands to her mouth another of those damned redcoat men atop a shell heap rubio saw him lowering his weapon to reload it and knew that this marksman was jeans slayer aiming at his waist this time rubio fired at him and saw the bastard spin around and stumble dropping his weapon as he pitched forward and slid down the face of the mound in an avalanche of old shells got him aha charite get down we men will fight them for you he shouted to her plastering a bold confident dangerous smile on his face for her benefit marines will advance they all heard a powerful voice cry poise muskets and forward march oh hell another deeper voice was bellowing proteuses cutlasses and bayonets and charge english helio spat theyre anglais the bloodies the anglais hippolyte gawped run little sister run for your life get aboard the schooner now up here you men don rubio shouted waving his arms to catch their buccaneers attention get on the mounds and well shoot down at them hold the mounds kill the cochons he had heard somewhere that the high ground was preferable in a real battle helio came round him to his righthand side and looked down at his cousin jeanmarie rancour but that unfortunate youngster had already died his lungs and mouth filled with blood and his eyes already glazing over his rifle rubio monaster callously snapped between shots as a dauntingly long line of britishers tramped over the oyster heaps and slithered down the front faces whilst the anglais dressed as sailors came swarming more quickly from the flank cutlasses waving aloft in full bloodthirsty cry his four pistols helio use them damn you rubio jean was just a helio de guilleri swore as he dashed tears from his eyes with his shirt sleeves but gathered up the pistols and the airrifle as directed hippolyte still crouching by the leanto was already firing his girandoni fast as he could aim pull the trigger and crank and helio could see that his shots were telling so he knelt and began to shoot as well the anglais quickly took half a dozen casualties dropped right at their feet they stumbled as they tried to step over the bodies and their ragged charge all but skidded to a halt pirates were clambering up atop the mounds walking backwards as they loaded primed and fired right in the englishmens dirty faces charite had not obeyed them but had snatched up helios rifle and was inexpertly clumsily working its action to fire a few rounds of her own making helio and hippolyte shake their heads at each other at her foolishness sadly proud of her all the same first rank take aim clear them off the mounds fire those bastards a blueuniformed naval officer was bellowing down below them waving his sword in the air and pointing with a pistol in his other hand shoot those bastards lads kill em dead the volleys stuttered out loud and deeptoned and buccaneers on the forward slopes went tumbling in heaps their hands on the east mound were completely scythed away and another young man with a sword in a blue coat shrilly led an impromptu charge to its top their few men who had rallied below the centre mound where the de guilleris and don rubio fought were shot down or broke and ran round its edges for the beach run charite run helio ordered her again even as musket balls whined about them like deadly bumblebees second rank the centre mound take aim fire stunned by the suddenness of the deaths below her charite at last came to her senses she went as pale as milk might have fainted if shed waited a second longer to flee but managed to turn round as quick as a spider and scramble on her hands and knees to the back of their mound and slide down the far side on the seat of her breeches a hand still gripped whiteknuckled on the barrel of her airrifle her pinnedup long hair had come undone and she instinctively reached up to let it spill praying a silent prayer for poor jeanmarie praying too that the bloodies wouldnt shoot a woman a girl so pretty she felt her lips begin to tremble her teeth chatter uncontrollably and tears stung her eyes sobs arose from the wrenching tautness in her chest she got to her feet at the foot of the mound her legs feeling juddery and weak her feet oddly disembodied as she tried to run to find a boat mademoiselle boudreaux balfas son fusilier dashed up in company with another young lad off le revenant both were armed and charite was glad for their company damn you all come back here the other youngster yelled at the few boats still in sight those who could had scrambled into any slight hull that would float and were fleeing northward dangerously overloaded in most cases there wasnt a single pirogue left as far as they could see along the shore a boat wheres a boat we must swim out mademoiselle fusilier said trying to be calm and brave but almost shivering with fear get aboard our ship and sail out of here no we wont jean the other lad dispiritedly growled and pointed to the large shalope not a quartermile off from le revenant and their prize and stalking up slowly but remorselessly a british navy ensign atop her mainmast we must swim or die charite determined somewhere well find someone to pick us up papa will come for us fusilier added perked up considerably he must chapter thirtytwo half a point more to windward jugg lewrie snapped his eyes fixed upon the blackhulled schooner as they neared her she turned from a dark smear in the fog to a substantial and detailed fact he could hear firing off the larboard bows coming almost abeam now distinguishable pops of single muskets the sharper crack of his marines pennsylvania rifles now and then the collective chuff of a volley fired all at once they were late the wind was perverse and fickle his landing party might be getting knackered and his shalope was closing too slowly to overwhelm the pirate schooner he had no need for a telescope to see her crew scurrying to prepare to fight she had been bowson when they could first make her out through a thin patch of fog but was now slowly swinging to bare her starboard side her bloodred gunwale stripe oddly bright and ominous as they let out on her kedge cable and hauled in on the springline on her bow cable lewrie could see a flamboyantly garbed figure on her quarterdeck waving his arms and shouting at d be jerome lanxade sor jugg grimly informed him at peacocky one yonder alius woz a flash bugger six gunports each side my survivors said lewrie speculated fourpounders or sixpounders mixed perhaps our battery god what a joke they had swivels and boatguns so shortranged they couldnt use them til they were closeaboard would have to eat one or two of lanxades broadsides before getting that close hed try to be stoic in the best royal navy traditions but the odds didnt look good steer for her bows lock bowsprits and board her up forrud he feverishly schemed haul off and cross her stern might work too if there s depth enough mr pollocks borrowed shalope only drew eight feet slightly less without a cargo yet if they ran aground short of the schooner it would mean the death of them all if they crossed her stern so slowly that they caromed off her kedge cable theyd be just as helpless could end up stranded close to the beach drifting to ruin whilst the schooner cut her cables and escaped and there was still no sign of proteus ship burning beyond her sir midshipman larkin cried they did take a prize lewrie exclaimed finally reaching for his telescope damme theyve fired her with all the silver aboard her sir young mr larkin yelped sonsabitches lewrie gravelled outraged that all this might be for nought beyond justice of course and vengeance he lowered his telescope lips gloomily pursed that schooner beyond the blackhulled one was ablaze from end to end wren or mousesized flames scuttling along every inch of her standing or running rigging and great clouds of smoke beginning to belch from open hatches mister larkin lewrie stolidly ordered ill have all the swivelguns shifted to starboard along with the grappling hooks and throwing lines well board her starboard side to starboard side oye oye s aye aye sir mean tsay mr larkin chirped whenever he was excited which was rather often the lad easily lapsed into a cottagers brogue mister jugg lewrie said rounding on him pinch her up to weather like wed grapple to her bows but at the last moment i want you to slew about and go alongside her near side well give em grape and langridge pointblank then board her aye sor jugg said with a firm nod of understanding ah sah andrews whispered plucking his attention back i think shes openin her ports sah ready tfire nothing tdo but grin and bear it hey lewrie tried to jape good god amighty andrews whispered lewrie turned his attention back to the pirate schooner just as the first of her guns exploded in a gush of powder smoke a sharpish slamming noise with the scream of solid shot coming passing warbling off easterly a clean miss bear up bear up lewrie snapped pointing to the north duck out of their aim jugg thus the schooner blotted herself out of existence as four more guns fired making a dense drifting wall of yellowgrey powder smoke along her engaged starboard side sulfurous and reeking shot howled harpylike and a cannon ball nipped at their shalopes larboard stern quarters another slammed into her midships larboard bulwarks but caromed off after wrenching a large bite of timber from her with the parrotscreech of shattered wood one screamed low over the deck its unseen passage trailed by a tunnel of tortured air that shimmered like the uprush from a redhot forge the last was another clean miss as the spent powder smoke drifted southward the schooners bow swam out of the newest mist jibboom and bowsprit figurehead beak rails and nettings helm hard up now lewrie rasped coughing on the guns lees jugg put the tiller as far over to starboard as it would swing his weight and dempseys weight pressing on the bar and the shalope began to turn stand by grapnels mister larkin stand by swivelguns at close range lewrie called out christ there the schooner was her upper railings just a foot higher than the shalopes deck her glossy black hull shining like a freshgroomed stallion so close lewrie could almost call it spitting distance their shalopes thrusting jibboom looked like it would jam right into the schooners mainmast shrouds and pin her there helplessly but after a long pent breath the jibboom slid past by a cats whisker and they were sidling up to her at an angle boatguns swivels and muskets fire as you bear lewrie cried drawing his hanger and a doublebarrelled manton pistol his men opened fire the light pounders barking lapdog sharp chewing chunks from the schooners side without doing much real damage the swivels though atop the caprail stanchions spewed loads of musket and pistol balls nearly straight across her decks reaping things and people grapnels he snapped as their boats single mast came level with the schooners midships the hooks flew scraped and found purchase and muscle power on the heaving lines hauled their lighter vessel alongside checking her way in a groaning instant their bow met the schooner bumping and rasping the stern began to swing in snugly and there were more bumps and thuds all the while lewrie with nothing physical to do stared with dread at those gaping gunports just waiting for them to be filled by reloaded cannon for them to spew grape and langridge and murder every man in his crew yet boarders he almost screamed at last away boarders up atop his own bulwarks a long stride across to theirs and he was hopping down to the schooners deck flooding with tittery joyous relief to see that no more than one or two pirates had tended each cannon that most of her crew had been ashore he dashed aft bumped and shouldered by his own hands to claim her quarterdeck vous the gaudily dressed captain said a tall and lean man with a wide but slim set of mustachios and a sword in his hand strike ye thievin cutthroat lewrie roared back a burly pirate with a cutlass leaped between shoved forward by lanxade the cutlass and lewries hanger rang together once twice the pirate twohanding his sword lewrie binded him brought up his manton with his left hand and gave him both barrels in his lower chest with the muzzles against his skin and the man shrieked and lurched backwards like a poleaxed steer his shirt on fire strike damn you lewrie roared again tossing away his spent pistol cutting the air with his sword va te faire foutre vous sanglant cochonlanxade spat whipping his long oldstyle rapier through the air as well fuck yourself lewrie retorted as lanxade sprang at him with a distracting footstamp and an inarticulate screech of battle rage their blades met parted slithering and chiming met edge to edge with the next slashes both men ironwristed ironwilled comin sir he heard his coxn andrews vow hell ye will hes mine lewrie shouted son boudreaux balfa shouted in immense relief when he recognised one of the weary swimmers in the water and quickly sculled over to pick him up mademoiselle charite was there too with jean that little la fitte brute fusilier clambered in first then aided the girl balfa considered leaving jean not trusting him one inch but fusilier reached for him and hauled him in while the mademoiselle knelt on the soleboards coughing up water as drenched as any wharf rat balfa spun his boat about got fusilier and jean to seize hold of two oars and started north up the bay for escape capitaine balfa charite finally found strength to say you must go back those cowards took all the boats my brothers a mere hundred yards off the beach balfa could hear the firing and the clash of blades the desperation of frenchspeaking or spanish pirates and the encouraged battle cries in english naw cherie balfa sadly said dere nothin tbe done best we can hope is we get away de games done did charite knew it in her heart too as she crept aft near balfa to cling to the boats gunnls and peer at the battle on the mounds helio she yelled sitting up on her knees and waving as her elder brother appeared at the back of their mounds flat top pistols in both hands looking seaward looking at her he shouted something waved as if to drag back the only boat still in sight two horrid red splotches suddenly blossomed on his white shirt the fine linen and lace punctured throughandthrough with calibre musket balls helio stumbled forward dropping his guns and almost knelt as if to recoup his strength then pitched tumbling and sliding down the back slope of the mound like a bundle of castoff clothes from a ragpickers barrow nooo charite screamed grief protest and horror together gotta go chers balfa urged vite vite topman willy toffett scrambled up the slope of an earth mound gasping almost clawing with his free hand for purchase grasping his heavy brown bess sea pattern musket in his right he had been scared at first but seeing so many piratessome he even recognised from his ordeal in their grasp their marooning on the dry tortugas on the run or dying had perked up his courage considerably a marine ahead of him private doyle a fairdecent bastard for a lobsterback was kicking muck in his eyes as he scrambled howling eagerness his musket held in both hands hah hah doyle cried as he engaged a pirate who rose up atop the lip of the mound bringing his bayonetfitted musket level thrusting at the swordarmed foemans belly but the pirate whipped up a pistol and shot him in the chest one of em toffett thought panicked again as doyle fell back the slope headdown and instantly killed he was one of em aboard that schooner the one who killed midshipman burns all those slaves in the water toffett howled inarticulately as he reached the top and swung his musket like a quarterstaff at the mans legs knocking him off his feet long enough for toffett to take proper hold and get into the drill hed been taught four times a week since volunteering into proteus thrustpartially parried by the bastards sword recover thrust again step forward inside guard buttstrike up from belowright to level the heavy brassfooted stock smashing into the bastards mouth with a toothy crunch to send him sprawling on his back plant left foot forward thrust toffett screamed just as loud as the pirate as he sank six inches of triangular steel into the foes belly folding him up like a jackknife twist stamp and recover yew murdrin sonfabitch stamp thrust into the enemys unguarded throat lean on the musket like shoving a capstan bar and twist and grind saw back and forth yew filthy goddamn whoreson that fer mister burns that fer them cuffies that fer ol doyle dont make a meal of im lad marine sergeant skipwith said almost in his ear beaming with delight six inch o bayonets good as a yard fer his sort and don rubio monaster whose aristocratic ancestors had been hidalgo since the reconquista of spain and charged into battle with el cid against the moors died with the taste of blood and cold metal in his mouth and his elegant breeches full of shit hippolyte de guilleri could only hear a whistling noise in his ears as he scampered to the back of the mound terror making an empty cold pit in his middle and his bowels watery time and motion slowed to a crawl as he saw rubio get spitted as he took hopeless guard with his sword to oppose the sailors and soldiers running at him him alone as the last defender all by himself and it was so unfair he didnt mean to kill all those people and he pleaded with god that he was now sorry to have taken such perverse pleasure from killing but hadnt it been in a righteous cause for louisiana for france so hippolyte stamped his foot and slashed with his sword howling at the hardfaced men who swarmed at him from every corner trembling inside despite his wish to be brave go game maman dont let it hurt he wailed to himself as his blade was easily knocked aside and he saw the flicker of a heavy cutlass coming at him sideways it cleaved like an axe into the side of his neck and it did hurt very much a whitehot agony in his head his throat and a second was rammed into his groin with so much force that he was lifted up on tiptoes it redoubled the agony brought forth a scream through the bubbling blood he was drowning in his last breath and then there was an officer in a blue coat standing over him as he sank to his knees struggling for air raising a pistol in his face inches from his eyes and the bore was as wide as a cannon and then there was a hot reeking scalding wind on his face bright amber light like the fires of hades then rien nothing he ain t a hop master lewrie wearily thought as he caught his enemys blade on his twisted his wrist so it slid off his own jabbed under to force him back then swept his hanger up to highleft to stop another slash countersweeping under at his belly again missing elegant as lanxade dressed he wasnt the product of some languid fencingmasters salle darmes he was skilled quick and steelwristed and fought with the desperate savagery of a backalley brawler the cutandthrust hed learned at sea in closequarter murder they swirled about each other leaping stamping and clashing all the other pirates were down the schooner was theirs and his hands stood watching their captains fight if he stumbled or fell looked about to lose lewrie was sure that a dozen muskets or pistols would take lanxade down the next instant surely lewrie thought lanxade knew he was a dead man even if he won and tiring as lewrie was the issue was in doubt swordplay was the most strenuous and enervating way to fight and his oneonone duel with lanxade felt like it had been going on for half an hour not one or two minutes lanxade clashed drew him wide left then whipped under thrust with a mighty shout and stamp but lewrie met it whipped off a flying cutover forcing lanxades longer rapier low and left wideopen lanxade panting and gasping as loud as lewrie instinctively cut right was left high and wide vulnerable for once backed against the schooners taffrails and lewrie put all he had into a slash that would gut the bastard from his left hip to his right breast lanxade bellowed rage and defiance even as lewries hanger cut his clothing open like a berserk tailors razor blood sprang from a slash on lanxades left thigh another gout from his right shoulder something went twangtwangtwang and lanxade fell back with his sword hand on the taffrail to recover his stomach and belly swelling like hed suddenly become pregnant and lewrie was stunned motionless for a second or two bloody hell lewrie gawped merde alors lanxade snarled back using that second granted him to glance down and see his waistcoat and shirt slashed open and the severed laces of his whalebone corset standing out like hedgehog quills sale chienlanxade screamed shoving off the railing and brought his rapier up in a wild slash at lewries head which he ducked tried to slash back downwards in the blink of an eye but that was blocked by lewries right shoulder against his forearm and lewrie rammed the point of his hanger deep into lanxades stomach no longer protected by canvas whalebone or lacings right through the gap hed made with his slash deep as he could the whole length of the honed backblade savagely twisted to ease its withdrawal lanxade tried to bring his own rapier back far enough to stab but lewrie took hold of his wrist feeling the mans oarstout strength going lewrie looked into his eyes glaring utter hatred getting the same hatred back fuck with my sailors will you my prize you took my men you almost murdered my midshipman you gutshot and left to die you miserable bastard lewrie raged almost in his ear now die and roast in the fires of hell lewrie stood back jerked lanxade back on his feet as he tugged his bloody hanger free then jammed it up under lanxades jaw through soft tissue and tongue into his brain lanxade jerked and jiggled like a dancing marionette at a punch judy show his rapier clanging on the deck as it dropped from nerveless fingers then he was falling backwards over the taffrails arms legs and coat jerkily windmilling as lewrie shoved him overside to create a cannonballs splash as he plunged deep under lewrie peered down over the schooners transom to see lanxade surface once strangling but incapable of movement before he went under again to sink slowly lifeless eyes almost yearning for air and the light drowned a last thought in the final dark i died rich hein lewrie spun about sagged against the taffrails and peered up at the french tricolour which still flew aloft get that damned rag down someone he croaked drymouthed and desperately weary coxn andrews came to his side with a leather bottle of brandy and a suck or two at that helped he was leery of the roundeyed awe his sailors showed him but hoped that awe cancelled out his previous lost respect ashore been below sor toby jugg reported theys kegged silver in th hold not too much though prisners say th bulk o hit woz on their prize still they looked west the pirates prize was now a halfsunk hulk a bowl of sullen flames beneath a monstrous volcanos pillar of smoke adrift and almost beached even as they watched the fire reached the unpillaged powder magazines its kegs and sewn cartridges at last she exploded with a dull roar a staggering series of blasts that shot flaming debris and fingery smoke trails up and outwards each bigger than the rest and with each explosion came a glittering in the sky like the coloured embers of a fireworks display tiny silvery bits that glinted as they spiralled out over a halfmile radius all newminted and mirrorlike in the rising sun oh lewrie lamented ooh went his sailors aw shit boy you get in your brothers boat balfa ordered after they met up with the grimfaced pierre in a small gig by himself you an him row like hell one way we go dat way dey dont cotch us all in de one bite hein balfa still had two loaded pistols in his belt but pierre only had one and all the rest had been soaked useless in their swim bad as things looked hard as it was to see old jerome meet a hard end as they rowed past to the west of the fight his neighbours still had his hillock of silver and the fewer greedy survivors of this day the better especially those quickwitted la fitte brothers row where pierre snarled we dont know the way through away from dis balfa mirthlessly hooted due north get in lake barataria skirt de shore de bayou take you free you stay wit de wide channel get tnew orleans den it

pierre weighed the bag in his hand couldnt see that boudreaux balfa had another on him and decided to make the best of what little was left him he motioned his younger brother jean to join him in his boat and they set off balfa bade the morose mademoiselle charite take the steering oar and he sat beside his son on a rough thwart an oar in his hoary hands lets row hard now fusilier all de way home and say a strong prayer we get away wit our lives by gar sir sir midshipman larkin cried hopping from one foot to another in excitement theres a rowing boat out there sir off the larboard bows theyre not our people sir the damnable fog had not quite dissipated but it had thinned considerably now more a haze that hid the horizons lewrie put his telescope to his eye and swept the nearer waters there were a lot of boats most nighlost in the northern haze some to the west ah thatun two men rowing a lad and a gammer one man with his hair bound back in a horsetail steering with a sweepoar about two miles off and going strong up to the noreast lewrie could almost make out a second boat with two men in it mister jugg he called use my glass and tell me if you recognise anyone in these two boats nearest us jugg trotted up from his task of helping secure their prize and took a long gander with lewries telescope at un up in th noreast sor dont think i know them fellers he said after a long moment lefthandun though ats boudreaux balfa at er starboard oar as big as life sor we goin after em capm he eagerly asked lewrie took his telescope back extended the tubes to full magnification and eyed the closest of his known foes damme he grunted as if punched in the stomach as he recognised another person in balfas boat charite shed turned to peer astern anxiously and he spotted her long mane of chestnut hair her soggy shirt plastered to womanly breasts the murderin bitch do we have a boat handy he loudly demanded rounding to peer about the schooners deck were off after em if we have tpaddle logs two sir midshipman larkin responded our shalopes jolly boat and that he said pointing overside at a scrufulous pirogue tied up alongside their captured schooners larboard chains coxn andrews you me and four hands in the jolly boat men who can row like blazes lewrie quickly decided all to have muskets and cutlasses with the shore fight seemingly done and capt nicely in charge of that there was nothing to deter him from wrapping things up nabbing balfa and getting a personal matter finished mister adair take charge here til i get back send word ashore if youre able and tell captain nicely where ive gone aye sir lieutenant adair crisply replied hands for the pirogue lewrie bade to his crewmen any volunteers to me sor toby jugg quickly spoke up sorta personal like lewrie looked him in the eyes for a moment then nodded assent just cause he once knew the bastard lewrie thought with a mental shrug as he headed for entryport no reason not to trust him jugg and his two almost inseparable mates his fellow irishmen mannix and dempsey followed jugg into the pirogue as lewrie took charge of the tiller of his own rowboat shove off out oars and lets be after the bastard lewrie urged his hands as their boats began to surge in pursuit he did take a moment though to wonder if he could shoot a woman if he caught up with charite dey gainin on us balfa muttered arm muscles bulging as he dug deep with his oar laying out almost prone at each stroke to sweep their boat faster almost ruing that hed rid himself of the la fittes now that they needed fresh strong backs gonna cotch us i think dat pirogue she be faster her he grunted tween hard strokes his tongue was about lolling out and fusiliers youthful power was nearly played out too the girl could steer adequately but shed not last five minutes on an oar mamselle dat rifle o yours you can use it hein you good shot helio had showed her how to use the airrifle though she didnt consider herself a crack shot charite had opened the magazine tube as theyd rowed past le revenant when the la fittes were still aboard to count remaining rounds there were only seven helio and hippolyte had bragged how far it could shoot she angrily swiped the sleeve of her shirt over her eyes to blot the fresh tears that the thought of them evoked they were prisoners of the hated anglais now on their way to a british noose cruelly wounded or dead and gone everything was lost ships crew the silver and when news got to the spanish the surviving de guilleris would face arrest and trial and the garotte in the place darmes all they owned would be forfeit even if her parents and sisters had had no knowledge or part in their planned revolution her own fate was the bitterest of all to savour she would die not as a martyr for france but as a fool an utter failure whod gotten her brothers killed a lunatic with a demented dream and creoles even those who might have taken up arms with them would be cowed into silence and ineffectiveness louisiana and new orleans would stay part of spain better to die now charite bleakly thought fantasising a tale told of a brave but foolish girl whod slain her heartless pursuing englishmen and died in battle than to be abased in a court like joan of arc then strangled in the public square mamselle balfa prompted i can use it capitaine charite grimly promised when the time comes i will ill not be taken non but oh it would be hard to die when shed only had nineteen sunny years couldnt there have been many more in a louisiana that was free and french again her holy duty done hoy the boat an anglais shouted from a boat on their starboard quarter lay on your oars and surrender in the kings name shit on your king boudreaux balfa hooted back an kiss my rosy cadien ass in a mutter he added de time be come mamselle try your eye an ill be ready wit my pistols for when dey gets real close charite abandoned the sweepoar pulled the airrifle up off the boats sole and cranked the stiff loading lever to chamber a ball then turned on her thwart to take aim frightened to death but determined to take at least one despicable anglais with her before she fell we know who you are boudreaux balfa the anglais bellowed in a quarterdeck voice shambling half bent over to stand in the bows of his boat charite de guilleri surrender and no harm will come to you she started with alarm chilled that the british knew her by name over the sights of her rifle she peered at the officer in the bows a bloody cochon in a giltlaced coat face shaded by a large cocked hat hands cupped to his mouth he would be her target she cocked the valve mechanism to the airchamber the officer lowered his hands took off his hat as his boat got within sixty yards and a long musket shot himmon dieu alain a spy a glib liar an arch foe of all she held dear crack her first round was short and to the right but alains oarsmen faltered and shed forced him to duck rocking his boat alarmingly coldbloodedly now charite reloaded and recocked her airrifle then brought the rifles stock back to her shoulder her fluttery fear now departed her hands and body no longer shivering charite de guilleri was filled by a calmly righteous and vengeful anger pirogues gettin close aussi mamselle balfa cautioned as if she was still papas little prodigy hunting quail in a cutover cane field charite swivelled to face dead aft and put a wellplaced ball square in the pirogues bows forcing all three men in it to lay flat and fall back as they abandoned their paddling give it up charite willoughbywhatever the lying bastard called himselfshouted over we wont hurt you swear it vous she thought utterly revulsed that shed let him even put his hands on her that shed given him her body her affection and her foolish trust her love her skin crawled at the recollections of how theyd how hed vous etes fumier she cried you have already hurt me to my very soul you bloody charite dashed her sleeve over her eyes again blinked her vision clear of tears took a breath and let it out slowly found the instant of perfect stillness and fired phffttack the ball hit him square in the chest just under his heart and the force of it punched the air from his lungs slugged him backwards to splay over the forwardmost thwart with his head on the jolly boats damp soleboards merciful god lewrie frantically thought as agony engulfed him unable to draw breath vision darkening im killed chapter thirtythree ahyee fusilier balfa cheered her accuracy all but clapping his oarchafed bleeding hands vivat mamselle hell wit dat his father boudreaux snarled dragging them to sobriety dat only slow em down for de little while den dey really be mad wit us gotta get a lead on em row or die chers and for a few minutes it seemed as if charites awesome shot had bought them a lead the anglais rowing boat had come to a stop the pirogue going alongside it and both receded into the lingering bay mists balfa bade charite to bear off norwesterly to throw them off and reach the closest maze of marshes cypress and mangrove swamp not lake barataria which lay due north both men were spent though the act of rowing a musclesearing agony their breath roared like a forge bellows as they panted for air and both were hangdog drooling with exhaustion oh mon dieu charite gasped as she fearfully looked over her shoulder and spotted the much faster pirogue off their starboard quarter reemerging from the haze they have found us messieurs sure enough the paddles flashed more quickly and the pirogue swung about to run parallel with their boat just out of pistolshot the sailor in the middle of the pirogue held a musket at the ready sorry cherie boudreaux balfa wheezed letting his oar slide aft can t do no more we tried he pulled a pistol from his belt and let it lay in his lap handing the other to his son charite abandoned her steering oar and testcocked her weapon a snap of the trigger only produced a faint hiss its unreliable buttstock flask was expended in spite of that she levered a ball into the breech and brought it to her shoulder the pretence of a ready gun more of a final act of defiance a way to die in battle hoy the paddler and steersman seated in the stern of the pirogue shouted as he set aside his paddle and took up a musket as well hoy boudreaux balfa ye auld cutthroat he added sounding nigh cheerful not threatening ye auld mudfoot who dat balfa warily called back squinting in confusion an auld shipmate o yourn the man hooted one ye didnt reconise when ye marooned im on th dry tortugas come ttake ye

dear old cheerful capitaine balfa who had just sold her out she would live the anglais sailor swore shed return home but to what chapter thirtyfour oh god capt alan lewrie weakly whimpered his hands shakily feeling over his chest his head lay cradled in coxn andrewss lap and andrews was gently undoing his waistcoat and shirt buttons air pain he could barely draw breath and his heart thudded so strongly and quickly it felt like a kettledrum at a bloody concert hot pain thrummed knotlike twixt his stomach and sternum be easy sah andrews commiserated easy im bloody dyin and ow damme but that hurts hold a tick lewrie puzzled hearts bangin like a racehorse hurts but what the bloody hell ya aint killed sah coxn andrews wondrously exclaimed ya aint even bad shot praise de lord lewrie fumbled at his bared chest coughing and still gasping for breath each one searing pain through him his fingers came away smeared with blood what dye call this then damn my eyes he querously quibbled faith sor liam desmond one of his oarsmen cried holding a silvery calibre rifle ball twixt thumb and forefinger found it on th soleboards sor must o bounced right off ya sure shot went pish stead o crack like that duck ya shot comin upriver sor when th airflask was spent mother mary but youre th luckyun an theres a tale for th tellin capm sor mebbe we starts callin ya ironbound stead o th ramcat sah andrews tittered immensely relieved and slightly teasing we will not lewrie snapped struggling to sit upright despite his sailors protests he gaped downwards thinking it must have been a weakly propelled shot for all of charites remorseless accuracy it had further been blunted by his white leather sword baldric that angled cross his chest by a doubledover giltlaced coat lapel atop it and lastly by the insubstantial obstacle of his waistcoat and shirt that had absorbed most of the balls force even so his flesh had been split by its impact and when he gingerly massaged his chest near the seeping slight wound which was already swelling and turning the most garish shade of purply green in a bruise as wide as his handspan he thought he could feel something broken insidea rib or two perhaps his breastbone chipped maybe dented thank the lord indeed though there wasnt a gaping spurting grapered hole in his hide damn my eyes but she shot me lewrie wheezed she actually shot me tried tkill me not that i really blame her much lewrie told himself with chagrin tis a bloody wonder some woman didn t try ages ago and by the queasy expression on andrewss phyz his longtime coxn mustve been wondering the same thing where is she lewrie demanded head aswivel in search for her way off yonder sah andrews had to say waving northward at a foghazed horizon lewrie couldnt spot another boat anywhere damme weve lost em but if jugg is still after em we might get lucky yet lewrie sadly decided might have em in irons by nightfall we head back to de ship capm andrews solicitously asked ya need tlet mistah hodson an mistah durant de surgeons tend to ya sah bind up yer ribs an such aye andrews thatd be capital lewrie was forced to agree it strikes me that i mightve done enough and more today for king and country ive earned myself a liedown amen tdat sah andrews said with a chuckle make yself comftable as ya can an desmond an mell fetch ya back to proteus quick as a wink mebbe jugg will cotch dat girl for ya an ahhemm lewrie growled at that unfortunate slip tossing in a grumbly arr for good measure as he pressed his handkerchief over his wound and eased down to sit on the gigs floorboards seepage and the state of his uniform bedamned to lay against the forward thwart half prone he found it easier on his ribs to breathe andrews and desmond got the gig turned about and set themselves a slow but deepbiting stroke that would get him to safety and still not completely exhaust them and the metronomic rumbling creak of oars in ungreased tholes the thrust and glide of the boat between strokes and the gurglechuckling of passing water began to lull him do i really want her captured he asked himself puzzling over why he didnt utterly despise her and wish her hearts blood since shed come damned close to spilling his all in all lewrie reckoned it had been a shitten business theyd done but it was done and even if charite escaped once the report on this affair was published in london papers the tale would make its way to new orleans sooner or later and it would be up to the incensed spanish to do the real dirty work in spite of all the depravities shed been involved with he could almost pity her when the dons got their hands on her luck to you girl he thought lolling his head back to admire the clearing bright blue sky but damme if i aint pleased tbe

kept on the dark and thick woods even so for an unwary man on the lonely natchez trace was as good as dead and even a party as large as his could still be taken in ambush did they ever let their guard down none of them would lay in easy sleep til they reached tiny nashville at least we can say that we came all this way saw it and had us a little adventure but id not give you five dollars for th whole damn place why congress is hagglin over sendin an army down there ttake it well more power to em but theyve not had tlive in it like we did they decide to try er on ill hoot an holler loud as

president john adams already had himself half a war a quasi war with france and he doubted if hed be able to bring congress round to his point of view before the coming elections if jefferson got in he might manage it but soon as jim hawk was back in nashville hed put his reports in the mails to washington city along with his letter of resignation and head back to the powells valley to make a new beginning a secure settled civilian life after years of war and filibustering for richer men he had spanish dollars in his saddlebags and that was enough for a man to found a mountain empire so something good had in truth come from louisiana you foolish foolish girl papa hilaire de guilleri fumed yet again since he and maman marie had rushed back to new orleans hed whiplashed between bawling drunken grief over the loss of his sons and his patrie to jibbering dread of exposure trial and garotting to anger directed to her the only living target for his icy wrath what were you thinking you to free louisiana charite numbly tried to explain once more her voice meek and her hands primly folded in the lap of her soberly black mourning gown for france papa for emptyheaded patriotic nonsense her elegantly tall and lean distinguished father cruelly shot back fervent twaddle for things an ocean away and nothing to do with us i tell you and if the spanish ever learn of what you did were all ruined youre debile you led your brothers into your your sweet and gentle cousin poor jeanmarie aussi maman coldly fumed from the other side of her fathers study plying a fan as if to drive off summer heat charite didnt know which of them was crueller to her her dashing beau ideal father or her elegantly gay and flighty mother for marie de guilleri had been still was one of the most beauteous belles of her generation the toast of the city and of the grandest creole society rubio monaster who might have married one of your sisters had he lived made the finest match between us and the bergrands she accused daintily daubing at her dry nose with a laced silk handkerchief their banker monsieur maurepas had summoned them and had spread a plausible lie to explain charites stumbling return to new orleans in a nameless acadians pirogue and care maurepass sorrowful tale had hardly been necessary for a week or more at least since new orleans had been rocked by the fire that had levelled poor monsieur bistineaus old store and warehouse and the simultaneous fire that had erupted aboard a newly arrived ship for sale on the south bank of the river and the way the used ship had lost all her mooring cables and had drifted onto the american emporium ship burning her to the waterline as well it had required the garrison turn out the forts to be manned against any attempt to seize the port city on top of that only two of the three treasure schooners had come up the mississippi the third feared lost and that caused even greater consternation given the circumstances the tragic murder of four of the towns most promising young gentlemen at the hands of the cutthroat runaway rebel slave st johns evil band while hunting and fishing on lake barataria had almost gone unnoticed rumours had flown charite had escaped been raped by the negres had stopped off with an acadian family due to slight unhealth and hadnt been with them yet had almost lost her complete wits in grief quel dommage n estcepasit was well known that charite had been the toobold outdoorsy and desexed sort of girl too outre too modern so to think i nursed you at my breast viper maman marie snapped her fan beat like a hummingbirds wings drinking gambling running the streets in mens clothing associating with whores and rogues and reeling home as drunk as a negre maman charite weakly beseeched

other side of the study his worries of a different stripe god knows how many other grand distinguished young people you will end up dragging to the garotte if the spanish ever learn the truth how many parents will be blamed as well though they knew nothing we will end up penniless at the least idiotchild hounded from new orleans and louisiana her mother bewailed rocking with impending ruin on her gilded chair all our wealth and security lost forced to flee among the filthy americains mon dieu penniless you hear me girl penniless and damned by every good creole family whose happiness you have destroyed bah she is mad cherie her father sternly declared her mind is gone i have spoken to docteur robicheaux who thinks she is utterly debile perhaps has been for some time that will not excuse what she did hilaire maman wailed then sniffed into her handkerchief the spanish wont care when she only if they ever learn the truth marie papa cautioned one hand raised to make his point in peaceful deliberateness if we play our parts properly they never will the bishop knows nothing and he will preach a fervent sermon against the rebel slaves as if our sons truly died at their hands hilaire de guilleri hitched a deep sigh and daubed his own eyes as he said that we must be too stricken to speak so we will not be forced to say anything to the contrary after we will quickly return upcountry along with iphegenie and marguerite and may stay for months and months she well will be too griefstricken to attend nestce pas though the thought of placing deer bones and rocks in our dear sons coffins to rest forever in our mausoleum is ah well according to what she admitted to us and what capitaine balfa wrote us there can be no trustworthy witnesses to her perfidy maurepas too frightened of exposure bistineau too that capitaine lanxade and most of his crew dead or captured by the anglais who will quickly hang the rest on jamaica the three anglais sailors the deserters are scattered to baton rouge or natchez and have just reason to fear that the spanish learn where they got their money charite stared unseeing at her hands clenched whiteknuckled in her lap her eyes averted and her chin down as she had contritely been ever since she had reached new orleans and saw her parents she was just as heartbroken as they perhaps even more so just as deeply wounded by her brothers deaths the utter end of her dreams hopes yet papa and maman had scathed her for days sputtering in spiteful hateful rages or accusing tears speaking of her as if she was dead too over the top of her head as if she was not there and frankly she was getting irked by their waverings from dangerous hostility to bitter but arch grief as if sorrow was the proper thing to do the sham to portray whether their hearts were touched or not and being spoken of not to worse than a dog given less regard than a piece of furniture only living witness would be her in fact papa hilaire declaimed sitting on the edge of his ornate desk swinging a booted foot a brandy glass in his hand and a soclever smile on his face charite snapped up her head to goggle at him chilling with dread her parents had always been testy about anything that might taint their familys repute beyond their semisecret amours of course and everyone in creole louisiana would forgive those charite thought but how far would they go to protect themselves she had to wonder her father gazed dispassionately at her for a long and somber moment then shook his head in disappointment docteur robicheaux is already convinced of her derangement papa said as he turned his attention to his wife again he has written us a letter to that effect such a condition will require years of care charite winced ready to burst into tears in fear of lifelong exile on their most remote and meanest plantation a feebleminded exile confined to the garret to spare them embarrassment there to turn old and cronish and desperately lonely with only slaves for keepers the rest of her life she could not bear it dare they risk her with the ursuline nuns under a vow of silence a convent might be better but only just new orleans didnt have a proper madhouse but what sort of care did he mean she must leave new orleans papa gloomily intoned she must leave louisiana sorry to say marie we lose yet another child leave louisiana charite dared wail in consternation where must i then go papa please hush you ungrateful girl maman spat stamping a dainty foot no matter how evil you turned out to be still we are your parents and we love you despite trust us to do what little we can in the best interests of our family name your sisters futures and in your own good though you dont papa shushed her mother and crossed the room to flair his coattails take a seat beside her and pat mamans hand charite knew she was completely doomed seeing where his sympathy lay docteur robicheaux suggests that there are several colleagues from his university days papa said squirming a little and unable to look his daughter in the eyes not completely progressive and clever gentlemen who are achieving marvellous results with the ah deranged charite in france in france charite gasped her fear of lonely exile fled her soul in a twinkling and her mouth fell open in utter surprise a second later came a blossoming blissful joy she would go to france the very centre of the entire civilised world the birthplace of the glorious revolution that shed wished to emulate a smile of wonder took her features one she strove hard to disguise but could not quell completely one she fervently hoped her parents interpreted as one of thanks for saving her life out of their socalled love for her secretly though charite was marvellously pleased ready to leap to her feet and dance with glee snap her fingers in their faces in elation a swedish ship is in port and will soon depart papa intoned we have booked you a cabin aboard her and docteur robicheaux wrote a letter explaining your condition and how you must be kept in isolation and at rest a neutral ship which the british will not dare to board you will not be disturbed onpassage nestce pas you will be safe all the way to lorient then but where will i go in france papa charite cried aloud france did have madhouses and even if the revolution had conquered the catholic church there still were convents i mean who will care for me papa maman she fearfully asked playacting as if she feared being separated from them forever more will you really have me committed to she bit her lower lip and shamtrembled like a chastised puppy but france yes she thought we have distant relations papa told her squirming a little more as he crossed his legs and put an arm about the back of mamans chair your mothers kin the lemerciers they live in a very nice little village a peaceful and bucolic place called rambouillet ghastly charite thought shivering for real not too far from paris really to the west i think paris yes paris too she would finally see paris people of the strictest morals and rectitude boring charite almost giggled aloud shed find a way to free herself a sober example that might in time restore you to proper behaviour near to one of docteur robicheauxs colleagues who will doubt it charite almost whooped in wicked glee not with the fabulous city of paris but a hop skip and a jump away do not mend your ways robicheauxs colleague will indeed commit you charite papa sternly warned her if you upset the lemerciers in any way you willful girl her mother threatened and charites galloping imaginings came to a hoofskidding halt making her cringe for real and gulp if she did anything to displease her dullsounding relations theyd have leave to sling her into the madhouse eu merde we will of course provide you with a small remittance her calmer papa explained a letter goes to them explaining how youve been ah bereft and driven witless that we wish them to spend no more on you and kerb your former extravagance too once assured that your mind is clearer they might go so far as to introduce you to some local lads of modest but upright nature or that failing settle you in some genteel circumstances as a housekeeper or we only wish the best for you cherie maman insincerely and oversweetly assured her ready to tear up over her youngest girls departure her potentially lifelong absence marry a village dullard a cobbler charite bleakly thought cringing with revulsion be a housemaid a matrons servant burp her infants and empty nightjars ugh i beg you maman charite pleaded must i really end it is settled papa snapped it is the only solution he concluded once again badly mistaking her dread of dullity for dread of parting her grimace of disgust at paid servitude or worse for the loss of her familys love who are these people charite had to ask herself did i really ever know them paris though once in france did she dissemble well and play up humble she could make her way to paris get her wellmeaning relatives to show her the famous sights where the revolution had taken place once there she could ditch them long enough to seek out men in the assembly or the senate even an august member of the powerful directory press for louisiana s liberation tell them what shed done had suffered in the cause of revolution and its worldwide spread some powerful man would sponsor her surely free her from the threat of commitment and the certain dullness of her rustic relatives who knew better than a creole girl how to cajole flirt and beguile after all choose well and she might end up touted as a heroine of france herself her story a cause celebre invited to the best salons she would obey her parents for a time she would mind her behaviour aboard ship and convince her docteurminder that she was as sane as he cruelly and unjustly exiled she would convince her relations of it too force herself to be helpful meekly obedient to their strictures and sunnily sweet once her grief had waned of course or would a lingering wanness suit better no matter she would win her freedom and get to paris where anything was possible win support for her cause for her upkeep even marry if a powerful and clever man wished it she would still give anything for louisiana and for france mrs tobias hosier mrs toby jugg toiled her stony sugarcane field in the hot barbadan sun despairing that their poor plot seemed to produce more stones and weeds than cane stalks this season her hips and lower back ached from her hoeing and chopping and perspiration soaked her entire body her shabby workgown so it was with weary relief as well as curiosity that she observed the arrival of a rider at her tumbledown gate he called her name and waved a letter in the air she shambled back to the house and the yardgate fetching tess from watching the baby on the shabby quilt swabbing her face and arms on her apron as she accepted the rare letter with a surge of hope that toby might have included a quarterly draught on his navy pay for they might not be able to settle their rent and store bills by quarter day and the next assizes she dipped the postrider a grateful curtsy then went back to the porch gallery out of the unmerciful sun to sit down and read it lord above wotve ye done this time lad she whispered as she saw that it was addressed from patrick warder from someplace in

bindings tighter so snug i cant draw a decent breath so they will be captain his frenchborn former physician told him with a sad chuckle as aspinall helped lewrie don a new shirt ze bruised ribs and breastbone knit slowly so you must expect pain and think yourself fragile for at least anozzer month before i may say wiz confidence zat you are completely healed nestce pas sir mean tsay im to dodder like a greenwich pensioner on light duties like one of our herniated bracetenders i fear zat is the apt comparison sir durant said with a sly twinkle in his eyes as he closed up his portable kitbox not serious enough to put a replacement captain aboard is it lewrie fretted as he gazed at admiralty house on the palisades of kingston harbour after being battered about by higher authorities in the last few months he was oftbitten damned shy of meddlers or those whod reward their favourites with a posting into a frigate the finest sort of command the royal navy could offer an aspiring young officer oh no captain no fear of zat durant assured him you mus be lazy for a time but zat is not cause for displacing you oh good lewrie chearly said perked up considerably lazy i blieve i can manage mainwell thankee muchs you done for em sir aspinall commented as he shoved lewrie into his waistcoat id expect em tkeep you an proteus as one forever muchs you earned em sir theyd sailed back to jamaica with their pirate schooner flying british colours atop its french tricolour trailing astern of them and had created quite the stir of excitement once their reports lewries and nicelys had been read and the amount of coined silver aboard her had been tallied the admiralty court had leapt to condemn the prize admiral parker had bought her in as a fast armed tender for to be seconded to a larger slower cruising ship so he could garner even more loot at sea and for his signal service in their recent expedition lt darling capt nicelys protege had been appointed into her as commanding officer capt nicely had finally struck his broadpendant and departed for a new command of his own since admiral parker realised that he would be much more useful at sea leading a real squadron than ever he was as staff captain damme lewrie but youve saved me nicely had grandly stated at his departure ceremony pumping lewries hand so happily got me a proper broadpendant at last and made me rich into the bargain they had only salvaged eight hundred kegs of coined dollars off the prize the rest of the rumoured six million in silver was scattered over a mile of baybottom mud or swampy forest when the spanish prize exploded or as their few surviving prisoners suggested there never had been that much and the rest might have made it to new orleans on another ship pollock could bear them the facts when he returned still eight hundred thousand spanish dollars was and that was nothing to sneeze at admiral parker got an eighth and captain nicely got an eighth as senior admiral and squadron commander respectively but that still left lewrie his traditional twoeighths as captain of the successful warship and that resulting was his ticket to a life of imcomparable wealth he could buy his farm from uncle phineas chiswick who resisted the odds with his typical stubborn meanness and absolutely refused to dieif he couldnt take all his own wealth with him lewrie suspected there could be a decent townhouse in london too and still leave them to place in the safe and solid bank of englands three percents and that would yield per annum before the bloody taxes due of course a family his size could live as grand as an earl on a sum like that why he could even spare an hundred well fifty would suit he idly supposed to dower his penniless ward sophie de maubeuge buy things to improve her paraphernalia to help attract a suitable man with decent breeding and fair prospects of his own sewallis and hugh his daughter charlotte those offspring it was safe to claim would be assured the very best educations and a leg up for their entry into adulthood his wife caroline well hmm sudden wealth might mollify her he could hope might soften her heart enough to forgive his overseas amours at last it wasnt as if any of them had been anything more than temporary foreign diversions conveniences really and werent a couple of them mounted under the orders of superiors topped in the name of grim duty that claudia mastandrea with the bountiful poonts in the italies and charite his most recent it felt callous to think that caroline could be swayed by a pot of guineas that she could possibly be that flintyeyed and mercenary yet riches as good as absence might make the heart grow fonder too busy to remember despising him whilst spending getting feathering her nest hmm dressed proper at last lewrie took his hat in hand and walked to the forrud door or tried to toulon and chalky had developed a new game with which to plague him whether genuinely glad to have him back aboard as their main delight their security or their chiefest playmate in their greatcabins or whether this was a holdover from the time that capt nicely had usurped that space a devious mischief they dreamt up to harass him when they werent spraying and marking everything in sight and thank god theyd stopped doing that their sole waking delight whenever he rose from his bed desk or settee was to dash ahead of him looking back impishly fling themselves down in his path with their paws aloft and bellies exposed and god help him if he didn t stoop or kneel to pet them and make fusses over them else his ankles and stockings were in for heavy weather aye damn yer eyes lewrie relented with a putupon sigh all but stumbling over their writhing tailwhicking eagerness with much oofing and groaning he knelt to placate them but it hurt some and was a slow process too gods sake dont try this after dark will ye toulon i can almost see chalky but you ye menace youre black as a boot yes big baby wubby feel good oh you too chalky lad mister gamble sah the marine sentry outside his doorway bawled slamming his musket butt on the deck and stamping his boots to announce the presence of their newest gift midshipman darcy gamble who came well recommended by both admiral sir hyde parker and nicely oh hell lewrie groaned caught kneeling and a cats belly under each hand come dammit christ he added under his breath the first officer mister langlies duty sir and mister gamble began to say stepping briskly into the greatcabins hat under his right arm chin high in the proud execution of his duties he widened his eyes though and could not help laughing at the sight of his captain on his knees yess mister gamble lewrie drawled embarrassed but determined not to let it faze him he sat back on his haunches and continued petting the cats careful for his fingers should they get too happy my pardons sir but the ah mongoose problem the ship had a few months ago sir gamble stated eyes on the stern windows and all but biting the lining of his mouth to stay sober oh the marines ratkillin trinidad mongoose lewrie asked as if it was trifling our pagan hindoo mongoose aye lewrie secretly savoured the look of perplexity on young gambles phyz wondering if the lad feared hed landed a berth in bedlam not a crack frigate the first officer mister langlie is of the opinion that it ah was a she captain sir gamble reported lips quivering as the lunacy of what he was saying struck him a pregnant she in point of fact there are simultaneous sightings of mongeese one must assume everywhere now sir lewrie shut his eyes and let a bemused smile spread on his face mine arse on a bandbox yet the rats are kept in check hey next match mister gamble put me down for a shilling on the mongoose im rich enough now lewrie supposed to himself as he slowly got to his feet ican afford aflutter afterword ah nawlins the big easy the city where i once had four hurricanes and closed pat obriens at dawn then thought that i was jean la fitte after an lsuole miss football game at baton rouge id driven down with a couple of good ol girls from ole miss whom i had met in memphis ole miss lost archie manning was quarterback and playing in a cast on his arm so they took the defeat and their cry of hoddytoddy christ amighty much like dionysiuss greek followers took evoe a reason for serious boozing thanks to louisiana state university press for the founding of new acadia by carl brasseaux and africans in colonial louisiana by gwendolyn midlo hall and to pelican publishing of gretna louisiana for reprinting george w cables book the creoles of louisiana for the description of the city and its citizens character or lack of it he did know them best creole and cajun character names were chosen blind from the indexes in these books and others so if anyone whose family name is mentioned may wish to take umbrage consider this i am well armed and know how to use them boudreaux balfas name was inspired by one of my bluegrassamericana cds where i found several cajunzydeco cuts done by dewey balfa are we kinfolk and his family band though i recall that his family reside on bayou la fourche not barataria so as dewey balfa said in the liner notes toujours balfa and more power to em cause theyre great im trolling for a free cd dewey for my rendition of cajun diction blame that famous cajun comic justin wilson with whom i spent a day doing a couple of tv commercials in memphis in the s when i was a producerdirector at wmctv for the tennesseans i borrowed a few of my own kin from my old stomping grounds round campbell claiborne and knox counties tennessee my maternal grandmother mary susan bowman ellison spoke of a cousin of her youth jim hawk mclean in the powell valley which is halfway between la follette tennessee and the cumberland gap every spring or when a wild hair hit him jim hawk and his cronies would build a flatboat and head downriver to the mississippi then raft down to vicksburg or natchez sell their produce and the boat then buy horses and good breeding stock and come home up the natchez trace to nashville the cumberland trail to knoxville all for a lark theyd sell all but the best mounts in knoxville then return to the powell valley originally powells with half their cash money for the year so i couldnt resist working a jim hawk ellison into the tale yes there was a panton leslie company a british firm that traded with indians spanish and frontier settlements its mentioned in both the south in the revolution volume three of a history of the south by john richard alden lsu press and the southern frontier to by vernor w crane w w norton co both provide dirt on the many plots and schemers who wished to expand westward along the entire length of the mississippi the united states plans the british scenarios and the individual states activities and yes by president adams and congress did wrangle over the costs of a military expedition to boot the weak spanish out of the old southwest it was up to president thomas jefferson to buy it in general james wilkinson was a paid spanish agent since no one could figure out how he was paid til someone noticed in the wake of the aaron burr filibustering conspiracy of that it was odd for barrels of flour and meal to go upriver from new orleans the barrels were too heavy and when finally opened were found to hold sacks or small barricos of silver coins wilkinson planned to seize kentucky tennessee or both as his personal kingdom at the same time he commanded all us army troops in both states or territories thanks again to bob enrione at cbs in new york for research on spanish money its contemporary value and how it was shipped all of the new world was short of solid specie and spanish dollars were good just about everywhere there was a shipload of six million bob said so i got inspired not only is bob a great source for fun facts but he also once owned enough brass muzzleloading naval guns to fit out a brig o war and he and his wife are multiple cat adoptees hence in the good folks column there really was a girandoni airrifle austria bought to of them and got shot of em rightquick too in lewis and clark took airrifles on the corps of discovery trek and theirs made in america worked a lot better almost anything else would pierre and jean la fitte hmmm i couldnt resist slinging them into a novel set round new orleans and their future infamous haunt on grand terre in barataria bay even if they were enigmas none of my research sources on themincluding a young adult nonfiction book i bought that tried really really hard to make slave dealing slave stealing piracy and murder sound like just grand politically correct funcan agree on where jean la fitte was born bordeaux portauprince haiti or cartagena he was nineteen in he was ten he went to a military school on guadeloupe martinique or in france he was partjewish and his family had run afoul of the spanish inquisition and had fled to the americas jean being born in now theres a good reason to prey on spanish ships theyd tried to turn your grandparents into tiki lanterns the only point of agreement is that jean la fitte was a sharp businessman but a horrid sailor whod heave up his innards on anything but a deadcalm sea anyway whether jean la fitte was seventeen fourteen or twelve in early he could have been part of jerome lanxades crew serving an internship in murder and mayhem so why the hell not stodgy academics may take umbrage but let me put it this way its my bloody book so sod you write yer own peeaitchdees peeaitchdees wwee don need no stinkin peeaitchdees and let me refer any thinblooded revisionists to my earlier statement about louisianans family names i am well armed and know how to use them lewries and pollocks appreciation about the best way to get at new orleans it was shorter quicker and cheaper than trying to float an army down the mississippi and at the time wouldve worked could it be that lewries plan mouldered in a soggy admiralty basement til the mousenibbled thing was pulled out and given to general sir edward packenham when he went up against andrew jackson robert v reminis the battle of new orleans penguin books lays the whole thing out though packenham screwed the pooch just as lewrie suspected any british army might since daring and quick werent in their vocabulary and will a commodore or rearadmiral lewrie play a role in it hmmm so the bad guys have had their stuff scattered to the wind and lewrie has come out smelling like rosewater again not only successful but fairly damn rich for a change when a chickennabob freshreturned from india with was thought immensely wealthy will money soften carolines heart whoever that spiteful and incognito scribbler is that writes anonymous letters to her detailing his amours has run out of fresh material and knows nothing of lewries caribbean doings might she ascribe to the views of clinton backers thats old news lets just move on or will it still be hell hath no fury i planned on killing off charite de guilleri but shes one of those characters who grows on you will she escape her dull relations and find a powerful sponsor and who might it be we left ol guillaume choundas an american navy prisoner on his parole but never count him out til you drive a stake through his heart hes harder to kill than cockroaches could it be will the cats stop marking territory now nicelys gone will midshipman gamble fit in aboard that floating madhouse hms proteus will lt langlies marital prospects towards lewries ward sophie be improved now that hes in for a goodly share of chink too and those mongeese how did the marines find them so far from india and the island of trinidad and howd they smuggle it them aboard in the first place will alan lewrie stay tagged as the ramcat or will ironbound become his new sobriquet in the royal navy all i can say for now is stay tuned buckaroos and prospero ill deliver all and promise you calm seas auspicious gales and sail so expeditious that shall catch your royal fleet far off my ariel chick that is thy charge then to the elements be free and fare thou wellplease you draw near exeunt omnes the tempest act v scene william shakespeare
