marion lennox the doctor the runaway heiress chapter one dr riley chase was bored it was his third night in a row with no action and riley was a man who lived on little sleep his medicolegal bookwork was up to date he was on his third coffee hed even defeated the crossword he was checking his email for the tenth time when his radio crackled to life two messages in twenty seconds one was announcing the arrival of a daughter hed never met the other was a suicide it was enough to make a man spill his coffee only the headlines of britains gossip magazines were stopping her drowning heiress suicides pippa was surrounded by blackness by cold and by terror any minute now something would attack her legs maybe it already hadshe could hardly feel anything below her waist the cold was bonenumbing she was past exhaustion and there was only one thing holding her up phillippa penelope fotheringham heiress to the fotheringham fast food fortune suicides after jilting she would not give roger the satisfaction of that headline are we sure its suicide riley was staring intently down at the blackened sea feeling more and more hopeless jilted bride harry toomey pilot for new south wales north coast flightaid was guiding the helicopter through parallel runs from the cliff harry riley and cordelia the teams flightaid nurse were searching north from whale coves swimming beach grim experience told them this would be where a body would be swept do we have a name riley said through his headset phillippa penelope fotheringham thats a mouthful their floodlight was sweeping the waters surface but the sea was choppy making it hard to see detail detail like a body do we know how long shes been missing five hours maybe longer five hours there was a party on the beach that went till late harry said kids everywhere when they left one of the security guys noticed an abandoned bundle of clothes plus a purse complete with id and a hotel access card she could have been in the water since dusk but were assuming later when it was good and dark five hours is about three hours too long for a happy ending harry didnt bother replying the crew knew the facts the worst part of this job was pulling suicides out of the water the jumpers were the worstthere was no coming back when you went over cliffs around herebut almost as bad were those who swam out from the beach knowing they couldnt get back desperate people desperate endings so how do we know she just didnt have a good time at the party riley demanded she could have ended up back in someone elses hotel room but even as riley suggested it he knew it was unlikely the police had called them in and the cops around here knew their stuff logic harry said bringing the chopper round for the next pass shes thirtyone about ten years older than the party kids shes staying at the sunspa resort in the honeymoon suite no less the cop who went to the hotel found her passport in the safe shes english and when he phoned the contact number in london her parents had hysterics it seems her wedding went up in smoke and our phillippa fled to australia with a broken heart alone she arrived late she booked into her honeymoon hotel with no wedding ring no groom and we can assume a decent dose of jet lag lethal combination she headed for the beach dumped her clothes and out she swam hes not worth it riley muttered feeling worse any minute now theyd find her they usually did he was a doctor he wasnt supposed to do this but yeah he was he thought grimly this was his choice he harry and cordelia did routine work clinics in outback settlements flying in and out at need but they also took search and rescue shifts sometimes it was incredibly satisfying saving people from their own stupidity sometimes though like now sometimes it was the pits phillippa penelope fotheringham where are you sweetheart after this time he knew they were searching for a body but it was still incredibly important to find her the parents could bury her could grieve could know exactly what had happened so what was happening when the call came in harry asked what do you mean whos lucy you read my email of course i did harry said unabashed harry was a highly skilled pilot goodhumoured and bighearted but his downside was an insatiable nose for gossip you took thirty seconds to put your gear on and you didnt supply alternative reading material so someone called lucys coming on friday and can you please put her up you going to tell us who lucy is riley thought of all the things he could say mind your own business a friend nobody important maybe it was the grimness of the night the tragedy playing out beneath the chopper but in the end he couldnt bring himself to say anything but the truth my daughter my daughter the two words resonated through the headset sounding terrifying hed never said those words out loud until now hed never had reason to say them youre kidding us harry breathed turning into the next sweep they were over the cliff now momentary time out while harry centred the machine for the next run checking bearings so they werent covering sea that had already been searched our solitary dr chase a daughter how old eighteen eighteen riley could almost hear harrys mental arithmetic cordelia was staring at him like hed grown an extra head doing maths as well youre what thirtyeight harry breathed a daughter eighteen years back thats med student territory man youve kept her quiet he had mostly because he hadnt known she existed three months ago hed received an email sent via the search and rescue website are you the dr riley chase who knew my mother nineteen years ago names dates details a bombshell blasting into his carefully isolated existence and then nothing no matter how desperately hed tried to make contact thered been no word until tonight im arriving on friday could you put me up for a few days but he couldnt afford to think about lucy now none of them could the chopper was centred again he went back to studying the waves grimly silent and harry and cordelia did the same despite the bombshell riley had just dropped every sense was tuned to the sea harry was a flippant carefree bachelor cordelia was a sixtyyearold dog breeder with a head cold riley was a man whod just been landed with a daughter tonight though now they were three sets of eyes with only one focus phillippa penelope fotheringham come on riley muttered into the stillness give yourself up the floodlight from their little yellow chopper a squirrel asbathe best in the business according to harrykept right on sweeping the surface of the night sea there was nothing but blackness nothing nothing and nothing where are you riley asked but he was talking to himself nothing there were lights the mists cleared for a momentthe fog of fear and cold and fatigueand let her see further than the next wave there were floodlights beaming out from the cliffs but they were so far out of her reach they might as well be on the moon she could see a helicopter moving methodically over the water was it searching for her had someone found her clothes it was a long way south too far was it coming closer just hold on she told herself but her body was starting to shut down she couldnt feel her feet at all she couldnt feel anything she was treading water up and down up and down if she stopped shed slip under a wave slapped her face and made her splutter i will not give roger the satisfaction she muttered but her mutter was under her breath to speak was impossible her teeth were doing crazy things she was so cold i will not be a jilted bride i will not die because of roger it was a mantra said over and over the helicopter turned it was still too far south so far i will not if its suicide shell definitely be dead by now and probably slipping under we all know that harry said but it doesnt stop us looking no but riley was speaking more to himself than to harry as a last resort lets think sideways what the crew hadnt spoken for what seemed hours theyd swept the expected tidal path and found nothing rileys words had tugged cordelia and harry out of their intense concentration but harry sounded as hopeless as riley felt im thinking riley said so think away its gotta be more useful than what were doing now riley thought a bit more and then put it in words okay if our phillippa was a normal tourist with no intention to suicide what time did she get to the hotel around seventhirty lets say shes jet lagged tired and hot she walks out to the balcony and the sea looks great she might take an impulsive dip at dusk eightish maybe the lifesavers would have long gone home but its not so dark that the waters lost its appeal if she got into trouble at dusk no one might see the party started on the beach at ten harry said hopelessness giving way to thought no one noticed the clothes before then were working on search parameters based on an entry at ten at the earliest sunday night the beach was busy one bundle of clothes might well go unnoticed an entry at eight shed be a lot further north by now and if it was a mistake shell be fighting her mothers sure shes suicidal how much does your mother know about you riley demanded id hate to imagine cordelia retortedwhich was a lot of speech for cordelia she was quiet at the best of times but tonight her head cold was making her miserable there was a moments pause while they all thought this through then i guess its worth a shot harry said and hit the radio assuming an eight oclock entry he asked bernie in their control room can you rework the expected position they did two more unsuccessful sweeps before bernie was back with a location half a kilometre north and closer to shore harry relayed lets go itd be so easy to slip under there will be no headlines not she was so tired the light had it turned was it coming she was imagining it her mind was doing funny loopy things the stars the fluorescence of the waves and the roar of the sea were merging into a cold menacing dream if this light wasnt really in her head she should raise her hand if she could summon the energy she could just maybe not she must something the squirrel banked and turned almost before riley barked the word harry was good so was riley his eyes were the best in the business but still the water was so choppy they were in by the cliffs any closer and theyd be victims themselves sure harry snapped no ten back five left hover they hovered the floodlight lit the water the downdraught caused the water to flatten there got it cordelia snapped they both had it and whats more there was a hand feebly raised shes alive riley said and he didnt try to keep the exultation from his voice how about that suicide or not it seems our brides changed her mind hold on phillippa penelope fotheringham were coming the light the noise it was all around her she couldnt think she also could no longer make her feet tread water a shadow was over her someone was yelling she was so tired do not slip under do not please something was sliding into the water beside her someone she was too weak to clutch but she didnt need to arms were holding her just holding another human she was safe she could let go she had to let go she could slip into the darkness and disappear dont you give up on us now phillippa penelope fotheringham someone growled ive got you she made one last effort one massive effort because this was really really important i am not marrying roger she managed my choice not his and my name is not phillippa im pippa chapter two there were sunbeams on her bedcover she woke and the sheer wonder of sunlight on linen was enough to make her want to cry someone was standing at the end of her bed male with a stethoscope she was in hospital of course the events of the night before came surging backor maybe only some of the events because there seemed to be gaps big gaps water dark terror then in the water someone holding her yelling at her or maybe they were yelling at someone else someone fastening her to him large male solid youre safe you dont need to hold on i have you noise lights people hospital hi the guy at the end of the bed said im dr riley chase welcome to the other side the other side she surveyed the man talking to her with a certain degree of caution he was gorgeous tall ripped and after the nightmare of last night reassuringly solid beautifully solid she took time to take him in detail seemed important detail meant real his face was tanned and strongly boned his deep blue eyes were crinkled at the edges laughter lines weather lines weather maybe his near black haira bit unkempt a bit in need of a cutshowed signs of sunbleaching thatd be from weather he was wearing cream chinos his shortsleeved shirt was open at the throatthis guy was definitely rippedand his stethoscope was hanging from his top pocket welcome to the other side gorgeous fitted the other side description she decided doctors didnt doctors arent in my version of heaven she said trying her voice out she was vaguely surprised when it worked nothing felt like it should work this morning its definitely heaven he said smiling a wide white smile that made him look friendlierand more heartstoppingly gorgeousthan any doctor shed ever met in the other place the pillows are lumpy and were big on castor oil and leeches and here she managed not a leech in sight we reserve our castor oil for emergencies and there are two pillows for every bed and because you were soggy the angels have decreed you can have more he waved an expansive hand around her notveryexpansive cubicle luxury she smiled at that she was in a twobed cubicle that opened out into the corridor the nurses station was on the other side giving whoever was at the station a clear view of her bed luxury and heaven also means your medical cares totally free he added especially as your documents say you have travel insurance her documents there was enough there to give her pause to make her take her time about saying anything else she looked at dr riley chase and he gazed calmly back at her she had the impression that he had all the time in the world dr chase a female voice called to him from the corridor maybe he didnt have all the time in the world unless its a code blue im busy he called back he tugged a chair to her bedside and straddled it so he was facing her with the back of the chair between them she knew this trick she often wished she could use it herself but it was a guy thing guy thing or not she appreciated it now it gave the impression of friendliness but it wasnt overly familiar she needed a bit of distance and maybe he sensed it youre on suicide watch he said bluntly we have a staff shortage are you planning on doing anything interesting she thought about that for a bit felt a bit angry felt a bit stupid were struggling with priorities he said maybe sensing her warring emotions feeling the need to be apologetic olive matchens had a heart attack last night shes a nice old lady were transferring her to sydney for a coronary bypass but until the ambulance is free id like a nurse to stay with her all the time only we need to watch you i dont need to be watched okay promise i have nothing to worry about he smiled again and his smile wow a girl could wake up to that smile and think it had been worth treading water for a night or more or more to find it you need to know youre at risk of that cod liver oil if you break your promise he warned and his smile became wicked teasing but there was seriousness behind his words she knew she had to respond i wasnt trying to do anything silly she tried to sound sure but it came out a whisper pardon i was not trying to suicide her second attempt came out loud very loud the noises outside the cubicle stopped abruptly and she felt like hauling her bedclothes up to her nose and disappearing under them your mothers frantic shes on her way to heathrow airport right now dr chase told her with someone called roger their planes due to leave in two hours unless i call to stop them forget hiding under the bedclothes she dropped her sheet and stared at him in horror my mother and roger they sound appalled they know youre safe but youve terrified them excellent thats not very kind no its not my mother still wants me to marry roger this sounds complicated he said sounding like he was beginning to enjoy himself then someone murmured something out in the corridor and he glanced at his watch and grimaced okay lets give you the benefit of the doubt and let roger and mum sweat for a bit what hurts nothing you know im very sure it does she thought about it he watched as she thought about it he saw more than she wanted him to see she decided his gaze was calm but intent giving her all the time in the world to answer but getting answers of his own while he waited she could see exactly what he was doing but there was no escaping those calm intelligent eyes my chest she said at last reluctantly theres a bit of water in your lungs weve xrayed its nice clean ocean water and youre a healthy young woman it shouldnt cause problems but were giving you antibiotics in case and you need to stay propped up on pillows and under observation until it clears your breathings a bit ragged and itll cause a bit of discomfort were starting you on diureticssomething to dry you out a bit therell be no longterm issues as long as you obey instructions my arms harness he said ruefully we try and pad em we new south wales north coast flightaid there was an echothe way he said the name some time last night those words had been saidmaybe even on the way up into the helicopter new south wales north coast flightaid maam at your service same voice same man were you the one who pulled me up she asked astounded i was he said modestly you were wet wet she felt disconcerted to say the least six years in med school he said proudly then four years of emergency medicine training plus more training courses than you can imagine to get the rescue stuff right put it all together and i can definitely state that you were wet he took her wrist as he talked feeling her pulse watching her intently so arms and chest are sore toes theyre fine though i was a bit worried about them last night she admitted you were very cold he turned his attention to the end of the bed tugged up the coverlet from the bottom and exposed them her toes were painted pink with silver stars her prebridal gift from one of her bridesmaids not the bridesmaid shed caught with roger one of the other five wiggle em riley said and she hauled her thoughts back to toes shed much rather think of toes than roger or bridesmaids so she wiggled then and she admired them wiggling last night shed decided sharks had taken them and she hadnt much cared today boy am i pleased to see you guys again she confessed and i bet theyre pleased to see you dont take them nighttime swimming again ever can i hear your chest yes doctor she said deciding submission was a good way to go she pushed herself up on her pillowsor she tried her body was amazingly heavy she got about six inches up and riley was right by her supporting her adjusting the pillows behind her he felt well that was an inappropriate thing to think he didnt feel anything he was a doctor but doctor or not he was very male and very close and still gorgeous he was midthirties hard to be sure he was a bit weathered he hadnt spent his life behind a desk he wouldnt have she decided if he was a rescue doctor if it wasnt for this man shed be very very dead what do you say to a man who saved your life i need to thank you she said in a small voice but he finished what he had to do before he replied cough he ordered she coughed and again good he said at last and she repeated her thank you my pleasure he said and she expected him to head for the door but instead he went back to his first position perched on the backward chair seemingly ready to chat arent you needed somewhere else she asked starting to feel uneasy im always needed he said with a mock modesty that had her wanting to smile dr indispensable so you save maidens all night and save everyone else during the day im not normally a duty doctor but were having staffing issues plus i havent finished saving this maiden yet you want to tell me why roger and mum told us you were suiciding i wasnt i get the feeling you werent or at least that you changed your mind i got caught in an undertow she snapped and then winced she sagged back onto her pillows feeling heavy and tired and very very stupid im sorry i accept it looks like suicide but i just went for a swim after dark on an unpatrolled beach it wasnt completely dark id been in a plane for twentyfour hours the sea looked gorgeous even if it was dusk there were people everywhere having picnics playing cricket splashing around in the shallows it was lovely im a strong swimmer and i swam and swam it felt great and i guess i let my thoughts drift then i realised the current had changed and i couldnt get back you must be a strong swimmer he said to stay afloat for eight hours is that how long i was there at least we pulled you up at fourthirty the sea wasnt exactly calm i figure you must badly want to live i do she said and she met his gaze unflinching it suddenly seemed incredibly important that his man believe her i want to live more than anything in the world you see i dont have to marry roger fifteen minutes later riley headed back to intensive care to check on olive matchens and he found himself smiling it was a good story told with courage and humour it seemed pippa had been engaged for years to her childhood sweetheart her fiancé was the son of daddys partner financial whiz almost part of the family only boring boring boring but what could she do shed told him shed marry him when shed been seventeen hed been twenty and gorgeous and she had been smitten to the eyeballs then he was lovely and patient while shed done her own thing shed even broken off the engagement for a while gone out with other guys but all the time roger was waiting in the wings constantly telling her he loved her he was a nice guy daddy and mummy thought he was wonderful there was no one else shed turned thirty shed really like a family her voice had faltered a little when she said that but then shed gone back to feisty why not marry him reason two days before the wedding shed found him in bed with a bridesmaid bomb blast didnt begin to describe the fallout from cancelling the wedding shed told him shed figured the best thing to do was escape leave for her honeymoon alone shed arrived in australia shed walked into the luxury honeymoon suite roger had booked in one of australians most beautiful hotels shed looked out at the sea and shed thought she had her whole honeymoon ahead of herand she didnt have to marry roger riley grinned as he headed for intensive care if there was one thing riley loved it was a happy ending he thought of what would have happened if they hadnt found her she was alive because of his service she was a woman whod been given a second chance because of the skills his team offered and shed use it he thought feeling exultant right now she was exhausted she lay in bed her face wan from strain and shock her auburn curls matted from the seawater her body battered and sore and still he saw pure spirit it felt fantastic helping people survive the adrenalin rush of search and rescue this was his happy ending solitude and work and the satisfaction of making a difference solitude the mornings satisfaction faded a little as the nuances of the word hit home the fact that his solitude was about to take a hit his daughter would be here on friday lucy what to do with a daughter he hardly knew whose existence had been kept from him because he was deemed inconsequentialnot important in the moneyed world lucy must have been raised in there was money in the background of the woman hed just treated he thought he could hear it in pippas voice english class and old money the combination brought back enough memories to make him shudder but the way the woman hed just left spoke shouldnt make him judge her and why was he thinking of pippa he now needed to focus on lucy his daughter she was probably just coming for a fleeting visit he decided her email had been curt to say the least flight detailsarrival at sydney airport friday morning an almost flippant line at the endif its a bother dont worry ill manage if its a bother to have a daughter family he didnt do family he never had he didnt know how but he could give her a place to stay that had to be a start he lived in a huge old house right by the hospital once upon a time the house had been nurses quarters but nurses no longer lived on site big and rambling and right by the sea it was comfortable and close and why would he want to live anywhere else last year the hospital had offered to sell it to him for a while hed thought about itbut owning a house that meant putting down roots and the idea made him nervous he was fine as he was he could see the sea when he woke up he had a job he loved surf at his back door a hospital housekeeper making sure the rest of the house didnt fall apart he had the perfect life his daughter wasnt part of it she was an eighteenyearold hed never meta kid on an adventure to australia meeting a father she didnt know had she always known who he was why had she searched for him had she been defying mummy and at the thought of her mother he felt anger almost overwhelm him to not tell him that theyd had a child anger was not useful put it aside he told himself hed meet lucy and see if she wanted him to be a part of her life no matter how tiny shed probably only stay a day or two that thought made him feel more empty than before hed known of her existence it was like a tiny piece of family was being offered but he already knew itd be snatched away again story of his life he shook his head managed a mocking smile and shook off his dumb selfpity olive matchens was waiting work was waiting hed saved phillippa penelope fotheringham pippa he did have the perfect solitary life once riley left an efficient little nurse called jancey swept into pippas cubicle to tidy up the edges someone was collecting her toiletries from the hotel she told pippa and she bounced off to set up a call to pippas mother dr chases instructions he says if you dont talk to her shell be on a plane before you know it it was sensible advice jancey put the call through and pippa managed to talk to her trying not to cough im fine mum i have a bit of water on my chestthats why i sound breathlessbut honestly theres nothing wrong with me apart from feeling stupid the hospitals excellent im only here for observation i imagine ill be out of here tomorrow and then the hardest bit no i was not trying to kill myself you need to believe that because its true i was just stupid i was distracted and i was tired i went swimming at dusk because the water looked lovely i was caught in the undertow and swept out thats all i would never then no i dont wish to talk to roger i understand hes sorry but theres nothing i can do about that tell him its over final theres no way were getting married if roger comes i wont see him im sorry mum but i need to go to sleep now ill ring you back tomorrow you not roger done jancey took back the phone and smiled down at her sensing shed just done something momentous pippa smiled back at the cheery little nurse and suddenly jancey offered her a highfive you go girl she said and grinned she managed a wobbly smile highfived in return and slipped back onto her pillows feeling fantastic she slept again and the nightmare of last night was replaced by janceys highfiveand by the smile of dr riley chase two lovely people in her bright new world olive seemed stable riley was well overdue for a sleep but problems were everywhere school holidays accidents flu it seemed half the hospital staff was on leave or ill and now they had a kid in labour amy sixteen years old alone she should not be here how could they send her away we need someone to stay with amy riley decreed shes terrified i know coral the hospitals nurseadministrator was sounding harassed but we cant special her i have no midwives on duty rachels on leave and ive just sent maryanne home with a temp of thirtynine i know she shouldnt be alone but it was her choice to come here she knows she should be in sydney meanwhile im doing the best i can ive put her in with your patient pippa coral sounded as weary as riley felt thats why i could free up a nurse for olive she said im juggling too many balls here riley so cut me some slack putting amy in the labour ward now will scare her and shell be alone most of the time putting her in with mums who already have their babies isnt going to work either the obs cubicle is close to the nurses station and im hoping your lady will be nice to her ive put them both on fifteenminute obs and thats the best i can do meanwhile we have troy haddon in emergencyhes been playing with those styrofoam balls you put in beanbags he and his mate were squirting them out their noses to see who could make them go furthest and ones gone up instead of out can you deal with it sure riley said resigned so much for sleep pippa woke and someone was sobbing in the next bed really sobbing fear loneliness and hopelessness were wrapped in the one heartrending sound she turned cautiously to see right now caution seemed the way to go the world still seemed vaguely dangerous when shed gone to sleep the bed next to her had been empty now she had a neighbour the girl was young very young sixteen maybe she was so dark her eyes practically disappeared in her face her face was swollen desperate terrified last nights drama disappeared pippa was out of bed in an instant hey she touched the girl on the hand and then on the face as she didnt react whats wrong can i call the nurse for you the girl turned to her with a look of such despair that pippas heart twisted it hurts the girl whispered oh it hurts i want to go home she sobbed and rolled onto her back she was very pregnant very pregnant as pippa watched she saw the girls belly tighten in a contraction instinctively she took the girls hand and held hard the girl moaned a long low moan that contained despair as well as pain and she clutched pippas hand like it was a lifeline pippa hit the bell this kid needed help a midwife a support team she looked more closely at the girls teardrenched face and thought she was sixteen seventeen at most she needed her mum the nurses station seemed deserted pippa however knew the drill hospital bells were designed to only ring once and light a signal at the nurses station so pushing it again would achieve nothing unless she checked behind the bed found the master switch flicked it off and on againand pushed the bell again another satisfactory peal and another three minutes later someone finally appeared dr riley chase looking harassed she needs help pippa said before riley could get a word in and riley looked at the kid in the bed and looked at pippa assessing them both before answering you should be in bed she needs a midwife pippa snapped a support person she shouldnt be alone i know he raked long fingers though his already rumpled hair took a deep breath and focused he glanced down the corridor as if he was hoping someone else would appear no one did he stepped into the cubicle once again as soon as he entered she had the impression that he had all the time in the world hed crossed over from the outside world and now he was totally in this oneonly this time he was focused solely on the girl in labour the contraction was over the girl was burrowed into the pillows whimpering hey amy im so sorry weve had to leave you alone he told her touching her teardrenched face with gentle fingers its hard to do this and its even harder to do it alone i did warn you this is why i wanted you to stay in sydney but now youre here we just have to get through it and we will pippa backed away as he took both amys hands in his and held it was like he was imparting strengthand pippa remembered how hed felt holding her last night and thought there was no one shed rather have hold her the guy exuded strength but maybe strength was the wrong word trust more it was a combination so powerful that she wasnt the least bit surprised that amy stopped whimpering and met his gaze directly amy trusted him she thought for a teenager in such trouble i want to go home amy whimpered i know you do if i were you id be on the first bus out of here riley told her but theres the little problem of your baby he wants out it hurts i want my mum i wish your mum could be here he said mum thought it was stupid to come so she did rileys face set a little and pippa guessed thered been conflict so now youre doing this on your own but you can do it amy i cant can i check and see how your babys doing pippa didnt need prompting to leave them to it she scooted back to her bed and riley gave her a smile of thanks as he hauled the dividing curtain closed youve been getting to know your neighbour he said to amy have you two been introduced pippa was back in bed with the covers up a curtain between them no amy whispered pippa your neighbour is amy amy your neighbour is pippa pippa went for a swim after dark last night and came close to being shark meat whyd you go for a swim at dark despite her pain amys attention was caughtmaybe thats what riley intended i was getting over guy problems pippa confessed she was speaking to a closed curtain and it didnt seem to matter what she admitted now and she might be able to help she thought if admitting stupidity could keep amys attention from fear from loneliness from pain then pride was a small price to pay you got guy problems amys voice was a bit muffled i was about to be married i caught him sleeping with one of my bridesmaids yikes amy was having a reasonable break from contractions now settling as the pain eased and she wasnt alone any more you clobber him i should have pippa said instead i went swimming got caught in the undertow and got saved by dr chase thats me riley said modestly saving maidens is what i do amy youre doing really well youre almost four centimetres dilated which means the babys really pushing i can give you something for the pain if you like i dont want injections it was a terrified gasp then you need to practise the breathing we taught you can you but he couldnt finish janceys head appeared round the door looking close to panic hubert trotters just come in she said hes almost chopped his big toe off with an axe and hes bleeding like a stuck pig riley you need to come give me strength riley said and rose can you stay with amy dotty simonds asthma she said riley closed his eyes the gesture was fleeting though and when he opened them again he looked calm and in control and like nothing was bothering him at all amy ill be back as soon as i can he said but amy was clutching his hand like a lifeline no please pippas in the next bed he started youre not by yourself but suddenly pippa wasnt in the next bed enough she was out of bed pushing the curtains apart and meeting rileys gaze full on amy needs a midwife i know she does riley said were shortstaffed there isnt one then someone else believe me if i could then id find someone id stay here myself i cant she believed him she thought fast this guy had saved her life this hospital had been here for her and more amy was a child then use me she said you i know theres still water on my lungs she said and i know i need to stay here until it clears but my breathings okay im here for observation more than care and if you can find me something more respectable than this appalling hospital gown ill sit by amy until she needs to push then ill call you he looked at her like shed grown two heads theres no need yes there is jancey said looking panicked hubert needs help now we cant ask then dont ask pippa said and dont worry you can go back to your toes and asthma ill call for help when i need it either for myself or for amy and i do know enough to call i may be a twit when it comes to night swimming but in my other life im a qualified nurse good basic qualifications plus theatre training plus intensive care and guess what midwifery you want to phone my old hospital and check she grabbed the clipboard and pen jancey was carrying and wrote the name of her hospital and her bosss name hospitals work round the clock checking my references is easy ring them fast or trust me to take care of amy while you two save the world or at least huberts toe off you go and amy and i will get on with delivering amys baby we can do this amy you and me women are awesome together theres nothing we cant do you want me to ring and check shes who she says she is jancey asked dubious he and jancey needed to head in different directions fast neither of them liked leaving pippa and amy together when youve got time i dont have time jancey said do we trust her shes a warm body and shes offered riley said do we have a choice hey they were about to head around the bend in the corridor but pippas voice made them turn shed stepped out the door to call after them she looked amazing riley thought and stressed or not he almost smiled she had brilliant red curls that hadnt seen a hairbrush since her big swim she was slightreally slightbarely tall enough to reach his chin her pale skin had been made more pale by the nights horror her green eyes had been made even larger from the neck up she was eyecatchingly lovely but from the neck down her hospital gown was flopping loosely around her she was clutching it behind she had nothing else on the deal is clothes she said with asperity bleeding to death takes precedence but next is my dignity i need at least another gown so i can have one on backwards one on forwards riley chuckled it was the first time for twelve hours hed felt like laughing and it felt great can you fix it he asked jancey mrs rogers in surgical left her pink fluffy dressing gown behind when she went home this morning jancey said smiling herself i dont think shed mind does it have buttons pippa demanded yes jancey said and a bow at the neck the bow glitters thatll cheer us up pippa said and heaven knows amy and i both need it assisting at a birth settled her as nothing else could amy needed someone she knew a partner a mother a friend but there seemed to be no one her labour was progressing slowly and left to herself she would have given in to terror what sort of hospital was this that provided no support to be fair though pippa decided as the afternoon wore on most hospitals checked labouring mothers only every fifteen minutes or so making sure things were progressing smoothly the mothers support person was supposed to provide company so wheres your family she asked they were listening to musicsome of amys favourites pippa had needed to do some seriously fast organisation there home amy said unhelpfully they made me come who made you come doc riley theres not a doctor at dry gum creek and they dont have babies there if doc riley can help it mostly the mums come here but doc riley said i needed young mum stuff so they took me to sydney central only it was really scary and lonely i stayed a week and id had enough there was no way i could get home but i knew doc riley was here so i got the bus but the pains started just as i reached here and im not going back to sydney central that explained why amy was in a relatively small hospital with seemingly not much obstetric support on hand pippa thought deciding to be a little less judgmental about amy being on her own why didnt your mum come with you mum says its stupid to come to hospital but she didnt tell me it hurt like this if you hadnt been here another contraction hit and she clung to pippa with a grip like a vice im here pippa told her as amy rode out the contraction hold as tight as you need yesterday i was staring death in the face its kind of nice to be staring at birth riley was in the final stages of stitching hubert trotters toe when jancey stuck her head round the partition shes good she said whos good our night swimmer shes been up to the kids ward in her gorgeous silver and pink dressing gown and she did the best plea you ever heard told them all about amy having a baby alone talk about pathos shes borrowed lacey sutherlands spare mp player she conned one of the mums into going home to get speakers shes hooked up the internet in the nurses station and shes downloaded stuff so she has amys favourite music playing right now she also rang the local poster shop i dont know what she promised them but the guys were here in minutes amys now surrounded by posters of her favourite telly stars oh and one of the mums donated a giraffe almost as tall as amy pippa has amy so bemused shes almost forgotten shes in labour shes a patient herself riley said stunned try telling her that oh and i managed to ring the number she gave us in england i had a minute and i couldnt help myselfshe had me fascinated her boss says send her back now seems your pippa left to get married two weeks ago and they miss her talk about glowing references can we keep her im not sure how we can just dont give her clothes jancey said grinning im off duty now were two nurses short for night shift but ive already stretched my shift to twelve hours how long have you stretched yours dont ask riley said okay hubert youre done pharmacy will give you something for the pain keep it dry come back in tomorrow and ill dress it again youll be in tomorrow hubert asked as jancey disappeared maybe youre supposed to be the flying doc not the base doc yeah riley said can you ring the union and let them know riley he sighed and straightened thatd be me amys moving into second stage it was mary the night nurse whod just started her shift pippa says you need to come straight away shed been having doubts about the ability of this small hospital to prepare adequately for a teenage birth but the transition from the cubicle near the nurses station to the labour ward was seamless a nurse and an orderly pushed amys bed into a labour room that was homey and comforting but still had everything pippa was accustomed to seeing riley was already waiting he smiled down at amy and pippa was starting to know that smile it said nothing was interfering with what he was doing right now and his attention was all on amy he hardly acknowledged her shed walked beside amys bed simply because amy had still been clutching her hand the moment amy no longer needed her she should back away she was in a fully equipped labour ward a doctor a nurse an orderly she could leave now but amy was still clinging her fear was palpable and at an unobtrusive signal from riley it was the nurse and the orderly who slipped away what was going on hey ames they tell me your babys really close riley took amys free handand pippa thought if she was amy shed feel better right now but maybe that wasnt sensible maybe that was a dose of hormones caused by rileys great smile dont tell me youre an obstetrician too she said and then she decided her voice sounded a bit sharp that was uncalled for she was however seriously thrown did this guy ever sleep hanging from ropes rescuing stupid tourists in the middle of the night sewing on toes delivering babies but amy knows im not an obstetrician riley said still talking to amy we have an obstetrician on standby dr louise will be here in a heartbeat if we need her but amy has asked if i can deliver her baby he glanced at pippa then and his smile finally encompassed her amy has need of friends it seems shes found you as well as me i know its unfair but are you okay to stay with us for a bit longer of course i can if i can sit down his smile was a reward all on its own there was also relief behind his smile and she thought hed be feeling the responsibility of being amys sole care person plus doctor okay then amy he said taking her hand just as a contraction started you have me you have pippa and you have you pippa has her chair we have our crib all ready all we need now is one baby to make our team complete so now you push pippas your cheerleader and ill stand around and catch then as the next contraction swelled to its full power he moved straight back into doctor mode he was a friend on the surface but underneath he was pure doctor pippa thought as she coached amy with her breathing and he was some doctor amy was little more than a child herself her pelvis seemed barely matureif pippa had to guess shed have said the girl looked like shed been badly malnourished if this was pippas hospital back in the uk amy could well have been advised to have had her baby by caesarean section csections never been option riley told her in an undertone as amy gasped between contractions how had he guessed what she was thinking neither is it going to be not if i can help it why amy comes from one of the most barren places in the country he told her i persuaded heragainst her mothers wishesto come to the city this time next time she may well be on her own in the middle of nowhere you want to add scar tissue to that mix amy was pushing away the gas and he took her hand again hey amy youre brilliant youre getting so much closer let pippa hold the gas so you can try again three deep breaths here we go up the hill up up up push for all youre worth yes fantastic breathe out down the other side youve stretched a little more a little more half a dozen more of those and i reckon this baby will be here it wasnt quite half a dozen amy sobbed and swore and gripped and pushed and screamed pippa held on encouraging her any way she could and so did riley two coaches two lifelines for this slip of a kid with only them between herself and terror but finally she did it pippa was already emotional and when finally amys tiny baby girl arrived into the outside world as pippa held amy up so she could see her daughters first breath as riley held her to show amy she was perfect pippa discovered she was weeping riley slipped the baby onto amys breast and amy cradled her as if she was the most miraculous thing shed ever seen as of course she was the baby nuzzled instinctively searching pippa guided her a little helping just enough but not enough to intrude the baby found what she was looking for and amy looked down in incredulous wonder im feeding her ive had a baby you have a daughter riley said smiling and smiling and pippa glanced up at him and was astonished to see his eyes werent exactly dry either surely a rough aussie search and rescue doctor just concentrate on your own eyes she told herself and sniffed shes beautiful she said trying to keep her voice steady she touched the babys damp little head with wonder no matter how many births shed seen this never stopped being a miracle have you thought about what you might call her and amy looked up at her as if she was a bit simpleas indeed she felt amy had just performed the most amazing complex difficult feat a human could ever performand pippa had simply held her hand im calling her riley of course amy whispered and smiled and smiled boy or girl i decided it months ago and im keeping her she said a touch defiantly riley smiled whos arguing itd take a team stronger than us to get baby riley away from her mum right now have you been thinking of adoption pippa said because if indeed it was on the table it needed to be raised mum said i had to amy said simply but doc riley said it was up to me hell support me wont you doc it will be hard riley said gravely now you know that i know amy said but me and this kid after this i can do anything shes going to have all the stuff i didnt shell go to school and everything she peeped a smile up at riley her courage and strength returning in waves with the adrenalin of postbirth wonder maybe shell even be a doc like you why not riley said if thats what you both want well make sure there are people wholl help you every step of the way he hesitated but amy rileys best chance of getting that is if you dont have six more babies in the next six years you dont need to tell me that amy said tartly and she kissed her babys head no fear i had this one because i was stupid me and her were not going to be stupid ever again amy was wheeled away up to maternity to be in a ward with two other young mums because thats where youll learn the most riley told her pippa promised to visit her later but amy was too intent on her new little riley to listen pippas legs were sagging she sat suddenly and felt extraordinarily relieved the chair was under her even her chair felt wobbly riley was beside her in an instant hitting the buzzer we need a trolley he told mary when she appeared fast mary or ill have to pick her up and carry her in your dreams pippa managed with a pathetic attempt at dignity no one carries me i believe i already have with the help of a helicopter she was trying to sound cheeky but she wasnt succeeding in truth the room was spinning warrens the only orderly mary said the trolley will be ten minutes you want me to fetch a wheelchair its okay pippa said ill be right in a minute youll be back in bed in a minute and to her astonishment rileys eyes were gleaming with laughter and with challenge lets do without warren or wheelchairs he said fancy inferring im inferior to our helicopter and before she could realise what he intended he lifted her high into his arms she squeaked mary giggled he does weights mary told pippa bemused what you said thats a red rag to a bull hes crazy he is at that mary said chuckling and holding the door wide to let riley pass you try getting workers compensation after this doc riley workers comp is for wimps riley had her secure solid against his chest striding briskly along the corridor past rooms full of patients and visitors carrying her as if she was a featherweight and not a grown woman in trouble trouble was right if a doctor did this in her training hospital to a nurse worse she was a patient this was totally unprofessional she needed to struggle but she didnt have the energy or the will trouble she was feeling like she really was in trouble like she wasnt exactly sure what was going on he was making her feel i should never have allowed you to help he muttered as he strode his laughter giving way to concern maybe he was feeling just how weak she was she wasnt really this weak she thought or maybe she was she thought about it or she sort of thought about it the feel of his arms holding her the solid muscles of his chest the sensation of being held it was stopping lots of thoughtsand starting others that were entirely inappropriate this was why theyd invented trolleys she thought to stop nurses to stop patients to stop her being carried by someone like riley it was so inappropriate on so many levels it made her feel youre exhausted he said it was totally unprofessional of me to allow you to help that shook her out of the very inappropriate route her thoughts were taking out of her exhaustion almost out of her disorientation to allow amy to have a support person she demanded forcing her voice to be firm what does that have to do with lack of professionalism you werent her support person i was if you hadnt allowed me to be i would have discharged myself and come right back amy would have said yes please and it would have been exactly the same except that you wouldnt be carrying me back to bed in your extraordinary bathrobe he finished and the laughter had returned it felt good she decided to make this man laugh and there her thoughts went again off on a weird and crazy tangent she was totally disoriented by the feel of his body against hers he turned into the next corridor and the turning made her feel a bit dizzy and she clutched he swore of all the stupid its not stupid she managed steadying again its wonderful last night you saved my life this afternoon weve helped amy have her baby youve done a fantastic twentyfour hours work dr chase did i tell you i think youre wonderful mary bobbed up beside them still chuckling dont tell him that she begged everyone does it gives him the biggest head riley really are you about to hurt your back nope riley said didnt you hear what our patient said im wonderful practically superman you cant hurt your back if youre superman superman or not coral says to tell you that you cant be a doctor in this hospital unless you get some sleep mary retorted coral said youre to leave and go to bed now immediately put pippa down first but leave the tucking in to me mary ordered as they reached pippas bed off you go dr superman sweet dreams i need to say thank you pippa managed so say thank you mary said sounding severe fast riley set pippa down he straightened and she felt a queer jolt of loss to be held and then released she was more exhausted than shed thought she wasnt making sense even to herself riley was smiling down at her with that amazing heartstopping smile a lifesaver of a smile its us who should thank you he said you were great her pillows were wonderful life was wonderful riley was wonderful you are superman she whispered youve saved my lifein more ways than one its what i do riley said superheroes r us come on mary lets see if we can find some tall buildings to leap you can leap all the tall buildings you want as long as you do it off duty mary said tartly goodnight then pippa riley said we both know what to do sleep it sounded good she slept smiling she slept thinking of riley chase a baby called riley a little girl eighteen years ago his daughter had been born and he hadnt known marguerite had chosen to have her alone or with her formidable parents rather than let him into her life hed thought hed loved her hed thought shed loved him he had no idea what love was what family was hed watched pippa with amy and felt the strength between them the instant bonding of two strong women that was what he didnt get didnt trust bonding family his daughter was coming it was doing his head in delivering amys baby thinking back to how it could have been if hed been deemed worth being a partner a father family yeah like that was going to happen he needed to sleep get his head under control or surf better no matter how tired he was surf helped he strode out of the hospital headed for the beach the thought of pippa stayed with him pippa holding a baby girl too much emotion his head felt like it might implode when all else failed surf chapter three she slept all night she was still right by the nurses station it was probably noisy but there was no noise capable of stirring her when she woke even the hospital breakfast tasted good she must have been very close to the edge she decided as she tucked into her leathery egg she must have been very close indeed if she was now appreciating hospital food just the concept of food felt great thered be lunch in a few hours time she thought with a thrill of anticipation maybe thered be a snack in between life stretched out before her resplendent in its possibilities she lay back on her pillows and thought this is day two of my honeymoon whats on today at around nine jancey bounced in accompanying an intern and she was aware of a stab of disappointment the young doctor was efficient caring thorough all the things he needed to bebut he wasnt riley dr chase isnt usually in the wards jancey told her as the intern moved off to sign her discharge papers pippa hadnt asked about riley but somehow jancey sensed pippa wanted to know hes in charge of search and rescue and he does clinics for our remote communities thats enough to keep any doctor busy this is the base for search and rescue yep we have two crews two planes and one chopper theres some coastal workstuff like rescuing youbut most of our work is clinics and patient retrieval from outback settlements it keeps us busy it keeps riley very busy so i wont see him again probably not jancey said giving her a thoughtful glance i know it seems a shame hes a bit hot our dr riley thats not what i meant of course it is jancey retorted grinning im a happily married woman but its still what i think its what every hotblooded woman in this hospital thinks he walks alone though our dr chase like the phantom pippa queried a bit nonplussed in the comics jancey smiled and nodded yeah though doesnt phantom have generations of dianas providing generations of little phantoms as far as we know theres not a diana in sight coral our nurseadministrator reckons he was crossed in love whoops she said as the babyfaced intern harrumphed with irritation from the corridor i know talking about dr chases love life with patients is totally unprofessional but whats life without a bit of spice and whos going to sack me with our staff shortage okay i gotta go and minister to the sick hold the hand of the learning will you be okay yes how else was a woman to respond are you staying in town for a while the hotels paid for until sunday then soak it up jancey said sleep spas maybe a massage but be careful our dr chase will be very annoyed if he has to rescue you again he wont do that pippa assured her its taken a lot of trouble to finally be on my own im on my lonesome honeymoon and it feels fantastic im not about to need anyone some wonderful person had fetched her luggage from the hotel pippa dressed and said goodbye to the ward staff jancey offered to accompany her to the taxi rank but first pippa needed to see amy amy was in a ward with two other young mums all getting to know their babies a lactation consultant was working with her and there were rumours that riley junior was about to have her first bath you were fab amy told her as she hugged her goodbye you and doc riley i wish i could have called her pippa too hey maybe i can riley pippa dont get too carried away pippa said grinning youre making friends all over the place by the time you leave here this young lady might have twelve names i wont be here long i dont like being in hospital amy confessed youre not planning to run away i wont do that ive promised doc riley ill be sensible you and me both pippa said it was great that shed been able to help yesterday she decided as she left amy it had made the terrors of the night before recede it had made rogers betrayal fade almost to insignificance birth beat death any day she decidedand it also beat marriage now to have her honeymoon half an hour later the porter ushered her into her hotel suite and finally pippa was alone her honeymoon hotel was truly madly scrumptious it had been years since pippa had spent any time in her parents world and shed almost forgotten what it was like or maybe hotels hadnt been this luxurious back then the bed was the size of a small swimming pool how many pillows could a girl use there must be a dozen and walking forward she saw a pillow menu an invitation to add more thick white carpet enveloped her toes two settees gold brocade with feather cushions looked squishy and fabulous the television set looked more like a movie screen two sets of french windows opened to a balcony that overlooked the sea below the balcony was a horizon pool stretching to the beach beyond it was magnificentbut pippa wasnt exactly into horizon pools or pillow menus she gazed around her and the familiar feeling of distaste surfaced more than distaste loneliness thats what these sorts of surroundings said to her she was an only child of wealthy parents shed been packed off to boarding school when she was six but during vacations her parents had done the right thing sort of theyd taken her to exotic locations and stayed in hotels like this her parents had booked her a separate room not close enough to bother them they had employed hotel babysitters from the time they arrived to the time they left as she got older she pleaded to be left at home there she least she knew the staffand of course there was roger roger was the only friend who was permitted to visit when her parents werent around he was the only kid who wasnt intimidated by her parents wealth and ostentation more than that hed been kind three years older than she was shed thought he was her best friend but now she gazed at her surroundingsat a hotel room roger had chosenand once again she felt tired tired to the bone the intern had told her to take it easy youve had a shock let your body sleep it off good advice she looked down at her halfacre of bed and thought shed come to the right place to sleep and to think she wandered out to the balcony and stared out to sea this was why shed swum so late on sunday nightfrom here the beach practically called to her a lone surfer far out was catching waves with skill shed love to do that on the far side of the headland she could see the cream brick building of the north coast health services hospital a busy bustling hospital perpetually understaffed perpetually doing good shed love to do that too and with that the sudden thoughtcould she what was she thinking nursing here she was here on her honeymoon not to find a job but the thought was suddenly there and it wouldnt go away nursing here because of riley no that was stupid really stupid youve been unengaged for less than a week she told herself you nearly died youve had a horrid experience and its rattled you yes you dont like fancy hotels but get over it and dont think past tomorrow but to work in a hospital where she was desperately needed to be part of a small team rather than one moveable staff member in a big impersonal city hospital to make a difference would it be running away no shed run away to go nursing deciding it was her career despite her familys appalled objections somehow this no longer seemed like running away maybe itd be finding her own place her own home they wont take me till my lungs clear she said out loud and surprised herself by where her thoughts were taking her could she she needed to sleep she needed to gain a bit of perspective shed been in the hospital for little more than a day how could she possibly make a decision yet but she already had meanwhile she eyed the ostentatious bed and managed a smile suffer she told herself unpack one of your gorgeous honeymoon nightgowns and hit that bed sensible advice she was a sensible woman she did not do things on a whim or not until tomorrow she hung a goldplated do not disturb sign on her door and fell into bed to her amazement she was asleep before well before shed even had time to feel amazed she dreamed not nightmares though sensible or not she dreamed of riley he couldnt get her out of his head pippa tuesday three days till his daughter came when he wasnt thinking about pippa he was thinking about lucy and the combination was enough to have him wide awake before dawn staring sightlessly at the ceiling trying not to think of anything and failing on both counts tuesday he and harry had a short run this afternoon collecting two patients and bringing them back for minor surgery tomorrow he was due to take a remote clinic on thursday at the settlement where amy lived if she was well enough they might be able to take her home the rest of the week was quietexcept for emergencies he should think of lucys arrival plan plan what it was enough to drive him crazy and on top of that pippa he never should have carried her it had seemed right no he never carried patients unless in dire emergencieshe wasnt stupidbut with pippa to wait for a trolley when she was clearly dizzy when she was wearing that ridiculous bathrobe when she was clearly in trouble how many patients made him feel like pippa did maybe it was the voice he thought harshly uppercrust english maybe that was his achilles heel only it wasnt the voice he lay back on his pillows allowing himself a moments indulgence letting himself remember the feel of the woman in the fluffy pink bathrobe a woman who smiled at amy who coached her who cared a woman who pushed herself past exhaustion because a sixteenyearold kid needed her her skill had stunned himshe had been totally on amys side she was a midwife any woman would love to have at a birth but he also saw her as a drowning bride at the end of a rope over a dark ocean the vision wouldnt go away phillippa penelope fotheringham pippa phillippa he corrected himself harshly english probably wealthy she was a nurse why would he think she was wealthy there was something about her some intangible thing the roger story what did it have to do with him forget it he told himself forget her he did not need complications in his life he already had a big one lucy he glanced out the window the sun was finally rising its soft tangerine rays glimmering on the water out at sea hed have a chance to think or not to think surf and more surf and medicine what was life other than those two things on tuesday evening riley went to see amy she was out on the hospital balcony cuddling her baby and looking longingly at the sunset over the distant hills hi riley said from the door and she beamed a welcome this is lovely she said youre my second visitor tonight second pippa came back to see me too look she held up a stuffed rabbit small and floppy with a lopsided grin that made riley smile cute how long ago had pippa been in how much had he missed her by these were hardly appropriate questions you missed her by minutes amy said and he caught himself and turned his attention back to where it should be to his patient i came to see you pippa asked if youd been in did she he couldnt help himself is she still staying at the same hotel she says her lowlife boyfriends paid so shell use it all shes trying to figure if he has to pay the minibar bill if he does then shes going to turn all those little bottles into a milkshake he grinned he could see her doing it the girl had spunk more pippa had been his patient more was not appropriate when can i go home amy asked id like you to stay for a week but you only go to dry gum every two weeks youre due there on thursday if i dont go with you then im stuck here until next time he hesitated four days postdelivery hed rather keep her here i hate hospitals she said she didnt it was just that she was lonely and young should he take her home medical needs versus emotional needs it was always a juggling act there was a medical clinicof a sortat dry gum it wasnt perfect but he looked into amys anxious face and he thought it would have to do if things are still looking good then well take you he told her but then i want you to stay with sister joyce for a week to make sure you know exactly how to care for your baby i know most of it she said i practically brought mums kids up she had too this kid had as much spunk as pippa no more pippa had clung to life for a night amy had been clinging to life for sixteen years hed known her since she was ten a bossy little kid who ordered her tribe of brothers and sisters around who herded them into clinic when she felt they needed it who hed heard from others had even been known to steal to get food for her siblings hed felt sick when hed learned she was pregnant he felt like hed personally failed her letting a sixteenyearold kid get pregnant he couldnt protect them all he could try theres still stuff you need to learn he told her i know there is she said serious in response sister joycell teach me you will stay with sister joyce for a week maybe longer she said diffidently im not going home to mum that was a big step huge riley mentally rearranged his schedule and hauled up a chair so baby rileys dad he said as far as he knew this baby was the result of a relationship that had lasted less than a month jason hes gotta pull his socks up yeah he wants to live with me amy said i asked sister joyce before i came here and she reckons she can get us one of the houses the governments built by the school wouldnt that be cool i asked her if just me and the kid could go into it and she said yes so i told jason if he gets a job and sorts himself out he can come too jasons okay she smiled then a smile much wiser than her years hell be nice if i can keep him straight if anyone could do it it was amy riley thought in increased bemusement her look was suddenly fierce determined focused you know when you and pippa were helping me i thought thats what i want to do she said be like pippa sister joycell help me im can learn youre a lot like pippa already riley said absurdly touched you both have courage in spades yeah shes good amy said what a waste she has to go back to england she didnt want to go back to england she was floating on her back in the sea of course she was going back when you fall off a horse get right back on how many riding instructors had told her that it was wednesday the morning was gorgeous the sea was glistening there were flags showing the beach was patrolled and two burly lifesavers were watching her every move she wasnt stupid she didnt go out of her depth she just floated thinking what was there to go back to her parents no they wanted her to marry roger it had seemed such a neat solution two sides of business meeting in marriage marry roger now her father had said youre wasting time messing about nursing get the family an heir what sort of feudal system did he live in but roger had been understanding for years even when shed said she wanted to break off their engagement and be free while she trained hed enjoyed himself then too she thought theyd even discussed their respective boyfriends and girlfriends then when hed gently resumed pressure to marry there had seemed no reason not to looking back she wondered had he been relieved to be given free time before he set about doing what he must to cement the family fortune it made her feel ill that shed been so stupid i just wanted him to be my friend she said out loud and heard the neediness of the child within but she was no longer a child she was in australia the sun was shining on her face there were two bronzed surf lifesavers watching over her this place was magic she thought whale cove was two hours drive north of sydney it was a town rather than a city clustered between mountains and sea and it had to be one of the most beautiful places in the world but you cant stay in your honeymoon hotel for ever she told herself why not rogers paying she rolled lazily over in the shallows thinking about the pros and cons of roger shed made some enquiries before shed comeenquiries that maybe she would have been wise to have made before shed got so close to the wedding it seemed her bridesmaid hadnt been the only one hed gambled on her not finding out she had to face ithed wanted her money not her ugh suddenly she found herself thinking of riley instead and it was a relief when his image superimposed itself over her exfiancés riley gambled too she conceded she remembered him holding her in that blackaspitch sea youre safe you dont need to hold on i have you he gambled with his own life to save others melodramatic no what was he doing now off saving more lives she rolled onto her back again watching the lone surfer shed seen before he was seriously good the waves were forming far out building and curving and finally breaking twelve feet high or so at their peak then falling away to nothing running themselves out as the water became deep again there must be a channel between those waves and the beach because in close the water was calm where she was the surf built again to about eight inches just enough to float on up and down watching the surfer thinking of nothing the surfer caught a huge swell he was sweeping in on its face then disappearing underneath as the wave curled she caught her breath shed seen this on videos being in the green room they called it totally enclosed in a tube of water she watched on entranced wondering where he was was he still upright the wave curled right over smashing to nothing at the end where hed entered collapsing in on itself all the way along slowly slowly for its full length and out he came at the other end still upright riley she was suddenly standing chest deep her hands up to shield her eyes from the sun was she imagining things maybe not it was time to get out the sensation that riley might be sharing her waterspace was somehow disturbing she caught the next tiny wave in then wandered up to the lifesavers she motionedcasually she hopedtoward the surfer hes good he is the older lifesaver said bit driven that one surfs no matter what the weather who is he though she already knew thats our doc riley the other guy said puts himself out there our doc great doc great surfer not bad with a billiard cue either crap at darts though the other guy retorted happy to chat on a quiet morning the missus says i should let him win because he hauled her brother off his fishing boat when it went down docd hate that though letting him win he gazed out at riley whod caught his next wave i sometimes wish hed come off out there and let someone else save him balance things up like like thats going to happen the other guy said and then he turned back to pippa youre english tourist im here for my honeymoon she said it felt absurd to say it but good honeymoons were great if they didnt involve roger so wheres the husband he never got past fiancé and i left him in england the casual conversation was starting to feel like fun isnt that the best place for fiancés if you say so the younger lifesaver was checking her out from the toes up and she thought she deserved that shed practically thrown him a comeon line hey hes coming out doc i mean he said motioning to the surf thats early and riley was right there one minute riley had been far out at sea the next hed surfed across the channel caught one of the tiddler waves then reached the beach before shed figured whether she wanted to see him why wouldnt she want to see him she tried to think about it while he hauled his surfboard onto dry sand and strolled up to meet them the lifeguards greeted him like an old friend she should greet him as well but she was too busy getting her breath back he looked awesome werent surfers supposed to wear wetsuits he was only in board shorts hed be a lot easier to handle in a wetsuit she decided handle handle as in come to terms with handle as in greet like a casual acquaintance not handle in any other way but the look of him he was every inch a surfer tall tanned and ripped he didnt look like a doctor he looked like he should be should be maybe she should just stop thinking her silence was starting to be marked hi she managed at last and he smiled and that smile he had no right to look like that it threw her right off balance i thought it was you he said have you been looking after her he asked the lifeguards this is pippa our floater from sunday night whoa how to embarrass a girl but neither of the lifeguards looked judgmental instead they looked impressed you managed to stay out there for eight hours not by choice id guess not the older lifesaver said and not because of the fiancé left in england um no i thought youd stick to the hotel pool riley said and then a mum yelled from the end of the beach that her kid had his toe stuck between two rocks and the lifeguards left them to go and see more toe trouble pippa said striving for casual you guys could start a collection we try to keep them attached riley said theres something a bit offputting about toes in specimen bottles even ones painted pink with stars are you okay i yes what else was a girl to say nightmares he asked suddenly gentle in doctor mode only he didnt look anything like any doctor shed ever met standing in the sun with water dripping across his eyes his wet hair sort of flopping his chest glistening do not go there no she managed and was absurdly pleased that shed got the word out hows the cough mary says youre booked at outpatients this afternoon for a full check coughs settled im all better im pleased to hear it he said hows the heart she knew what he meant cardiovascular concerns didnt come into this he was enquiring about roger happy she said a trifle defiantly sure im sure im a bit humiliated but the honeymoons helping especially as rogers paying good ole roger bride living it up at his expense is he back at the coal face paying for it dont you dare feel sorry for him she snapped and he grinned i never would im on your side guys stick together not me i stick with my patients im not your patient she said and he nodded thoughtful no but you were meaning you have to be loyal meaning i cant ask you out to dinner that was one to take her breath away she fought for a little composure it took a while the way he was making her feel maybe it was a good thing she couldnt be asked out to dinner so tell me about amy she said because he didnt seem to be making any move to leave to walk away patient confidentiality you just told these guys i was the what did you call me sunday nights floater that was a nonspecific impression so give me a nonspecific impression of amy he hesitated he shaded his eyes and watched the surf for a bit and she wondered if hed gone too far already she was after all his patient but he didnt leave and when he spoke his voice was low and lazy and she thought she was exaggerating her importance to him he was simply settling into his morning on the beach and wouldnt be hurried amys amazing he said at last she deserves everything we can do for her and more shes the oldest of ten kids and she cares for them all shes bossy and smart and toughshell fight for what she needs and ive seen her bloodied by it only we let her down we thought of her as a kid the nursing sister out where she comes from at dry gum creek was gutted when she found out she was pregnant her mother would never have told her the facts and riley junior is the result so why is she here we cant deliver babies at dry gumtheres no resident doctor normally we bring the mums here two weeks before their babies are due but louise our obstetrician was concerned at amys age she thought shed be better at the teen centre in sydney so we took her there but she ran away here where she knows me sensible or not she trusts me and she made it here before the baby arrived we can only be grateful she didnt hitch a ride all the way back to dry gum so now well probably take her home tomorrow theres no father that comes within patient confidentiality of course she hesitated will you personally take her home thats what flightaid doeswhen were not pulling maidens out of the water after eighthour swims im sorry she muttered dont mention it if you know how good it felt to haul you up alive if you knew how good it felt to be pulled up alive she stared out to sea and thought of where shed be if this man hadnt found her she shuddered rileys hand was suddenly on her shoulder warm and strong and infinitely reassuring dont he said yes we hauled you up but you did most of it yourself in a couple of hours youd probably have drifted into the next bay and been washed up on the beach youd have faced a long hike home but you would have lived happily ever after we both know no one knows anything for sure he said i could have been hit by lightning right now while i was surfing do i have nightmares because i almost was theres not a cloud thats the scariest thing he said gravely theres nothing else to pull lightning to except me i feel all trembly thinking about how close a call ive just had he looked anything but trembly she decided he also made her heart twist there was enough gravity behind his laughter to make her think this guy really did care he really did worry that she might have nightmares theres a psychologist at the hospital riley said gently and she knew she was right peters great with post traumatic stress make an appointment to see him this week she didnt need do it pippa he said i should have made the appointment for you but its not your job i just scrape people off he said its others work to dust them down i was only in the ward on monday because were permanently shortstaffed so now youre surfing whos not on my side now he demanded sounded wounded our team picked up two carcrash victims north of dubbo in the wee hours im off duty im sorry dont be sorry he said switching back to caring almost immediately it doesnt suit you you know he hesitated looked out to sea for a bit decided to say what he wanted to say the worlds your oyster he said at last youre back in the water you have a honeymoon suite in the most beautiful place in the world i get the feeling youve been drifting maybe you could use this time to figure what you want whats good for you standing heres good its a great spot to be he said softly and the surfs waiting then before she guessed what he intended he lifted his hand and brushed her cheek with his forefinger it was a feather touch it was a touch of caring or maybe a salute of farewelland why it had the power to send a shudder through the length of her body she had no idea she stepped back startled and his smile grew rueful pippa im not a shark he said im just me the guy at the end of the rope just me saying goodbye good luck god speed and with that he raised his hand in a gesture that seemed almost mockingand turned and headed back to his surf back to a life she had no part in if hed stayed on the beach one moment longer he would have kissed her hed wanted quite desperately to kiss her shed looked lost no matter how strong shed beenwalking away from the appalling roger managing not to drown helping with amy all of those things required strengthhe still had the impression she was flailing she was nothing to do with him she was a woman hed pulled out of the water like marguerite hed met marguerite on a beach in the south of france of course she had been there as it seemed she was always there working on her tan wealthy english idle on a scholarship at university in london hed been on summer break the first hed ever had where he hadnt needed to work to pay for next terms living his roommate had known someone who wouldnt mind putting them up the south of france had sounded fantastic to a kid whod once lived rough on the streets of sydney hed bumped into marguerite on the second day in the water literally bumped when shed deliberately swum into his surfboard shed faked being hurt and giggled when hed carried her from the water shed watched him surf admired flirted asked him where he came from asked her to teach her to surfand suddenly things had seemed serious on her side as well as his the first time he met her parents he knew he was hopelessly out of his class but he didnt care for marguerite didnt care either openly scorning her parents disapproval for five weeks she lay in his arms she held him and she told him he was her idea of heaven for a boy whod never been held the sensation was insidious in its sweetness she melted against him and the rest of the world disappeared then reality the end of summer he returned to university and the relationship was over for weeks he phoned her every day but a maid always took his calls marguerite was unavailable finally her mother answered annoyed his calls were interfering with her maids work you were my daughters summer plaything she drawled a surfer australian amusing she has other things to focus on now he thought she was lying but when he insisted she finally put marguerite on her mother was right it was over oh riley leave it how boring you were fun for summer nothing more you helped me drive mummy and daddy crazy and its worked they still want to send me to finishing school can you imagine she chuckled then but there was no warmth in her laughter there was even a touch of cruelty i do believe theyre about to be even more annoyed with me but they wont know until its too late and ill enjoy that very much so thank you and goodbye but dont ring again theres a lamb its over shed become pregnant to rebel to prove some crazy point over her parents and pippa pippa was rebelling against her family as welllike marguerite dont judge a woman by marguerite no he told himself harshly dont judge at all and dont get close hed seen enough of his attempts at family his attempts at love to know it wasnt for him so why did he want to kiss pippa he didnt a mand be a fool a man needed to surf instead or find someone else to rescue someone who wasnt pippa she wandered back to the hotel lay on the sun lounger on the balcony and gazed out to sea thinking i get the feeling youve been drifting maybe you could use this time to figure what you want whats good for you and were permanently shortstaffed the idea of staying had taken seed and was growing to be part of a hospital community doing such good its romantic nonsense she told herself yes you should go back to nursing but you know your old hospital will give you your job back but to live here she could make herself a permanent home a home without the ties the guilt the associations of a family who disapproved of her whod never cease expecting her to be something she wasnt she could buy a house something small overlooking the sea home it was a concept so amazing she couldnt believe it had taken her until now to think of it maybe shed never been in a place where the call had been this great until now like a siren song home she could put up wallpaper plant tomatoes do whatever people did with homes do it she told herself now before you change your mind and then she forced herself to repeat the question that had been hovering well maybe from the time shed been hauled out of the sea am i doing it because of riley dont be ridiculous her sensible self was ready with all the justification in the world youre doing it because of you its time you settled got yourself somewhere permanent and rileys hardly in the hospital he is sometimes there was a reason doctorpatient relationships were banned she thought was she suffering a bad case of hero worship how could she be friends with riley the relationship would be skewed from the start so what she muttered i can avoid him is hero worship enough to stop me applying for a job making a home in the best place in the world yes sleep a bit more think about it i cant drift she told herself give yourself another day yes but thats all she decided one more day of drifting and then then move forward toward riley no she told herself harshly toward a home nothing more chapter four riley enjoyed thursdays he liked the flights to the outback settlements today he was scheduled for a clinic at dry gum creek and dry gum was one of his favourites it was amys home it was also the home of sister joyce possibly the fiercest senior nurse in the state he loved her to bits he pushed open the door to the flightaid office feeling good and found harry sitting at his desk with news no cordelia he said morosely her head colds worse and her german shepherds in labour they stared at each other knowing each was thinking the same thing cordelia was a firstrate flight nurse but she was in her sixties her health wasnt great and her dogs were growing more important than her work we can go without her harry ventured working without a third crew member was fine unless there needed to be an evacuation there wasnt an evacuation due todaythey were simply taking amy home and doing a routine clinic but there was always a chance that a routine clinic would turn into an evacuation crews of two were dicey they had no choice theres a note for you to go see coral harry said shoving himself off the desk takeoff in ten minutes ill check what coral wants first riley said their nurseadministrator was good she usually let them bethat shed contacted them today meant trouble more trouble than a missing crew member are you sure coral was short and almost as wide as she was tall she was sitting on the far side of her desk looking at pippas cv like it was gold you really want to work here im not sure if i can get a work visa ill have you a work visa in the time it takes my secretary to make you a coffee youre a midwife yes but but dont say anything coral begged im reading this thinking im shutting up about two of your postgrad skills i could have me a war if this gets out the surgeons will want you intensive care will want you i want you when would you like to start i need to find somewhere to live id like to find a house but it might take time we have a house for med staff four bedrooms and a view to die for you can move in this morning my hotels paid until sunday coral nodded reflective you are still getting over your ordeal she conceded rileyll say you should rest im rested your chest okay ive been given the allclear hmm the middleaged administrator gazed speculatively at pippa how about we break you in gently with a training daygive you an overview of what services we offer outside the hospital id love that she surely would her lone honeymoon wasnt all it was cracked up to be well coral said glancing with approval at pippas jeans and tshirt youre even dressed for it im not pippa said alarmed i came with resort wear i bought these jeans yesterday ill need to buy serviceable clothes if im to nurse here for where youre going jeans are great coral said beaming just wait until i tell riley corals door was open she was drinking coffee with someone that someone had her back to the door but she turned as she heard him approach pippa what was there in that to take a mans breath away nothing at all shed probably come here to thank them something formal she rose and she was wearing neat jeans and a tshirt she looked almost ordinary but this woman would never look ordinary yesterday on the beach in her bikini shed looked extraordinary now in jeans she still looked you two know each other coral said and he pulled himself together coral was intelligent and perceptive and she was looking at him now with one of her brows hikedlike there were questions happening and she was gathering answers whether he liked it or not i of course you know pippas the one we pulled from the water who helped with amys baby i do know that coral said her brow still hiked so you know shes skilled i know shes skilled he felt wary now and he wasnt sure why pippas face wasnt giving anything away if anything she looked wary as well i have pippas application to work for us on my desk coral said right here it looks impressive youve worked with her any reason i shouldnt sign her up on the spot pippa work here there was a concept to think about but coral was giving him no time answer he told himself now theres no reason at all he said and was aware of a stab of satisfaction as he heard himself say it was that dumb no because pippa was an excellent nurse yes because the satisfaction he was feeling didnt have a thing to do with her competence it was everything to do with her looking at him measuringly those calm green eyes promising a man promising him nothing get a grip for how long he asked indefinitely pippa told him i dont want to go back to england youll change your mind it was pippas turn to hike an eyebrow she had him disconcerted very disconcerted but he didnt have the timeor the inclinationto stand around being disconcerted he remembered work with relief harry was waiting amy and her baby would be loaded and ready to go this is great he said pippa welcome to whale cove hospital but can we talk about it later i need to leave ive sent a message to the ward to hold onto amy for fifteen minutes coral said we have a couple of things to discuss first ive told pippa she can move into the medical house you have four bedrooms i assume theres no objection they both stilled at that he saw pippas face go blank and he thought he hadnt been part of that equation you never said id be sharing with riley she said its the hospitals house coral said riley mostly has it to himself but we occasionally use it for transient staff im not transient pippa said i have a guest coming tomorrow riley said over the top of her you have four bedrooms coral glanced at her watch clearly impatient if you have one guest there are still two bedrooms spare it should suit pippa for the short term im not going to knock back a great nurse for want of accommodation meanwhile pippa would like to work immediately but i dont want to put her on the wards until im sure shes fully recovered cordelias not coming in you need another team member pippa needs an overview of the service so im sending her out with you can you fit her up with a flightaid shirt so she looks official she can tag along while you can talk her through life here youll be back by late tonight pippa ill let you sleep in tomorrowitd be a shame to waste that honeymoon suite of yours you can move into the house at the weekend you can start here on monday and we can all live happily ever after no objections great lets go it had happened so fast she felt breathless she had a job she was flying over the australian outback in an official flightaid plane harry was flying it dual qualifications he said smugly when she expressed surprise triple if you count me riding a harley riley here doctors and surfs he has two skills to my three its just lucky im modest harry made her smile the whole setup made her smile the back of the plane was set up almost as an ambulance harry and riley were up front pippa was in the back with her patients amy and baby riley this was the start of her new life she was wearing a flightaid shirt the flightaid emblem was on her sleeve and there was a badge on her breast she was about to attend a clinic in one of the most remote settlements in the world this time last week shed been planning her wedding four days ago shed been floating in the dark expecting to die now she was employed as a nurse heading to an outback community to help dr riley chase the man whod saved her life he was a colleague she had to remind herself of that over and over but in his flightaid uniform he looked he looked isnt doc riley fabulous amy was headed home with her baby and things were looking great in her world she was bubbling with happiness hes made me see so many things you reckon one day my baby could be a doctor why not i wish id gone to school amy said wistfully mum never made me and there were always kids to look after then doc riley read the riot act and now they all go my littliell go to school from day one she glanced at amys uniform itd be so cool to wear that it did feel cool wearing this uniform her parents would hate it pippa thought they hated her being a nurse and for her to be a nurse here they still had roger they liked roger they didnt like her she was getting morose luckily little riley decided life had been quiet long enough and started to wail that gave her something to do a reason not to think of the difficulties back home she changed the baby and settled her on amys breast as she worked she marvelled at how neat everything was in the planes compact cabin how easily she could work hereand she also marvelled that she felt fine shed had a moments qualm when shed seen how small the plane was if she was to be airsick no such problem she grinned at mother and baby feeling smug somehow shed found herself a new life shed be good at this flightaid nurse heir to the fotheringham millions never the twain shall meet so do we use her straight away riley sighed he was having trouble coming to terms with their new team player and the fact that harry was intent on talking about her wasnt helping she doesnt have accreditation he said shes an observer only but youve left her in the back with amy amy needs company and im feeling lousy company i can see that harry said thoughtfully so is it a problem that were saddled with a young attractive competent nurse rather than our dogsmelling cordelia cordelias competent he snapped and pippas not we dont know that so youd rather the devil you know harry nodded i can see that no comment riley was feeling incapable of comment he sat and glowered and harry had the sense to leave him alone so what was the problem the problem was that riley didnt know what the problem was pippa was a patient he thought of her as a patientonly he didnt she had the same english accent as marguerite he couldnt hold an accent over her no but there were so many conflicting emotions lucy was coming his daughter shed have this accent as well his hands were hurting he glanced down and realised hed clenched his fingers into his palms tighter than was wise he needed to lighten up before lucy arrived he hauled out his wallet and glanced at the picture lucy had sent him when shed contacted him three months ago his daughter was beautiful she was eighteen years old and she was so lovely she took his breath away hed had nothing to do with her life hed been a father for a mere three months even then after that one email sent from an address that had then been deleted hed flown to england and confronted marguerite tracking her down had taken time but hed found her married to a financier living in a mansion just off sloane square she was still beautiful taking supercilious to a new level and bored by his anger yes she is your daughter but purely by genes she doesnt want you or need you in her life if she contacted you itll be because shes vaguely interested in past history nothing more i imagine that interest has now been sated why would she wish to see you i dont wish to see youi cant imagine why youve come no im not telling you where she is go away riley you have no place in our lives so tomorrow he was expecting a teenage daughter coming to stay and in the back of the plane was a woman called pippa who was also coming to stay two women identical accents trouble it must be bad to look like that harry said cheerfully and riley found his fists clenching again women he said maybe cordelias right maybe dogs are the way to go women are more fun harry said you have to be kidding for the last halfhour shed been gazing down at a landscape so unfamiliar she might well be on a different planet she was gazing at vast tracts of red dusty desert stunted trees growing along dry river beds weird wonderful rock formations sunlight so intense it took her breath away a barren yet beautiful landscape that went on for ever dry gum creek was in the middle of the outback there seemed no other way to describe it out back of where out back of the known world the little plane bumped to a halt riley hauled open the passenger door and pippa gazed around her in wonder red dust gnarled trees and windswept buildings dogs barking at their little plane like it was an intruder that had to be seen off a few buildings that looked like portable classrooms a slightly more solid building with a sign saying general store a big old house that looked like it might have once been a stately homestead but that time was long past corrugatediron huts scattered far out a couple of the rangy dogs came rushing to greet them harry fended them off while riley swung himself up into the back to help amy with the baby welcome to dry gum creek harry told pippa i hope you arent expecting swimming pools shopping malls gourmet eating she smiled feeling pure excitement i left my credit card at home a couple of little girls were peering out from the hut nearest the plane they were eleven or twelve years old with skins as dark as amys did amy come one of them yelled she sure did riley called come and meet your new niece the girls came flying all gangly arms and legs looking as thrilled as if it was christmas day riley handed riley junior down to pippa dont let the girls have her unless amy says so he said in an undertone amy was enveloped in hugs and pippa thought this was almost the reaction of kids welcoming their mother she could just as well be their mother riley told her hauling equipment from the plane and once again she was struck with this mans ability to read her thoughts it was entirely disconcerting theyd be lost without her are you coming home one of the kids asked amy amy shook her head she disentangled herself from them a little and took her baby from pippa nope i gotta stay with sister joyce for a week then im gonna have one of the huts by the school me and baby riley will live there will jason live with you dunno pippa saw amys face tense where is he hes got a job the oldest girl said sounding awed hes out mustering cattle he said to tell you wow amy breathed wow mum says its stupid the little girl said she says he can live off the pension its not stupid amy looked back to riley for reassurance and riley was right beside her his hand under her arm amy was sixteen years old shed given birth four days ago and her confidence would be a fragile shell were taking amy to sister joyce now riley told the little girls shell stay there until shes strong enough to look after herself well look after her the oldest of the little girls said and squared her shoulders were good at looking after people amys taught us and jasonll help amy told her i know he will like doc riley with riley supporting her her confidence came surging back and she peeped an impudent teasing smile at pippa my jasons got a job how cools that my jasons gorgeous even more gorgeous than doc riley though i bet you dont think so what that was a weird statement pippa thought totally in appropriate so why was she trying really hard not to blush pippa had been expecting a hospital but it wasnt a hospital at all it seemed little more than a big decrepit house with huge bedrooms the woman in charge was an elderly dour scot with a voice like she was permanently attached to a megaphone sister joyce she introduced her to some of her residents while riley started his clinic harry it seemed was needed elsewhere the water pump was playing up while harry was here joyce decreed he might as well be useful and pippa got the feeling joyce would be as bossy as she needed to get what she wanted for her residents maybe she needed to be bossy it seemed joyce took care of sixteen patients on her own and even though the place wasnt a hospital the residents were certainly in need of care were not defined as a hospital joyce told her were not even a nursing home because we cant meet the staffing ratio a lot of our population is nomadic every time we try and take a census so i can get funding everyone seems to go walkabout so this is a sort of a boarding house with hospital facilities with you on duty all the time joyce gave a wintry smile dont look at me like that girl im no saint this place suits me i cant stand bureaucracy i train our local girls to help me and i do very well amys been the best i have hopes shell come back to work baby or not and we have doc riley the mans a godsend sensible intelligent he doesnt shove medical platitudes down peoples throats weve had medical professionals come out here with their lectures and charts of the five food groups holding up pictures of lettuce lettuce our kids get two apples a day at school they take home more but even apples cost a fortune by the time we fly them in lettuce she snorted her disgust you want to see what rileys doing i yes please theyd moved out on the veranda where half a dozen old men were sitting in the sun gazing at the horizon are these guys patients diabetics joyce said you look closely at their feet and youll see and half of them are blind diabetes is a curse out here an appalling diet when they were young a bit of alcohol thrown in for good measure eye infections untreated you name it most of these guys are in their fifties or sixties but they look much older rileys doing his best to see this doesnt happen to the next generation he was joyce ushered her into a room at the end of the veranda riley was seated beside a desk a dark buxom woman who joyce introduced as the local school teacher was shepherding a queue of kids past him hes doing ear and eye checks joyce told her i do them but i miss things theres seven steps to go through for each child to make sure they have healthy eyes he also checks ears these people are tough and selfsufficientthey have to bebut that causes problems too many of these kids dont even tell their mums when their ears hurt infections go unnoticed in this environment risks are everywhere so we back each other up riley swears he wont let a kid go blind or deaf on his watch how longs he been doing this six years now he came to do an occasional clinic then helped me set this place up there was such a need how can you operate a hospital without a doctor we cant joyce said bluntly while they watched riley joke with a smartmouthed small boy but we dont have a choice were three hundred miles from the next settlement and most of the older people wont go to the city for treatment even if its the difference between life and death i do what i can and doc riley is a plane ride away always hes nearly as stupid as me joyce said dryly i need him he comes so youre a qualified nurse english yes i wont hold that against you coral said youre here to watch sounds boring want to help please you can speed things up joyce said tell her riley she said raising her voice so riley could hear he had a little girl on his knee inspecting her ear i need to settle amy in and help harry with the pump is it okay with you to let the girl work are you up to it riley asked youre not asking me to do brain surgery right he grinned no brain surgery were doing ears and eyes and hair and an overall check you dont know what youre letting yourself in for joyce and i take every inch of help we can get id love to help pippa said simply and she meant it so riley kept on checking ears checking eyes and pippa took over the rest she listened to small sturdy chests she ran a quick hair checkit seemed lice were endemic but she didnt find any she did a fast visual check of each child checking for things that might go unnoticed and blow up into something major the kids were good for riley but they were like a line of spooked calves as they approached pippa ready for flight sam kemenjarra if you dont stand still for nurse pippa ill tell her to put the stethoscope in the ice box before she puts it on your back riley growled to one small boy the little boy giggled and subsided and let himself be inspected but the line still fidgeted pippa was a stranger these kids didnt like strangersshe could feel it nurse pippas been sick herself riley said conversationally to the room in general he was looking at a small boys eyes taking all the time in the world no matter how long the line was she had the feeling this man never rushed he might rush between patients but not with them every patient was special he was good she thought he was really good but then she went swimming in the dark and nearly drowned riley said we had to pull her out of the water with a rope hanging from a helicopter there was a collective gasp hey pippa thought astonished what about patient confidentiality but riley wasnt thinking about patient confidentiality he was intent on telling her storyor making her tell it it was really scary wasnt it pippa i yes she conceded the line of children was suddenly silent riveted if i hadnt swung down on my rope to save you what would have happened she sighed what price pride why not just go along with it i would have drowned she conceded so much for floating into the next bay and that would have been terrible riley said and he wasnt speaking to her he was speaking to the kids pippa was all alone in the dark floating and floating all by herself far far from the land there was no one to hear her calling for help thats what happens when you go swimming in the dark or even when its nearly dark waterholes and rivers are really dangerous places after sunset she got it she was being used as a lesson her indignation faded it seemed this was a great opportunity to give these kids a lesson it was also settling them i thought something might eat my toes she conceded figuring she might as well add corroborating colour at night you cant see whats under the surface all sorts of things feed in the water at night crocodiles one little girl asked breathless you never know riley told her we dont have crocodiles here he told pippa so its safe to swim in the waterholes during the day but at night theres no saying what sneaks into the water looking for juicy little legs to snack on and i wouldnt be here with my rope it takes two hours for harry and i to fly here but youd come a little boy said sounding defiant if i went swimming at night youd come with your rope itd take me too long riley said like pippa youd be floating for a long long time getting more and more scared you were really scared werent you pippa i was more scared than ive ever been in my life she conceded i was all alone and i thought i was going to die it was the scariest thing i can imagine i know now to swim at night is stupid there was a moments hesitationa general hush while everyone thought about it then i wouldnt do it the little boy declared only girls would be that stupid we would not the girl next to him declared and punched him and the thing was settled night swimming was off the agenda and while were at it we should warn nurse pippa about bunyips riley said still serious and there was a moments pause ooh yes one little girl ventured casting a cautious glance at riley a glance with just a trace of mischief bunyips are scary bunyips pippa said theyre really really scary a little boy added theyre humongous biggern the helicopter and they have yellow eyes they sneak around corners they come up from holes in the ground they eat people it was practically a chorus as the whole line got into the act their teeth are biggern me you couldnt go night swimming here cos youd get eaten by a bunyip first or dragged down a hole for the little bunyips to eat the child on rileys knee said with ghoulish relish you youre kidding me pippa said blanching appropriately why yes riley said grinning yes we are the whole room burst out laughing pippa got her colour back and giggled with them the room settled down to ears and eyes and hair and chests pippa kept chuckling she worked on beside riley and it felt fantastic she was good she was seriously good cordelia was dour and taciturn the kids respected her they did what she asked but they were a bit frightened of her they werent frightened of pippa they were enjoying her showing off to her waiting impatiently for riley to finish with them so they could speed onto their check with nurse pippa pippa they liked the name he heard the kids whisper it among themselves pippa pippa pippa nurse pippa whod almost drowned hed had no right to tell them the story of pippas near drowning but the opportunity had been too great to resist drownings in the local waterhole were all too common and nearly all of them happened after dusk kids getting into trouble bigger kids not being able to see pippas story had made them rethink hed told the story to fifteen or so kids but itd be spread throughout the community within the hour pippas ordeal might well save lives and it had had another unexpected advantage somehow it had made pippa seem one of them shed been given a story hed brought many medics out herethere was genuine interest within the medical communitybut mostly the visitors stood apart watched or if he asked them to help the kids would shy away frightened of strangers but pippa was now the nurse who doc riley had saved on a rope if pippa was serious about staying she wouldnt be shed stay until she either made it up with her fiancé or she had her pride together enough to go home it wasnt worth thinking of her long term but even if she was only here for a month or two shed make a difference he watched her as he worked as she worked and he was impressed she was settled into a routine now tugging up tshirts listening to chests tickling under arms as she finished so the kids were giggling and the kids waiting in line were waiting for their turn to giggle she was running her hand through hair saying ooh i love these curlsyou know if you washed these with shampoo theyd shine and shine does sister joyce give you shampoo see how my curls shine lets have a competition next time i come lets see who has the shiniest curls every time you wash with shampoo they get shinier no elizabeth oil does not make curls shinier it makes them slippery and the dust sticks to it ugh she had the capacity to glance at the childs medical file and take in what was important straight away can i see your toe doc riley stitched it last month did he do a lovely neat job of it riley didnt have time to check the details pippa was checking cordelia would have decreed it a waste of time cordelia followed orders pippa was great the day flew he was having fun he decided in some amazement there was something about pippa that lightened the room that made the kids happy and jokey harry came in to check on their progress and stayed to watch and help a bit just because it was a fun place to be how could one woman make such a difference finally they were finished theyd seen every school child which was a miracle all by itself half an hour harry said thatll get us back to whale cove by dark i need to do a quick round of joyces old guys before i go riley said plus i need to say goodbye to amy you want to come pippa of course its been a long day i hadnt planned on you working ive had fun she said simply and smiled and he thought that maybe he needed to concentrate on the job at hand he did not need to think of any woman like he was thinking of pippa why not the question had him unsettled unlike harry who fell in love on average four times a year he steered clear of even transitory commitment but he did date women he did enjoy their company when hed told pippa on the beach that hed like to invite her to dinner it had been the truth but the more he got to know her the more he thought itd be a mistake why she was fascinating shed thrown herself into today with enthusiasm and passion shed made him laughshed made the kids laugh she loved what she was doing she was amazing and there was the problem he looked at her and knew with pippa he might be tempted to take things further he never had not since marguerite one appalling relationship when hed been little more than a kid except it was more than that a shrink would have a field day with his dysfunctional family hed known three fathers none of them his real one hed had stepbrothers and stepsisters theyd always been moving home to escape debts stupid stuff hed escaped as best he could physically at first running away sleeping rough then he got lucky welfare had moved in and he got some decent fosterparents there he learned an alternative escapehis brains the library at school a scholarship to study medicine at melbourne then england hed earned the reputation of a loner and that was the way he liked it only living at university hed finally discovered the power of friendship it had sucked him right inand then hed met marguerite after marguerite hed tried to settle only how did you learn to have a home it didnt sit with him it wasnt his thing when hed come back from england hed gone to see his fosterparents theyd been the only real family he knew theyd written to him while he was away they were caring for two new kids who were taking all their energy they were delighted that his studies were going well theyd given him tea and listened to his news his fostermother had kissed him goodbye his fosterfather had shaken his hand but theyd been distracted he wasnt their child theyd done the best they could for himit was time he moved on he did move on his six years in whale cove was as long as hed ever stayed anywhere he took pleasure in the challenges the job threw at him but still his restlessness remained he had no roots a surfboard and enough clothes to fit in a bagwhat more did a man need but as he walked along the veranda with pippa he thought for the first time in years a man could need something else but a man could be stupid for thinking it exposing himself yet again riley joyces voice cut across his thoughts that was good his thoughts were complicated and pippas body was brushing his that was complicating them more yes his reply was brusque and joyce frowned is there a problem not with me there isnt he said pulling himself up i need to see amy and then well go im sorry but i need you to wait joyce told him ive just got a message to say gerry onjingis in trouble theyre bringing him in now he was climbing the windmill at one of the bores and he fell off they had pickets stacked up underneath gerry fell on one and its gone right through his leg they werent going to leave before dark bundling gerry into the plane and taking him back to the coast wasnt an option not with half a fence post in his leg for the men had brought gerry in picket attached he lay in the back of an ancient truck and groaned and pippa looked at the length of rough timber slicing through his calf and thought shed groan too gerry was elderly maybe in his seventies though in this climate she was having trouble telling crikey riley swung himself up into the tray the instant the truck stopped you believe in making life exciting this is like a nose bone only different funny haha gerry muttered and riley knelt and put his hand on his shoulder well get you out of pain in no time he told him joyce was already handing up his bag lets get some pain killers on board before we shift you inside will i have to go to sydney and the way he said it no matter how much pain he was in pippa realised the thought of the city was worse no promises mate riley said we need to figure what the damage is well get you out of pain and then well talk about it it was amazing how such a diverse group of professionals could instantly make an elite surgical team even harry took part by the time the morphine took effect harry had organised an electric buzz saw with an extension cord running from the veranda electrics better he said briefly less pressure and this fittings got fine teeth itll take seconds rather than minutes by hand the picket had pierced one side of gerrys calf and come out the other pippa helped joyce cover gerry with canvas to stop splinters flying riley and pippa supported gerrys leg while harry neatly sliced the picket above and below closest i can get without doing more damage harry muttered and put the saw down and disappeared fast turns green our harry riley said grinning at his departing friend still if you asked me to pilot a chopper in weather harrys faced id turn green too he was slicing away the remains of gerrys pants assessing the wound underneath it looked less appalling now there was less wood but it still looked dreadful pippa whats your experience in getting bits of wood out of legs ive done shifts in city emergency we coped with a chair leg once she made her voice neutral and businesslike guessing what gerry needed was reassurance that this was almost normal rileys question had been matteroffact like bits of wood in legs were so common they were nothing to worry about you got it out we did when he came out of the anaesthetic the publican was there demanding he pay for the chair so this little picket piece of cake she said smiling down at gerry thinking it wasnt the wood had splintered the wound looked messy and how did they know what had been hit and not hit then lets organise xrays riley said and an ultrasound you can do an ultrasound here portable kit riley said sounding smug eat your heart out sydney okay gerry lets get you inside boys slide that stretcher in beside him pippa shoulders joyce hips ive got the legs and picket count of three one two three they moved him almost seamlessly and in less than a minute gerry was in what looked to pippa to be a perfect miniature theatre i thought this place wasnt a real hospital she said astounded its not riley was manoeuvring the xray equipment into place dry gums too small for much government funding joyce is funded for a remote medical clinic nothing more but we have lots more this place is run on the smell of an oily rag joyce and i do a lot of begging and blackmail joyce said any company who wants to mine out here who makes money off these peoples land can expect a call from me joyce even buys shares riley said in admiration shes been known to get up in shareholder meetings and yell shes a ripper gerry said faintly hell if she had some money imagine what our joyce could do shes doing a fantastic job anyway riley said okay gerry that legs positioned everyone else behind the screen lets take some pictures the leg wasnt broken there was a communal sigh of relief the wood had splintered surgery would be messy the ultrasound came next and pippa watched in awe reading an xray was one thing but operating an ultrasound she could pick out a baby babies were big even then when the radiographer said look at a closeup she was never sure she was looking at the right appendage but that riley was competent was unquestionable he was checking for damage thatd mean gerry had to go to sydney regardless he was looking at flow in the main blood vesselsevidence that the artery was obstructed blockage to blood supply that might turn to disaster when splinters were dislodged despite the trauma gerry seemed relaxed as long as he didnt need to go to sydney whatever doc riley did was fine by him i reckon we can do this riley said at last he cast a thoughtful look at pippa how tired are you she was tired but she wasnt missing this for the world not tired at all she lied and he grinned right we have one doctor two nurses and an orderly thats harry green or not he gets to keep the rest of the place running while we work pippa youll assist me joyce are you happy to anaesthetise sure joyce said you can anaesthetise here was something else to astound a nurse acting as anaesthetist joyce is a ran a remote area nurse riley said rans are like gold sometimes shes forced to do things a doctor would blanch at because theres no choice we both do like now im not a surgeon and joyce isnt an anaesthetist but we save lives if you end up working with us youll get to do everything as well joyce said briskly out here we do what comes next okay riley lets not mess around i have work to do after this even if you dont she had to ask this was tricky surgery and to attempt it here i know hes scared she ventured but surely itd be safer to take him to the city i can do it she and riley were scrubbing fast while joyce was booming orders outside without a trained anaesthetist to risk riley paused then turned to her think about it he said harshly gerrys seventy years old and hes lived here all his life no thats not true hes lived near here for him dry gum is a big settlement even here is a bit scary if i send him to sydney ill be throwing him into an environment that terrifies him ill do it if i have to but its a risk all by itself ive had one of my old guys go into cardiac arrest in the plane and id swear it was from terror with three of us ive weighed the risks and theyre far less if he stays here accept it or not he said grimly were doing it by the time it was over pippa had an even greater breadth of understanding of this mans skill quite simply it took her breath away he took her breath away joyce was competent but she wasnt trained in anaesthesia that meant that riley needed to keep an eye on what she was doing checking monitors assessing dosages at the same time as he was performing a complex piece of surgery that frankly she thought should have been done in sydney by surgeons whod had experience in such trauma who had skilled backup she was the backup she worked with an intensity shed seldom felt she was rileys spare pair of hands and he needed her clamping clearing blood holding flesh back while he eased eased eased wood out of the wound the splinters first of all and then the main shaft he had all the patience in the world it was a skill that awed herthis ability to block out the world and see only what was important right now few people had it a psychologist once told her it usually came from backgrounds where the skill was necessary to survive what was rileys background she didnt have a clue all she knew was that there was no one shed rather have in this room right now doing what he had to do in order to save gerrys leg they worked on mostly in silence except for rileys clipped instructions that fierce intensity left no room for theatre gossip and she wouldnt have it any other way and finally finally riley was stitching both entry and exit wounds closed the stockman had been incredibly lucky to have not severed an artery and bled to death in minutes to have not even have fractured his leg hell stay with you for a week though joyce riley said in a seeming followon from pippas thoughts theres a huge chance of infection ill put a brace on and tell him if it comes off in less than a week hell have permanent nerve damage its a lie but its justified if he heads off back to camp well have him dead of infection in days wont antibiotics pippa started he wont take them riley said wearily none of the older men will unless we forcefeed them they see medicine as a sign of weakness the women accept them now they see how the kids respond and they believe were educating the kids but gerry missed out so hell wear an immobilising cast for a week and im sorry pippa but we need to stay here tonight until gerrys fully recovered from the anaesthetic shed already figured that out shed been horrified that hed attempt such surgery here but having done it he couldnt walk away with gerry recovering from anaesthesia and no doctor on call i can manage joyce said but riley shook his head ill be the one who tells gerry the rules in the morning can you put pippa up here its a full house joyce said your sitting room glenda anorrjirris in it joyce said apologetically her lukes asthmas bad and shes frightened theyre staying with me until its settled i told you to keep myself professional i do joyce said flaring i keep my bedroom to myself which is a miracle all by itself riley growled joyce has a onebedroom apartment attached to the hospital he explained she has a sitting room and a bedroom which shes supposed to keep private i dont mind sharing with pippa youre having your bedroom to yourself he was dressing gerrys leg and pippa watched as he added a few artistic touches scaffolding from toe to thigh a dressing around the lot hell think his legs about to fall off joyce said thats what hes meant to think you said you have a full house do you have room for him i was counting gerry he can have the last bed in mens room two but you and pippa and harry you know harry sleeps on the plane he doesnt trust the kids riley explained to pippa neither do i would you trust kids with a shiny aeroplane parked in their back yard you two could use amys place joyce said looking thoughtfully at pippa i have a little house ready for when she leaves here theres a bed and a sofa in the living room i know you have sleeping bags but i dont like the idea of pippa sleeping rough im not nervous pippa said feeling nervous im happy to sleep anywhere pippa swims with sharks riley said and grinned he edged joyce out of her position at the head of the table and started reversing the anaesthesia job well done team thank you nervous or not you and pippa will share amys house joyce said riley glanced at pippa his grin faded i guess we will riley said why not said pippa chapter five sleeping over was a common occurrence riley was used to it harry slept in the plane its not halfbad he told pippa we have a comfy bed in the back and i always carry some fine emergency literature he grinned and hauled a fat paperback out of his back pocket a buxom woman with tattoos a dagger and not much else was pouting her lips provocatively on the cover im happy as a pig in mud riley wasnt as happy they shared a late dinner with joyce in the hospital kitchen then it was time to head over to amys little housewith pippa she seemed fine with it he had the feeling she was even eyeing him askance because she was sensing he was edgy why was he edgy normally hed roll his sleeping bag out and sleep under the stars hed lost count of the number of times hed gone to sleep listening to cordelia snoring or medical students giggling or sobbing and telling him their latest love life dramasleeping under the stars did that for some he didnt mind he could listen to it all and keep his distance so tonight hed much prefer to sleep under the stars only that would leave pippa in amys house alone or under the stars with him and something told him pippa wasnt as tough as she made out he thought as they walked the short distance to the house five days ago shed nearly drowned hed learned a lot about trauma in his years in this servicehed had victims come back and talk to him about their experiences and hed talked to psychologists therell be flashbacks hed been told you cant go so close to death without suffering and after eight hours in the water believing shed drown shed been close to an appalling edge this trip had been meant to break pippa in slowly before sending her back to her luxury hotel tonight to make her sleep outside personally he loved it but the sky was immense and for someone already fragile someone whod just reentered the world of emergency medicine after being a casualty herself even joyce had seemed to sense it it had to be amys house i wont jump you pippa said he stopped short you wont i thought i should tell you she said joyce took me aside and told me you were honourable youre looking worried maybe i should reassure you that i am too in fact im feeling exceedingly chaste i guess thats what comes from being a jilted bride you dont sound very jilted he said cautiously he was feeling cautious im not she said im exceedingly pleased to be free so you neednt walk three yards away from me as if youre afraid i might latch on and not let go youre pleased to be free this conversation had him floundering yes i am i have the rest of my life ahead of me ive had a very exciting afternoon and a very satisfactory day im starting to make all sorts of plans but men arent included and im very tired so show me a bed and then you can do what you want but you dont need to look after me and you neednt think ill be needy im independent dr chase and im loving it only she wasnt he woke at three in the morning and she didnt sound independent at all pippa was sleeping in the double bed in amys bedroom riley was on the foldout settee in the living room it wasnt sobbing that woke him it was gasps of fear then the sounds of panting breathless terror muted as if the pillows themselves were drowning her if he wasnt a light sleeper he would have missed it but riley was a light sleeper at the best of times and he was awake and at her door before he thought about it moonlight was flooding through the window her bedding was everywhere she was wearing panties and bra but nothing else she looked like she was writhing in fear her curls were spread out on the pillows and her eyes were wide and staring as if she was seeing hell it was enough to twist the heart pippa he was by her bed grasping her shoulders holding her pippa wake up youre having a nightmare pippa her eyes widened she jerked sideways as if he was the thing that terrified her pippa its riley dr chase the guy in the helicopter pippa its riley the guy youre planning not to jump and somehow the stupidity of that last statement got through her body stilled slumped her eyes slowly lost their terror and the terror was replaced by confusion she focused her gaze found his locked she shuddered and the shudder ran the length of her body she was cold to touch the temperature in the desert dropped at night to almost freezing shed gone to sleep with a pile of quilts but the quilts were on the floor she shuddered again and it was too much he tugged a quilt from the floor wrapped it round her and tugged her into his arms he held her as one might hold a terrified child she seemed so shocked she simply let it happen the shudders went on dreadful born of fear and cold and sheer disorientation he should never have agreed to her coming here he thought swearing under his breath when hed been a kid tiny hed found a budgerigaror rather one of the feral cats around the dump theyd been living in had found it hed managed to get it free then brought it inside warmed it and settled it into a box a couple of hours later hed checked and it had looked fine delighted hed lifted it out the little bird had been someones pet it was tame it talked it clung to his finger it pecked his ear with no adult to advise him hed played with it until bedtime hed popped it back into its box for the night and the next morning hed opened the box to discover it was dead years later hed talked to a mate who was a vet and hed told him the sad little story itll still have been running on adrenalin the vet said you werent to know but youll have stressed it more and today hed allowed pippa to come here hell have stressed her more he swore and held her close its okay pippa youre safe yes youre in the middle of the australian desert with people you dont know yes you nearly drowned yes your marriage is off but hey the threats are all past no one and nothings doing you harm well get you warm and tomorrow well fly you back to the coast were intending to fly via sydney you could catch a plane home to england from sydney how about if we phone your mother that might make you feel like things are real he was talking for the sake of talking not waiting for a response keeping his voice low and gentle keeping the message simple youre safe theres no threat youre under control the shudders were easing she was curled against his body as if she was taking warmth from him and maybe she was he hadnt undressed to sleephed hauled some rugs over himself and relaxed on the settee knowing hed be up two or three times in the night to check on gerry he was grateful for it now he was in his flightaid uniform the shirt was thick workmanlike cotton if hed undressed as she had itd be skin against skin and he could stop his thoughts going there right now he did stop his thoughts going there discipline nineteen years of discipline since im im sorry she was recovering enough to talk but not enough to pull away she was taking every shred of comfort she could find huddled against him spooned against his body wrapped in quilts she needed it all i shouldnt i woke you nightmares are the pits he said softly and he smelled her hair and thought and thought and didnt think it was inappropriate to think i didnt i mean i dont know why you didnt talk to the psychologists back at whale cove i didnt need to that was better there was a touch of asperity in her voice she had spirit this woman if she didnt have such spirit shed be dead he thought and the idea made him hold her tighter for some reason well for a very good reason it was good she wasnt dead but why was it more important that it was pippa im okay she said but she didnt move youre freezing you pushed all the covers off stay where you are until youre warm she was silent for a while and he could feel her gathering her thoughts gathering her senses figuring out what had happened how shed ended up where she was so i didnt have any blankets on she said at last cautiously and he grinned the woman in her was back nope oh my dont worry about it ive seen worse things come out of cheese she stiffened she sat up and swivelled pardon im a doctor he said apologetically i learned anatomy in first year i am not your patient that was definite no im your colleague yes he thought about it yes maam he felt her smile rather than heard it and it felt good to make her smile but suddenly he was thinking of her back in the water again and this time it was he who shuddered hey she said sorry youre cold nope im fine you can go back to bed youre still shaking not much i could go across and get some heat pads from joyce no she said and suddenly the fear was back in her voice born straight out neediness it had been some nightmare hed had nightmares himself as a kid one of his stepfathers had enjoyed using a horsewhip the beatings themselves hadnt been so bad waking up though in the night when dreams blended reality into something worse okay he wouldnt leave her the beds big she whispered shshare he stiffened she felt him stiffen and he felt her immediate reaction indignation were colleagues she said pulling away backing against the bedhead eying him with something that looked suspiciously like scorn we have one bed why does everything have to be about sex i didnt think it was about sex it wasnt until you reacted like that like what like id jumped you go back to your sofa no he could cope with her need he thought she was a colleague no she was a patient think of her as a patient the lines were blurring he wasnt sure how he thought of her but he knew he couldnt leave her why not she demanded because one of two things will happen he said either youll lie and stare at the ceiling for the rest of the night scared to go back to sleep or youll go back to sleep and the nightmare will be waiting youre not out from it yet how do you know he knew if the shaking hadnt stopped so whats happened to you she asked her voice suddenly gentling and that caught him so unawares he could have dropped her only he no longer had her shed slipped back onto the bed and only her feet were still touching him he wanted quite badly to be holding her again the thought jolted him what was happening here he didnt react to women like this but shed somehow pierced something hed hardly known he had it was like shed opened some part of him hed been unaware existed it made him feel exposed he had to get it sealed up again fast but how could he do that while she was here harry says you have a daughter her voice was suddenly prosaic like they were making polite conversation at a dinner party she tugged her quilt he let it go and she pulled it over her she huddled under it and she tried to hide the next wave of shivers whats her name harry talks too much he sighed lucy you want to tell me about her she was eying him over the top of the quilt im guessing lucy isnt one of children in a suburban back yard with mummy in her apron and a casserole warming on the stove there are no slippers and pipe waiting at my place he said it almost selfmockingly and she slid to the far side of the bed and hauled one of her disarranged pillows to the empty side she patted it you want to tell me about it she was still asking for help he knew she was she couldnt camouflage those tremors this woman was needy so what was stopping him lying on the spare pillow hauling up a quilt and telling her about lucy pride fear fear at letting someone as perceptive as she was close he wouldnt be letting her close or no closer than she needed to be to get her warm she wanted distraction from terror what harm he sighed he slid onto the pillow and tugged up a quilt then because it was what she needed and he knew it was he slid an arm around her shoulders and tugged her close she stiffened for a moment but then he felt her relax it was as if she too was reminding herself to be sensible back to front he growled i can warm you more that way wait she said and sat up grabbed her shirt and tugged it on two flightaid shirts colleagues needs must she said lying down and turned her back letting him tug her into him he felt her force herself to relax muscle by muscle he was doing the same himself the smell of her hair soft and clean and with a scent so faint if he wasnt this close he could never have smelled it tell me about lucy she said with sudden asperity and he wondered if she realised what he was thinking if she had then a man was wise to stop thinking it right now tell her about lucy shes my daughter i know that much she sounded amused shes beautiful shes dark and tall and slim maybe a bit too thin according to the one photograph hed seen what would he know how often do you see her never i didnt know she existed until three months ago wow she didnt sound judgmental she just sounded interested it was the right reaction he thought she made it sound like not knowing you had a daughter was almost normal that came from years of medical training he thought nothing shocks wows right harry says shes coming tomorrow so it seems he said harshly lets talk of something else something else she was silent for a while absorbing an absent daughter he wondered if she was drifting into sleep but apparently not so what about your parents she asked what about them where are they my mothers in perth last time i heard my father was in new zealand but that was twenty years back not a close family huh you could say that family wasnt something he chose to talk about but if it stopped the trembling this was therapy he decided and tugged her tighter and thought yep medical necessity youre so warm she murmured and she was relaxing a little warming a little tension easing so tell me about your family he said deciding to turn the tables what do you want to know why your mother didnt get on that plane and come she knew how close youd come to death just as long as it didnt hit the papers thats all shed care about not close either too close they should have had more children only one its all your eggs in one basket and a girl cant live up to it do they like you being a nurse they hate me being a nurse the tension was back again i wanted to do medicine so badly but there was no way theyd support me i was to go into the family business that was my grandfathers decree its my grandfather who pulls the strings ive had to work my way through nursing he fought me every step of the way but youre doing something you love im not sure she whispered or i am but im not doing enough when i was trying to stop myself drowning there was a part of me thinking if i get out of here i want to make a difference not just be i cant imagine you just being he said and she sighed and yawned and snuggled itd be so easy to sink into my parents world like my hotel room i have three different types of bath foam really really she snuggled again his body was reacting of course his body was reacting hed have to be inhuman for it not to react he was wearing heavyduty pants with a heavyduty zipper he was becoming exceedingly grateful that he didnt routinely pack pyjamas im so warm she murmured i shouldnt let you do this my pleasure im sure its not her voice was starting to slur im sure its just that youre a very nice man and a fine doctor you saved my life and youve rescued me from my nightmare now youre making me feel wonderful im so sorry you didnt know about your daughter im seeing her tomorrow shes the guest i told coral about thats great she sighed again a long sleepy languorous sigh that made the night feel impossibly sensual thats wonderful tomorrow youll turn into a father youre a lifesaver a doctor a father a guy with pecs to die for and youre holding me like three types of bath foam what more could a girl desire she was making no sense at all go to sleep i will she smiledhe heard her smile i am but i first i need to say thank you its okay no but tomorrow youll be a father she said and a doctor again and a lifesaver and i need to say thank you now pippa you saved my life she was no longer even trying to make sense he thought she was simply saying what came into her head you saved me from roger i could have married him that was hardly me you were part of it if you hadnt been there for me apart from being dead if it hadnt been you i might even have been weak enough to let him come he might have bullied me into believing in him again marriage for the sake of family ugh she shuddered and clung not now though youve shown me how ordinary it all was just ordinary her voice was a husky whisper part of the dreaming filled with pleasure and warmth and something more today not only am i alive not only do i not have to marry roger theres a whole world youre showing me youre showing me how it is to be alive new wanting pippa was she still dreaming she wasnt he knew she wasnt but still she was in some dreamlike state where normal boundaries didnt apply saying exactly what she thought feeling what she wanted to feel loving the way she was feeling and letting him know that too her body was heating against his and he knew he knew that he should leave now put her away from him let reality take over again but she was holding him needing him wanting him and how strong would he have to be to put her away she was a mature woman she was melting against him sensual languorous seductive seductive thank you she murmured again and before he could realise what she intended she twisted in his arms she wound her arms around his neck then pushed herself up just a little so she was gazing down at him in the moonlight and before he could even think how to stop her or even if he wanted to stop hershe kissed him she surely kissed him for this was no kiss of thanks a polite brushing of lips fleeting contact and then pulling away this was a kiss of a woman wanting a man more it was the kiss of a woman claiming her man her lips met his and the contact burned maybe his whole body had been heating before this point and now it was like the heat suddenly exploded into flame and the point of flame was his mouth her lips the melding of the two together this woman in his arms riley had she said his name she couldnt have but the sound was between them a long drawnout sigh a sigh of longing of aching need of want of need between two people this was crazy unwise cruel even to kiss her under such circumstances he wasnt kissing hershe was kissing him but maybe the delineation was blurring maybe they were simply kissing a man and a woman and a need as primeval as time itself pippa his defences were disappearing crumpling at the touch of her loveliness in the aching need of her sigh in the heat of their bodies he was kissing in return demanding as well as giving his mouth plundering searching her sweetness glorying in her need as well as his own pippa she was like no woman hed ever touched his body was reacting without control she was stripping him bare exposing parts of him he never knew he had parts hidden behind barriers hed built up with years of careful selfrestraint where was the selfrestraint now certainly not with pippa she needed this he knew it at some basic gut level she was a mature woman a woman who knew her way in the world a woman who fought for what she wanted or didnt want right now she didnt want control eight hours in the water had shown her as his job showed him almost every day that control was an illusion pippa had cheated death her nightmares had brought it back but she was fighting past them tonight was all about life about affirmation of now she was taking what she needed to survive this woman there were so many undercurrents so many things he should make himself consider but all he could think was how she felt in his arms her kiss her mouth her hands holding him close demanding he hold her close as well growing closer closer her kiss was almost savage in its intensityfire meeting fire sense was disappearinghad disappeared there was only this woman there was only now her fingers were unfastening the buttons of his shirt he felt the tug registered it for what it was somehow made himself react there was nothing between them but these clothes if they disappeared he hauled back and it hurt but he made himself put her away holding her up from him meeting her gaze in the moonlight pippa if we go further do you want to go further her voice was steady as it hadnt been steady until now the tremors had ceased she met his gaze squarely surely with honesty and with trust trust the sensation made something inside him wrench open barriers where were they not here not now more than life itself he said and knew it was true but its not wise im not feeling wise and before he could realise what she intended she tugged her shirt off and tossed it aside her hands reached behind her back for her bra clip riley im a mature woman ive spent the night deep in horror yes im using you i know i am can you accept that want it even i want it so much he caught her hands and held stopping the bra disappearing no no the tremor was suddenly back pippa this is unprotected sex were talking im supposed to be on my honeymoon im protected you know as well as i do that that theres more risks than pregnancy her eyes didnt leave his there is that im safe rogers a careful man double blind crossover tests safe from everything except bridesmaids how about you you shouldnt believe neither should you but i will believe can i be safe with you riley chase you can be safe he said huskily for the feel of her body over his was making his whole body seem to transmute into something he barely recognised but pippa is this purely to make you forget forget roger near drowning hopelessness no she said surely and strongly its to make me remember and before you ask she whispered lowering herself again so her mouth was close to his yes its seduction yes im using you i need you to affirm life she faltered then suddenly unsure but he knew it wasnt her actions she was questioning it was her reasons this night you it seems as natural as breathing ive signed no contract yet at whale cove tomorrow i can walk away i well may because what happens tonight could make working together impossible but its not interfering with me wanting you now and you do you want me how could she ask there was something changing within him something he hadnt been aware could be changed the tenderness the aching need he had for her pippa was she a fool she probably was but she didnt care she was in the middle of the australian desert with a man she didnt know or maybe she did know him hed saved her life but this went deeper something about riley chase resonated with her as no man ever had before someday shed ask him about his childhood she thought if she stayed around that long if there was a shared tomorrow it didnt matter if there wasnt or maybe it did matter but for now she couldnt allow herself to care for if she cared shed allow in caution rational thought sense she didnt want those things she only wanted riley shed told him it was to drive away nightmares it was but there was more more she could hardly admit more she didnt understand she was still resting lightly over him she let her fingers run the length of his face feeling the roughness of the stubble on his jaw tracing the faint indentation of a scar at the side of his mouth feeling the strength of his features she knew this man it was a strange sensation but she believed it she didnt need to know how hed got that scar where the life lines had been formed something within this man was stirring a response within her that she couldnt understand but could only believe two halves of a whole that was fantasy but there was something some basic link if he told her now hed had a happy childhood a safe secure existence shed never believe him he was a man who walked alone as she had all her life as she would again tomorrow maybe but not tonight for tonight she was holding riley and he was driving away every other thought taking away terror giving her life she was exploring his face with her fingers loving what she was learning she met his gaze devouring the look of him there was need in his eyes there was strength and truth and passion another man might have taken what she offered without questions he was still and silent making sure he could be sure riley she whispered pippa he smiled at her and here was a wonder for the smile said he was loving her she knew it was just for now but now was enough with his smile the terrors of the last few days disappeared as did the betrayal that was roger the accusations of her parents the pressures from home even the awfulness of the sea in the face of rileys smile it was nothing for now for this wondrous moment the horrors of the past made way for riley and then control was no longer hers impulse was no longer hers for riley took her face in his hands he tugged her down to him and he kissed her he kissed her as she ached to be kissed a possessive loving searching kiss that said for tonight she was his woman and everything else must fade to nothing this kiss was his seal of commitment he deepened the kiss and deepened it still more and the sensation made her want to cry out with wonder he put her away from him once more and she almost cried a protest but he was only moving her a little so once more he could read her eyes this is lovemaking he said softly pippa what youre offering its a gift without price i wont take it lightly i wouldnt expect you to she said struggling to make her voice light in response but i know its only for tonight you wont wake up to find yourself with a woman hanging on your sleeve wanting commitment ive been engaged to roger on and off for more than ten years thats more than enough commitment ive told my mother where she could put my wedding dress and it wasnt anywhere polite she smiled finding shared laughter somehow shed kept her voice steady somehow shed made herself sound like she was telling the truth she didnt want commitment she was under control there was an illusion the truth was that even though she was now independent since last sunday night her life had spun totally out of control and riley chase was making it a thousand times worse oh it was no fault of rileys she didnt even mind in truth for the first time in her life she was out of control and she was loving it so are you intending to kiss me again she teased because im getting a bit uncomfortable im not sure if youve noticed but im lying on your chest and its not quite as comfortable as that nice soft mattress youre lying on then lets fix that he growled and swung her over so they lay side by side and she was being kissed as shed never been kissed in her life riley was kissing her tasting her exploring her riley was loving her and all that must be said had been said hesitations were gone she closed her eyes savouring the feel of him the taste the touch his hands were working their magic on her skin knowing every inch of her and every tiny movement sent shivers of sensual pleasure through her entire body she arched back and he found the clips of her bra it finally fell away and she loved that it did his fingers cupped the soft swell of her breasts tracing her nipples making her sigh with sheer unmitigated pleasure she wanted closer she had his buttons undone nowhow had she done that she hardly knew but his shirt was gone and she loved that it was gone the feel of her skin against his the strength of his body the sheer maleness of him it was taking her breath away the moonlight washed through the window and the sight of his body was making her dizzy his body heat the touch of his mouth the feel of his hands she was starting to burn his breathing was becoming ragged and she gloried in it gloried that he was feeling as she was this was mutual need mutual pleasure this was right she thought in some far recess of her mind this man had given her her life and this it felt like giving life in return her hair was tumbled on his face he tucked her curls behind her ears and then tugged her tight so he could reclaim her mouth oh his mouth it wasnt enough he was kissing her everywhere a rain of kisses her neck her shoulders her breasts and the feeling was so breathtaking she could hardly take in air was that what was making her lightheaded she felt like she was floating and he with her she was moving to another place moving to another life her breasts were moulding to his chest as his hands tugged at her hips her clothing had disappeared entirely excellent but fair was fair she found the zipper of his jeans and tugged and then her fingers returned to where the zip had been the night was swirling her mind was swirling somehow she was shedding a skin being hauled from her old life into this the new oh the feel of him the joy he was discovering every secret of her body she felt herself arch with sheer animal pleasure abandoning herself to him entirely he could do anything he wanted with her and she could do the same to him for this night anything was possible the nightmares had faded to nothing the terror that had lingered was gone dissolved in rileys heat rileys body rileys need her need skin against skin she couldnt get close enough she was on fire riley she heard herself moan but it wasnt her voice it was a stranger a woman riley was loving she heard the aching need and wondered at it riley my beautiful girl and he was up and over her his dark eyes gleaming in the moonlight are you indeed sure was she sure for answer she reached and held his hips she centred him she tugged he was hers the night was dissolving around her riley pippa his voice was a husky whisper in her ear he was taking her slowly with languorous pleasure forcing her to wait forcing himself to wait riley this was where she was meant to be this was her heart her home her centre this man he was a part of her merged with her one their bodies were riding each other but there was no physical effort her mind was as clear as the stars outside she came and came again but she didnt lose sight of riley for one moment how could she close her eyes she marvelled at his body as he moved within her his raw strength his muscles delineated beautiful riley for tonight her man he was deep within her and her body was taking her rhythm from his he could take her anywhere he wished he could love her for ever this moment and the next for it went on and on building building and she felt herself weeping with joy she wept and she held his beautiful body and finally wondrously she felt him surge within herand she knew nothing could ever be the same again when finally he lay back spent when she lay on his chest and felt his heartbeat merged with hers when she felt his fingers run through her hair with tenderness and wonder and love she knew the nightmares wouldnt return she knew hed brought her out from the far side she just wasnt exactly sure hed come out with her she slept cradled in his arms warm secure safe pippa what had he done hed slept with her hed made love with her hed never meant to shed been his patient she was his colleague shed woken in midnightmare hed come to comfort her and hed taken her or shed taken him it was her need as well as his what had happened had been the culmination of a need so basic it was almost past comprehension past his ability to judge on right and wrong because right now lying in the dark with pippas naked body curled against him it felt right how could there be anything wrong with something that had felt so inevitable it didnt feel like he was holding pippa it felt like he was holding a part of himself if something was to wrench her away right now itd hurt like tearing a part of himself away he turned his head a little and his face was in her hair he was smelling the faint clean scent of her she murmured a little in her sleep her hand shifted sought held his fingers were entwined in hers pippa he was lying in the dark holding his woman in his arms he closed his eyes and a peace hed never felt before settled over him right or wrong for now for this moment dr riley chase had come home chapter six she woke and he was gone she lay in the filtered dawn light and forced herself to absorb the fact without panic she was trying to figure where she was what had happened what was real and what was dream she was naked the bed smelled of lovemaking there was a strong indentation in the pillow crushed beside hers she rolled over and buried her face in the linen thinking she could smell him shed made love to riley chase shed taken him she closed her eyes letting the sensations of the night before unfold reveal themselves sort themselves into some sort of order shed had a nightmare riley had come in to comfort her shed pulled him to her and shed made love talk about needy she should be mortified to her socks only she wasnt wearing socks she was wearing nothing at all it felt excellent her body felt new like shed done one of those crazy rebirth things shed heard about she smiled a little at that thinking rebirth yes she could have lain in a foetal position and pretended to be pushed with a birth coach telling her exactly what to do or she could have taken riley to her she could have allowed him to take her she could have woken feeling this excellent though maybe a bit sore theyd woken during the night and made love again and again she stirred and stretched and smiled the tangerine of the desert sunrise was calling life was calling she flung off her bedclothes headed for the shower and went to find riley gerry had passed an excellent night his leg was looking good and he wanted to leave but the exceedingly large brace fastened from thigh to ankle was stopping him riley wasnt about to remove it any time soon gerrys wound was large and penetrating there was access for infection everywhere and he needed to stay right where he was the nerves were millimetres away from being severed he told him and youre not out of the woods yet no need to mention the two dangers were unrelated i havent saved your leg only to have you come back with gangrene or worse youre staying in this bed for a week and well hear no more about it he left the room grinning and made his way to amys room his grin faded amy was cradling baby riley and she was crying she wont feed she said my boobs hurt theyre that full but she wont feed i fed her at midnight and she hardly drank anything and now she just wants to sleep hi pippa was suddenly in the room with them she was a colleague riley told himself trying hard to greet her as a colleague but how could she look so neat the last time hed seen her lets not go there problem pippa asked heading for the bed professional even if he wasnt amy was cradling her baby against her breast hey baby riley whos a sweetheart she looked at amys swollen breasts glanced at amys face and riley thought she had an instant appreciation of the situation whos a sleepyhead she asked she stroked the babys cheek the one closest to amys breast and kept on stroking the baby turned instinctively in the direction of the stroking pippas fingers moved slightly steering the babys rosebud mouth the little lips caught the taste of milk caught amys nipple and started sucking though not with gusto keep stroking her cheek pippa told her no going to sleep baby riley you have growing to do she wouldnt for me amy said choking back tears i suspect shes a bit jaundiced riley said watching her suck not badly but its enough to make her sleepy whats jaundice pippa crossed to the basin and moistened a facecloth she washed amys face as riley checked out his namesake the baby was feeding but not with any energy he checked her palms then the soles of her tiny feet yesterday theyd been pink today there were faint traces of yellow mild jaundice early days watch and see he thought there wasnt any need for intervention yet but watch and see here whats wrong amy asked breathless with fear and riley uncurled the babys fist and showed her see her palm the faint yellow tinge is the first sign of jaundice its common in babies as our bodys red blood cells outlive their purpose our liver gets rid of them if they cant then we get a buildup of these old cellsthe buildups called bilirubin because baby rileys liver is so small its not doing its job properly it might take a week or so to adjust but shell be okay shell definitely be okay sunlight helps well pop her by the window with just a nappy onthats often enough to fix it the way youre feeding her now is great itll take a little more encouraging on your part and we need to make sure shes not getting dehydrated if she gets any sleepier than she is well pop her under lights like a sunlamp sister joyce will thats a problem riley said evenly as pippa rinsed the facecloth and bathed her face again amy jaundice usually shows up before this if id thought baby riley might develop it id have asked you to stay on in whale cove he met amys gaze square on im sorry amy but you need to come back with us to to the hospital that would be best but i dont want to it was a wail then we can organise for you to stay in a hotel near the hospital amy if you were living in whale cove id be saying keep doing what youre doing give her a little sunbathe each day call me if you need me but im a long way away to call amys bottom lip trembled she really was very young riley thought a child herself jasons out mustering she whispered hes due back tomorrow can i wait until then im sorry we need to leave this morning i dont want to go back to hospital i hate hospital she was crying again fat tears slipping down her face she was afraid and alone riley thought and he sent silent invective toward her mother she hadnt even been in to see her daughter could one of your sisters come with you pippa asked diffidently and he knew pippa was thinking exactly what he was mum wont let em could i talk to your mum she would he looked at pippa in her jeans and her flightaid shirt her hair bunched back into a loose braid her face devoid of makeup and he thought she was just as alone as amy but she had courage in spades last night shed known what she needed and shed taken it shed taken him shed throw something at you amy was saying and pippa blinked really yeah or set the dogs on you uhoh pippa said and riley smiled at her expression a dogsetting missilethrowing mother pippa had the sense to back away okay that was option one she conceded option two is that you come back to whale cove and stay in the house beside the hospital where im staying where doc riley stays they tell me its okay to invite guests so im inviting you do you want to come and stay with me and riley she was what the riley practically gaped close your mouth doctor pippa said kindly after all its not like amys a patient any more this babys called riley pippa and that makes her our family so will you come and stay with us but jason amy seemed bemused shed stopped crying well leave him a note pippa said grandly if he can get to the coast then he can stay too he probably wont want to thats up to him will you come and stay with us yes amy said looking down at her drowsy baby knowing she had no choice yes i will are you out of your mind riley barely got the door shut behind them before he exploded what sort of crazy idea is this what pippa asked turning to face him she looked innocent and puzzled as if she had no idea what he was talking about inviting amy to live with me with us she said kindly and not live stay you dont live in that house i do coral says i do she says im to make it my home so i am youre not due to move there until sunday ill need to move in straight away she said thoughtfully thats a pity roger might even get a refund on his honeymoon suite shes a patient shes your patient i met her in hospital when i was in the next bed shes my friend youre a nurse nurses have friends its not ethical why isnt it ethical you dont get involved you dont need to coral says you have a big bedroom and you barely use the rest of the house i know your daughters coming but coral says we have four bedrooms so how does having amy staying get you involved youll need to be involved i want to be involved pippa mmm she tilted her chin and met his gaze full on her eyes were direct and luminous he needed to keep building his anger he thought he needed to hold to his knowledge that shed just overstepped professional boundaries because suddenly all he could think of was how shed felt last night how hed held her how shed slept tucked into the curve of his body his boundaries were slipping he felt them shift and he didnt know what to do about it revert to anger shell have to go to hospital ive invited her to stay with us shes stopped crying you want me to go and tell her youve changed your mind i havent changed my mind he said explosively its you maybe you could stay in the honeymoon suite she said thoughtfully though im not sure how id explain that to roger and then theres lucy of all the you dont want a honeymoon no neither do i want people staying in my house coral said its the hospitals house and you already have lucy she sighed suddenly repentant im sorry i know i should have talked to you before i offered but i couldnt bear it shes so alone i know what its like to be alone riley and i suspect you do too but ive never been as alone as amy is right now i can fix that ill take care of her youll be working i will be she said her tone suddenly severe as his objections grew weaker you think amy wants me there twentyfour seven shell take what i can give but thats a whole lot more than she has now so are we heading back to whale cove or not pippa yes her eyes were now expressionless she was waiting for more anger he thought she was expecting more anger he didnt have it in him not when he looked at her last night he said was wonderful she said quickly before he could go any further but you neednt worry yes i used you to escape from my nightmares and yes it was fabulous but im not about to step over the boundaries there either thats not what i was about to say then what were you about to say that i thought it was wonderful too he said and her face lit in response softening her eyes lighting with laughter she hadnt expected him to say it she loved it that he had he thought and that felt excellent snap she said and she stood on tiptoe and kissed him on the lips but lightly fleetingly it was indeed wonderful she said but it doesnt mean im pushing past your boundaries i needed you last night and you were there ill always be grateful and now i intend to be there for amy see were both soft touches in our own way i didnt last night was more i know it was she said firmly and surely like i said it was fabulous ill remember it for ever but we both know it was for one night only we both know we need to love that it happened and now we need to move on they couldnt move on not for a couple of hours joyce was waiting for them and cornered them before they reached the veranda ear infection she said coming in within half an hour ill make you breakfast and while youre waiting im concerned about john thaldersons feet hes cracked his heel she explained to pippa hes diabeticlousy circulation im dressing it every day but he came in ten minutes ago have a look riley while i cook you breakfast they both looked john thaldersons feet were truly appalling he should be headed for sydney pippa thought or whale cove at the very least but once again neither he nor riley seemed to think it was an option riley injected local so he could do a thorough debridement cleaning up the messy edges he dressed the wound with care while pippa assisted youll stay on the veranda for the week riley told him no argument look after gerry for me sure thing doc john said and limped out leaning heavily on his stick why not whale cove pippa asked hes not about to go into cardiac arrest and surely he needs intensive longterm treatment i told you riley growled i cant risk it hell lie in a clean white hospital bed he wont eat the food hell turn his face to the wall and hell get worse not better yes here his feet may well not heal he may even face amputation but even if he does well take him down to whale cove well get it done as fast as we can and well get him back on this veranda hell certainly die faster than he would if he had optimum treatment but thats his choice so what joyce is doing shes saving lives riley said by running this place and by turning her back on government regulations shes keeping these guys alive and im doing all in my power to help her and now shes even cooking bacon and eggs for us so were not keeping her waiting breakfast was massive pippa ate and thought ate and watched then watched and listened while hunger grew for something that had nothing to do with food harry and riley and joyce chatted like the old friends they obviously were they were doing such good she thought the three of them she wanted to be a part of it fiercely more fiercely every moment had she messed with that by sleeping with riley maybe she had he was terse with her this morning like he wasnt quite sure how to react that was fair she wasnt sure how to react to him either and shed foisted amy onto him he was laughing at a story joyce was telling him the dour nurse thought the world of him she could see it in the way joyce smiled at him the way she ladled more and more bacon onto his plate a team she wanted to be a part of it so much it hurt she set down her knife and fork and pushed her plate away joyce looked at her in concern had enough im feeling disoriented she confessed like its taking some time for my head to catch up with my body youre doing too much riley said well get you back to whale cove and you and amy can lie on the veranda and let your heads catch up all they want he glanced at his watch we should all be moving one ear infection and then home sydney harry said he demolished the last of his bacon and stood up in case youd forgotten your daughters due to arrive at lunchtime and the planes due for a service yesterdays plan was to return to whale beach then take the plane to sydney this morning weve run out of time todays plan is therefore straight to sydney well have amy and the baby pippa said blankly rileyll have to hire a car to take you all home harry said cheerfully im having a weekend off staying in sydney until the planes done home monday hell riley said yeah i thought youd forgotten the time harry said and grinned now what can you have been thinking of to make you forget you have a daughter arriving riley said nothing that was pretty much the last riley spoke for the morning he retreated into some place no one was allowed to enter pippa and joyce helped amy and her sleepy baby back onto the plane once again pippa sat in the back with amy amy was subdued pippa tried to keep up happy chat but she didnt succeed even with the headsets turned off she knew that riley was deep in silence too there were so many emotions swirling around she couldnt make sense of any of them inviting amy to stay had problems it meant shed have to stay in rileys housein the hospital house she corrected herselfas well and she was starting to think her wisest path was for her to retreat to her honeymoon hotel and close the door or retreat back to england that wasnt going to happen not for shed fallen head over heels in love with this job with what riley was doing with what joyce was doing she wanted to help with a hunger that was deeper than anything shed ever known as a child on television in some longforgotten luxury hotel watched over by some anonymous hotel sitter shed seen a documentary a doctor in south america treating childrens eyes shed watched in fascination as bandages were removed and sight was restored and something had resonated with her at a level she hardly understood she wanted to work like that and the desire had never left her nursing in england had been great she loved her work and there was always need but the last twentyfour hours was causing the emotions shed felt after the documentary to come crowding back she had to be allowed to be a part of it she might have messed with that she conceded by allowing last night to happen and by pushing amy onto riley riley was stuck with her and with amy and her baby as he went to meet his daughter for the first time this for a man who walked alone it was a wonder his head wasnt exploding what had she been thinking making love to him last night she knew what shed been thinking shed watched joyce smile at him this morning and shed thought yes thats how he should be smiled at like he was loved and her heart twisted love wouldnt it be stupid if it caught her now engagedon and offfor years almost married what was she thinking her engagement had been broken off a little more than a week ago and here she was thinking of the possibility of falling for another man not just another man riley whats wrong amy asked and the girl put her hand out and caught pippas you look like its the end of the world she caught herself and managed a smile the boundaries of friendship and professionalism were certainly blurring she was a flightaid nurse and she was supposed to be caring for amy nothing just dumb thoughts you didnt really want to drown yourself last week i no i didnt think you did but youre missing your boyfriend no she said no im not youre missing someone amy said wisely i can tell chapter seven flightaid had arrangements in place in sydney so transferring patients with any delays that involved could be achieved in privacy and comfort collecting patients whod needed complex medical care and taking them homeback to whale cove but more usually back to their outback homeswas part of flightaids charter when they reached sydney therefore riley was able to take amy and babyand pippainto a reserved medical lounge and leave them there harry was busy with the plane pippa was happy to take care of amy riley was about to meet his daughter and he was feeling like his head didnt belong to his body pippa lucy a week ago he didnt have a complication in the world he wanted quite badly to turn back the clock to head back to whale cove grab his surfboard and ride some waves hed gone to bed last night planning a dawn start theyd get back to whale cove drop pippa off and keep going to sydney hed figure what to say on the way down how to meet your daughter for the first time but hed figure it hed collect lucy put her in a hire car and drive her back to whale cove hed be calm collected a guy in charge of his world a man worthy of being a father hed woken this morning diagnosed jaundice knew the early getaway wasnt possible then pippa was suddenly filling his house with people acting as if what shed offered was reasonable pippa she was messing with his head more than it was already messed pippa he didnt do relationships hed learned it as a kid maybe even earlier keep yourself to yourself and you dont get hurt for one crazy summer hed forgotten and the knife had twisted so hard hed thought hed go crazy relationships were for other people they caused pain theyd caused a daughter his eighteenyearold daughter was about to walk through the arrivals gate three months back when first contact had been made hed written saying he wanted to meet her if there was any way she wanted him in her life if there was anything she ever needed she just had to ask no reply that email seemed to have gone through but his next had bouncedthe email address had seemingly been cancelled hed gone to england to find her only to be told shed gone away she didnt want anything to do with him he was her father in name only relationships caused pain he couldnt avoid this one she was a tourist he told himself curious about a father shed never met checking out australia and her unknown biological father as an aside the huge metal gates were opening and closing as each passenger cleared customs reunions were happening everywhere families were clinging sobbing laughing there was a couple beside him they were in their seventies and their anticipation was palpable the doors opened and a family emerged mum and dad and three littlies the elderly lady gasped and clutched her husbands hand the little family reached them and was immersed in joy he did not do this when lucy emerged shed be a kid on an adventure nothing more he told himself as hed told himself over and over though why her grandparents werent funding her to luxury like pippa was funded to luxury pippa it was the sight of the elderly couple holding hands it made him think he wanted he didnt want hed spent his life ensuring he didnt want the doors slid open lucy he recognised her of course he did how many times had he looked at the photograph shed sent him in her first email she was thin tall and pretty but not like her mother she looked like him she stood behind her luggage trolleysearchingand he saw his eyes his dark hair and fear there was a boy beside her seemingly arguing that he should push the trolley he was long and lanky a kid of about twenty worried he had dark hair curling wildly and olive skin then he pushed the trolley sideways and lucy stepped out from behind she was pregnant very pregnant she saw him his picture was on flightaids websitethats how shed originally contacted him he was in his flightaid uniform now so there was no need for red carnations in buttonholes but there was no wide smile and ecstatic wave like hed seen from most of the reuniting families there was a tiny fleeting smile of recognition a smile backed with fear he thought suddenly of amy same age same terror the thought settled his nerves put things in perspective this wasnt about him the boy took over trolley duty lucy walked out from the barricade then stopped a few feet from him ddad lucy despite his wish to stay calm neutral all the worry in the world was in the way he said her name all the things he felt about this frail slip of a kid and she must have heard it because suddenly she sobbed and stepped forward somehow he had her in his arms she was sobbing on his chest sobbing her heart out while the kid beside her looked on with worry lucy his daughter he held her close waiting for the sobs to subside wondering what a man was to do then he glanced over her headand suddenly pippa was there in the background she caught his gaze and smiled fleetingly problem no she gave a silent shake of her head waved slightly backed away and it settled him for some reason it made him feel that he wasnt alone with a pregnant daughter and who knew what other issues pippa would help he didnt need help he might he conceded his daughter was pregnant lucy was drawing back now sniffing and the boy beside her was handing her tissues he looked like he was accustomed to doing it thered been lots of crying its great to meet you he said softly looking down into the face of this halfrecognised daughter a part of him you dont know how much really really but im im pregnant lucy said half scared half defiant i noticed that he managed a smile how pregnant eight and a half months what the he gazed at his daughter in stupefaction she didnt look so far gone he thought but then some women didnt show as much as others you cant fly at eight and a half months mum paid a doctor to say im only seven and a half months i have a medical certificate your mother bribed she wants to get rid of me lucy whispered because of adam this this is adam she clutched the hand of the boy beside her hhi the boy said good to meet you riley said and held out his hand the kid was eurasian he thought and with that he had it figured he thought of the way lucys grandparents had reacted to him an illegitimate scholarship kid from australia white trash marguerites father had called him that to his face and now for lucy to bring adam home as the father of her baby im starting to see he said they tried to break us up lucy whispered they even bribed someone at adams university to kick him out they accused him of cheating they rang immigration said he was illegal we cant fight them over there mum says if i keep the baby she washes her hands of me grandpa says hes raised one kid he didnt want and hes not helping with another so we thought maybe we could start again here we were hoping i was hoping that youll help us you said in your email he glanced behind his daughter again and discovered he was searching for pippa in the crowd shed gone he was alone with his unknown daughter and her boyfriend and their baby their baby his grandchild of course i will he said manfully and he took his daughters trolley and summoned the most reassuring smile he was capable of which didnt feel to him like it was all that reassuring we need to find a caror maybe a small busand head back to whale cove thats where i live but first theres someone id like you to meet i have a feeling youre going to like her he paused and thought about it i have a feeling were all going to need her pippa had headed out to the airport pharmacy to replenish her nappy supply she needed to get her head around supplying an air ambulance this was an oversight unworthy of a trained midwife but two days worth of nappies had slipped from her radar maybe shed been thinking of other things like riley so shed slipped out to buy nappies shed passed the arrivals hall and shed seen riley meet his daughter his pregnant daughter he looked like he was drowning riley was a man who walked aloneshe knew that you couldnt be near the man without sensing his reserve and now hed been thrown in at the deep end hed be a grandfather she almost chuckled but she didnt she bought what she needed then hesitated before returning to amy taking a moment to try and get her thoughts in order riley last night shed needed him shed clung and hed held hed made love to her and shed lost herself in his body hed lifted her out of her nightmare and in doing so hed settled her world shed woken this morning feeling that all was right with her world that she was on a path for life with riley no that was dumb one night of lovemaking could never make a permanent relationship but hed made her feel wonderful alive young free all the things he no longer was his face just then he had a pregnant daughter and her heart twisted for him shed seen him holding a daughter hed never met before a teenager bearing his grandchild he wouldnt walk away she knew that about him truly and surely he was a man of honour riley chase and with that another twist he was so different from roger so different from any man shed ever met she felt she felt she wasnt allowed to feel riley had so many complications the last thing he needed was her throwing her heart into the ring she couldnt she didnt nappies she headed back to amy her arms full of nappies her head full of resolutions keep cool and professional never be needy again support him from the sidelines so why was the look on his face as hed held his daughter etched onto her heart why did her heart still twist he hired a family wagon a sevenseater three rows of seats the luggage filled the trunk to overflowing lucy and adam didnt travel light neither did amybabies needed stuff amy was in the back seat with baby riley strapped in beside her adam and lucy were in the middle seat holding each other like they were glued pippa was in the front passenger seat next to riley mum and dad in the front seat kids in the back riley was looking cornered she thought back to the evening before to this same man calmly attempting surgery that was complex and risky hed worked through challenges singlemindedly there was no one shed rather have around her in a crisis than riley chase and that wasnt just because hed hauled her out of the water it wasnt just that hed saved her life shed slept with him last night it had shifted their relationship to a different level it could never return again forget last night she told herself that harshly but she knew she never could somehow she had to move past it though to immediate need from living on his own riley was now faced with living with her with amy and her baby and with his daughter and boyfriend she thought of his lovely quiet existence and tried to think how shed feel landed with what hed been landed with hey she actually had been landed with it she too was a loner an only child a kid whod learned to like her own company a woman whod been independent whose engagement to roger had probably lasted as long as it had because she was so independent she too would be in rileys house she was part of rileys problembut he was part of hers hed have a bedroom close by hers that might be a problem all by itself she needed to put a lid on her hormones so what to do she was stuck in rileys house shed promised amy shed be there riley was stuck as well amy needed him to be there riley needed space maybe she swivelled lucy and adam could scarcely be any closer they truly were scared kids they had a whole lot facing them she thought a baby within weeks a new country a future to work out a relationship to forge with riley they all needed space is the house set up for lucy and adam she asked loud enough to talk to the car in general sorry riley seemed a hundred miles away the house she said patiently the housekeepers expecting me on sunday shes expecting lucy today but as far as i can figure shes expecting a lone lucy and shes not expecting amy so apart from your room do we have three more bedroomswith a single bed apiece yes riley said cautiously not sure where she was going but we can move in a stretcher bed for adam a stretcher she said disparagingly lucy adam you guys look really tired we didnt sleep on the plane lucy admitted so all you want to do is sleep right yes then i have a suggestion pippa told her for reasons too complicated to go into right now we also have one luxurious honeymoon suite in a swish hotel ten minutes walk away from our house the suites paid for until sunday would it make sense if you lucy and adam had the honeymoon suite until we can set the house up with more beds silence shed interfered in something that was none of her business she thought but this could give riley space to come to terms with what was happening and it obviously had its attractions for the scared kids a honeymoon suite lucy breathed kingsized bed room service a bath so big you can swim in it compared to a single bed hey its a pink single bed riley said sounding affronted there was a moments stunned silenceand then everyone laughed it was a good moment the tension dissipated rileys hands unclenched on the steeringwheel and the thing was settled lucy and adam were to have the honeymoon suite riley only had amy and baby riley to contend with and pippa chapter eight they dropped lucy and adam at the hotel with promises to check on them later then took amy to the house they settled baby riley in her carry cocoon by the window showed her the view baby riley didnt seem impressed by the view but she seemed to soak up the late afternoon rays theyll help cure her riley said he turned on the heater so the baby could stay in a nappy only and he tucked the nappy right down so almost all her body was exposed mother natures cureno medicine needed its awesome amy said gazing around the house in wonder but amy was used to living in a corrugatediron leanto pippa was less impressed how long have you lived here she demanded as amy disappeared for a sleep six years not a picture on the wall theres a view there was a veranda ran all around the house but she didnt have to go outside to see the view the sea was practically in the house but still no blinds bare boards and this furniture its hospital stuff she said even the beds single castiron a couple of them are even rusty how can you live like this it does me he said stiffly and pippa shook her head in disbelief if im to live here we need rugs curtains pictures youre not living here she stilled i thought i was i dont think thats wise after last night i can hardly go back to the hotel she retorted ive promised amy amys only staying until the jaundice settles then you want me out im not saying that he said wearily raking his hair in a gesture she was starting to know pippa this whole situation lucy and adam you think theyll want to stay here no the word was an explosion no theyll want a place of their own they wont be able to organise that any time soon theyre your family riley i dont do family you dont have a choice she might as well say it she thought it was the simple truth your daughters eighteen and shes about to deliver your grandchild adam seems even more terrified than she is they need you riley they wanted to go to your hotel of course they did a nice impersonal hotel where they can cling to each other without the world intrudingor a single bed and a stretcher with a guy they hardly know thats what i mean they dont know me they dont know you but they need you theyre terrified kids what was lucys mother thinking to let them go shell have orchestrated the whole thing he said anger rising he dug his hands deep in his pockets and she saw his hands clench within the denim she and her parents lucy said she wanted her to get rid of it when that didnt happen faced with a granddaughter a child of eurasian descent shell have shipped her off to me of all the his face was etched with pain and she felt ill for all of them you must have been a baby yourself when lucy was born she whispered halfscared to probe nineteen he wasnt seeing her now she thought he was staring out at the sea at the past at nothing a raw kid i knew nothing enough to conceive a child she said and he gave a raw halflaugh yeah med student i couldnt even stop that it takes two to make a baby for a while she thought he wasnt going to answer but finally it does he said at last i had a well dysfunctional family doesnt begin to cut it home was never home as anyone else knew it my mother went from one lowlife boyfriend to another but she liked the sea and there was always a school library at every place we went to so study and surfing were constants finally i got lucky found some decent fosterparents got some help i got into medicine at sixteen child prodigy they said but obsessive study produces the same effect then a scholarship to london off i went delighted to be shot of the mess that family wasnt oh riley he didnt hear he was talking to the sea to something out there that had no connection to anything marguerite was beautiful loving warm and it blew me away that she wanted me it was only later that i figured it out i was straight from the surf i was big and bronzed and i was australian her friends thought i was cool and her parents thought i was appalling it was the combination she wanted i did know she was in full rebellion mode but i didnt figure it that i was simply part of that rebellion maybe she sabotaged the condoms i dont know all i knew was that at the end of summer she wanted nothing more to do with me shell have got pregnant for her own reasons she never told me he closed his eyes to have had a daughter for eighteen years and not know oh riley dumb he said i even thought i was in love he turned to face her then and his face was as bleak as death last night im on the pill and im not marguerite i dont do family he said i never have you dont or you havent it seems to me that familys found you your daughter shes my daughter in name only no in need its not lucys fault she said striving to keep her voice even how she was conceived you think i dont know that so you found out three months ago an email nothing more then you must have responded magnificently she said quietly but firmly for her to come you must have told her you care three months ago shell have been five six months pregnant and terrified shell have contacted you looking for options and youve responded with concern thats what she needs right now caring family im not family you are she said and she took his hands in hers and tugged until she had his full attention this was important she thought for her suddenly as well as for him her parents had been cold and distant rileys had hardly been parents at all for riley to be a dad seemed huge bigger than both of them it was so important she had to fight for it riley both our parents messed things up for us she said and she knew she was going where she had no right but she had no choice there was something about this big solitary man that touched a chord hed travelled a harder road than she had she thought and hed come out more scarred scars couldnt disappear completely but he could move beyond them he must riley she was holding his hands strong hands capable skilled loving hands that had made her feel dont go there he didnt want her last night was all she could have of him deep breath hed been there for her hed saved her life she was halfway to falling in love with him she thought stupid stupid stupid he didnt want her but he was alone the thought was suddenly unbearable and with that if all that was left for him was his daughter shed fight for lucy shed give him a family whether he wanted it or not lucy is your family she said you just have to let her see you care i dont have a choice youve landed me with everyone it was an explosion of vented frustration and anger it caught them both on the raw silence she could respond with anger with hurt this was too important for either riley lets get things in perspective she said somehow keeping her voice even youre not stuck with us not for ever last night was what i needed to let me move on its made things hard between us but not impossible i dont have a money problem i need to stay here until amy goes but thats the extent of it i would like to stay working in whale covewith you if thats possible as part of your team but that doesnt mean im part of your life ill get my own apartment amy will go back to dry gum i suspect lucy and adam will want their own place as well this is temporary and i havent stuck you with anything pippa i didnt mean he tugged away and raked his hair again last night no she said evenly you did mean but were mature adults we dont need to let one night mess with our working relationship and you dont need to see me as the bad guy in whats happened i dont of course i dont but you seriously think we can work together and this was the other nonnegotiable he had a daughter she wanted to work in whale cove i want to be a flightaid nurse she said flatly and definitely ill do whatever that takes riley chase including never again thinking about what happened last night agreed theres no choice of course theres a choice she said and she managed to smile you can walk out that door right now pick up your minimal baggage and your surfboard and walk away she glanced around the bare walls with distaste itll be just as it was before you arrivedyoull have left no trace but im staying in this town for now im here to take care of amy and if you go then ill look after lucy and adam too because she squared her shoulders and she made herself sound a lot stronger than she felt because do you know i want those ties she said i want pictures on my walls i want mess baggage a sense of belonging being a flightaid nurse its what ive been wanting for a long time and i wont let it go it feels like home its a job its home she said stubbornly so now i can see some flowers growing on the cliff face i have no idea what they are but im heading out to pick a bunch then i intend to try and make a chocolate cake im the worlds worst cook but it feels like the right thing to do i may only be in this house for a couple of weeks but from this moment on as long as im working for flightaid then im home he was called out that night and it was almost a relief he wasnt supposed to be on duty jake and sueellen and mardi were on call over the weekend but at four in the morning jake rang fisherman off the rocks at devils teeth he said wifes only just contacted the police he was due home at dusk what was she thinking waiting this long cops have found his gear washed up on the rockslooks like he was hit by a wave swept straight in sueellen says she cant hack it going down ropes getting bodies shes hit a wall shell do it if you cant but shes asking it was almost a relief hed been lying in bed staring at the ceiling trying not to think how close pippa was yes there was a bedroom between them but that was two thin walls away if he lay still he could imagine her breathing he wouldnt mind betting she was staring at the ceiling as well and when he dressed and headed out he found it was a variation of a theme she was on the veranda staring out at the ocean she heard his footsteps boots on bare boards he was in full uniform it was a bit hard to disguise where he was headed problem she turned and she was wearing a negligee so tiny it took his breath away or maybe it wasnt exactly tiny it reached her knees but it clung the moon was almost full and he could see her body silhouetted beneath the soft silk he had work to do dreadful work he couldnt afford to be distracted by a woman in a silk nightdress you want me to come she said no need he sounded brusque and tried to soften it im filling in for sueellen with the other crew he had a couple of moments to explain it took mardi five minutes to get from her home to the helicopter pad it took him two he told her and saw her flinch so go she said and he knew she was reliving her time in the water it wont count so much tonight he said grimly he went off the rocks at devils teeth not a calm beach like you did for him to survive in that water for more than half an hour would be almost impossible and its been at least eight theres not a lot to be done but pick up the pieces go back to bed oh riley go back to bed how could she go back to bed she made tea let it get cold and she didnt notice things were happening inside her that she hardly understood that she had no idea how to deal with riley had stood in the living room in his flightaid uniform shrugging on his souwester readying himself for what lay ahead he needed a shave he didnt look as if hed slept he looked big and bad and dangerous only he was on the side of good he was off to haul a body from the sea it was what he did hed seemed more alone than anyone shed ever met things were settling inside her things she didnt necessarily want she was falling in love was that just neediness speaking the neediness that had seen her reluctant to leave the hospital shed trained in because that was where her friends were and friends were the only family shed ever truly known the neediness that had finally had her agreeing to marry roger because he was her friend she could have children she could be part of something the something shed found here rileys team this hospital the outback clinic something that called her like riley called her like riley made her feel she was falling shed fallen when back in hospital when shed woken and seen him at the end of the bed smiling at her reassuring her that she was solidly grounded she was safe the nightmare was over when shed watched him tease the children at his outback clinic making injections a source of fun a test of bravery that all could face when shed watched him hug joyce goodbye his deep affection for the elderly nurse obvious to all of them when hed held her in his arms and blown the terrors away with the heat of his body when hed made love to her with tenderness passion wonder or when shed watched him with his daughter not knowing where to start but wanting so much needing so much he was on the outside looking in she thought for pippa whod been a loner herself it was an identity she knew too well and maybe that was what was making her heart twist but it wasnt just the one thing making her heart twist she thought it was all of him the complete package doctor lifesaver father lover riley she thought of his face as hed left tonight he knew what he was facing and she knew it hurt something deep within never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee where had that come from she thought about it remembering the whole quote donne no man is an island riley would like to think he was an island she decided he did think he was an island but if you cared as much as he did he couldnt stay solitaryit was hurting too muchand if he had to be connected could she find a link he didnt want a link last night shouldnt have happened she hugged herself in the chill of the night and gazed out to sea a while longer she should go back to bed riley was out there facing a nightmare shed wait here until he got home stupid or not shed wait for however long it took like a lovesick teenager or a woman who was starting to see exactly where her home was who could heal and heal herself in the process jake was already in the chopper and mardi arrived thirty seconds later ten minutes later they were hovering over devils teeth one look at the sea told them there was no hope for a happy outcome searchlights were already playing over the base of the cliff police were searching the rockscautiously as the sea was hugebut the outcome was inevitable two hours later just on dawn they found what they were looking for and it gave them no joy at all there was no use for rileys medical skills he retrieved the body then he and mardi worked to disguise the worst of the damage before they landed on the clifftop the family was waiting the family was always waiting riley thought grimly as he watched the tragedy play out ambulances police cars desolation all the accoutrements of heartbreak the chopper landed but there was no surge forward no one wanted to take the first step to be first to acknowledge death and in the end rileys medical skills were needed the mans motherinlaw an elderly greek lady collapsed with shock riley was about to board the squirrel but the paramedics called him back two minutes later she arrested they got her back but only just one ambulance left with the elderly woman inside the second ambulance drove off more slowly carrying its sad cargo finally the squirrel could leave mardi and jake sat up front riley sat in the back and gave in to grey family he thought one death and the ripple effects stretched outward hed just watched a wife become a widow hed watched a motherinlaw nearly lose her life hed watched children and family and friends all gutted hed watched paramedics and emergency service personnel take on this load of tragedy and carry it with them every one of them had a family every one of them was exposed to the same kind of grief theyd seen tonight the type of grief he saw over and over joyce had it right he thought joyce cared for the community as a whole she put her life into working for the people she cared about but shed never let herself be part of that other scary thing the thing that ripped everyone apart family he had a daughter a pregnant daughter in a while hed have a grandchild he was thirtyeight years old the concept of being a grandfather was ridiculous it didnt matter how old he was the concept of being a grandparent was still ridiculous terrifying and then there was pippa pippa of the warm body of the huge smile of the heart that gave and gave pippa whod given herself to himwas it only last night she was back at his house his home waiting for him no one ever waited for him no one ever wouldnot if he could help it his was a solitary world and he liked it like that but he had a daughter and pippa was not waiting his solitary world was starting to seem besieged chapter nine at dawn pippa helped amy feed a still sleepy baby riley amy and baby went back to sleep exhausted pippa abandoned her sentry duty and crawled into bed when she woke it was ten and baby riley was squawking for her next feed the jaundice might well recede without the need for phototherapy she thought but mostly she thought had riley come home she padded down the passage and just happened to glance into rileys bedroom on the way no riley were they still searching or was he needed at the hospital she flicked on the radio to the local news and listened to the account of last nights tragedy a drowning followed by a heart attack in an understaffed hospital that could be enough to keep him busy for hours or was he was staying out because of her was she making herself more important than she was keep busy she told herself dont think about him easier said than done she helped amy bathe riley junior encouraged her to feed again then settled them both to sleep in a patch of sunshine lucy and adam arrived theyd walked round from their hotel lucys legs were swollen to fly for almost twenty four hours at full term there were reasons for regulations she settled lucy on the settee raised her legs massaged her swollen feet working on getting circulation happening sent adam out for supplies made sandwiches riley still didnt return the place was like home without its hearth maybe that was a dumb thing to think but there it was he should be there i cant believe dad lives here lucy said relaxing a little this place is like a barn has he only just moved in hes lived her for six years pippa said but hes a guy i resent that adam retorted he was also relaxingmaybe because pippa was obviously caring for lucy and being twenty and the only one to care for a very pregnant girlfriend was truly scary your dad needs posters amy said hopping into her third sandwich pippa rang up this really cool poster shop when i was in labour and next thing we had posters everywhere the nurses said the poster shops huge but i dont have any money lucy said sadly mums cut me off without a penny adams broke too but itd be great to decorate this place and pippa couldnt help herself shed run out of things to do she couldnt just sit still and wait for riley id love some posters she said if you order them ill pay really lucy demanded astounded i kind of think this house is boring as well what about surfing posters thats your dads thing my dad surfs lucy demanded awesome had marguerite told lucy nothing about riley her heart wrenched for both of them and her resolution built family that meant shared interests surfing lets see what the shop has she said maybe we could intersperse surfing with skiingits the same sort of theme lucy said dad looks like the kind of guy whod ski he did pippa thought an outdoor adventurer living life on the edge alone he was the kind of guy whod hang out of a helicopter whod risk his life to save hers he was also the kind of guy whod make love to her to take her out of her terror and mean nothing by it shed told him it meant nothing something was happening inside her she hadnt meant to happen it no longer meant nothing he spent the morning deep in the paperwork a death by misadventure always entailed then inevitably he was at the hospital when a car crash came in and how could he not assist finally he was free he walked back to the house entering from the veranda the way he always did entering his house it was no longer his house for a start it was full of people amy was in an armchair holding her baby lucy was on the settee and adam was beside her lucy had her feet propped up on adams knees she looked even more pregnant today he thought the baby seemed to have dropped settling low uhoh and of course pippa was there she was seated at the dining table behind a sewing machine surrounded by fabric she looked worried his gaze met hers and held the look she gave him was one of defiance but her worry stayed like im not sure i should have done this this this would have to be the house his breath drew in and wasnt replaced breathing seemed extraneous hed left at four that morning it was now midafternoon and it was a different house the sea had come inside there were huge montages of surf and sky and beach and sun and smaller montages of skiing snow and sun he saw a series of ten posters of dolphins riding the waves taken as stills one after the other from the moment the pod entered the back of the wave to when they twisted triumphantly out as the wave crashed out onto the shore and there werent just posters there were cushions throws and curtains he stared around in amazement every window had curtains great folds of blue and gold draped from rods with huge wooden rings how the pippa bought a sewing machine amy seemed the only one not nervous she was breathless with excitement the fabric shop delivered rolls and rolls of fabric and rings and rods adam put up the rods pippas sewed and sewed while me and lucy stuck up posters adam told us where to put themlucy says he wants to be an artist and pippas taught me how to sew curtains theyre easy she says i can have the sewing machine for a baby present and the leftover material for curtains when i get home do you like it they were all looking at him it felt he wasnt sure how it felt there was a part of him that loved it his house was being converted into a home more this was a home designed specifically for him the views from outside were echoed but softly the sunlight diffused the harsh yellows turned to soft gold here a man could take sanctuary he wouldnt have to head to the surfthe surf had come to him he looked at the people surrounding him lucy and adam tremulous with hope that theyd done something good amy beaming with pride and excitement pippa looking wary shed organised it he thought shed given him a home and that was the problem did he want a home had he ever he lived out of a duffel bag hed never put down roots as a kid his mother had always been dragging him from one place to the next from one substitute father to the next from one disaster to the next now he made sure his escape route was always open hed been here for six years but every moment of that time hed known he could walk away how could he walk away now he couldnt amy was depending on him lucy and adam were depending on him pippa was still looking wary she looked as if she expected to be hurt was she depending on him its fantastic he said as sincerely as he could and everyone beamed except pippa its so cool lucy said its even better than the hotel i thought if we buy a cheap mattress and put it in the spare room on the floor could adam and i stay here too the hotel was fine last night but heres better pippas been so nice she had been nice riley conceded shed invited amy into his house her niceness was drawing lucy in too nice but she was so much more im not staying here long pippa said still wary youll be here until i have to go amy said panicked pippa cast another sidelongwaryglance at riley and nodded yes i want you to be here when our babys born lucy breathed amy says you helped with her baby she says you were lovely you and dad both you know if you two were here why do i have to go to hospital i could lie on the veranda and watch the sea when im in labour and i wouldnt have to do any of that scary hospital stuff and her happiness faded she gave her father a scared glance it might be better i i dont have insurance you dont have riley was speechless we couldnt get any insurance company to cover me she said not here of all the he turned and stared at pippawho was looking at a halfmade curtain studiously not looking at him his life had been under control until this woman arrived since then this is you he said me its down to you how exactly am i responsible for lucy not having insurance youre responsible for telling her she can have her baby here she hasnt lucy said astounded that he was attacking pippa its just ive heard of lots of people having home births i thought maybe i could too i knew you were a doctor i knew i hoped youd help me but if you wont she sniffed and clutched adams hand adam will adam swallowed manfully i i expect you will need to go to hospital he said sounding terrified we can figure out how to pay later but the debt theres lots of stuff we have to figure out adam said squaring his puny shoulders baby first you first lets take care of you nothing else matters and riley looked at his daughters terrified face at adams terrified responseand he knew his anger at pippa was totally unjustified lucy was eighteen years old this was her first baby she was alone except for adam and adam was scarcely older than she was will you help us pippa adam asked while riley fought to make a recovery of course i will pippa told him turning stiffly away from riley lucy adams right theres no need to worry all you need to concentrate on is welcoming your baby into the world do you have any good books theres lots of stuff to read about what to expect and it might be fun for you and adam to read them together i can borrow them from the hospital and you should learn breathing amy said wisely i bet pippa could teach you he was being excluded riley thought maybe justifiably what the hell was he doing putting his needs before lucys well do this together he growled and he spoke to adam rather than lucy because now that lucy had pippa and amy behind her it was suddenly adam who was looking the most worried the hospital might be best i can help you we can decide that close to the time pippa said and her tone was suddenly resolute almost daring him to defy her i hope im still here to help amy said having a baby is awesome it doesnt hurt at all pippa teased and amy giggled it does hurt a bit she conceded but then you get this baby at the end of it and its fabulous im not going to have any more until im about thirty but i loved it can i help pippa teach you to breathe i can breathe already lucy said and peeped a glance at her father who was glaring at pippa im sure i can why are you looking at pippa like that shes organising my life im not pippa said if lucy and adam are staying here maybe i should go back to my hotel no amy said suddenly panicked you promised i need you here lucy said sounding even more panicked maybe he should go to the hotel riley thought absorbing the fact that he was in a house that had been transformed suddenly into a homehis homeand it was full of people who were depending on pippa its like having family lucy said and he thought exactly it was exactly why he wanted to walk away right now another bombshell was about to land amy retired to have a nap pippa went back to curtain sewing and adam put up more rods lucy took her father on a tour of the posters ill pay you for these he said trying to make up for his less than enthusiastic initial response they must have cost a fortune plus the sewing machine and the fabric i didnt pay for them lucy said i dont have any money mum said if i stay with adam then shed cut me off with nothing and adams an art student youve come to australia with nothing adam sold his motorbike that just got us here that made him feel dreadful the money itself didnt worry him he had twenty years of savings he earned an excellent wage and the overtime in the work he was doing now was truly astounding but to have lucy so helpless and whod paid for the posters so pippa paid it doesnt matter to her she says shes not your girlfriend but dad if i were you id make a move shes funny and shes kind and shes loaded loaded you didnt know what are you talking about i didnt recognise her but adam did as soon as he heard her full name we got the posters delivered she paid for them over the phone by credit card shes phillippa penelope fotheringham it that supposed to mean anything to me yeah it is i sort of knew about her shes an heiress and we know even more cos adam read a story about her last month while i was getting tests at the hospital adam read the glossies while he waited there was a piece on pippa he says her grandfather made millions with some food company her parents are socialitesworse than mum even ive heard of them theyre always in the news but pippas not social the story said pippa went nursing when she was seventeen her family hated it but she did anyway shes been quiet ever since the article was about her grandpa saying shes the best of his relations and hes left the company to her oh and she was going to marry the companys chief accountantthat was what the piece was about you know heiress finds true love that sort of thing i dont know what happened but what i do know is that shes seriously seriously rich dinner was steak and salad cooked on the barbecue with riley thinking pippa had paid for the steak amy and baby riley were asleep before the washingup was complete adam and lucy headed back to their hotel with baby books they couldnt get a mattress until monday but they looked wistful as they left the house riley headed out to the veranda and pippa followed she stood and watched him for a while he watched the sea and said nothing you can take the posters down after everyones gone she said at last why would i want to do that because you like bare walls i dont actually like walls at all how rich are you very rich there was no sense in denying it so what the hell are you doing here im not accepting free board and lodging she said warily because there was nothing in his voice to suggest any warmth im staying here because of amy but im paying rent to the hospital the same as you thats not what i meant you took the job with flightaid under false pretences under what pretences she demanded starting to feel angry are you saying i had no right to apply because theres money in my background you can apply for what you like because im rich anger was coming to her aid now pure and simple i didnt pay for coral to employ me at flightaid i was employed on the basis of my experience and my qualifications its a plaything excuse me youll do it and leave i might she said astounded so might you i did however work in the same hospital in britain for over ten years match that dr riley what are you doing here it was like an explosion he turned to face her and his eyes were dark with anger what are you playing at im not playing filling my house with whats the quote a monstrous regiment of women like three she said gobsmacked three four even baby riley howled when when you gave her her blood test id howl too if someone pricked my heel whatever youre putting her in your conspiracy theory too riley chase his life hijacked by women what about adam hell figure it out riley said harshly lucys grandparents her mother theyre angry with her now but theyll want her back theyll haul her back into their lives and adam will be left on the outside are we talking of adam or are we talking about you its none of your business and neither is my money any of your business what earthly difference does it make why are you working because i want to she was almost yelling almost but not quite i left my job to marry roger the deal was that wed have a long honeymoon then wed go back to london and guess what id find another job nursing i love what i do believe it or not i love it a lot more than i ever loved roger and guess what ive fallen in love again only this time ive fallen in love with flightaid with the whole package with whale cove hospital with jancey with coral with nurses who care so much they dont even see the end of their shifts coming who see the place as an extension of their lives their community thats not shut up and let me finish she said because i need to say it because i love what you do too and im not intending to walk away from it i love the search and rescue component of the joball the worthwhile things i sneaked into the hospital when i went for a walk this morning and i talked to jancey i know what you did for that family last night you got his body back so they could grieve but more you stayed with them you talked them through their grief you made georges body presentable so by the time they saw him he didnt look like hed died in terror and then you cared for maria you reassured her you were just there jancey says sometimes you doubt that a doctor should be on these search and rescue missions but everyone here thinks exactly that this is nothing to do with me yes it is because im a flightaid nurse ive signed corals contract and theres more joyces clinic her housecumhospital it took my breath away i want to be a part of that so much its like a part of me i didnt know was missing and i will be a part of it jancey says theres two complete crews two medical teams who cover inland settlements she says if you and i cant get along then well swap teams mardi can come to you and ill go on jakes team you talked to jancey about me everyone talks about you she said wearily everyone worries abut you they love you riley chase only you dont get it you do this loner thing and no one can get near jancey says you had the pits of a childhood alcoholic mother no parenting to speak of one of the older nurses knew your mother and she said i dont have to listen to this no you dont she said like i dont have to listen to you saying my medicine is a plaything ive come from money and neglect youve come from poverty and neglect either way weve ended up here the only difference is that i intend to make here my home ill buy an apartment here and you know what i wont need adam and lucy and amy to make it a home for me because ill do it myself oh and by the way while youre busy getting your knickers in a twist heres something else to get on your high horse about im about to throw more money about im about to set up a trust for joyces house ill use whatever i need to set it up as an accredited hospital ill do it anonymously but id imagine youll find out so you might as well despise me now not for the act for having the capacity to do it for what i was born into rather than what i am he didnt speak he stood staring at her in the moonlight like she was someone he didnt knowand didnt want to know i know how lucys mother and grandparents treated you she said her anger finally fading at little as she remembered the bald outline lucy had told her she had every right to be angry but money had messed with so much of her life that in a way she understood his confusion his emotion if she could come to this man on his terms but there was no way she could her money was there like it or not she would help joyce and she would help other communities even if it meant riley looked at her the way he was looking at her now im not my money riley she said softly thats not me im who you pulled out of the water a woman at the end of her life a woman with nothing but one thing this week has taught me is that i only have one chance at life and flightaid is what i want but you know what theres a part of me that wants more theres a part of me that wants she faltered she couldnt say it he was a stranger standing aloof against the balcony rail a shadow against the moonlight and the fluorescence of the sea he didnt want anything he didnt want the posters and curtains and the accoutrements of home he didnt want her what was she doing being angry with him she had no right hed made love to her only because shed been needy she had to move on ill stay here for as long as amy needs me she said making her voice even almost calm youre stuck with me until then and im sorry i invited amy here and that was a mistake i should have got an apartment for her and for me but moving now i dont think thats possible without heartbreak so ill stay here and well lead separate lives on monday ill talk to coral about being rostered onto a different crew from you well work apart thats the best i can do riley but i wont do more than that i cant walk away completely she closed her eyes and bit her lip this was so hard just say it no yes why not why not be honest i cant walk away because ive fallen in love she said softly now but with her dignity intact with flight aid with jancey with amy with whale cove deep breath just say it and im very close to falling in love with you she whispered because theres this connection i dont get it i cant figure out why im feeling it but i am like were linked our backgrounds something im sorry but there it is honesty on all fronts but im a big girl ive walked alone all my life and im good at it i know you dont want whatever im feeling and thats more of a reason for me to get myself as apart from you as i can without leaving whale cove so for now you need to put up with posters put up with sharing your home put up with people in your life for another week or so and then im not sure what youll do with lucy but thats up to you and lucy for the rest of it ill respect your right to be alone pippa theres nothing else to say she said and then before she could stop herself she stepped forward took his hands in hers and stood on tiptoe she kissed him and it was a kiss of farewell she wasnt leaving but she was moving away he didnt respond he didnt touch her there was nothing else to be said she released his hands she walked inside and she closed the door behind her chapter ten they didnt swap crews there was no need riley simply held himself distant pippa was introduced to full crew membership and she loved it she loved the work she loved the remote clinics and after a couple of days she figured she and riley could handle a professional working relationship they were both good at holding themselves contained practice on tuesday they did a retrieval upcountrya truck had rolled with three kids in the back it took all their medical skills to get a good outcomethree kids recovering in sydney centraland it felt fantastic she could do this the house was trickier amys jason arrived late on wednesday night dusty and worn from hitchhiking for six hundred miles i couldnt wait any longer to see my kid he said simply ill sleep on the beach i dont need a bed his boss had told him he could take time off to settle amy and the baby amy was so proud she looked like she might burst so there was now another mattress on the floor the pair sat and watched their baby slowly work her way through her jaundice they waited every night for riley to tell them she was doing well lucy and adam sat on the veranda read their birthing books and practised the breathing amy proudly taught themand waited every night for riley to tell them they were doing well they depended on him except they didnt none of them depended on him not really riley thought as the week wore on because there was pippa she was like the sun with planets spinning around her she was the life of the house she was embracing life like shed never realised she was alive until this moment soaking up every moment of this new wonderful world she found herself in her joy was impossible not to share except he didnt share it not if he could help it because it seemed like a void it seemed a sweet sensual lure a vortex that if he entered hed end up as hed ended up twenty years before when hed met marguerite maybe he wouldnt maybe he wasnt brave enough to find out thursday night he was on the beach looking back to the house pippas curtains were left undrawn the lights were on and he could see them all they were squashed on the divans watching television pippa had been making popcorn when hed left he could see them passing bowls laughing hed go back soon he was necessary in the house he had to sort lucys life he had to check amys baby he was useful he was loved no love was an illusion something that happened to others not to him he didnt need it he had everything he neededhis medicine his surf his independence hed set lucy and adam up in their own place next thursday amy would go back to dry gum pippa would move out the ripples in his calm existence would roll to the edges and disappear he glanced again at the lit windows and thought he could be in there pippa child of money a siren song stay outside for as long as it takes she knew he was out there but there wasnt anything she could do he didnt want to be a part of this house if it wasnt for riley shed be loving it pippa had gone from general nursing training to surgical and then to intensive care then a case one night had touched her more deeply than she cared to admit a woman had come in to have her fifth child during second stage her uterus had ruptured emergency caesarean theyd lost the baby and the mother had come so close to death it didnt bear thinking about pippa had cared for her in intensive care shed watched the little familys terror and their grief for the little life lost five children and each one the most precious thing in the world the following day shed put in her application for midwifery she loved it and here was the perfect midwife job she was caring for amy with her newborn baby and at the same time she was preparing lucy for birth lucy was like a sponge listening to everything pippa told her reading reading reading about childbirth and adam was almost as eager but what was more wonderful was that amy was teaching lucy in amy lucy had a teenaged ally whod gone through birth only a week before who scorned her fears as garbage its like a teenage antenatal clinic pippa told riley six days after lucy arrived and then winced as riley grunted a sharp response and went on to do what he had to do he was doing exactly thatwhat he had to do he was organising life for lucy and adam he was watching baby rileys progress he was making sure lucy had all her checks that everything was done that had to be done there were enough practical tasks necessary for riley to deflect emotion hed get his life back soon enough pippa thought as the end of the first week neared in one more week theyd take amy home and pippa would have no reason to stay then all riley had to do was sort out a relationship with his daughter and that had nothing to do with her his solitary life suited him she had to respect that so shed move out and shed be more professional than than who did she know who was strictly professional who did she know who had no emotional attachment at all riley not riley or not the riley she knew but the riley he almost certainly wanted to be saturday afternoon riley was in the flightaid headquarters not because he needed to be but because three women and two men and one baby were sunbaking on his veranda there was no way he was joining them it wasnt a trap but it felt like it theyd be talking babies he told himself quashing guilt there was no need for him to be there but there was no need for him to be here eitherhe could be on call at homeso when a call came he grabbed the radio with relief all stops harry sounded frightened which for harry was amazing kid stuck in a crevice off the rocks south of mccarthys sound tides coming in waters rising and hes at risk of drowning im calling pippa take off in two minutes whether youre on board or not they had six minutes in the chopper to take in the information being relayed to them harry had met them looking as grim as death and he had reason the kid slipped off a ledge while his dad was fishing the cliffs not sheer but its crumbling sandstone so he slid and bumped which is why he wasnt killed outright just before water level theres a bunch of rocks hes gone straight down a crevice he cant get up in breaks between waves theyve heard him screaming his dad tried to get down and fellprobable broken ankle he only just managed to get up himself the local abseiling clubs trying to get their members there but no ones available and the tides coming in the report was hystericalseems hes below the hightide mark it was enough to make them all shut up pippa and riley sat in the backthis was where theyd operate from if they needed to lower someone to the scene pippa felt ill was she ready with cordelia remaining off work shed been catapulted into the team with little training but even with the emotional undercurrents riley had worked at getting her professional it had been a quiet week which was just as well shed learned to operate the winch as riley was lowered shed been lowered herself she knew the right way to make physical contact with a patient for retrieval she knew how to operate harnesses she knew in theory all she needed to make her a viable member of the rescue outfit but for a call such as this they should have called mardi she thought or another of the members of the second crew but thered been no time mardi was five minutes away in the doctors house she was right there were almost there riley said watching her face knowing what she was thinking you can do this pippa of course she could there was no choicebut what was before them took her breath away people were clustered on the cliff top a police car an ambulance half a dozen people even from here she could pick out the father someone was holding him back from the edge he was kneeling screaming sobbing another car was pulling up a woman kids she couldnt hear the screaming but she felt it she watched the woman run to the cliff edge the policeman hold her back she watched her crumple a part of the cliff seemed to have fallen away making a rough ledge of rocks at the base huge boulders scattered randomly thered been strong winds for the last two days and the sea was stirred up crazily the wind had eased now but the sea was still vicious it was crashing into the boulders at the foot of the cliff somewhere amongst those boulders was a child hes eight years old harry said over the radio names mickey if i go down can we get directions to exactly where he is riley demanded get the father on the radio have someone hold him while he watches but if he saw his kid go hell be the only person who can pinpoint exactly where he is pippa youre in charge up here total control you know you can do it did she know of course she did she gulped how long did normal paramedics have to train not six days course she can harry said injecting forced lightness into his voice or you can come up front and pilot the chopper while i do it piece of cake just hover and dont hit anything i think maybe i ought to hold rileys winch pippa said faintly im not all that good at hovering you never know what you can do until you try riley said and he caught her gaze and held we accepted you into this crew because youre good pippa nows the time to prove it it was the longest five minutes of her life she operated the winch while riley was lowered carefully down to the rocks despite what harry said about just hover and dont hit anything she knew it took huge skill to hold the chopper steady they were so close to the cliff the people on the cliff top were forced to move back as harry took the chopper almost to ground level to give riley minimum swing as he lowered himself down the fathers voice crackled over the radio thick with sobs the big rock to the north of where he is a couple more yards yeah down there between that one and the flat one to its side oh god theres a wave riley had reached ground level he was on the flat rock no longer swinging from the harness he was on his stomach peering down waves were breaking over the rocks not much intermittently but pippa thought how far had the child slipped how far was the water going in mickey they heard riley through his headset he was bracing himself against the wash trying to see hed taken his flashlight down with him and pippa could imagine him peering down into the void hhelp it was a childs whisper choking off and through the radio system they heard it clearly dear god can you catch a rope mate if i throw it down to you its a harness you can loop it under your arms my hands i cant one of thems behind me it wont i cant get it out the other doesnt i cant there was a muffled sob and then a gasp riley was pushing himself down into the chasm reaching as far as he could swearing hold on mate hold on another wave a scream cut short dear god he had no choice he was as far into the chasm as he could reach the water was swirling round his face sucking back out of the chasm thered be more waves coming he couldnt reach he couldnt reach he was wasting time there was no way he could haul the child free if he pushed himself any further theyd both drown there was one choice and one choice only it nearly killed him to ask her he had no choice pippa it was riley using a voice she didnt recognise shed seen the sea wash over him shed thought shed thought im here of course she was every sense was tuned to the drama below she felt like retching this was no time for retching hes more than a metre out of reach riley said and she could feel his anguish but still his words were clipped and decisive i cant get inthe chasms too narrow and my chests too wide the seas risingthat last wave went over his head and i damn near stuck theres only one way we can do this im unfastening the harness harry get onto the cliff and pick up one of the copstheyll know how to operate the winch then pippa i need you to get down here youre half my size across the shoulders do you have the courage to be lowered feet first to grab him we wait five minutes and we lose him even now can you do this yes no hesitation of course she can harry said get that harness off chase so we can get it onto pippa were moving to ask her to do this he had no choice not if the child was to live but to ask it of pippa to ask it of anyone watch the sea were coming he called to the child below not knowing if he was still capable of hearing hold on mate pippas coming riley was on the ledge with no harness a wave could wash in at any time below him was a child trapped where the sea washed in and out pippas fear for them both didnt leave room for any fear for herself besides there were things to do fear was for later she had the winch up and was wearing the harness by the time they landed on the cliff top a burly sergeant ran forward was in the chopper was demanding instructions as the chopper lifted off harry had forewarned him i know the basics he said quick runthrough see one do one teach one pippa had to choke back a hysterical laugh surely this was the mantra at its most dangerous harry and riley had spent a couple of hours teaching her about winching theyd intended to do more with her but that initial teaching was all she had so shed seen one she was about to do one her life and rileys and mickeys depended on her teaching one as well but needs must and it all flooded back to her the mantra riley had drilled in steadiness keeping control at all times watching the wind being ready to rewinch at any moment watching for sway safety safety safety the sergeant was good calm and unflappable or maybe he was as good at hiding panic as she was by the time harry had the chopper centred again over riley and the child below he was behind the winch putting his hand on her shoulder as if it was she who was the trainee maybe she wasnt as good at hiding panic as shed thought you can do it girl the big policeman said calmly and steadily we know you can pom arent you never mind even if you guys are hopeless at cricket i reckon you can do this you can sing rule britannia all the way down she almost laughed but then she was slipping out of the chopper her feet were no longer touching anything and she was heading down to riley she was no longer even close to laughing the last time shed hung above the sea her life was being saved now concentrate do not sway hold yourself firm steady harry and the sergeant can only do so much you have to do the rest head straight down riley was below her down downand he caught her a wave washed over the rock as she landed and she gasped with the shock of the cold waterbut riley had her holding her steadying her its okay youre safe pippa but mickeys not and we need to work fast he shone the flashlight down and she could see a shock of red hair a child crumpled into an impossibly narrow crevice mickey riley called and there was no response i cant get down to him and hes drowning riley said and she heard the desperation in his voice the water from the last wave was being sucked out of the crevice now how far had it come up im watching the sea at the next break you go down head first with me holding your feet riley said youll still wear the harness if the crevice is too tight or another wave comes then i pull you straight outthis isnt about losing you as well you get the harness under his shoulders or you grab him any way you can and then you get out of there old surf mantraevery seventh wave is a biggie and it seems to be working straight after the next biggie and youre down they were working as he spoke adjusting her harness he was looping ropes around her waist and shoulders tying them so he had a rope on either side of her wait he said as she stooped and it nearly killed her to waitand it nearly killed him as well then as the next big wave struck he held her tight hard against him so the wave couldnt move them his body gave her courage he gave her courage the wave rocked them filled the crevice and she thought mickey mickey the wave sucked out again deep breath and then riley gave her a hard swift kiss as the water cleared from around their legs the kiss was a blessing then she was on her knees stooping leaning in letting go riley held her her hands touched the side of the crevice feeling her way straight down hauling herself in she couldnt worry about the wavesthat was rileys lookout she trusted him it was so tightshe had to hunch her shoulders as hard as she could to squeeze down she had no room to work with a torch and her body blocked the light her hands touched mickeys hair she pushed herself further down fighting to get a hold on his shoulders he was crammed in hard maybe hed wriggled to get out wedging himself in further mickey no response hed have been under water over and over his shoulders were hunched forward like hers in front of his clavicle a tiny amount of wriggle room she got her hands down under gripping like death she couldnt fasten a rope no room she grabbed handfuls of his windcheater and tugged he didnt move she firmed her hold pull she yelled at riley and he pulled and the child shifted if she could hold him she couldnt he was too heavy the grip of the rocks too great but he was up far enough now for her to get a harness around him sort of she was holding and tying keeping the deadweight steady and if anyone asked her afterwards how shed done it she could never tell them she didnt know all she knew was that she wasnt letting go if the water came in now she was still holding on for dear life the water did come in but not enough to reach her not enough either to cover mickeys head not now shed tugged him a little higher oh but he was so limp she couldnt think that she could only think harness she had him she was fastened to riley mickey was fastened to her they were going to have to rise as one if mickey came out without support if his head fell sideways and caught if another wave twisted him there was no winch on top only riley would he have the strength like her he had no choice pull she yelled and she felt her harness tighten she held to mickey for dear life his harness held and she felt the rocks release them she came free just as another wave hit she hauled mickey up and they were out riley was holding her holding mickey they were falling backwards against the rocks simply holding until the sucking power of the wave eased and the moment it did riley was working on mickey there was no room for the niceties of a mask breathe for him he snapped as he set mickey down on the highest piece of rock so they could work on him im on chest and wave watching he still had to watch the sea if another wave hit theyd have to stop to hold on there was no point in getting mickey breathing again if they were all to be washed back into the waves so riley watched the sea but still he worked compressing his chest as steadily as if he was in the emergency department of her training hospital all his focus was on the little boys chest she checked mickeys airway againshed done a fast check and given him a quick first breath as theyd come out of the crevice but now she had time to be careful she breathed if riley could be steady so could she if riley wasnt panicking neither would she she had her fingers on the boys carotid artery feeling desperate a pulse it was barely there but she was sure shed felt it pulse dont even think about stopping she told riley but he barely acknowledged her he kept working when the next big wave hit they worked as one lifting the child holding him high bracing themselves against the rock pippa kept on breathing as much as she could rileys chest compressions were more hugs during the worst of the wave as the wave receded mickey was down on the ledge again and they kept right on and then the little boy stirred his chest heaved he took a gasping searing gulp of air and riley had him on his side in an instant he was horribly wonderfully sick and then amazingly he started to cry pippa was beside him on the rock her face almost touching his she held him tight as the water washed over the rocks surface she was making sure his airway wasnt blocked this time the wave wasnt high enough to be threatening how could anything threaten them now youre safe mickey she said holding him close as his retching eased doc rileys come in his helicopter and weve rescued you your mum and dad are on the top of the cliff the helicopters lowering a stretcher right now so we can pull you up how cool to tell the kids at school you were rescued with a helicopter you just stay still and let me hold you until we get you back to your mum she was amazing pippa riley stood back as mickey was embraced by his family hed done what needed to be done mickeys airway was clear he had oxygen flowinghe was conscious and lucid so there appeared to be no longterm threat from his near drowning he had a fractured arm and maybe further fractures to his pelvis and ribs but nothing lifethreatening the painkillers were taking effect he was almost managing to smile his mother was holding his good hand and she didnt look like shed let go any time soon his father was hugging pippa he didnt look like he was letting go any time soon either he was sobbing and pippa was holding him tight cradling him like shed cradled mickey down on the ledge soon riley needed to work on himhe was sure the guys ankle was fracturedbut the man wasnt worried about his own pain he was only worried about his son its okay hes safe pippa told him if not for you i dont know how we can thank you hey doc riley held my legs and watched the waves its riley whos the hero plus my gym back in england how cool that i lost a little weight for my wedding she set him back a little smiling happy endings i love em by the way did you guys catch any fish i yes the paramedics were loading mickey into the ambulance riley was helping but pippas conversation had him distracted how many pippa demanded and riley blinked he was thinking of giving the guy some morphine pippa was thinking about fish we caught three the man managed what sort whiting oh yum are these them she seized a fishing basket and peered inside yes they are the man said and riley realised what pippa was doing she was dragging him back from the nightmare into a fragment of reality mickeys mother was holding mickey the paramedics were making sure he was immobilised for the journey riley had his pain under control there was a moment for normality to resurface and pippa was making the most of it i guess you guys wont be eating fish for tea tonight she said sounding suddenly wistful and a little bit cheeky what with having to sit around hospitals waiting for mickey to get a cast and you might need one on your foot thatll take ages i guess youll have to eat dinner at the hospital cafeteria the man took a deep breath he looked at his wife and son he looked at his other kidsthree littlies being held by someone who might be an aunt he looked back at pippa he looked at his fish and riley saw the instant when nightmare moved to thought pippa had found her reality would you like a fish the man asked i thought youd never ask she said and she chuckled she was incorrigible riley thought she was soaking wethow she wasnt shivering was a wonder there was an ugly graze on the side of her face where shed thumped against the rock on the way up or down her knuckles had lost skin her hair was dripping wetly down her back she looked about ten years old but her smile was enough to make anyone smile to make anyones nightmares recede hed been comparing her to marguerite he was out of his mind you can have all three the fisherman said handing over his basket theyre great fish really really oh and i have a huge family i can feed them to pippa said beaming gathering them to her like gold thank you so much you saved my son and you gave me fish she kissed the guy lightly on the cheek it looks like mickeys ready to go let doc riley check your foot and then into the ambulance with you oh and do your fishing a hundred feet from the edge from now on im buying my fish from the fish and chip shop he growledbut the man was smiling everyone was smiling everyone had heard the interchange even mickey so can we buy shop chips the little boy ventured and his mother burst into tears but she was smiling through her tears happy endings pippa said in satisfaction heading back to the chopper with her haul of fish i love em and when the ambulance moved away as their chopper rose she made riley leave the slide open she kept her harness on they rose and she leaned out as far as riley permitted she had a fish in each hand and she waved goodbye with fish cheering then she settled back into the chopper with her basket of fish on her knee and beamed and riley the armour hed surrounded himself with for years the protective barriers which let him want no one need no one were gone pippa she could have drowned he was totally exposed she was taking her fish home to her family riley thought dazed her family that would be amy and jason and baby riley and lucy and adam and him yeah tonight it would be him there was no way he was not being part of those fish mickey was being taken by road to sydney hed need specialist orthopaedic care so there was no medical need for either riley or pippa to stay involved harry started his routine check of the chopper riley and pippa walked back to the house they needed a shower they needed a change of clothes they also needed to talk riley thought but he didnt know where to start what had just happened hed lowered a slip of a girl into a chasm and he hadnt known if they could all survive as simple as that if the sea had turned on them thered been no choice the alternative had been impossible to contemplateto leave mickey to drown but hed had to ask pippa to risk her life and shed come up laughing shed come up talking of fish and of family he was feeling like hed shed something hed barely known he had he felt light and free and bewildered he was carrying her fish he was caught up in his thoughts so it was pippa who saw amy first she paused and looked across as amy yelled wildly from the veranda will you two hurry up were having a baby chapter eleven they were indeed having a baby lucy was crouched like an animal in pain on the livingroom settee she moaned as they arrived a deep primeval moan that told pippa they were deep into first stage how far apart she asked amy there was no use asking lucy anything for the moment two minutes amy said and she wont go to hospital shes scared she just wants you guys gee im pleased to see you but amys fantastic adam looked terrified but he gave amy a sheepish smile as lucys moan trailed away shes real bossy yeah well i know what to do amy said see one do one teach one pippa almost grinned then she glanced at riley and her grin died he looked like she never wanted a support person to look fear was infectious what was he doing with a face as grim as death we need to get you to hospital he told his daughter as the contraction eased and her body slumped no argument ill phone louise and take you now hey how about hi lucy great to see you we brought you some fish pippa demanded astonished the last thing lucy needed was an implication of fear from her doctor but then she thought riley wasnt lucys doctor riley was lucys dad maybe terror was understandable so maybe someone else had to take charge the contraction was easing lucy looked up from the settee and gave them a wavering smile fish she managed three beauties pippa said deciding normal was the way to go who needed panic your dad and i caught them from the helicopter sort of while youve been having fun here but now were here okay fish aside it looks like babys next she gave riley a sideways glance trying to figure what to do for the best he looked under such strain hed want louise but most obstetricians only worked in hospitals to have louise take on her care thats where they had to go lucy love why dont you want to go to hospital its two minutes away im not going to hospital lucy said in a voice where the fear came through please i dont want to this feels like family you guys can deliver babies i dont want my legs in stirrups where had she learned about stirrups the internet pippa thought or old documentaries pictures of labour wards where obstetricians put their patients in stirrups in second stage as a matter of course why cant i stay here lucy wailed and grabbed adams hand and held it like she was drowning i dont want to do this im so scared i want to go home to england adam sounded terrified we cant i wont go to hospital dadll help lucy im your father i cant be your doctor lucys not asking you to be her doctor pippa said figuring she had no choice but to intervene riley sounded strained to the limit he was right he was lucys father that had to be his role nothing more but lucy also needed a professional that would be her you all know im a trained midwife she said speaking more confidently than she felt the checks lucy did with louise on wednesday showed no problems everythings beautifully normal lucy youre delivering a week early but thats fine i suggest we let louise know whats happening in case we need backup then we settle down here with all of us supporting you every step of the way but if you get exhausted or if there are signs that your babys exhausted then we take you to the hospital straight away and louise takes over that has to be the deal do you agree yes lucy managed but it was a strangled gasp cool amy said do you want us all to stay yes lucy yelled gripping adams hand so tight that pippa saw him wince in pain i want you all then i want my family family was she still talking about wanting to go back to england somehow pippa didnt think so but she had no time to think about it riley was grabbing her wrist as lucy rode her contraction ill talk to you outside he said through gritted teeth itd better be quick she told him thats a minute and a half between contractions i need a quick shower to get rid of fish before i can turn into a midwife he wasnt interested in showers he hauled her through the door then tugged her along the veranda until they were out of earshot and let fly what the hell do you think youre doing he demanded practically apoplectic shes going to hospital why is she going to hospital his face was dark with anger she tried to stay calm but her very calmness seemed to infuriate him its safer we need incubators resuscitation equipment oxygen a fully trained obstetrician louise is a specialist lucy needs the best you delivered amy pippa said striving to keep her voice even amy didnt deserve the best amy was frightened she didnt know anyone and lucy she has adam she has all of us in a labour ward in hospital louise cant work with five of us amy and jason would have to stay here and amys giving lucy courage look at her she glanced in through the windowthe contraction was past and amy was making some sort of a jokemaking them all smile this is like gold she could have amy with her and adam yes and you i dont she needs you in the background yes but she does need you youre her dad she wants family her familys in england i dont think so pippa said what mother would pack her eighteenyearold to australia to have her baby didnt you hear her her familys here you cant make a family in a week you can if youre desperate lucys desperate you have no right to tell her she can have her baby here pippa hauled her wrist away and stepped back anger coming to her aid actually i do this isnt your house youve never bought it youve never thought of it as home but im working for flightaid and im renting part of this house contrary to you ive put up decorations ive bought rugs and made curtains so this is my home riley chase and i have every right to ask lucy to stay and you know what she tilted her chin knowing she had no right to say what she was about to say but she was saying it anyway lucy wants family she said and she couldnt quite stop a wobble entering her voice if you know how much that means its the reason i finally said yes to roger its the reason i almost married ive never had familynot a proper loving familyand i want it more than anything in the world i know its the last thing you want but thats your problem for now lucy and amy need me when amys gone ill somehow figure how to get a family of my own even if it means dogs or parrots but right now the only semblance of a family i have is here lucy needs my help to deliver her baby so if youll excuse me dr chase i have a baby to prepare for your grandchild family whether you like it or not and by the way you stink of fish too do you want to take a shower and join us or do you want to go surfing alone while your family operates without you your choice your choice alone so lucy didnt go to hospital riley and jason were consigned to the background he and jason paced talked lit the barbecue made a big fire stoked it watched logs crackle and burn and turn to embers theyd cook the fish in the embers riley decided when the baby was born did amy go through this jason asked awed as another moan rocked the house she did i shoulda been here the kid said only she said she didnt want me not if i was just going to hang around then she went to sydney and i missed her and i thought okay ill get a job if thats what it takes so she went through this by herself and look at her now she says she wants to be a nurse you reckon she could shell need to do part of her training in the city riley said watching through the open windows adam holding lucys hand or rather being clutched by lucy amy was designated coach talking lucy through every step of the way luce this is brilliant pippa says six centimetres and you remember the book every time it hurts youre opening up a bit more every time it hurts it means your babys closer that contraction was awesome youre awesome it was amazing for both of them riley thought for all of them for lucy had a team second to none she had adam whose love for her was transparent she had amy who was even younger than lucy but wise for her years and whose assistance now could riley sensed validate and direct amys existence for the rest of her life and she had pippa preparing warmed towels organising the sterilised equipment shed sent him over to the hospital to fetch overseeing her little team pippa looked happy she was a woman he hardly knew a woman of independent wealth british straight from the english class system hed thought he loathed hed made love to her out of need her need but as he watched through the window as he saw her smile chuckle give steady encouragement he knew things had changed she was wearing jeans and tshirt her feet were bare her hair was wet from her shower she was beautiful he thought of her down the crevice and he felt himself shudder hey its okay jason put his hand on his shoulder searching to comfort shell be great shes got my amy and your pippa helping her through you gotta trust women mate amy says if i toe the line we can get married how awesomes that to have your own woman and amy he glanced in at his amy i mean not that pippas not great she is but its one woman for every guy right look at adam hes in a blue funk now cos of lucy look at me ive even got a job ill even come to the city to help her if she wants to train as a nurse and you what would you give up for pippa he and pippa werent a couple he should explain but there was no time for explanation lucy hit full roar in midcontraction there wasnt space for a reply and it was just as well but the question stayed what would he give up for pippa what would he gain youre so close the labour had moved fastfive hours from the first contraction and now she was fully into second stage youth pippa thought emotionally young mums had it hard but physically they had so much going for them lucy was practically shooting this baby out i can see the head she told her adam do you want to help deliver your baby amy can you support lucys shoulders so she can see awesome amy breathed lucy youre fabulous do you want your dad to see she hesitated and jason didnt see my riley born lucy would you mind you can bring in the whole bloody army as long as they stay up my end of the bed lucy moaned oooooohhhh nearly there pippa said one more push get my dad lucy yelled suddenly desperate i need my adam and i need my dad oooooooowwwwwww so after eighteen years of not being permitted to do a thing for her he was there beside his daughter as she gave birth riley knelt at the head of the settee supporting lucys shoulders as she saw her baby born and he didnt feel like a doctor at all one more push and the head slipped into view pippa was there with warmed towels warming the tiny head even before the shoulder came out stay underneath with the towels she told adam as a last massive contraction ripped through and so as amy and riley held lucy up to see rileys grandchild slipped into the world to be caught by adam who looked like the sky had opened to reveal the secret of the heavens what what lucy gasped as adam gazed down in awe and pippa did a fast check of the babys airway making sure that everything was in working order what is it look for yourself riley growled and felt a bit a bit like adam looked i have a boy oh i have a boy lucy burst into tears and then ohhh for pippa was quietly directing adam showing him what to do and adam was settling his tiny son onto lucys breast the tiny baby hadnt made a sound but his eyes were wide open wondering and now he stirred and wriggled skin against skin against his mothers breast without prompting adam carefully guided the little mouth to where it needed to be he found what he was looking for his tiny mouth centredand rileys grandson found his home and rileys world shifted once more he glanced up and saw pippas eyes filled with unshed tearsand maybe his were the same his grandson had arrived into his family his family it was almost midnight before they ate their fish and for all of them it was a truly memorable meal jason and amy cooked the fish pippa produced a salad riley found some chocolate biscuits you could spend thousands on a meal and not get better riley decided they were all out on the veranda the boys had lifted lucys settee lucy and all out where she could see the luminescence of moonlight off the ocean she ate her fish and her chocolate biscuitsshe was starving she had a little name discussion with adam then she snuggled down to sleep her baby beside her adam watched their baby as if it was only he who stood between his son and all the threats of a dangerous outside world adam had grown ten years in this afternoon riley thought hed make a good partner for his daughter hed be a soninlaw to be proud of part of a family to be proud of until the meal was ended there were things to do but now amy and jason were snoozing on the sun loungers soon theyd roll into bed both babies were asleep im going to the beach pippa said abruptly shed been carrying stuff into the kitchen now she came out and walked straight down the steps to the garden see you later he let her go he was feeling discombobulated his grandson was right beside him he was thirtyeight years old and he felt a hundred he was watching pippa in the moonlight she was wealthy english good family he was a guy from the wrong side of the tracks he was a guy whod had a kid at nineteen who was a grandpa at thirtyeight pippa reached the gate leading down to the beach and he realised with a shock that she was no longer wearing jeans she was wearing a sarong hed seen it before she wore it over swimmers youre not going swimming i wont go out of my depth what about nightfeeders ive painted my nails with antichew precautions r us you going to sit on the veranda for the rest of the night grandpa grandpa the word still had him stunned she chuckled she tossed her towel over her shoulder and she headed down the cliff path grandpa family pippa chapter twelve contrary to what shed told riley pippa had no faith at all in antichew she consequently had no intention at all to bathe in the ocean there was however a rock pool at the edge of the cove it was a naturally formed ring of rocks at high tide the waves washed over it meaning it was full of clear seawater at low tidenowthere was an almost eighteeninch rim of rock the pool was five feet deep at the most there was no way night feeders could get in it was safe and she needed to swim it had been one incredible day first mickey then lucys baby and watching riley his face had been changing all day it was like he was fighting some desperate internal war and he wasnt winning shed fallen in love with him how had she ever thought she could marry roger oh if she had she shuddered and dived into the rock pool the water was cooler than shed thought it would be fresh from the sea and she shuddered again she decided to swim and stop thinking the thoughts wouldnt stop riley could she stay on at whale cove if he didnt want her love hed made it plain that he didnt lucy was hauling him into family whether he liked it or not but to have a needy besotted nurse at his side as well its not going to happen she told herself and then she thought of how shed felt that morning on the rock clinging to mickey clinging to riley feeling like if she died now at least shed known riley at least shed had one night i want more nights she said out loud and started doing laps up and down the length of the rock pool she was tired to the bone but she also knew she wouldnt sleep she might as well exhaust herself properly what would she do she wanted to stay here she wanted to be part of this community this job but how much was the job and how much was riley tonight had been magic friends family kids babies barbecues at midnight no clear delineation between work and home saving mickey waving her fish from the helicopter loving riley she almost sobbed only it was hard to sob when she had her head down swimming hard she closed her eyes and let the darkness envelop her something touched her foot she pretty near had a palsy stroke a night feeder she whirled in the water to face whatever it was expecting teethand two hands landed on her shoulders holding her up rileys voice growled into the night i thought youd have learned your lesson about night swimming shed whirled too fast she had a mouthful of water she spluttered and choked and it took a couple of moments before she could breathe properly let alone reply but finally if id died of fright she said with as much dignity as she could musterwhich actually wasnt very dignified when she was still spluttering and when his nose was only inches from hersit would have been your fault no deaths today he said gently in a voice she didnt recognise only life first mickey then lucys baby how to answer that she fought for something innocuous something safe did did they decide what to call it she was practically gibbering it seems they thought of calling him riley riley told her gravely only theres a bit of a run on the name theyre moving to william instead i like william she said and then managed a tentative smile do you papa papa he said blankly papa or grandpa grandfather sir hmm you want to get ducked gotta be one she said recovering courage theres no getting away from the fact that youre a grandpa i dont think i want to get away he said and there was enough in that to give her pause you dont do family i havent done family you dont want i havent wanted until now she paused she was suddenly acutely aware that riley was holding her up they were in the deepest part of the pool he could stand up she couldnt she was at a disadvantage she needed to put her feet somewhere solid but riley was holding her and not letting her go i thought you might die he said almost conversationally and instead of moving to shallow water where a girl could set her legs down he swung her up into his arms today with mickey you risked your life and more than that it was me who asked you to you just did it and then tonight you delivered lucys son youve made amy happy youve made lucy happy you saved mickey wherever you go life follows and you know what ive been sweating on an accent and on money and on past history and they havent let me see whats before my eyes golly pippa said which ridiculous but she couldnt think of anything more sensible to say i dont think im that good and youre practical too riley said ignoring her interruption and she heard his smile from where she was she couldnt see his face she could feel though she was enjoying feeling she was starting to enjoy feeling very much indeed even at the cliff this afternoon he said almost conversationally i was worrying about mickey i was worrying about practicalities transport shock you even about dry clothesand suddenly you were organising fish you had your priorities free fish thats a woman in a million i thought and then you know what else i thought i thought i really want to kiss you really she said cautiously something inside her was starting to feel good really he tugged her higher then and he kissed her he was shoulder deep in water he was holding her hard and he was kissing her as she wanted to be kissed as she ought to be kissed a girl had a right to be kissed like this so so what she ventured when she could finally get a word in what made you think you might want to kiss me adam he said and jason that didnt make sense she waited hoping for an explanation and finally it came after the next kiss theyre sitting on my veranda like two smug old menfathers he told her and theyre looking at me like theyre sorry for me and you know what theyre right im sorry for me you dont sound very sorry thats because im planning he said i have a plan a plan im not exactly sure how i feel about you being rich youre not exactly poor shut up my love he said i need to tell it like it is okay she saidhappily now for how could she stop the wave of happiness engulfing her she had no intention of trying i love our house he said and she blinked our house this wasnt the sort of declaration shed been expecting its a great house she managed its a magnificent house and now youve decorated it i can do better given time thats just it im worried the hospital offered to sell it to me last year and they gave me a figure if the valuer sees it now with its curtains and its posters itll double in price im parsimonious just think of the extra fish and chips we can have if i buy the house now you want to buy the house i do he said because ive been thinking if i buy us a house no if i buy us a home then anything else is icing on the cake no matter what either of us earn no matter what you decide to do with your fortune my pride is catered for oh and i might want to start an amy nursingtraining scholarship fund as well but ive been thinking i might invite you to join me my pride could take that he smiled my pride might even enjoy it your pride she was still being cautious he was circling the issue she thought she thought she knew where he was heading but a girl had to make sure youre saying you want us to fund amyand you want us to stay being housemates no no well only so much as are you housemates when youre married married the word took her breath away if you want to be he said i want to marry you more than anything else in the worldbut its your call but why because i love you he said simply and he did set her down then moving so they were waist deep in water and he could take her hands and gaze down at her in the moonlight pippa this morning if id lost you i couldnt bear it i wont ever ask you to risk your life again of course you will she retorted diverted we both will its what we do we rescue people how about ourselves you mean she tried to think it through she was feeling so happy she felt like she was floating but she needed to make her fuzzy mind focus you rescue me and i rescue you right back thats the plan he said softly and surely in the moonlight thats the dream for as long as we both shall live that sounds extraordinary she whispered is that a yes she made herself pause she made herself consider once upon a time shed agreed to marry roger that had taken her years to decide and shed still made a mistake but riley she looked up into his lovely anxious face and all the answers all the years to come were written in his gaze he loved her from this day forth her riley but er a thought had occurred something important youre a grandpa she said suddenly astringent if youre a grandfather and i marry you i will not be granny ive thought about that too he said sounding suddenly smug just now when you called me papa you have ill be poppa he said i like it i know im young but the word has a certain cachet and youre pippa poppa and pippa a matching pair how about that for a plan oh riley is that a yes i believe it is she said i believe i love youpippa he said and i love youpoppa she murmured and he laughed and hugged her hardand then she wasnt able to say anything at all for a very long time and almost twelve months to the day to pippa and to riley one baby any minute now on the veranda of the house overlooking whale cove pippa crouched on a settee and moaned a lot she had the right jason and adam were in the back yard firing up the barbecue organising fish since saving mickey there always seemed to be fish arriving at this house the fishing community was big and the locals remembered for our doc and our pippa our pippa but riley wasnt noticing fish now lucy and amy were taking turns to coach jancey was in the background a woman had to have a professional there pippas fingers were clinging so hard to rileys that he might end up scarred but riley wasnt noticing his fingers either its coming amy said six months into nursing training she was already an expert pippa youre nearly there we can see the head lucy breathed hold her up dad so she can see for herself pippa one more push you can do it jancey said a monstrous regiment of women riley remembered the quote he almost grinned jancey and amy and lucyand at the centre his own wonderful pippa how had he ever thought but then push jancey ordered biggest one yet keep going again go girl you rock lucy amy hold pippa so riley can catch his baby he couldnt sit around thinking all day he had work to do he had to disengage those fingers push he told his beloved he kissed her hard and fast and then he put her into the care of lucy and amy her family his family and he moved to where he needed to be the head it was certainly coming push dont tell me what to do pippa yelled im pushing push harder im oooooohhhhhh and there she was sliding into the outside world caught by her father held like she was the most precious creature in the world his daughter what what amy and lucy were supporting pippa so she could to see her baby jancey stood back with a smile wide enough to split her face with this family what need for a midwife we have a daughter pippa murmured awed oh riley i have a sister lucy sniffed jubilant oh wait that means william has an aunt our familys getting bigger and bigger as it should riley managed so choked he could scarcely speak its perfect shes perfect and he moved carrying his brandnew daughter so that he could kiss his wife his pippa his love and as pippa cradled her newborn as he gathered her into his arms as he held her close and as they felt this new little life between them he accepted what he knew for sure we have the perfect family it might get bigger pippa whispered dazed he kissed her again and he smiled and looked up at the people around them a bigger family sounds great to me he told her just as long as you stay at its heart my pippa
