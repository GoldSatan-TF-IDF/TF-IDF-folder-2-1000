dewey lambdin the kings coat lewrie prologue in retrospect perhaps getting into his half sisters mutton was not the brightest idea that alan lewrie had ever had not he told himself later that it had been his idea at all belinda had been the initiator and he merely the recipient of her favors which were ample that she had been the object of desire for half the blades in london both old and young made it imperative that he try her at least once just for the sake of comparison much like a book critic would sample some gothick fright and flummery so he could say he had read it that half those blades had already preceded him really didnt bother alan after all belinda never dallied with anyone less than aristocratic unless one counted the odd stable boy ostler shop clerk tinker or tradesman who happened to be in the immediate vicinity when her blood was up and since lewrie knew half of them anyway he could be fairly sure she wasnt poxed admittedly he had suffered some pangs of concern that they were related but since he was a willoughby by blood if not by name they had submerged wherever guilt pangs go when faced directly against willoughby nature run shrieking for the nearest window he surmised to himself if they have any sense at all belinda was a fetching girl right enough an auburn beauty with creamy skin breasts that threatened to spill over her bodice and bold eyes for any man of comely proportions and being a willoughby hot as a pagan hindoo with the morals of a monkey alan was seventeen two years younger than she but already sure of his abilities to please at what he thought was the i prime sport of kings a wellknit young man of middling height who could turn heads at a ball or on the strand even without his macaroni clothing with the christmas season over and the city season pace dying down he had little to look forward to until spring and invitations to country houses and had wearied of maids and mopsqueezers it was looking to be a damned dull year until the last explosion of parties in spring so what could be more delightful than a dalliance at home where one did not have to brave the elements the mob mud dead cats and streets full of garbage or a shower of night soil from some window this wih cut down on my gambling debts and my clothing bills so everyone should be grateful he had been surprised that belinda would show interest in him at all since he was the younger adopted but natural son born out of wedlock usually referred to as that filthy little bastard by everyone including his father and belinda herself but suddenly instead of irritable toleration there had been a week or two of sultry looks some covert fondling seductive conversation and deep breathing that led up to this night when all the servants were out of the way gerald was off chasing fellow sodomites so he could scratch his particular form of willoughby itch sir hugo and his manservant morton were both away most likely drinking and wenching themselves into the gout again and no one to interfere alan had pinched a silk condom from sir hugos travelling kit half sister or not he was only fairly sure of her latest amours and had finally succumbed eagerly they were gloriously engaged and belinda was trying to emulate the sound of a pack of hounds after the fox had gone to earth when he thought he heard a scuffling noise in the hall which he thought damned odd odd enough to put him off stride which didnt seem to affect belindas squirmings and view halloo much he knew servants never came upstairs after dinner not if they knew what was good for them and everyone else would be away til dawn at the earliest then he heard the door latch snap open suffering christ he breathed his passion cooling precipitously belinda leave off quick she grappled him even tighter to her yelping aloud now her transports of joy turning into fullfledged yells which he took for dumb lust not now you silly mort someones here merciful father in heaven a voice quavered as the bed curtains parted with ajerk spilling candlelight on the scene alan gulped at the sight of their parish vicar now whats the amencurler doing here god is he up next with her belinda pitched into a screaming frenzy as alan disengaged and crawled away from the scene of the crime then he saw the others his brother gerald grinning wickedly his fathers catchfart morton who had a pistol in his fist his father even redder in the face than his usual brandyinduced hue exercising his thick fingers on a walking stick god help him even their family solicitor pilchard was there bringing up the rear and trying to peek over their shoulders for a better view of belindas charms as she screeched her way up a full octave your own sister the vicar appropriately shuddered you godless animal half sister alan corrected as coolly as he could clad only in a silk sheath condom and kneeling about as close to flagrante delicto as one could he raped me help belinda screamed ill see you hang for this sir hugo said advancing with the walking stick swishing the air rape hell alan shouted in defense thinking it a poor one even as he said it the jade was the one invited me lying hound sir hugo took a swing at alans head that barely missed the vicar and if alan had not gone flat on his back would have half beheaded him ill kill you for this you little bastard alan did the sensible thing at that point he ran he leaped from the bed and made for his clothes morton came for him but he was a wellfed slowcoach and alan had retrieved his breeches and was well on his way to freedom past mortons outstretched arms when sir hugos cane came down like a thunderbolt from on high and strock him on the shoulder which caused him to draw his length on the parquet there there girl the vicar pawed belindas bare anns and back and reluctantly allowed her to draw a sheet up over her magnificent young breasts youre safe from him now sir hugo got the toe of his shoe in spinning alan about on the bare boards like a top before he fetched up against a table which came down with a crash but allowed him space to rise belinda went into another paroxysm of wailing as the vicar slobbered over her vicar i swear before god this was not totally my doing alan shouted dodging about the room from morton and his father gerald and pilchard huddled in the doorway unwilling to get too involved but ready to form a blocking force i dont know you well and i doubt if you know this family well either but if you did take him morton his father said take him now the one safe road was not another lap of the room alan vaulted a table and dove back into the bed rolling to his feet by the vicar if you would only listen to me sir he begged belindas feet flew into action pummeling him around the groin and up against the quavering old churchman you you absalom the vicar finally managed to say just before hitting him inexpertly in the chin with a lean and birdlike fist it was enough however to put stars in his vision and brought with it the odd urge to sneeze as the others rounded the bed to lay hands on him he sank to the floor once more feeling the thump of the vicars foot slamming his ribs here thats not quite cricket he protested as he was jerked to his feet and hustled out of the room he got a chance to lay eyes on belinda once more and she was staring at him with a curious smile on her lips and a crinkle to her eyes the sort of smile he had seen her deliver to a particularly tasty stuffed goose at remove after she had had her fill and was quite satisfied damme whats this all about alan wondered groggily still smarting from the kick in the ribs from the otherwise saintly seeming reverend with his anus full of clothing he was hustled upstairs in mortons steely grasp i must beg your forgiveness for striking him sir hugo the vicar said gratefully accepting a brandy in the firstfloor study ive not raised a fist in anger since i was twelve but the utter audacity and cockawhoop gall of him quite overcame me i understand totally sir hugo said without humor perhaps if i had allowed my temper to break on him more often when he was young we would not be engaged as we are tonight you did not strap him as a child the vicar asked very rarely hes a thoroughly spoiled young man sir hugo said pouring himself a glass you are new to the parish so i must explain in my youth before i settled down from serving the king as a soldier i was more forward than most with the young ladies his mother was beautiful my first love a proper girl from a good family the vicar made agreeable cooing noises which sir hugo ignored before i went overseas she and i consummated our love for each other and then i lost touch with her my letters returned or never answered i was heartbroken sir hugo muttered looking only stem but not in the least heartbroken by the time i had returned and married someone else i discovered that she had borne me a son she had been turned out by her own family and had died little better than a prostitute and that boy a pitiful parish waif i could not refuse to own up to my sin could i father well to atone for all i took him in you see a heavy burden brought about by the lust of the flesh sir the vicar said now on familiar ground but a common one i am sad to say in these evil times in which we suffer before our admission to the higher reward yes sir hugo said as i was saying i took him in fed him clothed him sent him to the best schools and never could find the sternness in my heart necessary for his proper upbringing because of my guilt and shame of abandoning her even though she was too proud to tell me my second wife died leaving me the sole parent of three poor babes even then i could not raise a hand to him not after ruining his poor mother for being the one who caused her untimely death er which mother are we talking of the vicar dithered his mother father sir hugo snapped alan was the very image of her when he was a boy how could i strike him how could i deny him anything his heart desired he sank his face into his hands you poor fellow the vicar said patting him on the back god most assuredly is aware you tried sir hugo the vicar went on for we have all sinned not only by commission but by omission as well and come short of the glory of god any small act of contrition and amends is he is a rakehell sir hugo said shooting to his feet and going for the brandy decanter away from the vicars petting indeed a gambler a corinthian a brothel dandy and the bane of any pretty maid in london sir hugo went on with some heat he fought a duel so please you for his alleged honor brought comment on this family by his shocking conduct wasted my money to clothe him in that ridiculous macaroni fashion he was expelled from harrow sir merciful god the vicar gasped at this last revelation something about emulating the gunpowder plot and the governors privy i do not see him mending his way in future either god forgives all sir hugo even the most practiced sinner the vicar reminded him with a beatific smile and a brandy glass that was dryasdust on the bottom even the attempted rape of his own sister the rest i could live down but this belinda will be ruined what good man would have her even with her dowry and prospects how shall i face the world as the father of a boy doomed to be hanged like one of the filthy mob sir hugo filled the vicars glass and then threw himself into a facedown sulk behind his desk he waited for an answer but heard only the sound of sloshing and a moan of contenbnent from the vicar i mean to say how may i retain the good name of willoughby he prompted ah yes the poor young lady the vicar finally said not without a gleam coming to his watery eyes yes sir hugo prompted trying not to seem impatient transport him or send him to the country the vicar decided but the courts involved ah yes well the vicar shrugged and made free with the decanter on his own i shall of course disinherit him sir hugo announced ill not have him spend another moment under this roof as one of mine then it shall be up to him to succeed or fail under his own name he is not known by willoughby lewrie his mothers maiden name sir let me see some form of punishment or banishment that will not reflect on your own kith and kin remove him from the scene and make a man of him the vicar said i have it yes i know a captain in the royal navy sir hugo with this dreadfullittie rebellion going on in the american colonies one more young volunteer for service would not be looked on amiss the vicar fairly beamed and ship him out as a seaman sir hugo grinned in return heavens sir hugo be merciful at the last i beg you to be a midshipman is punishment enough but to be pent with the common rabble an educated young man raised as a gentleman besides there would be unfavorable comment if he stood out from his surroundings too well i suppose so sir hugo said unhappily so i shall have to buy him his kit and his commission as well i suppose not at all sir hugo the vicar assured him well he must have his kit but a commission in even a poor regiment is four times the cost of a willing captain i am sure my friend captain bevan can find your son a commander desperately in need of hands and midshipmen like much else in our times the zeal of the populace for naval service is akin to the lack of zeal for the true sense of christs teachings desperate enough to take even young alan fifty pounds in the right pocket in portsmouth could put him on any ship of the line preferably one going to foreign climes the farther the better and your friend can do this most assuredly sir hugo why i recall in my last parish there was a young widow with a son who was the vicar reddened at the memory that sir hugo thought touched a bit too close to home at any rate the fleet is full of young lads who are not exactly welcome at home shameful sir hugo said well please be so good as to have your nautical friend bevan did you say attend me as soon as he can and just to clear this up as a legal matter i wonder if i could prevail upon you to attest to what you witnessed this evening with my solicitor mister pilchard he is gathering statements in case we have to call the watch and have alan imprisoned should he prove to be intractable mosht happy to oblige you shir hugo the vicar said barely able to bring glass to lip any longer i shall not keep you longer shir hugo i believe we have all shuf suffered enough tonight indeed we have sir sir hugo nodded somberly sir hugo rose and bowed a courteous goodnight to the stumbling sermonizer as morton held the door for him and took him in charge to the parlor where pilchard waited sir hugo sat down and mused happily over his brandy it seemed an age before the wizened solicitor stuck his head around the door waving a sheet of vellum to dry the ink much like a flag of surrender to his masters temper is that sqdden hedgepriest gone just this minute sir hugo i saw him to the door myself pilchard grinned entering the room fully as sir hugo waved him forward he laid the document before his employer like a great trophy here it is sir hugo and considering his vulnerable state and the witnesses against him i anticipate no problem there excellent pilchard excellent everything is in order then all but young alans signature sir hugo i wish you to make an addition to this pilchard sir have a brandy and sit down for gods sake sir hugo ordered irritated at the outre deference his solicitor always showed him but secretly still pleased that he could engender that sort of deference pilchard obeyed the instructions and took a seat on a settee perched on the edge of the cushion with knees close together the vicar came up with a most interesting suggestion pilchard and a perfect excuse for alan not to be present when this matter comes to its fruition and that is sir hugo if i may inquire naval service pilchard naval service sir hugo boomed it with a hearty chuckle the boy is not come to his majority and is overseas preferably far overseas on the kings business when we enter the court write it up so that i am his guardian or whatever so that his signature which you assure me of gives me total control over everything he is due in the first instance and hang the rest of what you had planned but if he survives to return to england sir hugo he is then heir and can take you to court for all of it i believe he should sign away all claims as we initially laid out now what are the odds of a midshipman returning sir hugo stood to refill his glass off to the americas the fever islands or the east indies among all those pagan hindoos not good sir but not certain im afraid but no problem until the war is over at any rate he knows nothing now and can learn nothing thousands of miles away it strengthens our appearance does it not safeguarding the interests of my son as he fights for england his king oh shout harroo for england and st george and should he survive and return it will be much too late to do anything he is a clever little devil sir hugo god help me but i think he may tumble to it eventually that is then the second part the part you first suggested to me shall be a secret agreement between him and me obtainable for reasons you make clear and only the first part of the document concerning guardianship shall be presented in court surely that shall suffice i believe that would suit sir hugo though i still worry that asking him to put his name to so many documents will bring his suspicions up to the devil with his suspicions the means of removal has to come up from portsmouth so we shall let that little dammeboy stew in his own skin for a few days by that time i am sure he shall be most agreeable there was a soft knock on the door and belinda entered the room now dressed in high fashion and bearing a cloak hat and muff for an evening out she crossed to her father and planted a gentle kiss on his cheek he put an ann around her off are you lady margaret is giving a drum belinda said calmly now i shall be fashionably late for it did i do well father excellently well my girl and you shall share in my gratitude and munificence once this is behind us i never doubted it father she beamed then bade them both goodnight leaving sir hugo humming to himself and pilchard fidgeting as he thought upon his new documents form and content wheres the chamber pot then alan demanded as he was shoved into a dark and cheerless garret servants room at the back of the house criminals dont deserve none morton smirked im sure you know about criminals morton you were born one candles too and a bed an why not a bottle an some bird an a servant girl while youre askin young sir morton jibed back scandalous goins on i swear to heaven rapin your own sister and you the innocent babe just down from the country goddamn you fetch me light and some sort of bedding ill fetch yaa ticket to your own hangin and thats all you little bastard morton said shoving him back into the dark room with a horny fist and slamming the door yer not the high an mighty little buck the first head now are you young sir he crowed through the wood then laughed his way down to the landing and out of hearing there was a thin slit of light under the door which did little to banish the gloom of that tiny garret cell and alan sat down next to it arranging his coat over his knees and chest as a makeshift blanket now what the hell is this all about he pondered again now a bit more levelheaded than when the posse had broken in on him why should they all show up at the same time as if it were arranged there had though never been much sense in the household from the way sir hugo ran his own affairs to the way he allowed belinda and gerald to run riot with their own pleasures and interests sir hugo had never shown much discipline toward them or much affection either too far gone in his own cares ever to notice his children alan had come into the house a threeyearold waif in rags to a paradise of food and good clothing and the life of a moneyed scion of a great man or so it seemed quite a change from the parish poorhouse he had known since birth and the death of his mother at least theyd told him shed been poor and was dead he had been prepared to be grateful and loving but there had been a vast gulf that he could never bridge made of his fathers icy indifference by the time he was breeched and off to the first in a long succession of schools he had stopped trying to bridge the gulf and only took advantage of the mans largesse he had wanted for nothing had been allowed to run riot like the son of a titled lord with few warnings to correct his behavior and now suddenly this what in hell did i do he asked the darkness hopped onto my half sister well thats almost fashionable these days isnt it all the good families do it and without witnesses too now im on my way out because of it why he tried to think that he had crossed sir hugos interests in some way but could not think of any woman he had had that sir hugo wanted he wasnt exactly champion wasteful with money in fact he had a fair amount of his allowance hidden away since he had gotten his fingers burned gambling the year before and had lost his taste for the tables he had not purchased anything extravagant or at least nothing so extravagant that would make his father bite furniture over it gods balls he thought suddenly the old farts gone smash over some investment and im now expendable he cant afford to keep all of us and im only half a son not like gerald if im not careful ill end up some drudging clerk maybe someplace brutal and nasty like liverpool but why not just call me in and tell me im chucked he shivered with the cold and with his misery clamping his knees together to control his aching bladder and waited for the dawn soon too foxed by wine to keep his eyes open dreaming of revenge and triumph it was four days before alan was freed from his cold and gloomy garret prison to be brought down to the study he did not make a very pretty picture by then his light brown hair was lank about his face and his queue was loose he wore no neckstock and his fashionable white silk waistcoat all sprigged with red and blue flowers was crumpled from service as a pillow his silk stockings had ladders in them and his tightly cut grey blue satin suit looked more like a stained and bedraggled bad bargain from a ragpickers barrow on the way down he had seen gerald entertaining a strange man in the parlor by the fire the man swathed in a voluminous darkblue cape held open for warmth from the grate court official alan wondered or one of geralds lovers getting his equipment to room temperature but theres no sign of the charlies about no one seeming to be a member of the watch usually spavined oldsters with cudgels was in evidence and he considered that a reason for cheer god knew he needed some badly at that point he had fretted and pondered feverishly all the time of his confinement as to what last straw he had broken if any and what was to be his fate he was led to face his father who glowered at him from the study fireplace pilchard stood behind the writing desk with his most serious legal face on you know mister pilchard sir hugo began he has paid you out of trouble often enough in the past for you two to be good friends by now hasnt he well hasnt he suppose so sir alan meekly responded what could have possessed you sir hugo demanded you realize this isnt some country girl to be fobbed off with twenty pounds this is your own sister you tried to rape you are finished boy what rape alan shot back but shuddering cold inside not until that bible thumper stuck his beak in it wasnt rape youre facing a hanging offense sir hugo intoned but it wasnt rape she was the one that wanted to do it and i went along with it you know her nature surely whats worse i know yours sir hugo shot back then you know i wouldnt have to depend on rape the towns full of quim to be had without a bit of struggle that nature of yours could get you hanged alan sir hugo said you were caught in the act and we have witnesses and i can provide a platoon of witnesses for myself and for my dear sisters character as well ifit comes to that only if it comes to trial boy what is this just what do you want from me since when have you gotten so holy sir hugo and i that is we have come to what we believe to be a most salutary solution to the contretemps which you brought about by your unnatural act of forcible rape upon your sister pilchard said from behind the desk for the sake of your family we oh dont prose like a front bencher in parliament pilchard sir hugo said crossly going to the sideboard for an early morning brandy get to the meat of it you are to be banished pilchard summed up you may never more lay claim to the willoughby name never did you miserable ass pray allow me to continue young sir pilchard said wagging a finger at him you must go away for the familys best interests you can no longer reside under this roof in london or in england and it would be most inadvisable for you to return for obvious reasons youre raving alan blanched if you do not then we shall summon the watch and have you taken before the magistrate we have no choice sir hugo warned making happy sounds from the brandy decanter with his back to the show your sister is the one who wishes to prefer charges pilchard informed him while we wish to spare her reputation and the family reputation she has decided otherwise if this does go to court you would throw undying shame on your own family and it would most likely cost you your life at best commitment to bedlam as an uncontrollable lunatic do you understand the seriousness of what you have done alan was stunned into silence beginning to doubt his memories of the incident belinda wants to prosecute me shes a brainless whore no theres something here that isnt right the whole thing was astonishing too astonishing to be credited part of the shock to his system admittedly was the realization that he would have to give up his whole life even if he by acquiesence saved his mere existence there went the girls the money the parties his circle of friends and fellow roisterers all the pleasures of the worlds greatest city not to mention the perquisites of the moderate wealth of even a second son we have here an agreement which sir hugo hopes you have the wit to sign which will spare your family any further loss of reputation what reputation did you have in mind the good name of sir hellfire club over there my sister the open beard or my brother the buttfucking molly alan scoffed morton must have been in the room behind him all that time for alans arms were seized at the elbows and forced high behind his back bringing a yelp of pain and surprise from him as he was forced into a halfcrouch to the floor i hope youre enjoying this you butchers dog alan managed to get out between clenched teeth i am sir morton whispered into his ear an about time too let me tell ya now listen to me you little bastard sir hugo said leaning over the edge of the desk so he could stare into alans face what we want from you is for you to be gone and we dont want any public trial so there wont be one youll have to leave the city and the country but youll be alive and with some money in hand to spend on your beastly habits my beastly habits what about yours oww alan went to his knees as morton applied more pressure i suppose you want me to admit to a rape i didnt commit too not at all pilchard said you merely have to sign this and go im as good as knackered right now he told himself sadly i havent a hope in hell of fighting this whatever it is father alan asked as sweetly as he could under the circumstances just why is this necessary was i any bigger a sinner than the rest of us have i cost you more money than belinda does she spends more on the strand in a day than i do in a month and half of london knows all about gerald last time he went to bath he was lucky to escape alive im not going to inherit anyway so why are you doing this lets put our contrite face on now laddy he told himself mabe i can wheedle free yet i beg you father he said with emotion dont disown me like this dont turn me out from the moment you pulled me out of that parish orphanage and claimed me as yours i have been full of gratitude and love for you dont abuse my wit boy sir hugo said you love your purse and your gut and your prick but i doubt this sudden affection for me we cannot keep you around after this and you know it well it was worth a try alan sighed heavily old bastard knows me too well ive had it urn you mentioned money alan asked at this sir hugo smiled and waved a signal to morton to relent his hold so alan could rise to his feet just how much did you have in mind fifty pounds per annum pilchard said thats four pounds three shillings a month alan quickly figured in his head this is ludicrous i spend more than that in a week and thats with food and lodging all found even in some hogswallow of a village in the north id starve to death not to mention being bored absolutely shitless i want a hundred alan stated testing the waters youre mad raving his father sneered for whatever reasons you have you want me gone alan told him resigned to his fate but anxious to get some of his own back if youre broke and have to sell up say so but why go to this ridiculous charade you dont want this to go to trial so there must be some blunt in it for you somewhere i want some of it if theres any to be had i dont know anywhere a gentleman can live for less than three hundred pounds a year so consider this a bargain price gone smash have i sir hugo laughed is that what you think the thought had crossed my mind youre going because you are despicable and ill not have the willoughby name tied to anything scandalous as if it isnt already alan muttered gentlemens vices discreetly handled as befits a gentleman not like the git of a twopenny tart who shows the dirt of the gutter every time he opens his lips and you want to go as a gentleman damn what you want damned right i do alright alan his father relented suddenly turning so mild alan was immediately put on his guard for some highhanded move one hundred pounds a year on certain conditions in that case make it guineas alan scowled leery his father tried to stare him down alan didnt back down sir hugo finally nodded his assent pilchard began to scribble on the document on the desk muttering to himself as he found room to add the amount which gave alan satisfaction pilchard presented his amended work to sir hugo who nodded his approval now sign the damned thing and get your guineas alan was released from mortons grasp to free his arms and took the excuse of massaging feeling back into his arms to take the time to read the document looking for traps and pitfalls no more claim to being a willoughby thats no loss is it out on my bare arse with one hundred guineas a year remittance i still think hes gone smash i was down for five hundred per annum last time i snuck a look at the will leave the city leave england i wasnt expecting much more if the old bastard had dropped to hell anyway second sons cant expect much and god knows gerald wouldnt give me a dilberry off his fundament much less a rouleau of guineas once the old boy croaked what hulloh here whats this bit about mothers estate he asked she didnt have one did she she died penniless you said that is a legal form only pilchard said primly now i see you never told me anything about her except she was pretty and dead her people have money do they and just what estate do you think a bawd could leave her bastard when she was doing it upright in doorways just before she died sir hugo sneered which was something he was right good at explain it to him pilchard yes explain it to me mister pilchard miss elizabeths parents are still alive pilchard began if alan had had eyes for his father at that point he would have been amazed to see eyebrows climb for heaven they are desperately poor wretches but still with us they have for many years tried to find someone to take them to court to sue sir hugo for support knmving that he bad taken you in we sent them fifty pounds per annum to keep them satisfied we do not wish to have them known as part of the family or you he did not add that alan could be considered an heir through his mothers side to spare gerald and belinda any legal difficulties upon their inheritance we included this clause you shall receive your hundred guineas as they get their money as long as you live for much the same reasons better i had left you in your squalor than claim you as mine in the parish register sir hugo busied himself pouring another morning brandy its all a formality to spare us your presence in future thats it now sign the damned thing and be quick about it before i lose my patience and summon the watch and to hell with the willoughby name alan quickly read to the bottom of the long page noting that his father was still to be his guardian though he was banished much like what some of alans wilder friends had faced exile and frigid relations much like living under the old farts roof and what do i do after i sign have you arranged that too overseas would be best who pays my way and what do i do once i get there pilchard sir hugo snapped turning his back on things to make your disappearance from society credible and without throwing any light on this despicable incident we could not have you transported or prenticed without comment being made thank bloody christ for that anyway and im to go as a gentleman alan pressed uneasy still yes but as a lewrie not a willoughby the solicitor told him right its the anny for me this is going to cost him dear an ensigns commission must go for at least four hundred pounds nowadays even in a poor regiment to buy my colors and my kit will have to cost nigh a thousand pounds that meant most likely that he would soon be in the american colonies facing constant danger from red indians and lawless rebels but there was a chmice he could prosper he could ride well he could fence hed already dueled once and won handily and he was a crack shot at game with one hundred guineas in addition to his anny pay he could get by barely certainly they would not choose a fashionable regiment for him so he would not have to worry about high mess bills besides there were damned few fashionable regiments fighting the war they were still parading and wenching at home as a soldier a gentleman ensign he could still carouse with a pack of young bucks as much as he pleased very well he said carefully if you foot the bill for my kit and my commission he was delighted to see the involuntary responses from both his father and pilchard what a discovering little slyboots i am to see to the heart of it he told himself oh we shall indeed his father agreed alan leaned over the desk and took the prof erred quill from pilchards outstretched hand he signed his name to the document and stood back up waiting while pilchard sanded the wet ink and glared at him in a prissy satisfied way when sir hugo smiled broadly alan was filled with a sudden foreboding well i wish to express my gratitude for all youve done for me father up til now mind piss on your thanks boy need me anymore no well i shall go pack then that has been done for you sir hugo told him youll not spend another hour under my roof you will surely give time to gather a few keepsakes that has been done as well including your hidden money i am sure there wont be a dry eye in drury lane when word gets out youve gone your wastrel friends will think you all brave and noble quite unlike you but we have to maintain appearances you were born a low bastard in a knocking shop but thankfully youre no longer my bastard to worry about once you leave here youre welcome to go to hell in your own way as are you father and what regiment am i due for regiment oh yes morton have that captain bevan come up would you the mysterious guest that alan had seen by the parlor fireplace entered the room a moment later no longer tented by his dark blue cape the stranger wore white breeches and waistcoat a dark blue coat with white turnbacks at cuff and collar trimmed heavily in gold with gold buttons that bore fouled anchors the navy alan was suddenly aware of what waited for him sweet jesus no not the bloody navy id id sooner go to ireland even bedlam i am so pleased by your reaction captain bevan shall take you to portsmouth where you shall enter the kings service as a midshipman a gentleman volunteer he shall supervise the purchase of your kit and see you into a suitable vessel you are now under kings regulations and the articles of war boy captain bevan told him desertion from my custody is a hanging offense to prevent that i have brought my coxswain with me that petty officer stood in the doorway a solid block of lowbrowed elephantine muscle with a devilish black expression on his face he wore a brace of imposing pistols in the waistband of his loose striped sailors trousers and a heavy cutlass hung on a baldric over his shoulder his hands dangled loose near enough to draw his personal choice at a moments notice and while he might appear slow to make up his mind just which instrument he preferred under a particular circumstance once committed he appeared altogether competent and you call me a bastard alan shook his head damn em all to hell theyll sit on me all the way to portsmouth probably some chink in it for them too i am so well and truly fucked ah well nothing for it but to go game father its farewell then alan said manfully and you have my most sincere wish that you rot in hell as soon as possible morton took him by the arms again and began to hustle him into the tender custody of the navy give my regards to belinda too alan called out have you not tried her already youll find her a right shortheeled wench and a most obliging sort of girl alan saw a look cross his fathers face and had to laugh in spite of the circumstances by god i believe you already have shameless come on you captain bevan ordered ill pay you all back you know alan threatened as the coxswain took charge of him at the door with huge hard hands you and belinda and gerald and that pettifogger pilchard and your brainless helpmeet morton gerald was waiting at the base of the stairs pleased with the world do us all proud at sea wont you alan dear dont bother to write though my brother captain bevan alan said by way of a hasty introduction sews his own dresses and whats the naval term he goes in for the windward passage god rot you too gerald i hope to see you in the stocks for buggery one day you poxy sodomite there was no servant present in the front hall just a valise and his cloak and hat awaiting him a much too smail tricorne trimmed in white lace and adorned with a long feather it was jammed onto his head but without his usual tall oversize wig it came off once they were in the street have you no shame bevan demanded comport yourself quietly into the coach for your own sake if not for your poor familys then have your trained bear let go of me he shrugged himself into his coat and cloak picked up his fallen hat and entered the coach the coxswain got in and sat across from him my names beii the man announced in a deep rumble do you really believe i give a damn what your name is give me an excuse ta cut yer nutmegs awrf boy ya sing small wi me an sit quiet er ya wont live ta sign aboard a ship take your choice young un captain bevan said seating himself next to his coxswain and sweeping back his cloak to reveal a pair of small pistols in his waistcoat go a gentleman or suffer the consequences i shall keep that in mind thank you captain bevan alan replied archly wrapping his cloak closer about him even a windy and wet january morning could not explain the sudden coldness he felt as their coach rattled off to rendezvous with the dilly for portsmouth chapter a sullen icy wind blew across the kings stairs in the city of portsmouth as midshipman alan lewrie waited for the boat to fetch him out to his ship the sixtyfourgun rd rate ariadne many naval vessels tossed and gyrated on the heaving grey green harbor waters and alan swallowed hard and became a touch ill just watching them he was also still in a mild form of shock over his fall from grace and his sudden banishment from one moment of being a buck of the first head and caterwauling with his friends allover london chasing women eating and drinking his fill gambling and playing and with little thought for the morrow to this seaborne exile was just too hellish a wrench the trip down had been rough bad roads and bad company with both bell and bevan eyeing him like hawks even a bath and a shave at the inn had not revived his spirits there had been no chance to escape to listen to bevan it wasnt that bad a fate to go to sea and over the past few days the terror of it had slipped away he would be a midshipman not a common sailor a junior petty officer with authority carried on the ships books as a gentleman berthed with others of his kind with servants and stewards to care for his clothing and his table bevan had told him about prize money and how some ships crews had become rich beyond measure and how midshipmen took a larger share of how fellows much like himself had gone on to fame and fortune and had set themselves up as great men once they came home and during the process of buying his kit alan had reveled in a form of revenge on sir hugo bevan had a letter of credit from his fatherhe did not strike alan as the sort one would trust with a full purseand since it wasnt bevans money they ended as confederates in spending it properly six full uniforms three of them the best the town could boast more silk and linen shirts than anyone could need silk and cotton stockings breeches and working rig slop trousers personal stores of extra fine biscuit jam tea paper and the proper set of books such as the latest edition of falconers marine dictionary alan was sure that even a royal bastard could not make a finer showing and secretly he thought he looked especially handsome in the uniform even if it was on the plain side there had been a saucy darkhaired chambermaid at the inn that had thought so too his last evening ashore after a dinner that had filled him to bursting two bottles of claret and several brandies he had gone to his room to discover her ready to turn his bed down for the evening and fetch a warming pan when he suggested she warm it instead she was out of her sack and stays in a heartbeat thankfully bell relented and stood guard on the door and not in the room with him showing some mercy to him on his last free night he had no civilian clothing anymore so he could not have run away like a condemned man he had eaten a hearty meal and had bulled her allover the room until the sky was grey both bell and bevan had been tactfully silent after he had washed up and joined them for breakfast much like executioners who had the good grace not to crack jokes at the wrong time the girls sendoff all the drink and little sleep had damned near killed him and a cold breakfast had almost finished the job and still gave notice of trying i am in no shape to do this he said to bell who took no notice and there was the boat from his ship approaching fast here you bell said behind him to a waiting bargee help the gemmun with his chest the sense of shock was gone also the hope of escape and alans passing interest in prize money and uniforms and little revenge faded as reality approached here was the end of one life and the beginning of another that felt much like penal servitude had he not heard or read somewhere that the navy was like a prison in which one had the chance to drown bell i have money he said turning to the coxswain tuppencell do for the bargee sir no i mean lewrie hinted tipping a wink best do it like a man bell scowled sir alan shrugged and tramped down to the boat at the foot of the stairs one man held it to shore with a boat hook while eight more sat with their oars held aloft like lances there was a boy by the tiller a midshipman of perhaps fifteen hurry it up will you he called our first lieutenants watching well get in the goddamned boat we wont bite you yet alan stumbled across the gunwale and sat in the boat at the stem by the boy who had addressed him while two of the oarsmen took hold of his chest and placed it in the bottom of the boat with a loud thump alan flipped a coin to the waiting bargee shove off bowman the boy at the tiller said out oars backwater larboard give us some way starboard alan looked up at bell who spat in the water as he waved him a sardonic farewell alan sighed and turned to look at the men in the boat with him the nearest oarsmen were both tanned a dark brown with skin as wrinkled as a discarded pair of gloves they also sported impressive scars which stood out like chalk marks on their arms and faces give way all the boy called stroke damn yer eyes or ill see someones back laid open for shirking that could cheer me up alan told himself not like a hanging but possibly entertaining he turned to look at the tiller man of his version of charons ferry and marked him down for a brutal little git of a type he was familiar with from harrow and sundry other schools from which he had been expelled a right bastard made even worse with power over fags and new boys at least once he was aboard ship he would have the same power as if he had been made prefect over a whole shipload of fags but the men in the boat didnt look like the pinkcheeked little victims he had bullied in the past neither did they look like the popular illustrations of jolly jacks and true blue hearts of oak in fact they resembled more last sessions dock at the assizes surly uncouth and dangerous brutes the gutter sweepings from the worst parts of the city cutthroats and cutpurses he normally wouldnt give way for unless they were the pimps he knew these men looked like the sort who would do him in for a little light entertainment and that brought him fullcircle to the dicey situation in his belly god it cant be sick already the tiller boy crowed oh hold your tongue alan snapped making sure to keep his own mouth as tightly sealed as possible so thats the way youll be milord the boy said with a cruel laugh well youll sing a different tune when were at sea that i promise you i said row you damned sluggards within minutes they were close to ariadne and steering for its starboard side it seemed immense to alans eyes much like a country house on a large estate unfortunately a country house that seemed to bob and roll with a life of its own the bowman grappled them to the side with his boat hook by the mainmast chains up you go my booby the boy said up there how lewrie gawped jump onto the battens grab hold of the manropes and climb to the entry port alan perceived a ladder of sorts made of wooden strips set into the hull much like a set of shelves with red baizecovered rope strung through the outer ends to make a most shallow sort of banister rail this led upwards from the waterline following the broad curve of the hull along the tumblehome to anornate open gate cut into the ships side very far overhead cant they drop a chair or something alan asked god ill be killed if i try to climb that ill bet this is some kind of nautical humbug they pull on the newlies you in the boat get a move on a voice shouted down through a brass speaking trumpet which appeared over the rail then withdrew alan realized there was nothing for it but to go he got to his feet shakily as the boat rocked and rolled and bumped against the heaving ship hellishlively which made him swoon he was also not a swimmer and feared the grey water a seaman offered a hand and shoulder to steady him as he put a foot on the gunwale of the boat he waited for the two craft to get in harmony then leaped for the ladder but his foot pushed the gunwale down and the ship rolled to starboard as be fought madjy for a grip on the sodden manropes and slick battens clinging in terror he was dunked chest deep in the freezing water and screeched an obscenity also catching a solid whack in his back from the side of the rowing boat as the ship rolled back upright alan scrambled for his very life and arrived through the entry port with his teeth chattering there was a hearty general round of laughter at his arrival which didnt do his composure much good either well a person who appeared to be some sort of officer demanded hands on his hips and his chin out almost in alans face sorry about that must have misjudged my timing alan said is there a place i could change its devilish cold youll doff your hat to me the officer was within an inch of his nose youll say sir to me and report yourself aboard this ship properly or ill shove your ignorant arse back for the fish to gawk at you simple fucking farmer alan stared at him for a second shocked to his core that anyone could yell at him in such a manner and with such filthy language not that he was above using it himself and prided himself on being a true englishman when occasion demanded harsh words but to be the recipient was much like his recent cold bath his lips trembled as he desperately tried to remember what captain bevan had instructed him to say m mid midshipman alan lewrie he finally said come aboard to join sir he raised and doffed the cocked hat he wore you are a young one aint you now the officer said what a codshead you ll never shit a seamans turd is that required alan stammered instantly regretting it the officer stared at him with eyes as blared as a firstsaddled colt unable to believe what he had heard bosun a round dozen of yer best for this idiot i believe mister harm that if the midshipman has just corne aboard to join then he is not on ships books and is not yet subject to punishment another officer said after stifling his laughter thank bloody christ alan thought wildly that dozen of the best didnt sound like a round of drinks goddarnn you youll get your ass flayed raw before the days out if ive any say in it the officer so appropriately named harm said ive my eye on you from here on out little man yes sir alan replied galled to give this screeching parrot any sort of courtesy but thinking it might mollify him thats aye aye sir harm said but sauntered off sufferin jesus alan whispered sadly still standing at a loose sort of attention and doffing his hat you are a bit old to be joining arent you the second officer asked why you must be all of eighteen s seventeen sir alan said between chattering teeth what were your parents thinking of to wait so late my father he did not agree with my choice sir alan said thinking his reception could get worse if they knew his real reason for being there or the fact that if he could get a good knockdown price he would sell the ship for his freedom and care less if the crew was carried off in a turks galley newlies usually go to the gun room but youre too old for that might be the orop for you with the older midshipmen the orlop alan replied trying the new word on for size he peeked about the deck to see if he could spot one gods teeth what a prize booby you are i cannot wait until captain bales sees his latest acquisition youll need dry clothing mister rolston aye aye sir said the grinning imp who had ferried him out to the ship show mister lewrie below to the gun room and see he gets into dry things and the proper hat soon as youre presentable lewrie get back up to the quarterdeck and well take you to the first lieutenant mister swift so you can be properly entered in ships books by the way i am lieutenant kenyon the second officer how do you do sir lewrie asked offering a civilian hand dh god kenyon said as alan dropped his hand and doffed his hat once more yes i expect you shall be most entertaining for us now get below he allowed himself to be led below from the gangway to the waist of the ship while a pigtailed seaman named fowles staggered along behind with his chest suffering in silence he staggered down a steep double set of stairs to the lower gun deck a dank and dimly lit and groaning place full of guns mess tables stools thick supporting beams and the columnlike masts glims in paper holders shed light on hundreds of men and doxies and quite a few children scampering about it was more like a debtors prison than a ship rolston led him aft to an area which was screened off from the rest of the gun deck by halfpartitions and filled with chests and tables this is the gun room rolston told him the master gunner mister tencher and his mates berth here along with the junior midshipmen you can stow your chest along one of the screens and itll be your seat and youll sleep in a hammock instead of your soft little feather bed i trust it will be up to milords usual standards the smell of cooking grease some foul egestion wafting aloft from the bilges the fug of damp wool and unwashed bodies was fit to make him gag but he forbore manfully it is not st jamess alan drawled acidly turning to look rolston up and down but good enough for some i shouldnt wonder youll not last long in this ship with your snotty damned city ways lewrie just you wait til his tirade was interrupted by the arrival of fowles with the heavy sea chest but as the ship groaned and creaked into another roll fowles staggered and performed a shaky dance to waddle past them bump rolston and crash to the deck atop the chest almost on rolstons shoes you clumsy fool rolston slapped the man on the arms and chest in anger you did that on purpose ill see you on charge for it laying hands on an officer for starters beg pardon sir fowles yelped sorry sir alan saw real fear in the man and was amazed that a grown man of nearly fourteen stone could be so bullied by a mere boy in a blue coat it wasnt his fault lewrie said wishing they would all go away and let him be as ill as he wished the ship rolled heavily thankee sir fowles said knuckling his forehead gratefully i were clumsy sir but meant no harm sir thats all fellow you may go alan told him fowles ducked out like a shot leaving rolston blazing goddamn you lewrie dont interfere like that again or ill make it hard on you you alan said buss my blind cheeks turkey cock pigeons could sit on your shoulder and eat seeds out of your arse hopo mythumb now go push on a rope or whatever before i decide to hurt you they faced each other for a moment one frailer boy whose voice had not broken completely arms akimbo and chin out like lieutenant harm the other broader shouldered and mansized coolly amused yet at the same time threatening rolston was the one to finally give way with a petulant noise he whirled about and fled the compartment utterly frustrated once he was gone lewrie sank down onto the nearest sea chest and began to strip off his wet clothing he unlocked his own and dug down for dry breeches and stockings not forgetting to pack away his cocked hat in its japanned box and fetch out the boyish round hat he had hoped not to wear once dry and in fresh togs he succumbed to misery letting go a moan of despair and sickness he clapped a hand to his mouth what the hell are you then a drinkgraveled voice asked a new midshipman should have knownlook at yerchest all on top an nothin handy whats yer name boy lewrie alan said ready to spew what are you mister tencher master gunner youll say sir to me or ill have you kissin the gunners daughter before youre a day older you want me to kiss your daughter alan wondered aloud she must be a real dirtypuzzle ifhe meant it as a threat are you that ignorant ive a feelin you and the gunners daughter will be great friends right soon not right now if you please im feeling a bit ill at the moment sir youve a sense of humor anyway sick eh had your breakfast then oh for gods sake alan mumbled feeling his bile rise biscuit n burgooll fix you right up tencher grinned where might oneoo need to shit through your teeth try it in this bucket once empty tencher had prescribed his own version of nostrum a hot rom toddy and a turn about the decks in the frigid january air lewrie choked down the rom and staggered topside he had to admit it worked after an hour no one gaped at his pallor any longer he was icecold down to his bones but the cold had a reviving effect as did the occasional splash of salt spray that plumed off the wave tops and smacked him in the face once free of immediate distress he began to take note of his surroundings and it was aweinspiring to see all the miles of rope that made up the maze of rigging coiled on the decks on rails all leading upward to the masts that swayed back and forth over his head all the blocks and all the ordered clutter of the guns and their own ropes and blocks and tackles it was all so overwhelming so confusing that he didnt think he could ever even begin to discover what each did much less become competent in the use of such a spider web his physical unease became lost in his anxiety over how he had been received so far and his nagging fear that not only was he stuck in the navy for the duration of the war but possibly for life what career could he undertake after this and if it was to be his career he had a sneaking suspicion that most likely he would be a total miserable failure at it what a terrible shitten life this is going to be he brooded and ive made such a terrible start on my first day suddenly he jerked to a halt in his perambulations about the deck had not kenyon told him to come back right after he was dressed to see the ships first lieutenant and was that perhaps a whole hour or better ago oh damn me theyll beat me crippled he turned to dash aft toward the quarterdeck where he had seen officers but before he could shrill whistles began to blow some sort of complicated warbling call and the ship became alive with running men thats it theyre going to hang me as soon as they catch me he felt a tugging on his sleeve and looked down to behold a very young midshipman a mere babe of about twelve you must be our newly the tiny apparition said im beckett better get in line with us captains coming offshore so then what happens alan asked wondering for his safety eager for a place to hide get in line here with the rest of us i told you down here you by height between me and ashburn a very oldlooking midshipman told him he had to be twenty if he was a day alan shouldered between him and a very elegantly turned out midshipman if such a thing was possible in their plain uniforms the other boy was about eighteen handsome with grey eyes and a noble face im keith ashburn the youth whispered thats chapman our senior alan lewrie he said then there was no time for more talk as all the officers turned up in their blue and gold and white their swords glistening there were marines in red coats and white crossbelts slapping their muskets about their sergeants holding halfpikes and two officers one very young lieutenant with a baby face and one very lean and dashinglooking captain of marines who resembled a sheathed razor such members of the crew also appeared that were not below out of discipline boat ahoy someone called down to the gig and the answering shout came back ariadne meaning that the captain was in the boat after a few moments the marines presented their muskets and the officers presented swords while the bosuns pipes shrilled some complicated lieder that lewrie found most annoying a bulky man in the uniform of a postcaptain came slowly through the entry port and briefly doffed his hat to ships company god what a face alan thought looks like a pit bulldog i once lost money on the captain of ariadne was in his late forties a gotchbellied man with very thin and short legs he wore his own hair clubbed back into a massive grey queue and his eyebrows seemed to have a life of their own and danced like bats wings in the breeze dismiss the hands mister swift the captain said aye aye sir ships company on hats dismiss you there the new midshipman come here bales thundered yes sir you are lewrie i am sir come aboard to join sir then why have you not reported to me and youve already been inboard half the morning the first lieutenant swift said he was a reedy thoroughly sourlooking man with a permanent scowl on his dark face i shall see you in my cabin directly mister lewrie after i have conferred with mister swift following that you will not tarry about signing on board in a proper fashion yes sir alan replied crisply as he could but secretly terrified that he was about to catch pluperfect hell and for gods sake lewrie the proper form is aye aye sir captain bales said petulantly try it will you even the marines do so aye aye sir alan said turning red the captain turned to go aft but the first lieutenant took alan by the ann and shook him like a firsttenn student salute and show the captain respect goddamn you alan doffed his hat and threw in another one of those meaningless aye aye sirs ready to weep after they had gone and the other midshipmen who had witnessed his ignorance had finished laughing and had gone below alan turned and staggered to the rail to look out at the shore which was rising and falling in a regular pace alongside the petulant anger of a spoiled young man who had been humiliated before his new peers like the merest toddler he felt such a rush of selfpity that he could not control his face screwing up in a flushed grimace or hold back for long the acidhot tears that threatened to explode his eyes how could he stand this he wondered how could he survive all the hateful abuse the wicked laughter at his ignorance about a career he would never have chosen in a million years how tempting that shore looked where people safely ate and drank and slept snug at night with never a care for this sort of misery he contemplated finding a way to run away from all this no matter what the consequences he thought of killing himself his death flinging shame on his family forever besides suicide was damned fashionable these dayseverybody did it but then who would care if he died a few of his friends and a girl or two might sigh over his coffin but most of london would most likely feel a sense of relief that was no way to go he shoved his hands in his breeches pockets to warm them and leaned on the solid oak bulwark growing angry and snuffling away his tears there was no escapethis was his life now and he would have to make the best of it he could until he found a way to get out and get even ill make you pay for this you filthy old bastard he told the harbor waters ill find a way to break you and pilchard and belinda and gerald and morton and even that damned vicar ill make all you shits pay you want me to die let the navy kill me for you but i wont do it ill be back lewrie lieutenant kenyon said behind him making him leap away from the railing and spin to face him aye aye sir alan sniffled stained with tears but his face hot with anger young gentlemen do not ever lean on the railings nor do they ever put their hands in their pockets aye aye sir you had better go aft to the captains cabins and be ready for your interview kenyon said what can i do to avoid making even more of an ass of myself sir alan asked him though i cant imagine doing worse than now follow me kenyon said as they walked aft he told him to be sure to salute to remove his hat once in the cabin to speak direct and not prose on and to remember to salute before he left alan mopped his face with a handkerchief after they had passed the wheel and entered the passage under the poop deck that led to the captains quarters kenyon pointed out the first lieutenants cabin on one side and the sailing masters on the other they stood by the ramrod straight marine sentry by the captains door until the first lieutenant emerged who be ye sir the marine asked midshipman lewrie to report to the captain kenyon said midshipman lewrie sah the sentry said at the top of his voice crashing the butt of his musket on the deck enter alan stepped through the door into a large set of cabins that spanned the entire width of the ship there was a dining room with some rather fine chairs table and sideboard to his right and a study to his left filled with charts and books and a large desk far aft there was a day cabin and another large desk before the stem windows lewrie strode up to the desk and his bulky captain seated behind it he tried to keep his balance as the ship groaned and rolled and pitched with a life of its own he came to a halt three paces from the desk hat under his arm and gulped down his alarm at the sight of the town swinging like a pendulum beyond the stern windows midshipman lewrie reporting sir lewrie my name is bales the captain frowned as though disappointed with his own name a captain bevan offered me your services as a midshipman ariadne is at present fitting out and so is shorthanded in prime seamen warrants idlers and waisters and midshipmen alan didnt think a reply was in order but he did nod to be expected in wartime bales continued so i looked on captain bevans offer quite favorably to get such a wellrecommended young man and ill bet someone slipped you some chink as well lewrie thought whats place for if you cant make money out of it then captain bevan hands me this letter from your family solicitor a mister pilchard of london bates gloomed god rot the jackanapes what sort of lying packet did he send oh god did he mention belinda he states that you have been sent to sea to make a man of you bales said sourly that you have been a wastrel a scamp and a rogue so you will understand if i feel that i have been handed a pig in a poke yes aye aye sir alan all but whimpered well i do not intend to allow you to be a bad bargain for me or for this ship or for the king lewrie bales said beggars cant be choosers especially in whats becoming an unpopular war we have to take what we can get by the press gang if necessary so consider yourself pressganged if you like but youre mine now this letter goes on to state that you were banished aye sir alan said hoping the reason was unknown and that you had to leave society bales said making society sound like an epithet was it a duel a young lady sir alan said pretending contrite apology with perhaps the hint of an illstarred affair darnme that sounded right good he told himself i said that devilish well pray god he eats it up like plum duff you may have noticed that we already have the dregs of the hulks and the debtors prisons perhaps next assize will flesh us out lewrie now we have you you know nothing of the sea do you no sir youd much mther be rantipoling about and playing balum rancum with some whores wouldnt you bales posed well frankly yes sir believe you me you shall know something of the sea before im done with you even if it kills you england needs her navy now more than ever i wouldnt count on our army to pull a drunk off its sister much less save the nation and the sea is a fine calling for a man i shall not allow you to abuse that calling may i be honest with you sir alan asked you had better not ever be anything else boy bales replied picking up a shiny pewter mug of something dark and aromatic i am indeed banished sir he began hoping he could win the man over he could charm when it was necessary there were even some addled old fools back in london who considered him a manly upright young gentleman i realize thatj know nothing sir and i shall endeavor to learn with all my heart if this is to be my life then how can i succeed without knowledge hmm and bales nodded studying him over the rim of the mug i tell you this lewrie if you apply even a tenth of yourself we can beat you into some sort of sailor we can do that with anyone aye sir saying it only once sounded a little more english to his ear saying it twice was like higgledypiggledy your mister pilchard goes on to state that you show some promise as a student some latin greek a little french mathematics had good tutors if you throw yourself wholeheartedly into your work and your studies you may make someone much better than your background suggests and your bottom wont get half as sore bales grinned i shall try sir alan responded heartily all but piping his eyes and breaking into a chorus of rule brittania yes bales said setting his mug down you are seventeen aye sir you are much too old for the gun room and i doubt if we want our younger midshipmen corrupted by any habits you might have picked up in london bales said almost mellowing toward him pity we did not get you sooner most midshipmen come aboard at ten or twelve and spend six years before being examined for a commission at least that is what master pepys laid down though it is not much followed in these times but since i doubt you have much influence with our lords commissioners of the admiralty well assume you have six years we will put you in the cockpit with the older midshipmen where you may pick up their knowledge the quicker with people closer to your own age when you see mister swift give him my compliments and that you shall shift your dunnage to the cockpit on the orlop damn theres that word again he thought aye sir bevan has given me your per annum allowance aye sir alan perked up a hundred guineas is quite a sumtoo much really i shall hold it for you and should you have any need for it you shall request of it through my clerk mister brail i have deducted five pounds for schooling with the sailing master and another five pounds for your initial mess charge as a midshipman you do not receive pay so i shall ration you to one pound ten shillings per month of your allowance that should be more than enough at sea aye sir not paid nobody told me that then be so good as to sign to that effect alan bent over the desk and placed his signature to a sheet of paper that banked his money and allowed the deductions that will be all for now mister lewrie aye aye sir dismissed alan saluted and got out quickly he stopped by the first officers door and knocked swift bade him enter ah lewrie ready to sign aboard now swift asked aye sir urn the captain presents his compliments and suggested that i be assigned to the cockpit on the orlop sir thought he would swift said presenting him a large bound book there were many names entered many with xs for mens marks here copy of the articles of war make sure you leam them i am assigning you to the lower gun deck should we go to quarters sailmaking stations shall be the mizzenmast for now brace tending will be on the poop with the afterguard i know it must be english he thought i can make a word out now and then see lieutenants roth or harm and get a copy of your quarter bills so you may memorize all the names of the hands in your larboard division and for the afterguard and lower gun deck especially your quartergunners and gun captains got all that if not now then i shall by morning sir dont be flip with me lewrie youll live to regret it aye aye sir alan said on his guard again thats all then dismissed get below about my luggage sir yes swift smiled almost pleasant for once could you give me some men to help carry it sir think it might be worth a penny for me lewrie swift asked oh i wouldnt presume take care of it yerself fer gods sake dismissed alan staggered out onto the quarterdeck glad to have escaped without a physical attack or something direr damme its hellishbad enough just being on this filthy ship do they have to be so hateful he looked about the quarterdeck but did not see anyone exactly menial it was inhabited by a few people in blue coats red waistcoats cocked hats and breeches it was only below the quarterdeck rail that he saw men in checked shirts and redandwhitestriped ticken trousers or short blue jackets some wearing flat tarred hats he descended to the ships waist into that stirring crowd of men determined to give as good as he had gotten lately lets see if this junior wammt power works he thought bracing the first man he saw you there whats your name bostwick sor the man replied startled and suddenly on his guard oim a larboard waister sor grab another hand and go down to the gun room i shall want my dunnage shifted to the orlop lewrie ordered hunting for the right words roight away sor the man nodded relieved that the new midshipman only wanted something trifling done here george bear a hand laddy had alan not followed them below closely he would have been lost they hoisted his heavy chest and he followed them back to the companionways down another ladder to the orlop deck and slightly aft to the cockpit if the gun room had been gloomy then the cockpit was the netherpit of the deepest darkest hell there were two deadlights of muscovy glass that let in weak beams of light from god knew where glims burned in paper holders here and there to relieve the darkness there was a long mess table with chests down both sides as furniture four minuscule cabins not much bigger than dogboxes were set two abeam the headroom between the thick beams that supported the lower gun deck over his head could not have been much over fiveandahalf feet there were several midshipmen lounging about obviously bored dressed anyoldhow the air was thick with the smell of pipe tobacco bilge odor sour clothing mildew salt tar and a generation of peasoup farts all in all it was a damned sight worse than harrow even on the worst days alan could remember the hands set his chest down with a crash at an open space near the far end of the table er beggin yer pardon sir the fellow known as george asked knuckling his brow does yer want me ter be yer ammockman sir am i being put on or does that mean what i think it does he wondered i heard the navy was a bunch of bum wallopers but i thought it was illegal keep yer togs all spiffylike sir george explained you already do for the wardroom jones the young midshipman named ashburn said lieutenants do not get dirty but midshipmen do youd have mister lewrie looking like a tag rag and bobtail in a week off with you now aye aye sir thank you mister ashburn lewrie said as soon as they were gone should i have tipped them something this drew a chorus of hoots and laughs from everyone christ no theyre more used to a ropes end on their fundaments one young man said looking up from a book he was trying to read in the light of a small candle lewrie peeled off his coat and hat and found a spare peg on which to hang them he also unfrogged his new dirk an especially showy one with an ivory grip and what the shopkeeper had assured him was a heavily gold plated lion pommel pretty little sticker ashburn idly commented anyone ever use one of these things for real or just prying open jam pots lewrie asked r d sooner have spent the money on a letter opener ashburn replied take off your neckcloth and make yourself to home pass that toddy down here before this newly gets his death thank you alan said getting comfortable on top of his chest arms resting on the scarred mess table let me do the honors ashburn said pouring a battered pewter mug full of steaming toddy the bookworm over there is harvey bascombe this is alan lewrie i believe bascombe is a total waste of time and doesnt even have a sister so hes not worth knowing hello thats chapman our senior midshipman ashburn said indicating the older man who alan had rubbed shoulders with on deck we all toe the line when chapman speaks dont we lads chapman was a carrothaired lout with not a sign of intelligence behind his eyes but seemed kindly lewrie got the idea that ashburn was japing the fellow with his comment a comment that went right over the mans head the mathematical genius over there with the slate is jemmy shirke do not trust his sums ever and never let him navigate any boat youre in young jemmy on the other hand has three sisters in suffolk all willing tits or so he tells us what a reception you got shirke said putting aside his slate and coming to the table to sit down next to lewrie were you really wandering about adrift without reporting to the first officer yes i got soaked coming aboard alan said feeling at his ease for the first time of the day had to go change what was your last ship chapman asked as he helped himself to the battered rum pot pouring a larger tankard than the others uhm there wasnt one alan had to admit you dont mean youre a true johnny newcome bascombe guffawed right in here with us practiced sinners shirke added not a whip jack much less a scaly fish now what got you here at your age from hard experience with the cruelty of youth and he had dished out his share of it so he ought to know he realized that he was in for a rough time if he did not establish some sort of standing in their order at once he was totally ignorant of their chosen trade while they could sport years of experience at sea lf knowledge could not help perhaps bravado could win the day letting them know that he was wise to their games and not to trifle with him much anyways it was a bit of a scandal really he said with a knowing leer there was a young lady i knew who turned up with a jackinthebox and all sorts of hell to pay for it when i refused her her brother came for me and i had to duel him everyone was happy i left and did you kill your man shirke sneered honor was satisfied she and her family werent alan told them cryptically next thing i knew i was buying my kit but youve never actually been to sea ashburn asked well no not until necessary alan said with a bluff smile i think this is going to be fun dont you bascombe grinned cunningly at the others and lewrie realized the game was blocked at both ends i dont think im going to enjoy the next few weeks chapter for nearly a month more ariadne heaved and tugged at her anchor while the business of commissioning continued warrants were put aboard by the various navy boards powder and shot came aboard to be stowed below sewn up into cartridge bags the holds were filled with new casks for fresh water barrels of saltpork and saltbeef barrels of rum tobacco pursers supplies slop clothing large bags of ships biscuit galley implements muskets cutlasses boarding pikes miles more of cordage for spare anchor and towing lines standing rigging and running riggingall the needs of a ship of war that would allow her to be free of the land for months at a time more hands were recruited most willingly but some gathered in by the pressgangs and allotted to the vessels in harbor in need of men a few at a time for alan it was a time of learning he was not going to be allowed ashore and the ship had no amusements other than reading so he read mostly his falconers and if the descriptions seemed vague or made no sense then he found practical examples in the ship he learned the names of the sails and masts how they and their yards were raised and lowered he found out what most of the running rigging did tracing lines from pin rails to blocks to where they were terminated aloft he prowled the length of the ship plumbing secrets of cable tiers carpenters walks bread rooms spirit rooms where the surgeon plied his trade where the firewood was kept he learned a bit about how ariadne was constructed from the carpenter he learned how to actually sleep in a hammock at night and how to wrap it up in the required seven turns so it would be snug enough to pass through the ring measure each morning and be stowed along the nettings on the bulwarks he also learned how to tell if one of his mess mates had taken liberties with how it was slung one fall had been enough as well as one good blow on the ears that had left shirke sneezing ellison the sailing master loaned him a book on trigonometry so he could get a head start on solving navigational problems at the least learning how to handle the numbers obtained from the daily sights theyd take once at sea it was indeed fortunate that he had not joined a ship ready to go to sea safe in harbor or fairly so and with none of the daily activity of working the ship to be done in his first few weeks he had a chance to pick up enough knowledge without killing himself in the process and he was spared most of the officers disgust with an ignorant newlyofficers did not stand harbor watches except to supervise loading and storing and what drills or exercises were ordered alan was fortunate too that keith ashburn was deputized to be his unofficial mentor since they were both london boys and had come from a station above the usual squirearchy when they were not working for the purser the bosun the saiirnaker carpenter cooper and to be honest the work was either clerical or merely standing around appearing like they knew what they were doing ashburn delighted in his duties as guide for it kept them out of trouble from senior warrants who detested the sight of a midshipman with idle hands not that ashburn didnt have a cruel streak himself youre going aloft lewrie ashburn told him leaping for the mainmast chains couid we not wait until tomorrow alan asked looking up at the incredible height of the mast it was one thing to stand on deck and follow lines to understand their use he was hoping that midshipmen would stay on deck and supervise or something up you go ashburn wore a sharks expression the first part wasnt so bad going up the ratlines of the larboard mainmast shrouds for they were angled in toward the maintop not much worse than the ladders down to the holds it was at the mast that it got frightening where the shrouds crossed to either side of the top marines might get to go inside the crisscrossing and proceed through the lubbers hole to the top platformreal sailors had to grab hold of the shrouds that were now over their heads and angled out to the edge of the top actually hang on with fingers and toes and scramble up the outside angle before gaining the top platform well that was exciting alan said after getting his breath back nice view we can go down now right up ashburn laughed the next set of shrouds were much narrower and set closer together and they did not lead to another platform where there was much room to stand but to the small cap and trestletrees that supported the topmast ashburn thrust an arm between the topmast and the halyards and stood on the cap while alan gripped the mast with both arms and held on for dear life it seemed a tenifying distance down to that very substantial deck far below and the ship was still moving and the masts swayed a considerable distance with each slow roll heave and pitch plus the snubbing jerk as she tugged at her anchor and the mast seemed to hum and vibrate on its own in the steady wind alans heart was thudding away in his chest and his limbs felt cold there was a tingling emptiness in the pit of his stomach but not in his bladder and he knew that if he did not get down from that precarious position he was going to fall and kill himself or piss his breeches now well lay out on the tgallant yard ashburn shouted to be heard over the wind do what i do ashburn reached up and scrambled like a monkey onto the small crosswise yard that rested on the cap and rapidly went out to the end of it oh god you have to be joshing me alan said feeling sick at the very idea be a man for gods sake lewrie come on the yard seemed like a toothpick to hell with your nautical humbug i cant cant no such word in the navy lewrie i promise you youll spend half your life in the rigging might as well learn now i would very much like to go down and what do you think mister swift would do with anyone who had no courage refused to go aloft because he was frightened ashburn asked swarming back to the mast and lewries shaky perch on the crosstrees disroting three dozen lashes put forward with the common robble therell be some dark night when its blowing a full gale and you dont want to go theyll drive you aloft and the best thing you can do then is jump and die because if you dont have bottom every handll be turned against you or they could just hang you for refusing to obey a direct order jesus christ he was a carpenters mate not a sailor ashburn said now listen to me grab hold of that yard use the harbor gaskets to hold on to put your feet on the footrope now lean into the yard and hook your elbows over it whatever you do dont lean back now come out here alan was panting now there was not enough air in the whole wide world to fill his lungs but he did as he was told and slowly painfully trembling like a whipped puppy he crabbed his way out to the end of the yard until it was no longer the ship he would strike if he fell but the harbor he was one hundred and twenty feet up with nothing but ocean below his feet there he stayed for long minutes the footrope was not all that bad if he hooked the heels of his shoes along it and if he kept leaning forward how do you work up here he asked with only one eye open and that directed at ashburn not down anywhere but down one hand for yourself and one for the ship ashburn singsonged the trick is to reach over the yard keep your arms or elbows across it even with a full crew work aloft is like church work it goes slow no one but a fool would rush things if its blowing hard can we go down now take a look around ashburn suggested jesus have to climb higher for that look around you can see downchannel fairly well today and theres a lovely frigate beating down past us there was the isle of wight the grey waters of the solent the harbor mole and the old forts and the channel beyond there was a frigate taking advantage of a favorable slant of wind to make her way west downchannel her sails laid as close to the wind as she could bear and well heeled over are you well just thumping wonderful thank you very much for asking alan sneered thats my bully buck well make a sailor of you yet mine arse on a bandbox got to set your mind to it or you wont get on in the navy not just reading about it but doing it like this turning into a real tarpaulin man like chapman lewrie asked sarcastically well chapman ashburn said theres a blank page for you hes failed the exam twice now a good sailor but sharp as an anvil i expect hell always be a midshipman can one do that i mean that would be awful youre an educated type lewrie youre miles ahead of most of us you know social skills good tutors cant expect eightyearolds to come aboard as a captains servant and learn much more toon the sea think how you and i shall stand out when we become officers what about rolston lewrie asked he had been plagued by the little bastard showing off his skills and knowledge finding subtle ways when they were working together to belittle alans small contributions or toady to the officers and warrants and shine at lewries expense now thats a real welsh mile he is i feel sorry for whatever crew gets him as a postcaptain well lets go down thank god make your way back to the mast without killing yourself and well go down one of the backstays why cant we just climb back down the way we came up not seamanly youll have to cross your legs over the stay and let yourself down hand over hand you keep finding new ways to scare hell out of me if beat you down to the deck ill make you climb back up here and do it allover again lewrie was closest to the mast so he reached a backstay first but took a moment to decide how to proceed with a death grip he had seized the stay levered himself out into the open air flipped a leg around the rope and cocked it behind his knee it was then that he discovered that standing rigging is coated with tar which can be slippery he could not hang on and he could not remain in one place even with both legs about the stay he was sliding slowly down gaining speed as he went there was nothing to do but try to go down hand over hand but in a moment he was moving too fast to brake his descent with his hands which were burning on the hemp rope with some heartfelt and very english words of pain and terror he screeched his way down to crash feet first onto the quarterdeck and tumble in a heap his hands on fire on your feet there young sir captain bales said angrily i will teach you that i will have no blaspheming in my ship bosuns mate half dozen of your best for mister lewrie at once sir alan lewrie finally met the gunners daughter bent over a quarterdeck ninepounder and slashed on the buttocks by a bosuns mate with a stiffened rope starter once chastised bales ordered him aloft again to climb each mast in succession and layout on each topsail yard in turn until bales was satisfied with his progress and bales had a great deal of patience in watching him mister lewrie turner one of the masters mates called to him as he paced along the starboard gangway above the waist one damp and dreary afternoon aye mister turner captain osmonde ere wants a boat ter go ashore an fetch out cabin stores fer the wardroom yer it turner told him standing ratscruffy next to the elegantly uniformed marine officer me sir they hadnt allowed him outboard since he had joined and he knew nothing about boats o course yew sir now git wif it here is the list mister lewrie osmonde said handing him a sheet of paper the particular chandlers name is on this bill and his place of business be sure and get a receipt aye aye sir now how do i do this he wondered turning away the duty bosuns mate has charge of the boats ill try him lewrie hustled up ream a husky young man explained what was needed and a boats crew was there in a twinkling scrambling down the side to an eightoared cutter tied below the main chains alan went through the gate and lowered himself down the ladder to stumble into the boat and make his way aft to the tiller the crew sat waiting for him to say something but for the life of him he could not think of what the proper order was well we cant go on staring at each other like this lets shove off then he said and the bowman undid the painter and fended them off from the ships side with his boat hook so far so good he told himself shakily now we need these oars in the water out oars he said with a confidence he did not feel eight men lowered their blades into the water and shipped them to the rowlocks then sat looking dumbly obedient for the next command give way er starboard sounds as good as any he thought the oarsmen paused for a short moment took the opportunity to look at each other and then the four starboard oarsmen dug in for a stroke naturally under their thrust the boat swung back alongside ariadne and nuzzled her timbers with a series of bumps much like a piglet would prod her sow for a teat god strike me blind but youre hopeless came a strangled wail from the quarterdeck oh stop that alan said waving at the starboard oarsmen shove off again give way over here someone in the boat began to snigger choking on a laugh that could cost him a dozen lashes if he was not careful the boat made it away from ariadnes side this time she also continued to circle to the right until she was pointing back at the ship today you clown came a shout from above just what does he expect jason and the bloody argonauts lewrie muttered under his breath two more oarsmen began to laugh i couldnt look any more stupid if i sank the damned thing im open to suggestions he said with a sheepish grin easy all sor the closest oarsman whispered easy all lewrie parroted aloud tiller sor the other closest man muttered center it up he took hold of the heavy tiller bar and laid his arm along it lining it up in the direction of the bows ah yes now give way all lewrie said remembering those instructions that rolston had used weeks before the two closest hands winked at him and began to set the pace for the stroke the boat began to pick up speed lifting and rising through a slight chop with a pleasing sort of surge forward each time they dug in with the oars he was headed in the general direction of the shore but there was one slight problem from water level he hadnt a clue where he was going and nothing looked remotely familiar he was lost anyone from portsmouth here he asked i am sir one of the forward men said between strokes i am looking for a certain chandlers named kenner sons do we have to land at the fleet landing and walk or is there an easier way pale brick place sir theres a red n white gig by it right now sir the man said lewrie found the distinctive gig and gingerly turned the tiller first the wrong way then back to the other side of a few degrees which brought them in a gently curving path towards the particular landing where they needed to go here thats not so tricky after all he marveled now when we get there we dont want to go this fast so i should tell them to ease the stroke i guess easy all stops em now what do you say to get em sticking up god i cant remember and i dont think my falconers mentioned it youre just supposed to know as they approached he told them to ease the stroke and the speed fell off the bowman stood up with his boat hook ready they had to come alongside the stone wharf sideways lewrie knew but how he was going to do it was beyond him he steered directly for the dock until the bowman began to cough alarmingly and he took it as a cue to throw the tiller over toss yer oars the bowman called and all eight oars were unshipped and raised aloft as one lewrie realized he was sitting on the stem mooring line and he raised up and dug it out from under his bottom but neglected the tiller and the boat swung away from the dock and the bowman almost went overboard trying in vain to hook onto something solid on the second try he caught a ringbolt and pulled the cutters bow in close enough so that lewrie couid grab hold of another ringbolt and pass the line through it he made a hash of his knot but he had arrived boat yer oars the bowman ordered softly and down went the blades to be stored alongside the gunwales thalt never make a sailorman a toothless oldster on the dock said with a tubercular cackle go to the devil why dont you is this kenner sons aye so it be young un you come with me lewrie said indicating his starboard stroke oar who is senior man keep an eye on em bowman he scrambled to the dock and entered the chandlers shop he found a clerk presented the list and began the task of having his men carry the cabin stores to the waiting cutter noticing he was mostly ferrying wine for the officers to drink it gave him a thirst for something himself the only drinks available in ariadne were rum miss taylor a thin and acrid white wine black strap a thin and acrid red and small beer which at least stayed fresh longer than the water what he wanted was a good ale a stout english ale foaming in a pint mug there was a keg behind the counter of the chandlers and a row of wooden mugs why not here let me have a pint of ale how much penny a pint sir the counterman said and lewrie flipped a coin out to jingle on the counter he got his mug and started to lift it to his lips when he saw stroke oar staring at him with a short look of disgust hell they did get me here he thought and theyve been at hard work loading those cases here man a pint for every hand lewrie said slapping down a shilling thankee sir thankee right kindly the bowman said for all of them as they began to guzzle and sigh with pleasure nothin like a good wet afore rowin back to the ship sir they were halfway into the boat after finishing their drinks before alan realized that they were a man short whos missing uh harrison sir the bowman said sheepishly e must be takin a piss sir not run hell he is alan decided in a panic you stay here and keep your eye on the rest of the hands you come with me and well search for him lewrie and his stroke oar began to dart about the dock and the storage areas there were a million places to hide among all the barrels and crates a thousand ways out of the dock area into the town how could he have let him slip away and how much hell would he catch if he went back a man short they had warned him the men were signed on for at least three years of commission with only rare spells of freedom and it was common for men to payoff one ship and go right into another with no chance to see wives and families when in port it was safer to let wives and children come out to the ship and live on the mans rations and pay until the ship was placed back in full discipline let them go ashore and it was good odds theyd run inland as fast as their legs would carry them once into long clothing beyond the immediate reach of the watch and impress service and they were lost to the aeet most desertions came from new crews in home ports they had told him to be vigilant there sir stroke oar said pointing to an area behind the chandlery lewrie saw his quarry a youngish man in a brass buttoned short jacket hugging a thin and poorly clad young woman one dirt child clung to her skirts and she held another still in swaddling clothes harrison lewrie snapped comin zurr the man replied sadly letting go his woman coming so is christmas alan scoffed e werent nm zurr the woman said fearful for her man juss wanted ta see is babbies zurr why didnt you come out to the ship then ah didn have no money zurr harrison told him ah had no way ta have em come out ta the ship it been a year they been wi out their daddy zurr just a few minute more harrison s wife pleaded we have to go harrison go back to the boat with this mana aye aye zurr harrison said giving his wife one last quick kiss and patting the dirty little boy on the head the oldest child was wailing and lewrie wanted to get away from the damned noise he turned to follow his men but the girl took him by the arm tis a hard service what never pays a man but in scrip zurr an that two years behind if es lucky bum boat men an jobbers give alf what the scrips worth dont ave im flogged please zurr well lewrie managed embarrassed by her tears anythin ta keep im from bein flogged zurr by god shes a pretty thing under all that dirt it ya dont tell on im id id she shuddered pointed to a building across the alley that was obviously cheap lodgings god even im not that low he told himself well maybe i am im a willoughby no i have to go back to the ship now ill not make a habit of this lewrie said digging into his breeches and fetching out coins he gave her two half crown pieces and watched her eyes go wide in astonishment you get some food for these children and pretty yourself up and come out to the ariadne and i wont say anything to anyone if you wont cant have the hands thinking im a soft touch can i god bless ye forever zurr yere a true christian er right he said and trotted away from her once in the boat he glared at harrison just cause i sported you a pint is no reason to think you can take a piss on my time behind a crate harrison or ill have you up on a charge aye zurr harrison said nodding his relief out and toss your oars shove off bowman ship your oars give way starboard backwater larboard easy all now give way all row damn your eyes he arrived back at ariadne in much better fashion than when he had left coming alongside gently and issuing the correct commands at the right time so that they hooked on and tied up properly he arrived on deck very proud of himself but no one took the slightest note of his improved performance he organized a party to hoist the stores up from the boat on his own initiative and saw them delivered below to the wardroom just in time to meet mister swift lewrie where the hell have you been mister turner had me take a boat ashore and fetch wardroom stores sir he said proud of his accomplishment and what took you so damned long well after the boat was loaded we had a pint of ale sir you stopped and had a pint of ale you let the hands purchase drink sir i uh treated sir and what if ariadne were ordered to sea and we had to wait for you and nine hands to finish your little drink have you no sense i am sorry sir damned if you do and damned if you dont im out money and not a speck of credit for getting there and back without drowning em all if hes mad about me being late i should have gone ahead and bulled that skinny wench while i had the chance my word youre a brainless booby swift said your only concern is what the navy wants not what you want youll have to do better than this in future if you wish to be a sea officer aye aye sir now go below no stay a moment from now on youre on rowing duties good practice for you and ill time you from the moment you shove off until the second you return and god help you if i see you skylarking ashore got that more hands came aboard calfheaded innocents who had been gotten at recruiting rendezvous at various taverns where an officer and several reliable hands had bragged about ariadne and all the prize money she would take more came aboard from the impress service willing and eager volunteers for the security of the navy even merchant sailors seeking better food and less work in the overmanned fighting ships though the pay was less they would not be cheated by a bad master many more came from the tenders as volunteers or from debtors prison fleeing small debts and giving topsl payment with the joining bounty men snagged by the courts for various crimes but which were crimes against property not crimes of violence lewrie soon lost all sympathy for them since no one had any to spare for him if im here then its their tough luck to be here too should have run faster they came aboard in ragpickers finery cast off from the great houses perhaps even stolen from their masters they came from shops and stores and weavers lofts still trying to play the upright apprentice or freeman they came in country togs from the estates where the owners no longer needed field hands or from the villages that had been wiped out by enclosure of public lands they came with the prison stink and the farm stink on them or dredged up from the cities gutters up to the first lieutenant to sign or make their marks then out of their clothes to shiver under the wash deck pumps and the decks ran with the accumulated grit they carried aboard on their skins deloused perhaps for the first time in months and then chickenwhite and pimply down to the gun deck with their slop clothing where they got sorted out into hands they would the bulk of them serve guns in battle haul on braces to angle the sails tail on the jears to raise the yards tail on the halyards to make sail and be the human engines to shift cargo so that ariadne would live the younger ones would be cabin servants and stewards or be trained as topmen who went aloft to fight canvas as ariadne approached something like her full complement bales decided the time had come for sail drill and gunnery exercises alan knew a little which was reams more than most of the new hands knew so he found himself leading men about the deck like tame bears so they would know where to stand when ordered what rope or sheet to seize when needed what part of the deck they would scrub lewrie saw what captain bales had meant when he had told him they could make sailors out of any material they laid their hands on slowly the crew began to fathom what was required of them slowly he began to do the same going aloft when top and t gallant masts were struck and rehoisted sails were shaken out and drawn down then reefed over and over again until the exercise was no longer a complete shambles with the ship back in full discipline and with her company hard at work the officers were out in force once more and though ariadne had fourteen of her required sixteen midshipmen he felt that he was the only name anyone knew when it came to extra duties or something especially filthy to do now he sat at the mess table in the cockpit he had a navigation problem due to mister ellison in the next forenoon but his mind refused to function he had been up since four in the morning and it was now six in the evening supper was on its way from the galley and he slumped over a hot mug of flip wondering if he would be able to stay awake long enough to eat lets playa game after supper bascombe suggested lets build a galley lets not unless youre the figurehead bascombe alan said wearily heard of that one have you alan had fallen for most of the usual pranks he had been sent up on deck to listen to the dogfish bark that cost bascombe a sore shoulder he had been sent to fetch a marine private named cheeks and had dashed about the ship passing the word for private cheeks until ream had told him it was a buttfuckers insult and got even the marines mad he had not gone to fetch gooseberries from the foretop or some of the other dumb japes midshipmen played on each other he had heard of building a galley and had asked lieutenant kenyon about it it involved one boy being the contractor and the rest being the boat linking arms in an oval to make the sides their feet together to be a keel the one named the figurehead leaned forward until the contractor demanded that he wanted a gilt figurehead at which point the mark was given a dash of shit in the face with a brush and everyone else ran for their lives gun drill tomorrow shirke said sipping his drink surely we should be doing more of that dont we work enough already alan groaned cause weve got people listed for the guns that dont know a cap square from a cascabel and what do we do if we run into a french lineofbattle ship going downchannel bascombe asked a cap square alan laughed is that something you wear id like to see you wear one bascombe snapped speaking of country harrys who cant even steer a damned cutter hark that from our best bargee alan shot back the great sailor tom turdman learned his trade at dung wharf ill thrash you for that bascombe shouted leaping across the mess table lewrie sprang to meet him and the brawl was on with the others cheering and the senior warrants of their mess absent it was a wrestling match just to work off tension and excess energy only halfserious here you spilled my brandy you lout ow fight fair you bastard kick im in the nutmegs lewrie shirke cheered ill take a shilling on harvey done ashburn said putting aside his book until lewrie noticed that he had hold of a silk shirt as he grappled with bascombe bascombe was from a poor family his kit was of middling quality and it most definitely did not run to silk shirts wait a minute where the hell did you get silk bascombe chapman gave it to me bascombe lied knowing the fight was about to become serious in their mess things were borrowed back and forth to make a presentable showing on deck in front of the officers but they were mostly asked for not taken chapman doesnt have one and he doesnt look toot stupid lewrie said have you been in my things me why should i dig in your rag box because youre a ragpicker bascombe now take it off and put it back where you got it ill not its mine hell its yours you parish waif now have it off bascombe took a serious swing at lewrie and caught him on the side of the head alan shot a fist straight into his face and bloodied bascombes lips and nose dropping the other boy to the deck damn you bascombe wiped blood from his face on the shirt sleeve got to his feet and ripped his waistcoat off then the shirt balled it up and threw it at lewrie heres your damned shirt i hope you choke on it youll hand it back to me clean or ill make it a gift if the blood wont come out then ull have exactly one silk shirt ere now ere now said finnegan one of the masters mates as he came into the compartment christ wot a pack of yowlin ramcats mister bascombe i see summun tapped yer claret n nice mister lewrie alookin like goodyers pignever well but when in mischief wot is it then summat seryuss enough fer the captain er does it stop ere just a little wrestling match for a glass of flip mister finnegan ashburn said got out of hand rip ya say ill take a measure now lets git this cockpit stright fer eatin finnegan ordered knowing exactly what had happened but relieved that he did not have to report it which would reflect on his ability to supervise the midshipmen alan tossed bascombe the shirt with a sly smile and watched as bascombe dashed out of the compartment to fetch some seawater to stanch his nose and lips you really know how to make friends lewrie ashburn said in a low voice after they had sat down away from the others he took that shirt from my chest didnt he hell not have my blessings to take what he wants when he wants but you dont have to rub his nose in it ashburn replied theres no harm in him he just had to look good to attend the captains gig this afternoon id have loaned him one but all mine were dirty he could have asked he doesnt know you well enough to ask besides your usual answer to sharing is no ashburn said my family could buy up yours a dozen times over most like but that dont make me as purseproud as you you havent gone shares on anything in the mess yet its still stealing alan insisted blushing red not stealing borrowing aye if the hands borrow they get flogged for it but if we do its christian charity alan said sarcastically for your information harvey s the son of a country parson i doubt hes got two shillings to rub together and no hope of more his father probably makes less than thirty pounds per annum shit alan said i didnt know but whats mine is mine i have to protect it i dont have enough to keep a gentleman in the first place and my family wont part with another pence for me not if it was for a coffin lets say the splendor of my kit was a very firm goodbye just be civilized lewrie youll get by with us a lot better now bascombes going to get his own back on you and i dont know what hell do but it wont be hurtful much dont take it to heart we dont need a scottish feud down here damn you ashburn alan muttered you always find a way to make me feel like such a low bastard thats because you are mind now i like you lewrie i really do youre a ruthless uncivilized young swine and i doubt youll ever be buried a bishop but youre an interesting person anyway youll go far in the navy like me supper was decent since they were still close to shore and had the opportunity to send for fresh meat and vegetables and when ashburn raised the suggestion that they go shares on some cabin stores alan did offer to help out so they would have some drinkable wine and some livestock of their own in the forecastle manger to delay the day when they would have to live totally on issue saltmeats before lights out at pm lewrie took some bum fodder in his hand and made a postprandial journey to the heads up by the beakhead under the jibboom at sea the heads would be scoured continually by the sea but in harbor no waves reached high enough to relieve the odors or remove their source at least at sea there would be no marine sentry standing over him to prevent desertions over the bow as one now patrolled in port he returned to the cold orlop deck that was buried in darkness for after lights out no glims could burn except where permitted by the ships corporals he found his hammock by touch slipped out of his clothes and rolled in drawing the blanket over him gratefully oh my god he muttered feeling the cold and sticky semifluid substance against his legs and buttocks theyve shat in my hammock he raised a hand to his nose expecting the worst and detected a sweet odor tinged with sulfur my hammock is full of molasses from the darkness came a furtive snigger bascombe i swear to god ill murder you he shouted into the dark bringing snorts of laughter from the others and shouts from the senior warrants to shut up and let them sleep chapter their last moming had dawned grey and miserable with a fine misty rain that swelled the running rigging until it would have difficulty passing through the blocks and sheaves but the wind had come around to the northwest and ariadne was in all respects ready for the sea the ship was still about twentyfive men short of full complement but that could not be helped in wartime captain bales evidently did not have private funds for recruiting at taverns or for paying the crimps to deliver warm bodies with all their working parts in order who would wake and discover they were in the fleet he must have heaved a great sigh of relief that he was in shape to sail at all for if a captain could not gather enough men to crew his ship out of harbor he could lose his commission and his full pay and some other captain would be given a chance while the failure went on the beach at halfpay there to remain for the rest of his natural life those men he had gathered had been pummeled into some semblance of a crew through fire drills sail drills gunnery exercises and the like alan had been disappointed that he had not been given a chance for a final run ashore if the awful day had indeed arrived when he cut his last ties to the land he at least wanted to remember it with a stupendous farewell but it was not to be the boats had been hoisted inboard and stored upside down on the boattier beams that spanned the center waist of the upper gun deck so there was no excuse to be used for a last quart of ale a last dinner or a last rattle anchors hove short sir lieutenant church their feisty little third lieutenant called from the bows up and down get the ship underway mister swift captain bales said looking like a hungover mastiff in the dawn light hands aloft and loose topsls stand by to hoist foresls lewrie joined a mob of topmen as they sprang for the shrouds and swarmed up the ratlines for the mizzen top he was no longer dead with fear about going aloft merely scared stiff off came the harbor gaskets hands tailed on the jears hoisting the yards to their full erect positions on the masts others tailed on the sheets to draw down the sails as they were freed while more men stood by the braces to angle the sails to the wind as they began to draw air and fill with pressure there was a difference aloft the masts were vibrating even more the freed canvas was flapping and booming as the wind found it like a continual peal of thunder rattling the yards and jerking them into an unpredictable motion that was like to shake hands out of the masts like autumn leaves then as the topsails began to draw the yards tilted as the ship paid off heavily to the wind swinging through great arcs that brought cries of alarm from the newest hands and made lewrie moan in sheer terror as he tried to find his balance as footropes and secure holds began to slide from beneath him the footrope he was on on the mizzen topsail yard was down at a fortyfive degree angle and new men were skittering it until it almost tucked under the yard in their panic senior topmen cursed them into stillness before they all tumbled to the deck but the topsail was set and no one was calling for the royals yet so lewrie could look forward and upward to the other masts to see hands working calmly could look down to the huge capstan head on the upper gun deck where a hundred men at the least trundled about in a small circle on the bars and the clank of pawls filled the air while on the forecastle the strongest hands in the crew were walking away with the halyards for the stays s and jibs while others of their kind drew on the sheets to bring control of the jibs laid out almost level to the deck as they strained their great muscles to gain every inch of rope aft to the belaying pins ariadne was no longer sailing sideways from the wind after paying off from her headtowind anchorage but beginning to make steerage way for the harbor mouth she had changed from a helpless pile of oak and pine and iron to a ship admittedly her crews efforts must have raised some cruel amusement from more fortunate captains and officers but she was under control and unless taken suddenly aback from a capricious shift of wind would make her way out of portsmouth and past the isle of wight into the channel without mishap for a new crew made up of mostly landsmen it was the best to be expected aloft there on the mizzen set the spanker back to the mast at the crosstrees then straight down the mast to the spanker gaff experienced topmen walked out the footropes to free the big driver which was furled on the gaff and would hang loosefooted to the boom that swept over the taffrail lewrie had to join them and lie on his belly over the gaff by this time his immaculate white waistcoat working rig trousers and jacket cuffs were turning a pale tan from the linseed oil of the spars and streaked with the tar of standing rigging even beginning to smell like rancid cooking fat and pick up grey stains from the galley slush skimmed off boiling meat that was used to coat the running rigging it was almost impossible for a midshipman to stay clean and presentable on a ship and he knew hed have the hide off his harnmockman if the stains would not come out finally they were called down to the deck with ariadne fully underway and clumping along like a wooden clog down the channel coast lewrie mopped his face with a handkerchief and made his way to the starboard gangway to watch england drift by it did not look as if any more would be demanded of him for a while and he now had time to take note of his hunger pangs and the soreness of his muscles from being so tense aloft his hands were aching from the climb down a backstay and were red from unused exertion but beginning to toughen up he could rub them together and feel the difference in them from a month before he looked about him and took note that the ship was now organizedthe monumental clutter and confusion of braces halyards sheets clew lines and jears were coiled or flaked into order the anchors were catted down up forward the stinking anchor lines were stored away below in the cable tiers to drip their harbor filth into the bilges wafting a deadfish tidal smell down the deck except for the watch the hands had been dismissed below those with touchy stomachs were being dragged to the leeward rails to cast their accounts into the channel and those that could not wait were being ordered to clean up their spew he thought about going below out of the brisk wind and misty cold rain but the idea of hundreds of men who at that moment resembled deaths head on a mopstick down on the lower gun deck and were being ill in platoons dissuaded him he was dizzy from the motion of the ship a lift and twist to larboard a plunge that brought spray sluicing up over the forward bulkhead and a jerky roll upright that did not bring the deck level mister swift ill have a first reef in the courses captain bales said seconds later all hands were called but the mizzenmast had no lower course merely a crojack yard to lend power to the braces and hold the clews of the mizzen topsl down so he could sit this one out he went aft to the quarterdeck and stood by the larboard rail with the afterguard should he be needed to trim the braces he could see ashburn standing with the first lieutenant pleased as punch to be underway who turned and gave him a wink when swift was too busy to notice lewrie became fascinated watching the water cream bone white down the leeward side just feet away from him with the ship at a good angle of heel the hull groaned and creaked as before but now ariadne also made a continual hiss as she turned the ocean to foam and made an irregular surf roar as she met an oncoming wave there were ships coming upchannel in a steady stream with the wind on their quarters and alan had to admit they made a brave sight to see heeled over and rocking slowly and he wondered if ariadne made much the same picture to them lewrie quit skylarking and keep your eyes inboard lieutenant harm snapped at him as he headed for the ladder down to the waist harm was making good on his promise to keep a chary eye on him and being such a surly angloirish bog trotter was eager to find any fault in him aye aye sir lewrie answered brightly cheerfulness seemed to upset lieutenant harm very much so lewrie made it a point to be as happy and eager as possible around him mister lewrie lieutenant swift called come here aye aye sir lewrie doffed his hat i watched you on the mizzen you did that right manfully enough and youre too old to be wasted on the mizzenmast see me in my quarters and ill move you on the watch lists and quarter bills i think well move one of the new lads to your place and you may serve on the mainmast aye aye sir he secretly dreaded that for the mainmast was much taller had longer and heavier yards carried the main course and the largest topsl was the place where studding booms had to be rigged in light airs and meant a quantum leap in work the mizzen was manned by the oldest topmen or the very newest and clumsiest the nearly ruptured and the ones with foreheads as big as a hen some elevenor twelveyearold sneak was going to get a soft touch and he was going to work his young ass off still it did have advantages he would no longer be in lieutenant harms division or watch but would get to serve under lieutenant kenyon the second officer who was considered much fairer and so much more polite lewrie went forward to the base of the mainmast where kenyon and a bosuns mate were chatting and pointing at something aloft and when alan told him of the transfer he welcomed him to the starboard watch most pleasantly very glad to have you with us mister lewrie kenyon said though i am sure you realize that much more work is involved still i can use such a wellsetup young fellow like yourself aye mister kenyon and i may learn the faster alan answered thinking that it never hurt to piss down a superiors back actually he would be working much the same duties in any watch or subdivision on deck or aloft for the watches rotated equally each four hours using the much shorter dog watches in late afternoon to make sure that the same men did not have to work two nights running and everyone turned up at am to begin the ships working day washing and scraping decks and standing dawn quarters so there wasnt much to choose really well said mister lewrie we shall make a tarpaulin sailor of you yet though the bosun despairs of your ropework you are not seasick yet well no sir alan replied realizing with a shock that he wasnt he was clumsy as a newfoaled colt on the tilting deck and he staggered from one handhold to another but the ships motion did not affect him overly all he had in his stomach was a raging hunger how disgusting he thought im getting used to this when do i make the changeover sir from one watch to the other ships day begins at noon at the taking of the sights for our positions kenyon said id suggest you go see lieutenant swift as soon as hes had his breakfast then show up for the second dog watch aye aye sir oh by the way mister lewrie kenyon said calling him back with a drawling voice we have a man missing from my division he has run went out a gunport last night probably theres a rumor he was smuggled money and some street clothing heard anything about it who was it sir lewrie said having a sneaking suspicion of exactly who it was and where the money had come from harrison one of my main topmen had a wife and family in the port so im told he was in one of my boat crews sir had to hunt him down about two weeks ago but he swore he was only taking a piss behind some crates and barrels alan carefully replied hmm that was after you had stood the boat crew to a pint uh yes sir i did see a woman with two children but i didnt connect them with him well you werent to know what i regret is that he was no green hand but a prime topman hes probably halfway inland by now there are some hands in this ship you can trust with your life and your sisters honor and youll find out who they are quick enough there are also some men i wouldnt approach with a loaded pistol since youll be closer to them than i it is up to you to discover the shirkers and the ones who work chearly aye sir you cant treat them all like scum mister lewrie though they are halfway scum when we first get them neither can you be soft on em someday you may have to order a great many men not only to do something dangerous but maybe tell a whole crew to go die for you kenyon went on at some length i do not expect my midshipmen to be popular with the men nor do i wish them to be little tyrants either the men respect a taut hand a man whos firm but fair and it man whos consistent in his punishments and his praise and in the standards he calls for dont court favor dont drive them all snarling for your blood if you are so eager to learn the faster as you put it there are good lessons to be had from the older hands i suggest you find them aye aye sir lewrie said with a hearty affirmative shake of his head though he regarded it much like a lecture from a travelling italian surgeon who might see salubrious benefits for mankind in the cholera now be off with you i can hear the wolf in your stomach in full cry mister lewrie aye aye sir ariadne butted her way through the channel chop until she was out past lands end and began to work hard in the great rollers of the unfettered atlantic and up into the irish sea to meet her duty it was not blockade work for her that was for the largest rd rates that mounted more guns since ariadne was much older and lighter armed her lot was convoy duties she met her first convoy off the bristol channel forty or so merchant vessels under guard by ariadne and a th rate fiftygun cruiser named dauntless and if she was anything to go by it was going to be devilish miserable work dauntless was sanded down to the bare wood on her bows and her sides as high as the upper gun deck ports were stained with salt and her heavy weather suit of sails was a chessboard of patches of older tan and new white after getting the convoy into a semblance of order ariadne took the stem position and let dauntless lead out past ireland for new york in the americas the weather was blowing half a gale when they began and the bottom fell out of the glass within fortyeight hours ariadne rode like an overloaded cutter pitching bow high then plunging with her stem cocked up in the air rolling her guts out and shipping cold water over the gangways by the ton the hatches were battened down and belowdecks became a frowsty reeking hell where it was impossible to get away from several nauseous stinks impossible to cook a hot meal impossible to sit down in safety impossible to get warm or once having been soaked right through on deck to find a speck of dry clothing for days on end even in a hammock one was slung about so roughly it was impossible to relax enough to really sleep gunnery exercises were cancelled and sail drill became sailsaving as lines parted sails were tom or simply burst in the middle and flogged themselves to ribbons of flax or heavy cotton with new rigging it was a constant war to keep the tension necessary to support the masts as new rope stretched a watch could not pass without all hands being summoned to reef in or totally brail up the sails cut away those that had blown out and manhandle new ones aloft and lash them to the yards and their controlling ropes i want to die alan kept repeating to himself as the afternoon wore on on their tenth day of passage he was soaked to the skin halffrozen and his tarred canvas tarpaulin was turning into a stiff suit of waterlogged armor that he swore weighed twenty pounds more than when he had put it on he had not eaten in three days and had lived on rum heated over a candle he honestly could not have choked anything down that could possibly scratch on the way back up i hate this ship he screamed into the wind sure he could not be heard over the howling roar i hate this navy i hate the ocean and i hate you too rolston rolston stood nearby at the quarterdeck nettings looking down at the upper gun deck a slight smile on his cocky face you love this shitten life dont you you little bastard only the wind heard him the ship gave a more pronounced heave as a following wave smashed into the transom rolled heavily to larboard and alan dropped to the deck his feet ripped from beneath him he slid like a hog on ice along the deck that ran with water until he fetched up against coiled gun tackle and thumped his shoulder into a guntruck wheel goddarnn it he howled looking straight at captain bales by the wheel binnacle bales nodded at him with a vague expression not knowing what the hell he had said resting lieutenant swift boomed near to him no sir he shouted back hoping swift hadnt been close enough to hear what he had said though a full flogging could not hurt much worse than being bounced around like this then get on yer feet swift barked in a voice that could have carried forward in a full hurricane alan scrambled to obey and clung to the nearest pin rail trying to rub his shoulder where he had smacked it go forward and check on the lashings on the boat tier swift ordered aye aye sir he screamed back inches from the officers nose bosuns mate the duty bosuns mate ream could not hear a word he said so he took advantage of the ships roll upright to dash over to him and cling to the man as the ship rolled to larboard once more and threatened to take him back where he had started come with me he yelled into the mans cupped ear boat tiers alan muttered curses at everything in general all the way along the starboard gangway clinging to anything that looked substantial ream fetched a couple of hands along the way and alan took notice that ream and both hands were also moving their lips in a canticle of woe and anger probably directed at alan but he could have cared less at that point they reached the thick timbers that spanned the waist of the upper gun deck between the gangways and stood studying the lashings on the stored boats that were nestled foreandaft on the massive beams chafing ream shouted into each ear pointing at the ropes that were wearing away slowly before their eyes each time the ship did a particularly violent roll and pitch tell the first lieutenant alan made his way back aft getting freshly drenched in waves of spume and spray until he could stagger to the mizzen weather chains where swift stood one arm hooked through the shrouds chafing sir he shouted rolston swift bellowed all hands on deck rolstons mouth moved but no sounds were to be heard as he relayed the message and in moments men began to boil up from below and muster on the upper gun deck below them rolston take windward with mister kenyon swift ordered and mister lewrie go to looard with mister church oakum pads and baggywrinkle on old lines and new lashings doubled up aye sir alan replied knuckling his forehead shit new words again baggywrinkle sounds like my scrotum about now he went forward with their little third officer and tried to explain what was desired to each man but church simply roared out one command and everyone fell to with a sense of purpose that left alan standing about go keep an eye on em church barked shoving alan toward the boattiers he realized that he would have to scramble out onto the timbers to the upturned boats and that timber couldnot be more than two feet wide and deep with absolutely no safety line of any kind he took a deep breath waited until the ship rolled about as much upright as she was going to and ran out onto one of the timbers the ship slammed her bows into a wave as the stem lifted once more the beakhead buried in foam and she lurched as if she had been punched right in the mouth the beam seemed to dance out from beneath him but alan was close enough to fling himself forward and grab onto one of the lashings that stood out from the nearest craft the jollyboat one leg dangled into the waist but he had made it by the merest whisker he scrambled up on top of the jollyboat with the help of one of the older hands and clung to her keel with a death grip the man smiled back at him teeth gleaming white as foam in his face dont tell me this cretin enjoys this alan thought new lashins first er baggywrinkle sir the man asked coming close enough to carry the smell of his body alan clung tight as ariadne rolled once more to larboard he felt more than heard the grating as more than two tons of wooden boat shifted against the tiers to the leeward sidethe boat he was sitting on new lashings he decided quickly bobbing his head nervously aye aye the man yelled then scrambled over to the next boat with a grace that alan could only envy and shout something to the rest of his party then hopped back over to alan how do we do it alan asked when the wind gusted a little softer than normal im not too proud to ask stap me if i know sir thought you did and thats the last time i am not too proud to ask alan promised himself as the man beamed his stupidity at him alan bent over as far as he dared and studied the existing lashings the way they threaded under the beams crossed under like a lacedup corset and crossed over the boats give me a bight on the forward timber alan shouted then make sure its wrapped snug in oakum or old canvas take it up and over the boat under this beam were on and on aft then back forward like well like a womans bodice is tied up see double lashings this time aye aye sir ship work on a heaving deck or shaky spar was as ashburn had prophesied much like church work it went damned slow alan inspected each point where the new ropes could rub on wood and had them padded and wrapped he thumped on each bight until satisfied that they were as taut as belaying pins so there would be no play after they were finished lieutenant church made his way out to him and gave him an encouraging grin squatting on one of the boattiers once his men had gotten the idea alan swung his way over to thecentermost boats the massive cutter and barge to watch from another vantage point he was feeling very pleased with himself in spite of being wet as a drowned rat and aching in places where he hadnt thought one could ache being useful rolston shouted into his face taunting him yes damn yer eyes alan shot back and was disappointed that he had to repeat himself to be understood his throat was almost raw with the effort of making himself heard church tell you to do that rolston shouted back do what rig new lashings before padding the old thats wrong what if the old ones part before you have new ones on they wont part rolston shrieked into his nose but he didnt look as confident as he had earlier which prompted alan to look at what his hands were doing rolstons team was applying a single lashing without any padding or baggywrinkling and were loosening the frayed lashings to pad them then what the hell are we doing out here alan demanded did kenyon tell you to do it that way rolston looked away alan made his way farther to starboard over the barge to the captains brightly painted and gilttrimmed gig which was being lashed down in much the fashion that alan had thought correct providing him with a tingle of satisfaction he waved to lieutenant kenyon who clambered out to join him but once out there kenyon took one look at the way the two heaviest boats were being treated and frowned rolston you young fool he shouted leave those lashings be sir rolston cringed not able to believe he had done wrong at that moment shirke came from aft to request some topmen to go aloft and secure a comer of the mizzen topsl that had blown out her leeward leach line alan looked at rolston gave him a large smile then went back to his own hands who were busily doing things all seamanlike he climbed over the keel of the biggest and heaviest boat the barge and was about to traverse the short distance to the jolly boat when he felt the barge shift underneath him a frayed lashing gave way and came snaking over past his head with the force of a coach whip it struck the jollyboat and cracked like a gunshot leaving a mark in the paint jump for it he yelled wondering if he could do the same there followed a series of groans and gunshots as other lashings parted under the tremendous weight they had restrained and he was on a slide along the timbers toward the jollyboat as the barge came free one of his men had been sitting on the boat tier between the two boats he turned to look at the weight that was about to smear him like a cockroach between a boot and a floor and screamed wordlessly alan leaped over him one foot touching the mans posterior and flung himself across the keel of the jollyboat the man grabbed at him and hauled away which pulled alan down off the keel and down the rainslick bottom of the upturned boat using alan as a ladder he got out of the way and disappeared over the far side the ship now rolled back upright for a moment snubbed as her bow dug deep into a wave and came up like a seal blowing foam the barge shifted back to the starboard side making a funereal drumming boom against the cutter rolston came over the top of the barge to check for damage as alan hoisted himself out of harms way just in time to meet lieutenant church and the panicked working party the ship tucked her stem into the air once more rolled to larboard and rolston fell between the barge and the jollyboat he was facedown on the boattier asthe barge began to slide down on him a leg dangling on either side of the thick beam wonderful alan thought inanely im about to see a human meat patty and it couldnt happen to a nicer person then without really thinking or calculating the risk he planted his feet on the boattier leaped forward and grabbed rolston as he flung himself off the tier to drop to the upper gun deck which was about eight feet below them he had the satisfaction of landing on rolston who landed on a thick coil of cordage at the foot of the mainmast overhead the barge slammed into the jollyboat to the sound of splintering timber now why in hell did i do that he wondered trying to get his lungs to work again after taking an elbow in the pit of his stomach for a moment he thought he was dying until with a spasm his lungs began to function again and he could suck in fresh air as for rolston he was stretched out like a dead man but alan could see his chest heaving merciful god are you alright young sir lieutenant roth asked him kneeling down by both of them i believe so sir alan said trying to sit up which was about all he thought he could manage at the moment roth hoisted rolston up in his arms and slapped him a couple of times which cheered alan a bit in fact he wished that he could do that to rolston himself rolston rolled his eyes and groaned loudly trying to shrink away from that hard palm stupid gits lieutenant kenyon shouted down from above get your miserable arse up here now aye sir alan shouted back thinking it was a summons for him as usual both of you kenyon added lieutenant swift and the captain were there on the gangway by the time they had ascended to that level by the forecastle ladders and gone aft to join the officers silly cackhanded cunnythumbed whipjack of a sailor you are sir swift howled spitting saliva into the wind in his fury a cantingcrew imitation tar would know better than that theres a jollyboat stove in and the barge damaged as well because of you sony sir alan said along with rolston oh not you lewrie at least not this once its rolston im talking to swifts face was turning red as a turkey cocks wattles get back to wode mister lewrie oh aye aye sir said a surprised alan not on the carpet for the first time since he had joined ariadne if it wasnt for lewrie youd be pressed flat as a flounder and good riddance to bad rubbish swift was going on as alan scrambled back across the boattiers to leeward out of earshot i should have let him get mashed damme if i shouldnt have alan thought but now ive done something right for a change and somebody else is getting grief an hour later they finished lashing down the boats and by then the watch had changed alan went down to the lower gun deck and sniffed at the odors of sickness and bodies even as bad as the weather was topside he almost contemplated going back on deck rather than stand the atmosphere down here but he peeled off the sodden tarpaulin and began to work his way through the swinging hammocks toward the afterladders to the orlop he passed the junior midshipmens mess where there was a single glim burning the master gunner mr tencher had a stone bottle by his elbow on the table secured by fiddles and was humming to himself lewrie he whispered not wanting to wake up his sleeping berth mates want a wet god yes mister tencher sir alan croaked in gratitude he seated himself on a chest and locked his elbows into place on the table so he wouldnt slide about the gummy wetness of his clothing that had been soaked in saltwater for hours almost glued him to the dry wood ciderand boy tencher promised pouring him a battered tin mug full of something alcoholicsmelling and what mister tencher alan asked sniffing at it as it was handed over to him good blue ruin holland gin tencher laughed softly his leathery face crinkling in the fitful light of the glim he looked as if he had tar and gunpowder pennanently ground into his wrinkles god in heaven alan choked after a sip he had ordered ciderand in country inns and had usually gotten rum or mulled wine as the additive plus he was never partial to gin but he took another sip grateful for the hot flush in his innards hear ya done somethin right tonight mister lewrie it was nice not to be caned or shouted at for a change mister tencher alan said tears coming to his eyes from the fumes of the gin no gunners daughter fer you eh until tomorrow alan gave tencher the ghost of a smile the man had run him ragged trying to pound the art of handling artillery into him and had had him caned more than once when he didnt have the right answer he could not feel exactly comfortable with tencher but he meant to be civil if the man was going to trot out free drink rolston should owe you a tot fer saving his life ya know tencher said filling his own mug again and taking a deep quaff well we shall see alan said forcing himself to choke down the rest of the mug he knew that if he made it to his hammock without passing out he was going to be a lot luckier than he had any right to be thankee kindly mister tencher that was potent stuff i shall sleep like a stone if they dont call all hands again dont mention it tencher winked earned it alan made his way out of the mess clinging to the top of the half partitions toward the double ladders someone took him by the arm in the dark and spun him to a stop lewrie rolston he asked thinking he recognized the voice think youre a clever cock do you it was rolston alright ill not let you make me look ridiculous like that again you dont need any help from me to be ridiculous alan tried to judge just where rolstons head might be so that when he hit him as he felt he soon must he could get in a good shot ill settle you rolstons voice was shaking alan could barely make out a face but he knew the fellow must be almost weeping with rage by then ill square your yards for you for good and all no you wont alan said prying the hand from his arm and pressing it back away from him against rolstons best effort with an ease he would not have had weeks before and if you lay hands on me once more ill kick your skinny arse up between your ears right where it belongs watch and see ifi dont get you lewrie watch out for yourself alan chuckled i might not save your miserable life next time farmer alan took a few cautious steps toward the coaming of the hatch wary of a sudden shove from rolston that could send him crashing to the hard deck below ready to dive flat and let rolston go arseovertit instead but mister tencher came out of the mess area with his glim and a handful of scrap paper for a trip to the warrant officers heads in the roundhouse before the focsl and rolston had to turn on his heel and go forward to his own berth space alan relieved went below to his own where he slid out of his wet dripping clothes and sat on a chest to towel himself down in the dark his skin was burning with saltwater rash and he could feel the chafe in crotch and limbs where boils were erupting from the constant immersion and the sandpaper effect of wet wool he rolled into his hammock nude wearing a blanket wrapped about him like a cocoon he tried to inventory what he had dry to wear but was so sleepy exhausted battered and drunk that he soon fell into a swoonlike sleep dreaming once more of getting everyone who had been in any way responsible for his current predicament in the navy all together in one place and roasting them over slow fires two days later once the weather had moderated they only found twenty ships of their convoy at first light perhaps fifteen more came straggling back into sight over the next few days it was likely that the five missing merchantmen would never be seen by anyone again at first alan was a bit irked that no one said anything about his saving rolston then realized that it was just one of those things that was after all expected from a midshipman or a sailor with no thanks needed or expected what a shitten outlook they have in this navy he sighed dawn was a rosy hint rising over the humps of the sea astern lost in the grey gloom of another spring morning in the windswept north atlantic the taffrail lanterns and the candles in the wheel binnacle lost their strength and one could begin to recognize people on watch by their faces instead of their voices like wraiths the ships in convoy began to loom as dark shadows ahead of them to leeward on either side of their bows now that another long voyage was almost over alan clung to the starboard shrouds halfway up to the main top shivering with chill and trying to steady a heavy telescope to count ships lieutenant kenyon was below him at the quarterdeck ladder his eyes flying from one vantage to the next judging the strength of the wind the set of the sails ariadnes position to the rest of the convoy a first reassuring sight of dauntless out to leeward and far ahead of the convoy eyeing his watch to see they were awake and alert lewrie wondered if he was making nautical plans for all eventualities or merely sniffing the aromas that occasionally swirled back from the smoking galley funnel today was a meatissue day following a wednesday banyan day on which the crew was served beer cheese gruel soup and biscuit lewrie clambered down to the rail and jumped the last few feet to the deck twentyfive sail to starboard sir some very far out of position but all taffrail lanterns burning very good mister lewrie kenyon replied referring to his pocket watch almost five bells prepare to rotate the watch aye aye sir five bells did indeed chime from up forwardtwo pairs of quick chimes and a last single one that echoed on and on or was it merely the sound of so many ships around them raising a chorus of bells later than ariadne lewrie kicked awake one of the ratty little ships boys so he could turn the halfhour glass at the binnacle washdeck pumps were stowed awayhands stood erect from buffing the deck with bibles and holystones to remove the filth of the day beforeothers boiled up from below with their rolledup hammocks for stowing the pipes shrilled for the lower deck to be swept clean pump chains clanked as the bilges were emptied of their accumulated seepage twentytwo ships to larboard and ahead sir midshipman rolston reported to kenyon and dauntless is shaking out her night reefs sir that was the main wrench of being in kenyons watch having to share it with rolston even after two round voyages rolston still gave off a hatred so deep and abiding that he positively glowed and lewrie found himself walking stifflegged about him waiting for the knife in the back or the studiedly awkward push at the wrong moment very good mister rolston kenyon replied my respects to the captain and inform him that all ships in convoy are in sight spread out from the night and that dauntless is making sail aye aye sir rolston answered giving lewrie a haughty look as if to say that he could never be enrusted with carrying a message aft to their lord and master as rolston could alans belly rumbled hungry mister lewrie kenyon grinned always sir he never got enough to eat not like back home in london and ships fare was plain commons he could spend half the watch dreaming of all the spicy substance of the buffets he had seen at drums the houruponhour dinner parties of course after course even the hearty filling nature of a twopenny ordinary or the choices available at a cold midnight supper after the theatre the midshipmens mess always exhausted their livestock quickly and had to settle for biscuit hard as lumber and alive with weevils joints of saltpork or saltbeef that had been incask so long one could carve them into combs thick pea soup cheeses gone rancid and that only twice a week an ounce of butter now and then and a fruit duff only on sundays he no longer looked askance at the hands who offered him rats that had been caught and killed in the bread room they were threeapenny fat as tabbies and surprisingly tasty sea squirrel they called them now that his oncefine palate had been jaded be had to admit that the food wasnt all that bad he had seen coaching inns and low dives in the east end of london that served worse it was the unremitting sameness of boiled everything and once the gristle and bone had been subtracted there was never enough on his plate to leave him comfortably stuffed captain sir lewrie whispered catching sight of captain bales coming on deck from his great cabins aft he and the mate of the watch byers went down to leeward leaving the starboard side of the quarterdeck for bales to pace in solitary splendor and after making his report kenyon joined them what would he have done if he had not gotten into kenyons watch he wondered the captain was so remote and aloof and rarely seen the first lieutenant mr swift was a testy butler who always found a power of faultno one could please him the third officer lieutenant church was cold as charity and silent while roth their fourth and lieutenant harm the fifth were both full of harshly impatient bile kenyon was the only one he could remember who actually smiled now and then who didnt deal out floggings and canings and vipertongued screeches against one and all kenyon went out of his way to teach to admonish his failures as faults to be corrected and not catastrophes that called for humiliating tirades he would go to the heads aft off the wardroom in the middle of the watch leaving lewrie and byers alone on the quarterdeck totally in charge of twelvehundred tons of ship plunging along in the dark of night while kenyon did not court favorites and disliked being toadied to lewrie had a sneaking feeling that kenyon liked him when his part of the watch stood on the quarterdeck he got quizzed by the second lieutenant and there was time to talk softly in the black hours of the morning alan found himself confiding in kenyon as he never could with the others even ashburn had it not been for the difference in rank kenyon could have become much like an older brother to him he did not think kenyon and rolston shared the same regard as soon as the hands have eat well endeavor to round up this flock of silly sheep once more lieutenant kenyon he heard the captain say it was the same each morning of every convoy the masters of the merchant ships would never trust the stationkeeping of their own kind and would scatter like chickens going for seed corn every night which required ariadne to spend half the day chasing after them herding them back toward the pack and chivvying them into order and merchant captains did not take kindly to sharp commands from the navy more than once they had fired a blank charge to draw a moody merchantmans attention to their signals under the captains sharp eye lewrie tried to appear busy he went up into the larboard shrouds of the mizzen to use his telescope on the convoy now that the gloom was being chased to the west by the watery rising sun behind them he also noticed with some amusement that lieutenant kenyon was trying to appear intent on his duties as well he turned his glass on dauntless there were flags soaring up a halyard on her mizzen and he dug into his pocket to consult a sheet of paper that contained the meager signals for day or night strange sail south at last he crowed leaping down and dashing to report to lieutenant kenyon this close to new york strange sail could be those frenchies from their base in newport or rebel privateers were going to see some action he exulted strange sail is it captain bales said hearing the report aloft with you to the maintop mister lewrie and spy them out aye aye sir mister kenyon my respects to the master gunner and ill have a signal gun fired to starboard day signal for the convoy to close up followed by strange sail to the south shall we beat to quarters sir kenyon asked no let the hands be fed first time enough for that lewrie made it to the mainmast crosstrees to join the lookout already there his heart beating from the exertion and the excitement seen anything to the south no sir the lookout replied not yet sir lewrie scrambled up onto the topmast cap and hugged the quivering t gallant mast unslinging his glass which had hung over his shoulder as heavy as a sporting gun he steadied his hands and peered to the south aloft there came a leatherlunged shout from the deck what do you see not a bloody thing damn yer eyes lewrie muttered tell him nothing yet lewrie went up higher onto the t gallant yard to sit astride the narrow spar now thats more like it in his glass he could see a tiny sliver of a topsl with just the hint of a triangular sail right behind it that might be a schooner or a brigantine he scanned farther west behind that ship and found a pair of tops is and then bringing up the rear three topsls close together possibly a brig and a fullrigged ship their sails painted rose red as spring flowers by the dawn deck there he bawled three strange sail to the south what lieutenant swift shouted back through a speaking trumpet lewrie left the glass with the lookout and descended rapidly to the quarterdeck by way of a backstay three ships to the south and southwest sir lewrie said due south a topsail and what looks to be a gaffsail together a brigantine or schooner swift nodded impatiently aye aft of her two topsails a brig mostlike sir and three topsails to the southwest perhaps a fullrigged ship mister swift signal again to those damned merchantmen to close up captain bales said then have dauntless move to the southern comer aye aye sir mister rolston bring your signals sir six bells of the watch chimed from the forecastle belftyseven in the morning the sound of the signal gun had brought everyone up from below out of curiosity the other officers now congregated on the quarterdeck mister lewrie said kenyon where is your glass sir i left it with the lookout at the crosstrees sir for him to see the better good youd better take your portion of the watch below now i doubt if youd have much chance for breakfast if you waited til the end of the watch aye sir thank you but alan only got as far as the wide companionway to the lower gun deck before the first lieutenant called for all hands to hoist more sail and shake out their night reefs to make more speed with a sigh he dashed back to the ratlines ariadne turned due south away from the easternmost end of the convoy which by now had seen the possibly hostile sails for themselves and were fleeing northwest away from them alan presumed that they would pose a threat well up to windward and ready to dash down on the raiders as they tried to close he was much too busy for many minutes to pay attention as ariadne also set her l gallants for more speed but by the end of the watch they were faced with a new alignment the schooner furthest east was now behind the convoy and had crossed ariadnes stem while a fast privateer brig was dashing dead north for the convoy with the wind on her quarter while the frigatesized ship was challenging dauntless for passage to the west of the convoy alan turned from the bulwarks and the hammock nettings now full of tightly rolled and numbered hammocks which would act as a barrier for the marines when action was joined within musketshot he saw some ships boys gathering with their drums and fifes and trumpets the ariadne was beating to quarters really stripping herself for a battle he could see the captain on the quarterdeck pacing back and forth by the foremost netting rail overlooking the waist of the ship looking like a fat duck on his thin legs alan took himself down to the waist then down to the lower gun deck which was his station at quarters the deck was rapidly being transformed as mess tables were slung from the overheads the hammocks already removed as were the screens and partitions from the marine and midshipmens berths chests and furniture were being carried below to the holds for safekeeping and to lessen the danger of being shattered and turned into deadly clouds of wooden splinters the ariadne was a rd rate ship of the line mounting a total of sixtyfour guns twentyeight of them on her lower gun deck massive thirtytwopounder pieces that weighed over pounds fourteen to each beam the ideal crew would be thirteen men to each gun but since there was little likelihood of fighting on both sides at once there were only three men on the disengaged side to starboard while the bulk of the men slaved to prepare the larboard guns for action the deck was gloomy for the gun ports were not yet opened though the guns had been rolled back to the extent of their breeching ropes for tompions to be removed and to be loaded with cartridges and balls gun captains stood ready with powder horns portfires with a burning length of a slowmatch on one end and a pricker on the other to clear the vent of their gun and pierce the cartridge bag bundles of firing quills were ready to hand goose quills filled with a fastburning and finegrained powder that had been soaked in wine and supposedly a bit of gunners urine that would be stuck down into the cartridge bags and lit off to transfer the spark that would fire the gun loaders rolled cannonballs from the thick rope shotgarlands or the shot racks around the hatches to find the roundest most perfect iron balls which would fly straight for longrange work rammer men plied their tools to tamp the cartridges down snug against the vents then a hairy discshaped wad a ball and another wad other men stood by with crows and handspikes to shift the guns from left to right with brute force once they were drawn up to the sills and run out most of the gunnery crew stood by at the sidetackles and overhauled the traintackles to haul those guns up to firing position lieutenants roth and hann had charge of the lower gun deck though should they close to pistol or boarding range hann as the fifth lieutenant or lieutenantatarms would go on deck to oversee the boarding parties which he had trained at musketry and the use of the pike and cutlass bout time you harm fairly spat at lewrie i was at the masthead sir take station to starboard and stay out of the way you might be good enough to run messages if youve wit to remember them ariadne was allotted a complement of sixteen midshipmen and it was galling to see the youngest and smallest boys getting assigned to the engaged side while lewrie was rated more useless than even striplin an elevenyearold who was not half the height of an average sailor harm and roth and their quartergunners in charge of four guns had to put tools in the hands of some men shove others out of the way of possible recoil while alan who had found that gunnery exercise was one of his least hated duties had to stand aside silent and useless once the lower gun deck was arranged to roths satisfaction the deck became fairly silent and long minutes passed as ariadne drew up to their foe alan amused himself reciting the fourteen steps of gun drill he had memorized he daydreamed about delivering brave messages to the quarterdeck or having both officers shot dead before him please god most especially lieutenant harm and himself taking charge and performing some feat that would go down in glory when that grew dull and he realized that an immediate commission to lieutenant might not be in the cards he worked on other remembrances and fantasies there was what he would have liked to have done with harrisons slim little west country wife her with her burring accent from zealand there was that last glorious night with the little chambermaid to be relished or the lady at vauxhall gardens who had found him so pretty she had taken him home to her lodgings and halfkilled him with kindness then there was a ball in the country where he and his hostess had struck an arrangement after the host had drunk himself into a stupor the crotch of his slop trousers became uncomfortably tight just remembering what a rogering buck he had used to be if i dont get ashore for some mutton in new york this trip i dont know what ill do muter what seemed an age little beckett dashed down and spoke with roth who ordered the gun ports opened as they hinged up out of the way the deck became a painfully loud cavern as the heavy guns were run out to stick their black muzzles from the ports alan made his way to midships and knelt down to spy their target it was the rebel privateer brig tacking heavily to make a dash past ariadnes bows to get at her prey in the convoy stand by roth called there was a loud bang from the upper deck as you bear fire one by one each piece discharged with a monumental blast that had alans ears ringing most painfully but it was glorious so much noise so much power so much smoke and recoil and the great guns all rolling back to snub at the end of their groaning breeching ropes he had not taken part in a live firing yet merely drills yet he knew at once that if he could play with cannon he could make a career in the navy and not half mind all the rest of the stupidity it did not appear however that ariadnes bite was quite as impressive as her bark in point of fact alan could see quite a few tall splashes as heavy balls impacted with the sea some were far beyond the brig having passed over her hannlessly perhaps twitching a sail with the wind of their passage some struck short incredibly short so close to ariadne that he at first thought it was the enemy that had fired at them and missed there were a few frankly more than merely a few splashes far in front and far astern of the privateer brig where they may have killed an injudicious fish or two but had no effect on their foe goddarnn my eyes roth called as loud as the broadside after the last thunder had died away what a pack of duckfuckers try to keep your eyes open and aim at something this time swab out yer guns ariadne began a ponderous turn to starboard to keep the enemy on her beam and within the arc of her guns alan could see a gay flag on the privateer a redandwhitestriped banner with a blue canton to the upper mast they were almost close enough to discern a circle of tiny white stars on the flag as the guns were run out again point yer guns handspikes and crows there hann ordered aim the goddamn things now they let loose a second broadside it was about as effective as the first jesus how can we miss at this range alan thought miserably he spans two gun ports so he must be no farther than three or four cables away from us its impossible to miss and then the privateer brig sailed out of their gun ports to the north outreaching the much heavier and slower ariadne the hands labored at swabbing out their hot barrels slipping in fresh cartridge bags ramming home wads and fresh shot then straining to roll the guns squealing on their ungreased wooden trucks back up to the sills beckett appeared once more at lieutenant roths side the captains respects mister roth and you are to prepare to engage to starboard lewrie supervise the larboard guns and see theyre secure roth told him leading all but three of the numbers from each hot gun over to starboard alan made sure that no cartridge bags had been pricked that all vents were covered from sparks and that the ports were securely closed and the heavy guns were snubbed in place by the train and sidetackles with no chance to roll about and crush someone by the time he and the excess numbers had finished that chore the starboard guns were speaking rattling the fabric of the ship he bent down to see out and could not detect any improvement in their aim as they fired at a much smaller target the privateer schooner which was in the process of cutting out a slow merchantman and by the time the most experienced gun captains and quartergunners had found their enemys range and had begun to slap balls close about her she had danced out of reach and gunarcs to rush down on another prize ariadne now turned about and chased after their earlier target the brig the men stood behind the guns in long swaying lines for what seemed like an hour there were sounds of gunfire far off light sixand ninepounders occasionally the deeper boom of a twelvepounder and then it was over they were to secure from quarters charges and balls were drawn and the guns were securely bowsed down by the time the mess tables were being lowered between the guns and all the other officers had left lewrie shrugged and went up on the upperdeck gangways down south to windward or off to the southeast astern stood the three raiders safe as houses with ariadne and dauntless now far down to leeward to the north in pursuit of a panicky flock of merchantmen the privateer ship had a foretopmast missing and showed a few scars but was still afloat more to the point five tubby merchant vessels that had lately been part of the convoy were also down to windward prizes of the privateers seven bells chimed from the belfry and bosuns pipes began to shrill dye hear there clear decks an up spirits the bsun shouted as loud as a gunshot eleventhirty in the moming as if to confirm it lewrie drew out his golddamascened silver pocket watch and opened it so that was a battle he thought i cant see anything we accomplished if this is the glory of naval life you can have this nautical humbug how do you make all that prize money or make a name for yourself when youre down below getting bored to death lewrie took himself off to the cockpit for their issue of rum then came back up to perform noon sights which he got wrong as usual resulting in an hour of racing up and down the mainmast later at dinner he noticed the many long faces around their mess table finnegan and turner mr brail the captains clerk a couple of surgeons mates shirke chapman ashburn and himself bascombe was in the day watch except for the sound of cutlery it was dead quiet well perhaps not too quiet there was the sound of the masters mates finnegan and turner as they chomped and chewed and gargled and hawkedboth of them were what were termed rough feeders um this morning alan said clearing his throat which raised an involuntary groan from everyone as they thought of their poor performance what happened exactly nothin worth talkin about finnegan mumbled bloody shambles chapman said with a blank stare for him to make a comment of any kind was rare we werent handled at all badly ashburn said between bites placed right clever if you ask me but the gunnery alan prompted aye that was awful shirke said its like harvey was telling us we havent spent much time at gun drill weve drilled turner said jus never fired the damn things cept fer salutin and pissin off merchant masters good gunners gone stale new uns couldnt hit a spit kid if it were tied to their mouths they were pretty fast too i expect that didnt help alan said dauntless did alright keith ashburn said got hits on her foe chased her off and chased off that brig once it got past us no one could have caught that schooner once she got past us though lost five ships not a bad mornings work for em damn their eyes and theres no way we could get them back alan asked beat up to windward against more weatherly ships and leave the rest the convoy ta get took finnegan shook his head yere a young booby aint ya wot its all about is we got beat see younker them damned rebel jonathans done beat us alan saw new york again but only from the anchorage at sandy hook he got to go ashore but only as far as the fleet landing with a cutter full of demoralized and sullen hands who had to be watched constantly to keep them from drink or the many brothels fresh supplies had to be ferried out more coal and firewood fresh water livestock and wine and crates of fruit and vegetables bumboats were out offering women rum and gewgaws but the ship was not allowed out of discipline only bales and the purser actually got to step ashore for pleasure the officers sulked in their wardroom aft lolling over long pipes and full mugs when there was no drill exercise or working party the midshipmen and mates stood anchor watch in their stead for the humdrum task of waiting envying the men in the guard boats who rowed about to prevent desertion or watch against a hostile move it was an unhappy existence the ship lay at anchor for days stewing in the blustery early spring rains and fickle winds too wet to stay topside and too warm and airless to stay below ariadne shifted her beakhead to point at the colony then at england groaning her way all about the compass the seeming lack of purpose and their recent poor showing began to grate on everyone people began to put in requests for a change of mess a sure sign of trouble below decks there were more floggings for fighting more backtalking and insubordination more slow work at tasks assigned god knew where they got it but lots of men were turning up drunk and getting their dozen lashes on the gratings every forenoon watch if he didnt have to set some sort of example he wouldnt have minded getting cupshot himself alan decided here i stand dripping wet cant see a cable the food stinks the people stink and i still cant get ashore for sport why cant i help out on the pressgang or the patrol what a nautical picture you make keith told him as he climbed to the quarterdeck to join him perhaps a watercolor is appropriate water is the word alan agreed feeling the wet seeping down his spine under the heavy tarpaulin he wore mister brail and the jack in the bread room said we could buy fresh food from shore on the next trip for cabin stores any ideas a warm dry whore for starters lewrie muttered seriously keith scoffed potatoes lewrie said with some heat id love some boiled potatoes and carrots with parsnip turkey or goose coffee wine thats one meal how about some onions drag it back aboard and ill go shares god what a shitten life this is alan mourned it will get better once were back at sea this idling is bad for us keith said whats the bloody difference lewrie eyed a passing barge with the spy glass ahoy there passing came the faint reply boredom and deprivation in port is pretty much like boredom and deprivation at sea only not as noisy lewrie griped at least at sea were too busy to care of all the ships i had to be put on why this one why not one that can shoot and do something exciting well do better ashburn promised firmly now we see how bad we did weve been working the gun crews properly do you really believe that alan drawled of course i do i have to is the rest of the navy like this because if it is iii be glad to make my fortune as a pimp soon as were paid off thats disloyal talk alan ashburn told him oh for gods sake keith youre educated youve been in a couple of ships now lets just say i have a fresher outlook tell me if youve seen better ships and dont go all noble about it alan you must know that i love the navy keith began believe me after listening to you for three months i know it ariadne is not the best ive served in keith muttered whats your concern youre the one was dragooned here its all ive ever wanted all your talk about prize money and fame alan said what do i have if this war ends a small rouleau of guineas and thats it in peacetime id end up selling my clothes in a year i cant go home and without a full purse i cant set myself up in any trade i think i could make a go of this miserable as it can be at times if i were on another ship one that could fight and shoot and go where the prize money is hark the true sailorman keith was amused at lewries sudden ambitions which made him sound like any officer or warrant that ashburn had ever listened to bravo well make a postcaptain of you yet or kill me first alan said but the fantasy was tempting if i were a postcaptain wouldnt that make all those bastards back home bite on the furniture now that would be a pretty crow pie ariadne finally weighed and sailed and it was back across the atlantic to england with another convoy once home she swung about her anchor in plymouth in falmouth in bristol before shepherding more ships across the atlantic to halifax louisburg or new york facing the same winds the same seas the same food and hours of gun drill and sail handling with the same work of replenishment and loading at each end until ariadne could have done it in her sleep some men died fallen from aloft and vanished astern some sickened from the weather and came down with the flux some could not stomach the food though it was more plentiful and regular than what they would have gotten in their country crofts and more healthful than the dubious offerings of a slum ordinary some were injured by cargo or gun carriages and suffered amputation men were ruptured by heaving on lines or cables men went on a steady parade to the gratings so many miles were rolled off astern across the ocean in all her moods and weathers so many pounds of saltbeef pork biscuit peas and raisins and flour were issued so many gallons of small beer red wine and tan water were swallowed it all blended into seven months of such a limitless unremarked and pointless existence that hardly anything seemed to relieve it of its sameness there were some small delights even so he crossed swords at small arms drill with lieutenant harm and thoroughly humiliated him to the clandestine joy of the other midshipmen and most of the crew and there were moments of freedom when the ship was moored so far out that rowing supplies out would have halfkilled the hands and alan discovered the pleasure of sailing a small boat under a lugsail racing other cutters to the docks on a day of brisk wind then a quick quart for all hands before racing back with his new detennination to succeed burning in him he pored over all the books on the ship and the only books were nautical in nature it was impossible not to learn something one can only practice a task so long without gaining the knowledge of how to do it and more important when unless one were like chapman do a bad knot get a caning or a tonguelashing so one learns a world of useful knots do a bad splice and be called a booby by people who have your career in their hands and one learns to do a good splice execute the steps of gun drill so often get quizzed on the amount of powder to be used in various circumstances until youre letter perfect and you no longer get abused go aloft until you know every reef cringle and clewgarnet block and splinter of spars and one finally is allowed a grudging competence to be able to fulfill ones duty from both the officers and the senior hands measure the sun at noon and work out the spherical trigonometry often enough and you soon learn what is right and what is wrong whether you really like doing it or not and navigation can become a tedious but useful skill and not a horror of stupid errors and their price and with each slowly gained bit of knowledge with each more seamanly performed chore with each more day full of danger and challenge that was experienced lewrie noticed a change in the way he was treated from the captain from kenyon certainly old ellison the sailing master the mates the bosun the marine captain even from mr swift he found less harsh shouting or exasperated invective fewer occasions to be bent over a gun for his own good there was a gruff acceptance of him and his abilities as though he and the blue coat were one and he could do anything that any other blue coat on a blustery nightdeck could do in their seagoing pony show and his new anonymity was blissful and when he performed something so particularly well that even he knew it there was now and then a firm nod or a bleak smile or even a grunt of approval that was as much a treat to his spirits as an hour with a wench with the keys to her masters wine cabinet there were too the reactions of his fellow midshipmen to go by there was ashburns bemused acceptance shirke and bascombes sullen scowls of disdain at his progress there were chapmans heavy sighs as he realized that he was being surpassed by yet one more contender for commission and that his own chances were flying farther from his poor grasp every day and there was the unspoken deference of the younger boys like beckett and striplin who were already cowed by his size and seeming maturity and now by his knowledge which had accrued faster than theirs most especially there was the hot glow of dislike that lewrie felt whenever he was around rolston that was so warming that he thought he could easily toast cheese on it ashburn had been the top dog in a blue coat then rolston in the officers estimations it was only natural that an older boy such as lewrie once he had attained rolstons level in skill and sealore would be thought of as more competent by those worthies which would automatically force their opinion of young rolston down to third place perhaps lower much as it galled him lewrie realized his life had become more tolerable since he had in the parlance taken a round turn and two half hitches but that is not to say that he did not secretly loathe every bloody minute of it chapter by the grace of god and the pleasure of the admiralty ariadne was saved from her ennui by new orders lewrie could have kissed them in delight he still shivered with cold as the ship was driven hard to the westsou west by a stiff trade wind it was a grey miserable afternoon with an overcast as dull as a cheap pewter bowl and the sea pale green and white humping high as hills on either beam the ship held her starboard gangway near the water as she forged her way across the atlantic to their new duty station in the west indies somewhere over the larboard beam was portugal and she was beginning to pick up the trades that sweep clockwise about the huge basin that is the atlantic and blow due west for the islands soon she would turn the comer and ron with a landsmans breeze right up her stem for an entire and exotic new world and alan wondered what it would be like to be warm all the time to get soaking wet and not consider it a disaster to see new sights and smells and delight in the fabled pleasures of those far harbors like having a woman againany woman four bells chimed from the forecastle belfry pm and the end of the first dog watch soon unless sail had to be reduced for the night they would stand to evening quarters at the great guns then he could go below out of the harsh winds for more of the smell and the damp and the evil motion of the ship lewrie sighed in frustration about the women or the lack of them about the irritating sameness of shipboard life and the need to see an unfamiliar face hear a new voice telling new jokes about the bland and boiled mediocrity of the food and most especially about the eternity of life in the navy it had been eight months now with an educated eye he could see that ariadne was broadreaching on the larboard tack with the wind large on her quarter utilizing jibs fore and main staysls two reefs in the topsls and three reefs in the courses the glass was rising and the seas were calming after a day of bashing through half a gale captain bales strode the quarterdeck deep in thought and the sailing master mr ellison leaned on the waisthigh bulwarks about the wheel and binnacle squinting at the sails lieutenant swift loafed by the mizzen shrouds on the lee side with the watch officer lieutenant church bales would peer aloft at the seas astern and sniff the air heavily alan grimaced as he knew what was coming they would have to take in the courses and take a third reef in the topsls for the night he was halfway to the weather shrouds before captain bales shared a silent eye conference with the sailing master and made his decision all hands swift bellowed as the bosuns pipes shrilled hands aloft to shorten sail to ease the wind aloft ariadne carne more southerly to take the wind abeam waisters hauled in the braces to larboard with the third reef came the need for preventer braces and backstays parcels aloft to keep the yards from swinging and flogging sails not so much with an eye to sail or yard damage but to keep the topmen from being flung out and down by a heavy smack by the flying canvas lewrie left his hat on deck not wanting it to disappear in the harsh wind going aloft had not gotten any easier for him it still brought his scrotum up to his navel each time go lads go captain bales shouted from below as they passed onto the futtock shrouds crack on mister lewrie speed em on fine day to get singled out by the old fart he thought miserably now ill have to be all keen with him watching the wind was a brutal live force aloft buffeting him and setting his clothing rattling and the higher he went the harder it was to breathe as the wind made his cheeks flutter they assembled in the main crosstrees once the yards were braced to satisfaction and the preventers and parrels rigged it was time to layout on the yard the top captain went out to the weather side first lewrie following rolston went to the lee side after the number two man the yard had been lowered slightly and was drumming like a pigeons wing as the top captain prepared to pass the weather earring to the third reef line haul to weather facing inboard on the yard and footrope they hauled with all their might to shift the weight of the sail as it was clewed up once hauled up it was lewries honor to duck below the yard and pass the earring through the reef cringle to the third man seated astride the yardarm once secured and hugging the spar for dear life it was the lee arms turn to perform that dangerous duty then it was nailbreaking herniating exertion to reach forward and haul in the flogging sail tucking the folds under ones chest until the third reef was gathered snug then came another dangerous chore no less so now that the sail was under control and the reeftackles had tautened one had to squat down on the footrope one arm from the elbow down the only secure hold from a nasty death and reach under the yard once again ones shoulder below the yard to grab the dancing reef points and bring them back up so they could be tied off lewrie could hear rolston giving someone absolute hell on the lee yardarm for not seizing his on the first try the first and second top captains surveyed their handiwork and found it good below them other men were still tidying up taking in the main course the forecourse would be left at three reefs since it was a lifting effect on the bows lay in from the yard thank christ lewrie thought glad to have survived once more they gathered in the top and began making their way down to the deck lewrie took hold of the preventer backstay that was already twanging with the weight of the men who had preceded him and began to descend after glancing over to sting rolston with a smug look he lowered himself away quickly and neatly hand over hand smearing his clothing with tar and tallow then there was a shrill scream he took a death grip on the preventer backstay and locked his legs about it tighter than a virgin without a further bit of thought it definitely saved his life he glanced up and the whole world was filled by a dirty blueandwhitechecked shirt and a mans mouth open in a toothy rictus of terror horny fingers raked like talons on the sleeve of his jacket ripping one hand from his grip and unconsciously he clenched his hand as though to grab back though it would have been his own death to have tried the desperate hand caught on the white turnback cuff of his left sleeve and ripped it loose then the man fell past him and lewrie watched him with dumb amazement as he performed a lazy spin faceupwards and limbs flailing to smack spine first onto the inner edge of the starboard gangway lewrie could hear the mans spine snap over the harsh final thump of the impact and then gibbs late maintopman in the starboard watch dribbled off the edge of the gangway and fell to the upper gun deck like a limp sack of grain his bowels turned to water and his own limbs began to so tremble he was himself lucky to reach the deck without accident but he had to satisfy his morbid curiosity so he made his way forward until he had a good view after the bosuns mates had shooed away the hands captain bales was standing over the man sadly while the surgeon tried to discover some sign of life the surgeon stood up to signify that it was hopeless gibbs would be commented upon in the log and the ships books with a very final dd discharged dead washed by the surgeons mates and sewn up for burial in the morning by the sailmaker and his crew a brave attempt sir bales said to lewrie showing the scrap of white cuff he held in his hand sir lewrie asked in shock does he actually think i tried to save the poor bastard alan gawped to himself hawkes bales said to he second top captain who had been on the lee yardarm and who was now weeping openly for his dead friend you must keep a better control of your people aloft ill not have them skylarking in the rigging aye sir hawkes said cutting a black glance at rolston who lewrie observed was standing near and eyeing the corpse with a bright fascination and licking his lips as if in satisfaction what happened mister rolston bales demanded gibbs overbalanced on the footrope sir reaching for a stay before he was on the crosstrees rolston answered quickly unable to tear his gaze from the bloody body bent at so unnatural an angle or unable to face bales hard stare it was too far to reach did he indeed lewrie wondered you had it in for him for backtalking everybody knows that had him gagged with a marlinspike half the day watch yesterday nobodys so stupid as to leap that far for a stay theres something going on here and i dont think youre the innocent bartholomew baby you appear to be i could square your yards rightproper with this if i handle it right was that what happened hawkes bales asked i i suppose it was sir he wanted to say something else but not knowing how to in front of his betters he sounded more resigned than anything else once they were below after evening quarters lewrie searched for a way to begin supper was over the dingy mess cloth removed and hot rumpunch circulating in lieu of decent port the surgeons mates were absent still preparing the body finnegan and turner were munching on hard cheese and biscuit at the head of the table the captains clerk brail was writing a letter lord what trash keith said softly wincing at the bite of the rum id give anything for a run ashore and a real port for an afterdinner treat at least well be able to buy fresh stores at antigua shirke said the ships even running low on wellfed rats to cook twoapenny now not three bascombe said rubbing his eyes in weariness its amazing what an english sailor can eat if he can catch it finnegan said boozily now me id admire me a quart of strong ale ya can have yer black strap n yer claret n yer port ales a good christian drink the pause had been to release a spectacular belch turner nodded agreeably making a gobbling noise through a cheekful of cheese and for you chapman shirke asked nudging bascombe so he could appreciate his wit chapman ponderous and dim was always good for a laugh oh chapman pondered long knowing he was being made fun of once more and determined to respond in kind but not quite sure how country beer was always mce back home cool stoup on a hot day after bringing in the sheaves shirke said with a straight and innocent face i like wine too chapman said his face flushing with the effort of erudition and repartee a mce white now and again miss taylor ill wager bascombe said naming the thin acrid white issued by the purser im partial to ale chapmans fists clenched it was dangerous to goad him further for he was a big and powerful lout who could explode if pushed too far lewrie had made that mistake once and had been bashed silly for it before he learned to recognize the waming signs did you really murder that topman today lewrie shirke asked turmng to safer game no but i mcked him with my dirk as he went by lewrie said with a grin a hands spectacular death plunge had to be a topic of conversation in so closed a world sooner or later and alan was more than ready for it it would have been remarkable if no one had thought or said a word about it did he sass you too bascombe laughed wasnt gagging with a marlinspike good enough i looked up and there he was and i distinctly heard him say bugger all you officer shits quickly followed by aarrgh splat lewrie went on giving a shrill sound by way of punctuation which had them all hooting and tittering ere now ave some respeck fer the dead young sir turner said ill not ave it sorry mister thmer lewrie said trying to sound contrite men die in a kings ship finnegan said into the awkward silence no need to make fun of em adoin it gibbs was a good hand indeed he was mister finnegan lewrie said i never found him a backtaiker or a sea lawyer very reliable very steady not steady today shirke said softly bringing grins back there was danger enough to reef topsls before the wind keith said shaking his head sadly but he fell when all that was over with on the way down what happened to him rolston says he jumped from the footrope to the preventer backstay and overbalanced lewrie told them i heard him say it how cunnythumbed can you be bascombe said how dumb and what do you think brail asked looking up from his letter and speaking to lewrie brail was close to the captain and the affairs aft but did not trade on his confidences or what he could learn so he was most reticent in the mess never initiating conversation well alan began thinking i have to be careful here i cannot accuse but will have to plant seeds instead to take rolston down a peg hes such a bullying little shit itll do everyone a favor to have the captain sit on him with some stiff warning hawkes didnt look too happy about it i mean rolston was riding gibbs that might have upset his judgment alan said as calmly as he could extending his left arm and sleeve which still sported the torn cuff as eloquent a sign of his supposed bravery as a ribbon and star of knighthood what do you mean about hawkes brait asked putting on his legal face brail held himself aloof from the common herd because he had been a lawyers clerk at one time and fancied himself as a man who could see his way to the kernel of an argument with the discerning logic of the law though any clerk who had to give topsl payment and take sea service was automatically suspect of being a bit less acute than he thought himself to be hawkes did agree with rolston but i dont think his heart was in it lewrie said pouring himself another measure of grog but you are not suggesting that rolston actually did anything aloft to make gibbs fall to his death brail pressed lewrie knew any scuttlebutt from below decks would reach the captain through brai god that would be unthinkable i totally disavow any notion mister brai yet rolston was riding him you say well shouting at him to get a move on that sort of thing and where were you on the weather yardarm rolston and gibbs were on the lee i was nexttolast down from my side except for blunt and then here came gibbs screaming down right at me so you did not actually see anything brail concluded no i did not and mister braii the way youre asking these questions you seem to think there was something wrong done now i told you i refuse to place blame on anyone but it does seem queer that a steady topman like gibbs would take such a risk ashburn put in who was left from the lee side oh keith not you too alan said well gibbs rolston and hawkes who would have been at the lee earring and cringle at least i think so i wasnt paying much attention to anything but just getting down to the deck myself once i got to the crosstrees now look here youre pressing me to make some kind of charge against rolston and im not going to do it granted hes a little swine and i dislike him more than cold boiled mutton but it has to be an accident doesnt it accidents happen all the time no matter how careful one is maybe gibbs was stung by something rolston said that took his mind off safety at the wrong moment shirke said maybe just being on the same yard together was enough after the way he had been hazing him well never know i know id hate to be on the same yard with rolston bascombe said expressing everyones general opinion brailleft it at that agreeing to take a bumper with ashburn but lewrie knew that he was still puzzling about it inside and that his suspicions would get back to the captain rolston would be called aft and given a roasting maybe even caned over a gun for not keeping proper concerns for safety uppermost it would be a tidy comedown for him in every officers mind that would make the little bastard seethe lewrie thought and make him a little less eager to bully and bluster and his own reputation would shine in comparison which was the primary goal lewrie rolled into his hammock and blankets quite pleased with himself that night and happily fuzzled by too much hot grog slept peacefully as ariadne rocked along in the night gibbs funeral was held the next morning after dawn quarters and deck cleaning bales read from the prayer book as the men swayed in even lines since ariadne did not carry a clergyman as the sun rose in strength on what promised to be a bright day of sparkling waves and blue skies the body was slipped over the side sewn up in scrap canvas with a final stitch through the nose to make sure that gibbs really was a corpse to satisfy the superstition of the hands rusty roundshot at his feet to speed his passage to the unknown depths below immediately after the hands were dismissed ships routine reasserted itself hammocks were piped up from below and the hands were released for breakfast hundreds of bare feet thundered on oak decks as the men took themselves off for a hearty meal and captain bales crooked a finger at rolston summoning him aft to his cabins which sight delighted lewrie breakfast was also delightful porridge and scraps of saltpork and crumbled biscuit in a salmongundy with scotch coffee and small beer for drink lewrie was taking a second helping when rolston appeared in their mess his face was as white as his coat facings except for two dots of red on his cheeks before anyone could say anything to him the angry young midshipman leaped for alan ill see you in hell you vicious bastard he cleared the table scattering bowls and plates and mugs in a shower of food then dove at lewrie as he attempted to rise from his seat on his chest lewrie fell to the deck with both of rolstons hands on his throat and his weight on top of him damme i didnt expect him to try to kill me lewrie thought in shock as he struggled and flailed to free his throat there were other hands there in a moment however prying rolston loose and hauling them both to their feet you miserable lying bastard you said i killed gibbs ill kill you for it rolston cried wriggling to break free the hell i did alan shot back i didnt say it actually just hinted round it he qualified to himself in the privacy of this mess i said it was a shame you were riding him and thats all nobody is going to make me make a false report not even against you it was an accident rolston said but its all over the ship i pushed him or something and its your fault i want you dead as he said it he shoved hard to his left breaking bascombe loose from him and dragging free of keiths grip before anyone could restrain him he drew his dirk and dove at lewrie with the point held forward alan ducked across the compartment as fmnegan and turner and the surgeons mates seized rolston again this time disarming him and forcing him to kneel on the deck stand to attention the lot of you lieutenant swift ordered from the doorway he had the masteratarms and two ships corporals with him he stepped inside taking in the dirk in finnegans fist rolston held down and raging lewrie looking as pale as a spook and the mess littered with overturned utensils and bowls now whats all this about did i hear you threaten a mans life mister rolston explain yourself damned fast boy sir did you accuse rolston of causing gibbs death mister lewrie no sir i did not alan vowedwith crossed fingers did he give anyone reason to think rolston did it swift asked the general mess he was quickly informed that he had not though the common opinion was against rolston and his temper lewrie had refused to countenance such a thought hes a clever liar sir dont believe him from rolston are you going to tell me that this is not your dirk rolston are you going to deny drawing it and attacking mister lewrie i ashburn was there a physical attack in these quarters with a weapon swift turned to his trustworthy senior midshipman aye sir there was ashburn said reluctantly knowing he was sealing rolstons fate he described the events gave lewrie a fair report and quoted rolstons avowed purpose of murder masteratarms i shall have mister rolston taken aft to the captain at once charge of striking a fellow junior warrant and fighting with steel swift said specifying a charge less than murder or the attempt at it which would automatically qualify for hanging mister swift sir rolston gasped realizing what was to fall on him please sir no now get this place put to rights swift said this mess looks like a pigsty i shall expect all of you to be ready to go aft when the captain summons you aye aye sir they mumbled in a rough chorus as swift took the evidence from finnegan and strode out sufferin jesus chapman breathed after swift was safely gone thats all for that little bosscock rolston be damned shirke said just look at my breeches idiot what chapman asked i meant rolston shirke replied quickly trying to wipe food from his clothing with the tablecloth whats going to happen to him lewrie asked the whole joke had gotten way out of hand he had not expected rolston to come for him like that and was badly shaken you notice the first lieutenant didnt say attempted murder so i doubt theyll scrag him for it bascombe said ive never seen anything like that disrating mostlike chapman said flog him raw and pack him off home soon as we get to antigua for losing his temper lewrie asked i mean we go after each other all the time down here we all have bruises to prove it whens the last time i drew a blade on you and said id kill you keith asked him at least a week ago be serious for once alan that man tried to kill you not just wave a dirk about and shout at you ashburn said sternly hes for it now just as well before he got control over people a man who cant control his passions is obviously not a gentleman at least that passion shirkepicked up some bowls though a passion for the ladies is allowed by the navy if thats so i havent seen much sign of it lewrie sighed the next day in the forenoon watch rolston was paraded on deck there had been a swift inquiry with all involved hands testifying it also included details of what had happened with gibbs with hawkes giving the impression that while it may have been accidental it pleased rolston greatly while captain bales could not hold a courtmartial that took a panel of five captains he could assign a punishment for fighting and assaulting a fellow midshipman with a weapon sea officers had the power of life and death in their hands for though the admiralty might limit the number of lashes a man might receive written reports exceeding those limits never brought even a peep of displeasure from whitehall out of reach of land and senior authority a captain could do pretty much as he pleased so while the marines were formed up with their muskets on the quarterdeck the officers below the rail on the upper gun deck and the midshipmen to one side rolston was called to punishment a hatch grating was stood up and lashed to the gangway and the bosun and his mates stood by with a red baize bag which contained a cato ninetails bales read out the charges against rolston and asked him if he had anything to say rolston bitris lip and did not have any words bales referred to his slim book containing the articles of war and read the specific passages aloud to drum into the hands the folly of fighting or laying hands on one another much less a senior the twentythird article bales intoned in a loud voice if any person in the fleet shall quarrel or fight with any other person in the fleet or use reproachfuj or provoking speeches or gestures tending to make any quarrel or disturbance he shall upon being convicted thereof suffer such punishment as the offence shall deserve and a courtmartial shall impose bales also made reference to the thirtysixth article the captains cloak headed all other crimes not capital snapping the book shut he ordered seize him up rolston was clad in shirt and breeches the shirt was ripped off his back and a leather apron tied over his kidneys and buttocks they pressed him against the grating and tied him spreadeagled with spun yarn give him a dozen bosuns mate ream took off his coat and took the cat out of the bag the lengths were not knotted since it was not mutiny theft or desertion but that was cold comfort ream settled himself and drew back he delivered the first stroke rolston was a roy after all a vicious bullying sixteenyearold roy not made to take a mans punishment the lash made his whole oody leap against the gratings with a thud and he gasped audibly regular as a slow metronome the lashes struck home by the end of the first dozen rolstons back was crisscrossed by angry weals and already turning blue and mottled yellow from the savage pounding he was weeping silently and had bit his lip trying to be game arout it another rosun bales ordered at the end of the first dozen jesus god i started this lewrie told himself sadly theyre halfkilling the little shit and its my fault i truly do hate him but was it worth this the second rosun laid on his first stroke and this time rolston screamed not a yell not a plea for mercy but a womanish scream of agony the next stroke knocked the air from his lungs his back was now streaming blood where further lashes had broken open the inflamed weals the youngest midshipmen that lewrie saw were either weeping openly or staring as though the flogging had happened not a moment too soon to please them rolston would have been the oldest in the gun room and would have made their little lives hell lewrie looked at the lines of men and he saw furtive gleams of pleasure there was none of the swaying or shuffling they normally showed when they thought a punishment had found the wrong person perhaps it was an accident about gibbs but to the ships people the punishment fit the crime or answered their sense of a final justice the punishment ended after two dozen it was doubtful if rolston would have survived a third and he was so lost in agony already that one more stroke would not have affected him or served a useful purpose he was cut down and hauled off to the sickbay the deck was washed down and the grating put back in place the men were dismissed and chivvied off to prepare for morning gun drill and cleaning rolston was officially disrated deprived of gun room privilege and dressed in slop clothing like a common seaman he was also confined in the brig as soon as the surgeon was through with him there to languish until they docked lewrie quit mooning lieutenant kenyon snapped as he saw him lounging by the bulwarks sorry sir i was thinking about rolston just now dont waste your time kenyon told him lewrie gave it a long thought then decided to come clean about his scheme to ruin his rival but kenyon forestalled him i still do not think he caused gibbs to fall but the captain had enough suspicion to reprimand him and the way he went after you was the end of him yes but so you crowed about it in the mess believe me i know what its like to see a rival confounded and rolston was not the most popular man aboard either how often have i seen him having men up on charge to satisfy his petty grudges or just to see a flogging no he is no loss to us he was a brutal little monster and would have been a real terror as an officer god help us as a captain that kind we dont need in the navy i feel as if i precipitated the attack sir so what kenyon shrugged so might any of the others who had a reason to wonder what happened aloft let hawkes and blunt stew on it long enough and it might have been rolston who came down from the rigging next and then wed have had to hang two good topmen for the sake of one bad midshipman i doubt if hed let me admit rape of his only sister alan told himself maybe i did do something right after all youre shaping devilishwell as a midshipman lewrie er thank you sir even though you thoroughly detest the navy were better off with your kind than his and dont tell me you love the navy like ashburn does cause ive seen you when no one was looking i was not exactly enamored of going to sea when i was a boy either but there were reasons why it was necessary i still do not love it but i have a future in it youll make your way thank you for telling me that sir i said nothing mister lewri now i expect you to make sure to inspect the mess tables and report which mess has not scrubbed up properly and check the bread barges too aye aye sir for the next couple of weeks of their passage the world seemed incredibly sweet to alan the weather was fresh and clean with deep blue skies and highpiled clouds with no threat in them from the usual disturbed grey green color the ocean changed to a spectacular shade of blue that glittered and folded and rose again under a balmy sun so that it was as painful to look upon as a gem under a strong light in the steady trade winds ariadne shook out the reefs in her topsls and hoisted her t gallants for the first time in months even setting studdingsails on the main course yard and except for sail drill each day there was less cause to reef and furl free of convoys and sluggish merchantmen she proved that she could fly with better weather and steadier footand handholds alan practically lived aloft in the rigging as they traded their heavy stonn sails for a lighter set lowering tons of strained and patched flaxen sails to be aired and folded away the new being bent onto the yards and stays clearer skies also allowed better classes in navigation and the measuring of the noon suns height with their quadrants or the newfangled sextant that was mr ellisons pride and joy alan found himself becoming pleasingly accurate at plotting their position dry decks and a following wind also gave better footing for small arms drillmusketry firing at towed kegs pistol practice pike training tomahawks or boarding axes and lewries favorite sword work kenyon let him borrow a slightly curved hunting sword or hanger and he became adept with it for it was much lighter than a naval cutlass to handle but was meant to be used partially in the same way stamp and slash ashburns tutor had been spanish so he knew the twobladed fighting style of rapier and main gauche while alan knew the fighting style of the london streets smalls word and cloak lantern or walking stick for a mobile shield they delighted in practicing on each other it was good exercise and taught raw landsmen how to survive at close quarters though once in action it was pretty much expected that they would forget most of what they had been taught and fall back on their instincts which were to flail away madly and batter someone to death rather than apply any science to the task the masteratanns was not a swordsman and as lewrie had proved months before neither was the lieutenantatanns lieutenant harm so marine captain osmonde had been summoned from his life of ease in the wardroom to instruct at swordplay lewrie was not exactly sure that a marine officer had any duties to perform except for looking elegant and lending a measure of tone to what was a minor squirearchy gathering aft his sergeants did all the work and he supposedly served as some sort of catering officer to the other officers which might have taken an hour a week yet osmonde was lean to the point of gauntness always immaculately turned out in snowwhite breeches waistcoat and shirt his neckcloth perfect his silk stockings looking brand new his red tunic and scarlet sash without a speck of tar or even dust and his gold and brass and silver fit to blind the unwary lewrie was quite taken with osmonde for his skill with a sword his gorgeous uniform his egalitarian way of talking to the petty officers and midshipmen at drill he did not talk to his own marines ever and mostly with the fact that the man did not appear to ever have to do a lick of work and got paid right well for it even getting to sleep in every night with no interruptions i see you still sport mister kenyons hanger osmonde said to him one sweaty day on the larboard gangway at drill aye sir and short enough to get under guard you would benefit with hefting a regulation cutlass put that away and do so osmonde said carefully phrasing each word aye sir lewrie sheathed the wonderful little sword and dug a heavy cutlass from a tub of weapons he looked around for an opponent and found everyone already engaged here we shall faceoff each the other osmonde said this shall be good for you i notice you are a wrist player do you good to learn to hack and slash to strengthen your whole arm seems such a clumsy way sir and inelegant lewrie said taking up a middle guard so shall your opponent be should we ever be called upon to board a foe some common seaman osmonde said clashing blades with him he began to backpedal lewrie across the gangway with crashing blows while continuing to speak as if he were seated in a club chair you shall advance so gallantly and with such grace as to make your old pushing school proud and some hulking brute like fowles there will chop you to chutney before you can shout en garde lewrie fetched up at the quarterdeck netting backed into it by the fury of the attack and the weight of the opposing blade the damned thing has no point worth mentioning so quit trying to frighten me with it osmonde said try a twohanded swing if it helps they went back down the gangway toward the bows lewrie still retreating and his arms growing heavier by the minute the idea is to hack your opponent down not dance a quadrille with him osmonde said his swings remorseless and the flat of the blade he wielded bringing stinging slaps on lewries arms lewrie tried to respond with some wittiness but could not find his voice which was lost in a bale of raw cotton so dry was he he was nearing the foredeck and planted his feet and began to swing back with both arms clanging his blade against osmondes his arms were so tired they felt nerveless though engorged with blood and heavy each meeting of the blades made his hands sting and he found it more difficult to keep a grip on the wooden handle with an air of desperation he thrust the curved hilt into osmondes shoulder and shoved him back then aimed a horizontal swipe at him with all his remaining strength that should have removed a months worth of the officers hair but osmondes blade was just suddenly there and his own recoiled away with a mighty clang almost tom from his grasp and then osmonde thrust at him which he barely countered off to the right then osmonde brought a reverse stroke back at him and when their blades met this time lewries spun away from his exhausted grip osmonde laughed and tapped him lightly on the head with the flat of the sword not elegant was it no sir alan replied between racking gulps of air humiliating experience bloody right sir such language from a young gentleman but better being humiliated than killed by someone with bad breath and no forehead fetch your cutlass and well get some water in warmer climes a butt of water was kept on deck with a square cut or scuttled into the upper staves so that a small cup could be dipped inside without spillage it was too long incask that water and tan with oak and animaicules but in lewries parched condition it was sparkling wine most men are afraid of blades lewrie osmonde told him as he sipped at his water making a face at the color and taste thats why people were so glad that gunpowder and muskets and cannon were invented you dont have to get within reach of a blade or a point to get rid of the other bastard i am glad to see you are not one of them thank you sir lewrie replied i think most men these days wear swords the way they wear hats osmonde sighed handing the cup back to lewrie or to give them a longer reach at the buffet table yet society and the navy require us to face up to the enemy with steel in our hands fortunately for us the frogs and the dons are a bunch of capering poltroons for all their supposed skills as swordsmen and swordsmiths but there are a few men who are truly dangerous with a sword like you sir alan grinned hoping to flatter do not toady to me lewrie i was merely asking if you thought yourself dangerous sir yes yes i am i am because i like cold steel osmonde said with a casualness that sent a chill down lewries sweaty back i can shoot i can fence prettily but i can also hack with the best of em axe cutlass boarding pike take your pick ever duel once sir back home ever blaze no sir smaiisword only i pinked him huzzah for you how did you feel weil was he skilled no sir he was easy to pink and you were properly brave osmonde sniffed well you were both frightened hands damp throat dry trembling all over probably pale as death but you stood up game as a little lion did you not yes i did sir alan said getting a little tired of being humiliated it was only natural and until you are really skillful with steel you will always feel that way trusting to luck and hoping the foe is clumsy like going aloft which i sincerely thank god i do not have to do one learns caution but goes when called by facing ones fear and conquering it i think i see sir most likely you do not but you shall someday you do not know how many young fools have rushed blindly into danger and died for their supposed honor or for glory those two have buried more idiots than the plague heroism cannot conquer all youll run into someone better someday better to be truly dangerous and let them come like sheep to the slaughter let the other fool die for his honor your job is to kill him not with grace and style but with anything that comes to hand i suppose id live longer if i were that sort of man sir lewrie asked not above placing his valuable skin at a high premium exactly so i suggest you find the oldest and heaviest cutlass aboard and practice with that until a smallsword or hanger becomes like a feather in your hand keep fitter than the other fellow not only will you tire less easily but the ladies prefer a fit man aye sir lewrie replied now on familiar ground practice with all this ironmongery until they each become an instinctive part of you i will let you know if you are slacking aye sir lewrie said not looking forward to it it was a lot of work and he had to admit that the sight of a pike head coming for his eyes was most unnerving i shall try though the ships routine does take time from it it must be easier to devote oneself to steel if one were a marine officer sir tempted to be a bullock mister lewrie the thought had crossed my mind sir prohibitively expensive to purchase a commission dyou know osmonde said by way of dismissal certain appearances to maintain in the mess as well well alan said turning to go as seven bells of the forenoon watch rang out and the bosuns pipes sounded cleardecksandupspirits for the daily rum ration osmondes marine orderly was there with a small towel and osmondes smallsword and tunic as the marine sniffed the air from the galley funnel bugger the snooty bastards anyway alan muttered going below to his own mess soaking wet from the exertion he dropped off lieutenant kenyons hanger and vowed that before the voyage was over captain osmonde would rate him as a dangerous man days passed as ariadne made her westing running down a line of latitude that would take them direct to antigua as resolutely as a dray would stay within the banks of a country lane there were two schools of thought about that it made navigation easier to perform and could almost be done by dead reckoning with a quick peek at the traverse board to determine distance run from one noon to the next but it was a lazy civilian way of doing things or it was quite clever since lazy civilian merchant captains would do it and that put ariadne in a position to intercept enemy indiamen or conversely those privateers who might be lying in wait to prey upon british ships but since the ship had not distinguished herself in the past as a great fighting ship the latter was a minority opinion gun drill and some live firings were practiced but it was undertaken with the tacit assumption that ariadne would never fire those guns in angerspite or pique perhaps but not battleand it showed what a happy ship we are alan thought stripping off his coat and waistcoat as he sat down for dinner following one of those morning gun drills in the forenoon watch lieutenant harm had yelled himself hoarse with threats and curses to the gun crews on the lower deck and the mechanical way they had gone through the motions and when lewrie had told some of them to remember to swab out so they would do it for real in action harm had screeched something like a midshipman giving advice by the nailed christ and for him to shut the hell up if he knew what was good for him there may have been a war raging in the colonies all round the world as france spain perhaps soon even holland joined to support the rebels and rehash the seven years war and ships may have fought in these very waters somewhere over the horizon british vessels could be up to closepistolshot with the broadsides howling but the general idea was that ariadne was not part of that same fleet and never would be so drilling on the great guns was makework sullenly accepted the pork joint in their mess was half bone and gristle and the real meat was a piece of work to chew their peas were lost in fatty grease the biscuit was crumbling with age and the depredation of the weevils lewrie watched his companions chew heard the rapping of the biscuits on the table like a monotonous tatoo he was sick to death of them all even ashburn shirke was telling bascombe the same joke for the umpteenth time and bascombe was braying like an ass as he always did chapman chewed and blinked and swallowed as though he was concentrating hard on remembering how and in which order such actions of dining occurred the masters mates smacked like pigs at a trough and the surgeons mates whispered dry rustlings of doglatin and medical terms like a foreign language that set them apart from the rest brail fed bimelf with a daintiness he imagined a gentleman should and maintained a silence that was in itself maddening id love to put a pistol ball into this damned joint just to have something new to talk about lewrie decided it might wake old chapman up at least no probably ricochet off the pork and kill one of them and was our young prodigy all proficient at gun drill today shirke asked him what lewrie said realizing he had been asked a question were you a comfort to lieutenant harm from bascombe im sure the foretopmen heard it ashburn teased by the nailed christ i think the expression was did big bad bogtwotter hurt babys feewings i see you have reverted to your proper age and intellect harv lewrie said how refreshing for a while there i thought counting higher than ten at navigation was going to derange you bascombe was not exactly a mental wizard when it came to the intricacy of working navigation problems and had spent many hours at the masthead as punishment the insult went home like a hot poker up the arse youre a right smart little man aint you lewrie smarter than some i know at least i can make change you bastard thats educated bastard to you for twopence id call you out bascombe leaped to his feet with fists clenched you want me to pay you lewrie said calmly looking up at him with a bland expression funny way to make a living i didnt know you were that needy goddamn you and a parsons son at that lewrie was enjoying himself hugely this is the best lunch weve had in days ere now finnegan said waving a fork at them theres a midshipman awready wots been rooned this voyage now shut yer traps bascombe plumped back down on his chest his hands still fisted in his lap he stared at his plate for a long moment who ruined rolston he asked softly lewrie was the one that ran on about him and swearing so innocent he meant nothing by it i didnt know he was that sharp lewrie thought have to watch young harvey in future rolston ruined himself and we all know it keith said as if he was the only one to lay down the law and i think his case is example enough for all of us we are here to learn to get along with each other alan i think you owe harvey an apology and you owe one to alan as well mine arse on a bandbox lewrie thought but saw that the others were waiting on him to start well perhaps lieutenant harm made me raw and being teased about it didnt do my temper any good sorry i took it out on you bascombe what with this morning i lashed out without thinking for my part im sorry for what i said as well bascombe said after taking a long moment to decide if lewrie had actually apologized to him now shake hands and lets finish eating ashburn said they shook hands perfunctorily lewrie glaring daggers and bascombe thinking that he would find a way to put lewrie in the deepest hottest hell better ashburn smiled and picked up his knife and fork did i hear right did mister harm really intend to put snow up on a charge and see him flogged mister harm got hellish angry when two men slipped and when snow told him they couldnt help it because of the water on the deck from the slowmatch tubs harm thought it was backtalk and went barking mad mister harm mind ye turner said aye sir lewrie corrected waiting for turner to tell him that commission lieutenants dont go barking mad either but evidently they sometimes do for turner went back to his meal snows a good quartergunner been in forever im told wont stand ashburn said smearing mustard on his meat and hoping the flavor was improved captain bales will take it into account come to think of it i cannot remember snow ever being charged ten years in the fleet and never a lash my last captain would have had him dancing shirke said taut hand was he chapman asked now that he remembered what came after chewing best days were thursday forenoon shirke told them looked like the egyptians building the pyramids whack whack whack i fear the cat is a poor way to keep order brail said i should think grog or tobacco stoppage would be more effective nonsense finnegan said digging for gristle with a horny claw wots better dye think hangin fer stealin half a crown er takin a dozen lashes fer drunk on duty well id take the floggin its done its over yer back hurts like hell but yer still breathin ashore they hang fer every thin flogging is a brutal way to discipline brail maintained bein on a kings ship aint brutal enough awready exactly my point brail said the hands would do anything for tobacco or grog deprive them of it for a few days and theyll learn their lessons aw able seaman breezy lays ordinary seaman joke open from is gullet ta is weddin tackle an youd stop somebodys grog turner gaped at this dangerous notion somebody says no ta me when i tells im ta do somthin an youd take his baccy from im nothing like the cat ta make em walk small about ya finnegan said firmly i had a captain who had a hand who could not stop pissing on the deck learned it in his alley ive no doubt ashburn told them grog tobacco nothing helped had him flogged a dozen to start nothing worked finally tied him up in baby swaddles itchy old canvas had to see the bosun whenever he had to pump his bilges and be unlocked that cured him shamed im afore is mates too finnegan said felt more like a man iffen e d got twodozen an they learned him the right way flogging is not always the best answer ashburn said with a saintly expression some intelligence must playa part in the middle of their discussion they heard the call of the bosuns pipes then came the drumming of the marine to call them to quarters bringing a groan damme not another drill lewrie said i know we were terrible this morning but do we have to go through it all afternoon he raced up to the lower gun deck where the crew had been having their meal it was a mass of confusion as hands slung food into their buckets and bread barges stowing everything away out of sight and slamming their chests shut tables had to be hoisted up to the deckheads out of the way so they could fetch down the rammers crows and handspikes to serve the guns grumbling at their lost meal ariadne turned slightly north of their westerly course as the gun captains came up from the hanging magazines with their tools of the trade by then chests and stools and eating utensils had been stacked on the centerline out of the way of the guns and the tompions were being removed ships boys arrived with the first powder cartridges borne in flashproof leather or wood cases another drill sir lewrie asked lieutenant harm no you fool weve sighted a strange sail oh i see sir this could be a real fight a chance to do something grand maybe even make some prize money no what am i saying this is ariadne well lose her or shell turn out to be one of our packets little beckett came scuttling down from the upper deck and went to lieutenant roth the captains respects mister roth and would you be so good as to attend to the lowering of a cutter for an armed party to go aboard the chase once we have fetched her he singsonged my compliments to the captain and i shall be on deck directly wish me luck horace he said to harm if shes a prize i may be the one to take her into port what an opportunity roth fled the deck as though devils were chasing him horace harm lewrie thought stifling a grin with difficulty no wonder hes such a surly irish beaunasty arrah now fuck you jemmy roth harm muttered under his breath his associate could parley the strange ship into an independent command first crack at fresh cabin stores and a good chance at a promotion into another ship while harm languished aboard ariadne moving up to fourth officer but still stuck in her until old age lewrie harm said spinning on him and following the old adage that when in doubt shout at someone check to see that sand is spread for traction and look to the firebuckets can you stretch your little mind to handle all of that lewrie aye aye sir lewrie replied sweetly which he knew galled the officer horace by the time lewrie had finished his inspection had ordered more sand told some crews to clear away their raftle and gone back to report the guns had been loaded with quarterweight powder cartridges eight pounds of powder to propel a thirtytwopound iron ball an increase in powder charge would not impel the shot any farther or faster since all the powder did not take flame at once it was good enough for random shot at long range about a mile as they closed with the chase they might reduce the charge for short range especially if they doubleshotted the guns then a normal charge would likely burst the piece should we not clear for action mister harm lewrie asked seeing all the mess deck gear stowed on the centerline and the partitions still standing for the midshipmens mess should the captain require it we shall harm said and if he does not then we shant now shut your trap and quit interfering with your betters lewrie or ill see you bent over a gun before this day is out aye aye sir lewrie chirped again full of sham eagerness to serve and wondering why he had expected a sensible and polite answer from such a man it must be one of ours he decided there are recognition signals well most likely stand around down here until were bored silly and then be released once more there was nothing to do for a long time as the day wore on and ariadne bore down on the chase plunging along with the wind on her starboard quarter and her shoulder to the sea but it was still an hour before beckett came below and told the crews to stand easy they dragged out their stools and sat down lewrie took a seat on a chest in his heart he knew it was wrong not to strike all the assorted junk below into the holds take down those partitions and get rid of the chests and stools but what could a midshipman do about it and even if he got harm to send a message with a respectful suggestion on the matter what shrift would a lieutenants advice receive from a postcaptain intent on the whiff of prize money some of the older hands had tied their neckerchiefs about their ears making them look decidedly piratical when he asked a quartergunner old snow in fact he was told that it would keep him from going deaf from the sound of the guns by four in the afternoon the order came down to open the gun ports and blessed sunlight flooded in along with sweet fresh air the hands were called back to attention by their guns but they still ducked to peer out the ports at their possible prize fullrigged boys a cammer man whispered to a sidetackle mate maybe a french blockade runner full gold have ta be a rum un ta get took by us a handspike man said silence the ot of you lieutenant harm shouted watch your fronts and it was another half hour by lewries watch before the strange ship was near enough to hail about two cables off their starboard bows a chase gun barked from the upper deck and a feather of spray leaped up right under the other ships bowsprit a flag broke from the chases gaffit was dutch everyone sighed with a hiss of disappointment they werent at war with holland yet they had wasted their whole afternoon damme a hand cursed rubbing his hands together with a dry rustle thort she were a beamy one woulda been a good prize there goes the start of my fortune alan thought easing his aching back from long standing by the guns he could have almost felt and heard those yellowboys clinking together good golden guineas beckett appeared on the companionway mister harm the captain wishes you to run out sir right harm crackled run out yer guns and fourteen black muzzles trundled up to the port sills with a sound resembling a stampede of hogs point yer guns handspikes there number six harm had drawn his smallsword and stood with it cocked over his shoulder and alan wondered just exactly what good the officer thought a blade was going to do to a ship more than four hundred yards away but shes neutral is she not alan asked might be smuggling harm said id have thought yad have brains enough to realize well board her and check her papers anyway might pick up a few hands to flesh us out damn dutchies always have a few english sailors aboard hiding out from the pressgang under a foreign flag the dutch ship took a look at that menacing broadside pointing at her and took the path of sanity her flag slowly fluttered down the gaff alan hoped that she was indeed a smuggler loaded with contraband goods destined for some american port or had papers that would make her liable to seizure if so they could take her into antigua and sell her cargo hull and fittings um how much do you think she might be worth if she is a smuggler mister harm hull and riggingll fetch near ten thousand pounds harm told him a gleam coming to his own eye now if shes carrying contraband itll be military stores and suchlike and that may double her value davit blocks squealed as the large cutter was lowered over the side directly in front of their midships guns the main course yard being employed as a boat boom their prize had let fly all instead of bringing to into the wind and her canvas fluttered like a line of shirts on wash day dutchies can carry right rich cargoes harm went on half to himself almost pleasant for once in his greed maybe fifty thous the late afternoon was tom apart with redhot stabs of flame and the lungflattening booming of heavy guns the side of the dutch ship lit up and was wreathed in a sudden cloud of smoke as she fired a broadside right into ariadne two full gun decks of twentyfourand eighteenpounders the air seemed to tremble and moan with the weight of iron headed their way and another flag was shooting up the naked gaff but this time it was the white and gold of bourbon spain bastard dons harm shouted prime yer once more lieutenant harm was inteltupted as the lower gundeck exploded heavy balls slammed into the ships side at nearly feet per second and lewrie could hear the shrieking of her massive oaken scantlings as they bulged and splintered the cutter that was dangling before their gun ports was demolished and a cloud of splinters raved through the open ports striking down men one ball struck a gun and upended it hurling it free of sidetackles breeching ropes and train tackles and sending it slewing to the larboard side another loaded gun was hit right on the muzzle which set off its charge and it burst asunder with a great roar a little powder monkey standing terrified by the hatch to the orlop had his cartridge case explode in his arms and was flung away like a broken doll his clothes burned off and his arms missing there were screams of pain and surprise as though a pack of women were being ravaged there were howls of agony as oak and iron splinters ripped into flesh and guns turned on their servers and crushed them like sausages lewrie had been blown off his feet by the explosion of the powder cartridge and lay on the deck still buffeted by the noise and the harsh thump of each cannonball striking deep into ariadnes hull he saw and heard throaty gobbling and sobbing all about him as men clawed at their hurts and burns in a split second the ordered world of the lower gun deck had become a colored illustration from a very original sort of hell he got to his feet unsure what to do or where to go but certain he wanted to go anywhere else fast a hand touched him on the shoulder and he jumped with a yelp of fear he turned to see who it was lieutenant harm had been struck in the face by a large splinter half his face the side nearest lewrie had been shaved off to the bone one eye was gone and in its place was a splinter nearly a foot long and nearly as big around as lewries wrist harms mouth opened and closed a couple of times like a dying fish before he toppled forward like a marionette with the strings cut he fell on top of snow the quartergunner whose entrails were spread out in a stinking mess on the deck just beyond him lewrie could see a sidetackle man lying beneath the overturned gun and still screaming at the ruin of his legs oh lewrie managed to say gulping in fright the fear that seized him made him dizzy turned his limbs to jelly and took him far from the unbelievable sights and smells of the deck he tried to take a step but felt like he was walking on pillows and fell to his knees thats an eye he decided regarding the strange object below his face he threw up his dinner on it overhead but no business of his he could hear the upper deck twelvepounders banging away raggedly and the roar of the trucks as they recoiled it sounded as if ariadne was being turned into a pile of wood chips a second broadside from the spanish ship slammed into them more screams more singing of flying debris and a muffled explosion somewhere he got back to his feet clinging to a carline post lieutenant roth came skidding down the hatchway with his hat missing and the white facings of his uniform and breeches stained grey with powder smoke harm lewrie wheres and then someone jerked lieutenant roths string or so it seemed for he left his feet and flew across the width of the gun deck to slam into the larboard side where he left a bloody splash cut in half by shot got to get out of here he told himself considering how dark and safe it would be in the holds below the waterline snuggled up by the rum kegs he seemed to float to the hatch but cole the gunners mate stopped him by hugging his leg in terror zur cole pleaded on his knees clutching tight zur not now alan was intent on salvation but there was a marine sentry at the hatch using his bayonet to disincline others who had already had the same thoughts and he looked over at lewrie as one more customer for his trade couldnt make it with this bastard anyway alan decided unable to move without dragging the mate along with him goddamn you youre a mate tell me what to do zur the mate babbled shuffling on his knees with alan i want out of here hear me out alan yelled run out zur the gunners mate asked eager for any sane suggestion run em out right zur let go of me damn you and do your job get up and do your job stand to your guns and he hauled cole to his feet and shoved him away corporal run those shirkers to their guns right he told himself i wouldnt believe me either seeing the marines dubious look ready zur cole was wringing his hands in panic fire as you bear lewrie ordered hoping to be heard in all the din the thirtytwopounders began to slam rolling back from the sills and filling the deck with a sour cloud of burnt powder this isnt happening to me he thought wildly i refuse to be killed i will not allow myself to believe this is real lewrie staggered to a port which no longer contained a gun and peered out to see through the smoke cloud he was amazed to see some ragged holes punched into the enemys hull the range was less than a cable as the two ships drifted down on each other beautiful hit him again he shouted happy that he might take a few of the bastards with him swab out there charge your guns git yoor ztupid foot atta the bight a that tackle er yewll be mister hopkins the gunners mate told someone just to be sure it wasnt himself lewrie stepped back to the centerline of the deck knew we should have struck all this below he thought studying the wreck of chests and stools and spare clothing as they were ramming down roundshot a rammer man beside him took a large splinter of oak in his back and gave a shrill scream as he toppled over scattering the terrified gun crew clear away there wounded to the larboard side run out your guns lewrie was glad to have something to do besides shiver with fright he had not thought it would be that cold below decks teethchattering cold prime point he saw fists rise in the air as each gun was gotten ready and he felt the hull drumming to hits but he also felt the scend of the sea under ariadne on the uproll fire this was much more organized a twelvegun broadside fired all at the same time an avalanche of iron seemed to strike the enemy she visibly staggered and three waist gun ports were battered into one whole chunks of scantling blown apart by the impact surely there was a cloud of splinters on her gun deck this time kick em up the arse lewrie sang out which raised a ragged cheer from the men sponge out your guns b better zur the mate said as ariadne was struck deep in the hull but not on the gun deck he looked at lewrie like a puppy who had lost his man in a crowd theyre not sullen about gun drill now are they lewrie said with a manic smile well take a few of the shits with us hey aye zur cole said finding his courage and gazing at him with frank admiration which lewrie found disconcerting in the extreme have we fired twice or three times he asked should we worm the guns dont want a charge going off early id worm zur cole said worm out yer guns there he must think ive gone mad lewrie thought getting away from cole as far as possible in doing so he stepped over the body of a boy a tiny young midshipman who had lost a leg and bled to death his dirk still clenched in a pale fist odd that after eight months in the same ship together alan couid not place him at all fuck me im dead or deranged already he told himself if i have to go game i wish i couid stop shaking so badly im ready to squirt my breeches he clung to a support beam amidships and tried to get a grip within a minute fresh charges had been rammed down wads ball and sealing wads and the guns trundled up to the ports god theyre close now at this range we ought to shoot right through them prime your guns point on the uproll fire another solid broadside a blow beneath the heart sponge out lewrie shrilled gunners mate reduce charges and load with double shot double shot and grape powder monkeys scampered like panting rats as they came up from below with lighter powder bags eyes widening in their blackened faces at the sight of the gore no wonder they paint everything red down here lewrie told a handspike man as he levered his charge about like the cloaks that the spartans wore i suppose what the handspike man was too busy to talk to him or even to listen and lewrie chastised himself for beginning to sound like one of those hanoverians at coon with their eh what whats gunners mate on the downroll this time rip the bottom out from under them aye aye zuc the gunners mate stood in awe as he watched lewrie take out his pocket watch consult it then pace about he knows im off my head on the downroll fire below the level of the enemys lower gun ports starshaped holes appeared the range was a long musketshot now with hardly a chance for a miss lewrie wheres lieutenant harm beckett yelled up at him dead as cold boiled mutton lewrie told him conversationally so is roth hes over to larboard someplace need something the spanish are closing us we must cripple them now oh right well give it a shot pardon the play on words double shot the guns again or do you think if we reduce to saluting charges we could tripleshot the damned things beckett and he had strolled aft through all the carnage until beckett spotted the dead midshipman gave a shrill scream of disbelief and began to spew striplin oh dear god its striplin wondered who that was lewrie said ready run out your guns the enemy ship was evidently in trouble with her larboard battery and was painfully tacking about to point her bows toward ariadne to bring her undamaged side to bear her turn could also cut across their stem and roundshot fired down the length of the gun deck would be like a game of bowls through the thin transom wood but for that instant the dons were vulnerable to the same thing as you bear fire it was too much to ask for a synchronized broadside but he could count on a few steady gunners to let fly as they readied their pieces one at a time the thirtytwopounders barked no longer rolling back from the ports but leaping back and slamming to the deck with a crash as loud as their discharge as the breeching ropes stopped them the forward bulkhead aft of the jibboom burst open the boom and the bow sprit were shattered releasing the tension of the forestays that held the rigging tautly erect forward gun ports were hammered to ruin as they swung into view splinters and longengrained dust and paint chips fluttered out in a cloud from each strike with a groan they could hear below decks the spaniards foremast came apart like a snapped bow royal and t gallant and topmasts sagging down into separate parts and trailing wreckage over the side or leaning back into the mainmast ripping sails apart and creating more havoc yahh fry those shits lewrie heard himself scream ariadne struggled to swing to starboard to keep the enemy on her beam for there was still half that waiting broadside in reserve that could still do terrible damage lewrie pounded on people rushing the swabbing and the loading and the running out but they could not bear and the enemy was drifting astern more and more point aft hutty it up lewrie demanded seizing a crow and throwing his own weight to shift a gun quoins in prime your guns as we shift done it the gunners mate sounded off stand clear fire someone yelled as a gun recoiled over his foot and a cloud of smoke rushed back in the ports lewrie went halfway out the nearest port for a look sonofabitch marvelous there would not be a return broadside there was not one port showing a muzzle that did not tilt skyward and close as they were he could not see anyone working in the gloom damme its nearly dark is it over please god ariadne could not stay to windward for she had taken much damage aloft from chain and barshot that had tom her rigging to rags she sagged down off the wind while the spaniard drifted away going off the wind as well but far down to the south able to beamreach out of danger and ariadne could not follow think its over fer now zur the gunners mate told him water lewrie said organise a butt of water right away zur lewrie sat down on what was left of a midshipmans chest and caught his breath now that the gunsmoke had been funneled out by fresh air he could see a stack of bodies to the larboard side and a steady stream of screaming wounded being carried below to the cockpit and the dubious mercies of the surgoon and his mates the sound from below on the orlop was hideous as they sawed and cut and probed mostly sawed for badly damaged limbs had to come off at once there was a gun dismounted lewrie said suddenly aching at the effort of communication has it been bowsed down aye sor a quartergunner told him got her back on her truck an lashed snug ta larboard good good he nodded organise a crew from larboard to rig a washdeck pump and begin cleaning up we may not be through yet he could see that once the guns ceased to speak the men were sagging into shock and that sneaky bastard might come back they would be useless the next time and he did not know what to do water zur the gunners mate said have a cup theyre falling apart what do i do lewrie pleaded ill see to keepin em on the hop zur yew take a breather yew done enough fer now cole said making it sound like a reproof i must have screwed this up royally lewrie sighed well who cares i never wanted this anyway i wonder if all this was famous or glorious what would osmonde say is he alive to say anything bosuns pipes shrilled and the bosun yelled down dye hear there secure from quarters iffen yew want zur ill finish up here the gunners m said when ya zees the first lieutenant the count is eleven dead an nineteen wounded an on the orlop jesus lewrie breathed sweet jesus aye zur damned bad it was anything to get away from the screams from the surgery he decided getting to his feet with a groan and slowly ascending to the upper deck and the quarterdeck good god are you wounded mister lewrie swift asked him as he reveled at the coolness and sweetness of the evening winds i dont think so mister swift wondering if he had been struck and did not yet realize it perhaps that explained his weakness and the trembling of his limbs you gave me a fright with all that blood swift said lewrie looked down and saw his trousers waistcoat and facings blotched black in the gloom with dried blood as if he had been wallowing in an abbatoir i beg to report that the lower gun deck is secured sir one gun burst one overturned but righted all lashed down snug the gunners mate said to tell you eleven dead and nineteen on the orlop with the surgeon what about mister roth and mister harm dead sir mister harm had this big baulk of wood stuck in his face and mister roth came below andjust went splash across the deck who ran the gun deck then me and the gunners mate sir wait here lewrie and swift tramped off across the splintered deck toward the binnacle where lewrie could make out the sailing master and the captain you look like deaths head on a mopstick kenyon said as he strolled up who won sir draw id say those dons are off to the suthrd making repairs well have to work like trojans through the night or theyll be back at dawn and finish us off where are roth and harm lewrie recited his litany of woe once more leaving kenyon at a loss for words i shall need you to assist replacing the maintopmast with the spare maincourse yard aye aye sir lewrie come here from lieutenant swift standing before bales he had to explain when harm and roth had fallen and what had happened following their deaths what the state of the lower gun deck was how many wounded and killed it felt like an old story that he couldnt dine out on for long and you did not think to report your officers fallen bales asked there wasnt time sir lewrie was feeling faint again ready to drop in his tracks could i sit down sir im feeling a bit rum if they want to cane me for not sending a messenger then they can have this bloody job i quit he told himself leaning on the corner of the quarterdeck netting the captains servant offered him a mug of something which he said would buck him right up and lewrie took it and tipped it back drinking half of it before he realized it was neat rum no matter it was wet and alcoholic whatever it was he smiled and belched contentedly at all of them the gunners mate was there pointing at lewrie but he could not hear what he was saying probably telling him what a total poltroon i was i shouldve been taking orders from him not the other way around god bless you mister lewrie someone very like captain bales said to his face from the most unlikely places we find courage and leadership in our hour of troubles i shall feature your bravery in my report most prominently believe you me here now you cant be saying that lewrie goggled at him unable to feature it he could not speak merely nod dumbly unable to remove his weary drunken smile but then he had to go aloft to clear away the raffle of all their damage which sobered him up right smartly but did nothing for his aching weariness chapter english harbor at antigua was a bit of a letdown after yearning for it imagining the joy of it and struggling so hard to reach it once round cape shirley into the outer roads the land was all dust and sere hills sprinkled with dull green flora they were told it was the dry season even though it was near the start of the hurricane season there were island women in view loosehipped doxies in bright dresses and headclothes ready to provide comfort and pleasure for the poor english sailors but the ship was not allowed out of discipline they were much too busy for that first they had to keep from sinking at their temporary moorings ariadnes bilges and holds were deep in the water and the orlop hatches had been sealed tight even then at least an inch of dirty water sloshed about on the orlop since their battle with the disguised spanish twodecker the pumps had gushed and clanked without pause while carpenters slaved to patch holes the upper deck damage could wait gilt and taffrail carvings were moot if ariadne foundered along her waterline ravelled sails could be seen hairy patches fothered over gaping wounds to slow the inrush of water discarded bandages bloody slop clothing and floating personal possessions seeped from her like pus rowed barges towed her down the tortuous channel to the inner harbor and the dockyard where she was buoyed up with camels barges on either beam supporting thick cables that slung under the hull as the camels were pumped out they rose in the water bringing ariadne with them so that laborers could get into her holds and begin plugging the many shot holes above decks she was in much better shape damaged yards and topmasts had been replaced snapped rigging reroved tom canvas taken down and replaced with the heavyair set or hastily patched but the poop starboard side and the starboard gangway still bore shot holes especially around the waist light shot was still embedded in her thick scantlings the decks were still tom from splintering and no amount of scrubbing could remove the huge bloodstains especially on the lower deck and ariadne stank though she had been scoured with vinegar or black strap smoked with tubs of burning tobacco or painted with her slim stocks of whitewash and red she reeked of vomit of gangrenous wounds from her tortured men who had been killed but had not yet been allowed the final release from agony she smelled copperysickly from the smell of decaying bodies and the island flies found her and made a new home so they could feast on her corruption on au the blood that had been spilled and seemed now a part of her framework she was a worse environment than the old fleet ditch dung wharf or the worst reeking slums lewrie could remember hastily passing he was an englishman which meant that he was used to stinks but he had never imagined anything that bad dockyard officials had been aboard and had ordered the removal of her artillery to lighten her they had poked and probed measured and calculated noting her new tendency to hog to bend down a bit at bow and stem a sure sign that the keel structure was badly strained some of her key midship beams weakened it was supposed that once she could float on her own without aid she would go into the dock for permanent repair though where theyd get the timber the wounded were taken off to the hospital the dead had been buried at sea altogether they had suffered fortyone men discharged dead and another seventy severely wounded and half of those stood a good chance of dying yet that was a quarter of the entire ships company and did not count those lightly wounded that had been returned to light duties there were gaping absences in her crew thmer had been killed on the riddled starboard gangway the master gunner mr tencher had been killed up by the bow chasers harm and roth of course were gone from the officers mess two young midshipmen had died as well as little striplin and his friend beckett had lost a foot on that last broadside shirke was ashore with a broken arm but looked likely to mend chapman on the other hand had lost a chunk out of his right thigh from a grapeshot ball and his future held in a precarious balance for they thought the leg might have to come off near the groin finnegan and another of his mates had been made acting lieutenants as had keith ashburn since no officers could be spared from the other ships in port indeed no captain would willingly give up a competent commission officer into such a ship and no lieutenant would consider such an appointment since if she were condemned he would be left high and dry without employment captain bales once he had made his dire report to the admiral had kept his own silent counsel aft in his quarters lieutenant church was nowhere to be found and no one would admit knowledge of his whereabouts rolston also had gone in custody of marines from the flagship the remaining midshipmen had been run ragged in the days that followed standing watches ferrying groaning and crying wounded ashore and bringing back fresh supplies to feed the survivors lumber to plug shot holes emptying the magazines and hoisting out the great guns and their trucks and the tons of roundshot to lighten the ship they were also involved ferrying the dockyard officials flag officers the idle curious and the morbid who wished to come and gawk and marvel praise or damn inspect and condemn lewrie clambered up the ships side and through the battered entry port chafing in his uniform the day was hot and there was no wind in the harbor he let bascombe take his place and went to the scuttlebutt for a measure of fresh water grateful for the shade of the old scrap canvas that was rigged over the quarterdeck as an awning by god i know its unhealthy to bathe too often but id admire a dunk in a creek or something he thought with so much fresh water coming aboard no one would miss a gallon in which he could take a quick cooling scrub and put on some clean linen mister lewrie the captains clerisaid to him aye mister brail alan noted that even brail wore his arm in a sling fortunately not his writing arm the captain would like to see you me what have i done alan cringed by rote i have no indication that captain bales is displeased with you mister lewrie he would be however should you keep him waiting lewrie straightened his sweaty clothing and went aft midshipman lewrie reporting sir the captain stared at him scowling with those huge eyebrows and alan was sure he had committed some grievous and punishable offense without knowing what or how mister ashburn has informed me of your messs request that i release some of your money for the purchase of fresh cabin stores i have summoned you to take charge of it since the others are away at their duties at present whew was forced from him barely audible i will allow each of you no more than five pounds as the prices here in the islands are higher than normal that will have to be sufficient and ill not have it all spent on spirits mind you lewrie was mystified that captain bales sat there in a ship that could still sink right out from under him and took care of a small chore that his clerk or coxswain could have handled easily had he lost his senses or could he no longer bear to face the larger issues with the artillery removed you may consider livestock sheep or pigs are your best bet island bullocks are too lean and stringy and usually overpriced hardskinned fruits are plentiful as are the onions hereabouts youll find cheese dear as well as tea but coffee is fairly cheap we shall try to spend it wisely sir lewrie lied knowing that ashburn was ashore trying to get rooms and a private dining area for a long overdue shore leave as well as some women as i said in my report and i shall say it to your face lewrie you did extremely well when put to the test bales said fingering a stack of guineas on his desk eight months ago i despaired that you would ever amount to anything and now here you are the one bright bit in a dismal report had you not reorganised the lower deck guns and gotten them firing again there is a very good possibility that every manjack in this ship would now be dead or a prisoner of war and ariadne sunk or a prize thank you for your good opinion sir darnme did i really do all that and did you really put it that way in your report if you did im a bloody hero of such good beginnings are great careers and reputations made in the heet and you have worked diligently at your studies as well i predict that you may do very well in the navy mister lewrie but watch the course you steer well therere a hundred pitfalls for the ambitious officer no one can rush about blind to hazard or forget to cover his back id advise you to make caution your watchword and not let this fleeting fame be the highwater mark for you aye aye sir lewrie said not knowing what the hell bales was talking about and a little unsettled at seeing such a stem man muttering to himself between phrases once dismissed lewrie went back on deck just in time to see keith ashburn coming through the entry port and went to join him his friend was now half a commission officer at least clad in breeches and stockings and had replaced his round hat with a cocked one he wore a new smallsword on his hip instead of a dirk but his tailor must have been a slow worker since he still had to move about in a midshipmans short coat twenty pounds keith lewrie said excuse me mister ashburn ours bascombes and shirlees though i dont see what a parsons son and a man with one arm in boards are going to do with a bareback rider he forgot chapman ashburn said who wouldnt lewrie shrugged what have you gotten for us a good dinner for a start and a suite of rooms a dozen of wine thats fifteen shillings apiece only two girls so far but they have friends a guinea apiece for them what are they blood royal there must be a whole island full of mutton thatd do it for half a crown and thats a whole night of it these are gentlemens doxies not common trolls wont go for anyone less than a lieutenant usually the two i met are quite fetching ashburn promised since his promotion to acting lieutenant he had been acting all right acting much more superior reclaiming those languid airs he had grown up with in rich society lewrie was getting a bit peeved with his attitude it was not a week ago that ashburn was not above borrowing money from him until his packet arrived theres a boat comin offshore sir a bosuns mate told ashburn pointing over the starboard rail headed fer us i thinks very well hail him mister lewrie boat ahoy alan shouted aye aye came the answering hail meaning the boat was for them and from the fingers stuck in the air by the bowman there was a full captain aboard bosuns mate muster the sideparty lewrie ordered another ghoul come to marvel i expect i feel like the gatekeeper at bedlam poking sticks sir stir em up water squirts only a penny more he wheezed rubbing his hands a youngish post captain came in through the entry port and did a long survey of the splintered and stained decks the lack of guns and the many repairs still being done to the bulwarks he carried a large canvas bundle of papers tied up with many fluttering ribbons welcome aboard sir ashburn said stuyckes flag captain to rear admiral sir onsley matthews i am here to see your captain this way sir if you please ashburn smiled smarmily here you inform the captain of captain stuyckes arrival you know sir i was looking forward to coming to antigua sir onsley is well known to my family in london here you indeed lewrie grumbled as he ran off to inform bales that he had a visitor he being the here you in question i dont think this is going to be one of those friendships that lasts for generations keith and if i ever have a daughter god help her your son can go hang before he marries her but it didnt seem as if keiths toadying was getting him anywhere with captain stuyckes since that worthy wore an expression more in keeping with a funeral and whatever his business with captain bales was it didnt look like it was to be a social call news of the visit did not take long to circulate through the vessel so quite a few interested parties made it their business to take the air either on the quarterdeck or as close as they could get to it the flag captain was he ellison asked the general vicinity a captain stuyckes sir lewrie volunteered with a bundle of papers all bound in ribbons then its bad news no doubt of it ellison said bitterly poor old girl shot to pieces you mean they might not be able to repair the ship sir alan wondered aloud shes bad sprung twenty years old she is and only brought out of ordinary because we need ships bad you ask chips shes half rotten and now too bad gutshot to be repaired not out here not in the tropics might make a powder hulk so there might be a possibility i could end up in another ship lewrie speculated with a tingle of hope for better chances aye a lot of us most like ellison said considering his slim chances for future employment another sailing master lewrie kenyon called as they were breaking up the sideparty pass the word to all the midshipmen to be sure to wash and dress in their best uniforms in the morning youll be called to the flag kenyon ordered sternly you and a few of the others shall be called upon to testify at the courtmartial eh were they going to try rolston ariadne has been condemned kenyon said bleakly his own hopes for the future seemingly dashed since she has been lost to the reet the captain and the first lieutenant are to face charges in her loss just after breakfast at one bell of the forenoon watch a gun boomed from the flag of the inshore squadron which ariadne had been to join the fiftygun th rate glatton a courtmartial jack went up her masts and boats from several ships in harbor converged on her boats bearing the five captains that made a courtmartial panel and boats from shore bearing wounded witnesses as well as two cutters from ariadne with her sorrowfullooking party once aboard bales and swift were called aft to the admirals cabins while lewrie and the rest were led below to glattons wardroom and told to wait shirke was also there his arm encased in a set of boards and wrapped with leather i understand we are unemployed shirke whispered to lewrie as he gave up his chair to him accommodations ship they tell me lewrie said softly we may be kept on but i expect the fleet here in the islands is in sore need of people what with sickness and all pray god theyve just had the plague shirke said then grinned what about our party i have five pounds of yours lewrie told him but with you laid up just get me a gentle one and ill take my fences as well as anyone whats my share three crown say a pound total with tip for supper rooms and wine a guinea for the whore a guinea for a guinea shed better be salome would have to die before he could be taken aboard a ship already in commission he could be temporarily derated to masters mate for the good of the service and spend years trying to get his pay straightened out after stoppages shore duty for me then and my marines osmonde said some garrison work would not go amiss id love to get a frigate lewrie announced wouldnt we all ellison snarled stalking off a chance to see more action eh osmonde asked lewrie aye sir as long as i have to be in the navy what better duty is there amazing what a taste of powder smoke can do for a boy you were right mister osmonde lewrie said i almost ran and hid but i didnt or couldnt and then i didnt have any time to think about it i just did it it was terrifying and i thought i had gone mad but never more alive and you did extremely well osmonde told him in fact you may be the only one to garner any credit from our encounter one word of advice aye sir your advice has been good dont go dashing madly after more fame and glory they are always bigger than you are and will eat you right up the captain said much the same thing sir at least i think he did lewrie replied repeating bales admonition hmrn i fear captain bales and i do not mean the same thing at all of course he is right in a way this service is very political whig tory city interests country interests anyone who makes a name will always be desperately envied and theres a hundred people ready to run you through for your psition you must be cautious about the people you anger on your way up and the people you espouse but in your actions too much caution can get you killed or ruined its a fine line to walk like the edge of a sharp sword the sideparty formed again as captain stuyckes took his leave of them he was even grimmer in aspect than when he had come aboard and most conspicuously was without his bundle of papers quiet you two kenyon admonished from across the room one at a time they were called upon as the morning wore on first kenyon as ranking officer then the warrants ashburn went and was back in minutes that was quick lewrie said as a cabin steward circulated a tray of fresh coffee about the wardroom and he used it as an excuse to get close to ashburn how was it it doesnt look too good for them ashburn muttered there wasnt much i could tell them except that i was on the quarterdeck and never heard a word about clearing for action urn good coffee first real article ive had in weeks passing the word for midshipman lewrie a marine called on his way up to the admirals cabins to testify lewrie saw two faces that he had not expected to run across again the first was his disrated enemy rolston he stood by the larboard entry port with a small chest and canvas bag at his feet going with a draft of men to one of the ships in harbor he was dressed as a common seaman in slop trousers checked shirt and neckerchief with a flat tarred hat on his head and his feet bare evidently the needs of the fleet were such that there would be no further punishment for him and he was attained hand able to hand reef and possibly steer rolston saw him and gave him such a black look that lewrie was afraid for his life for a second then the irony of it situck him and he waved hello gaily the second face was their silent lieutenant church he was in the company of a marine lieutenant dressed in normal uniform but minus his sword lewrie attempted to speak to him but church turned away with a the direct cut youd think he could speak alan groused not likely his guide an elegantly turned out midshipman on the admirals staff told him with a wry grin hes due in there himself tomorrow what for courtmartial cowardice under fire the boy took pleasure in informing him seems you lot from ariadne have no luck at all eh lewrie was announced led in to face the assembled court and shown to a witness chair captain bales and mr swift sat to one side and he nodded to them as he was sworn in he was led through his name his date of joining his duties and all the mundane things then came the day of their fight my station at quarters was on the lower gun deck sir he said in response to the first serious question and he tensed up not knowing what would help or hurt bales and swift and if he should even bother and what occurred mister lewrie we were finishing dinner sir when we were called to quarters we had been at gun drill all morning did you think it was another drill a sharpfeatured captain asked it was hard to figure out if he was a lawyer or a member of the court at first sir just before one bell of the day watch what was done on the lower gun deck mister lewrie we turned to the fourteen thirtytwopounders to starboard sir the larboard guns had three men each sand was cast the gun tackles were cast off tompions removed and the starboard battery loaded with eightpound charges and single roundshot you did not run out no sir i see what else did you do to prepare for battle that was it sir lewrie squirmed in his hard chair as he said it unable to look at bales or swift you did not strike the mess tables take chests below tables had been raised to the deckheads sir but everything else was placed on the centerline away from recoil wkat was everything else the officer posed seamens chests sir stools plates mess kits and bread barges the gunroom was still standing and so was marine quarters and the officers mess you were on the lower gun deck how could you know about the other another captain snapped that midshipman lewrie and gunners mate cole took over at this time and did exceptional service with the lower deck guns well not exactly sir you did not i was blown to the deck sir and it was an absolute madhouse mister roth did join us but he was also killed almost at once it must have been two or three minutes before we got sorted out but you did after that take charge after i had gotten over being terrified sir mister cole tells me he took orders from you did you find that strange a warrant gunner obeying a midshipman aye sir but we got the job done what was the final toll from the lower deck another officer asked one who had been sitting silent for most of the testimony two officers and nine seamen killed nineteen wounded sir and three more have since passed on lots of splinter wounds i suppose aye sir a lot alan gulped they conferred among themselves for a moment then turned to face their court once more i believe that is all for this witness the president announced unless you have anything captain bales i think mister lewrie will bear me out that we held regular gun drills did we not captain bales said looking sharper and more aware than in the past few days aye sir we did alan agreed and was the starboard battery of the lower deck run out and ready to fire when that spaniard fired into us bales added the guns were run out sir aye and ready to fire bales repeated thumping his chair arm um no sir after lieutenant harm believed our chase to be a neutral dutchman he never ordered the guns primed bales exuberant defense crumpled but ah the gunners and crews were thoroughly competent were they not i think what this young man means is that if those quarters had been struck below they would have come down past him is that right mister lewrie the sharpfeatured one put in aye sir did that strike you as odd excuse me but what a midshipman of so little experience holds as an opinion is of no interest a much older captain grumped and god save me from serving under you lewrie thought did your officers find it odd did they say anything about the fact that ariadne would be full of dangerous sources of splinters should the ship be called upon to fight the sharp one pressed i asked mister harm if we should not clear sir but he did not like me asking questions what did he say to keep my trap shut sir which raised a laugh from the court yess the sharp captain drawled so you went to quarters at one bell of the day watch and you did not engage until one bell of the first dog is that your recollection aye sir we stood easy for a long time they got to the point when the spaniard was only two cables off and struck her false dutch flag that awful first broadside and the revelation of their foes true identity and what happened on the lower gun deck mister harm was killed immediately sir lewrie replied seeing again that shaved skull and the huge splinter in the mans eye and in his brain splinters from our cutter came through the gun ports one gun was dismounted one burst and a powder charge blew up the cutter had been lowered from the boattiers aye sir what about the other boats at divisions that morning sir they were all on the boattier but after we went to gun drill i cannot say sir i would like to point out the sharpfaced captain said there goes someone asking an opinion of a newly again the old captain muttered i shall let this one stand the president of the court said aye sir i felt we were competent lewrie lied knowing that they had been terrible shots grudgingly adequate at best men who had never considered gun drill a serious business who could go through the motions but had found fighting for their lives to be a horror not even used to the sound of their own gunfire poor bales is fucked alan thought and ive put one of the nails in his coffin the least i can do is soften the blow for him god where did i get so noble suddenly then alan also realized that anything he said in bales defense would look good for him as well before the members of the court after all he too was soon to be unemployed oh you wretch if i may say something about captain bales sir lewrie said and received a nod if i have learned anything in my short time in the navy its that captain bales is a good officer and a fine captain when we were on convoy duty he was the one we all looked to when it was blowing a full gale no matter what happened whenthat spaniard tried to ambush us and we did do him more damage than he did to us i was glad to have captain bales as our commanding officer id sail with him again sirs ah well i think thats all you are dismissed mister lewrie the president said all but piping his eyes aye aye sir lewrie said crisply rising from his seat god you are such a toadying little shit lewrie he told himself turning red with embarrassment did i lay it on a trifle thick maybe it will even help the old bastard a little bit in the end but if id been on the listening side id have spewed and then kicked my young arse out god bless you mister lewrie captain bales whispered to him as he passed him on the way out ill not forget that i meant it sir lewrie said knowing that he hadnt meant a bloody word of it and eager to get away ariadne was condemned her topmasts were struck for the last time and she was warped alongside a stone dock there to be a receiving ship most of her hands were dispersed to the hungry vessels that still had a job to do without them she felt eerily empty captain bales found guilty by the court of article ten and lieutenant swift being found guilty of the same charge were dismissed from the service to be sent home to england lieutenant church was found guilty of article twelve cowardice and neglect of duty he was liable to the death penalty but also dismissed from the navy lewrie thought that if they all went back horne in the same ship it would make a cozy little gathering in the passengers messbales swift church chapman now minus his leg and doomed to a life of poverty and being chased by children in the street calling him mr hopkids and young beckett minus a foot at twelve years of age all juing the day they had joined the fleet and ariadne for she had been bad luck for everybody lewrie was moved into the old officers wardroom but still had to sling a hammock some form of ships routine still went on rising to scrub decks stow hammocks sail drill with the courses anything to keep the newly arrived hands busy before they were assigned ships he also supervised a lot of working parties at the dockyard and stores warehouses all his friends left osmonde went to an eightygun ship of the line whose marine captain had been cashiered ashburn attended the flagship and passed his examination for lieutenancy and took his place as sixth officer in glatton which was easy duty since it had been months since that ship had seen the seaward view of cape shirley and was rumored to be resting on a reef of beef bones shirke was on the mend in hospital while bascombe went into a fine frigate all the senior warrants and mates disappeared except for the oldest and slowest he languished for weeks in limbo waiting for his call a very old lieutenant had charge of ariadne a man so old that he made bales look like a spry young topman when lieutenant cork drank alan drank in fact everybody drank cork knew he wasnt going anywhere important for the rest of the century so he drank a lot which meant that lewrie had to sit and drink with him almost every night on those nights when lieutenant cork had started early or simply forgot that he had a readymade audience for his maunderings lewrie had the chance to slip ashore and caterwaul he checked out the whores he ate the spiciest foods he could find which were such a change from the navys idea of what to do with rockhard saltmeat but it was an expensive island and wartime wasnt helping to hold down prices and he found himself in the miserable psition of having to go ashore to get away from the drudgery but not being able to afford doing it more than once a week his hundred guineas were going fast and there was no guarantee that his father ever intended to honor their agreement now that he was thousands of miles away he had sent pilchard a letter so his new guineas would catch up with him but he wasnt holding his breath waiting for them he found himself in the miserable position one night of really wishing he were at sea if just to cut his expenses and he knew that he was going mad even to consider it once lieutenant cork went facedown in a puddle of claret lewrie had to give the man credit for supplying a good vintage and free to boot he went on deck to think out the fumes in his head with fresh air and leaned on the railing wondering what was going on aboard all the other ships in harbor mister lewrie a familiar voice called from the darkness aye lewrie youre cupshot lewrie could not make out who it was and stepped closer before he made the wrong answer to someone more senior mister kenyon he gasped once he could make out the uniform and a hint of the face its me right enough how do you keep like a ghost sir i think im the only soul left from the old crew he said happy to see his favorite officer and hoping that it wasnt just a social call too much idle time on your young hands if you ask me mister lewrie too true sir then how would you like something that would keep you out of mischief i like mischief sir frankly but this is getting boresome so you wouldnt turn down a chance to be a midshipman in an independent command mischief be damned sir where do i go he whooped admiral matthews has just given me command of hms parrot she is a big fore n aft schooner american built and english took im allowed two midshipmen and i was delighted to find that you were available matter of fact matthews was quite taken with the report about you and was saving you for something good lead me to her sir well be doing some interesting things running fleet mails and orders all up and down the leewards over to jamaica now and then maybe as far as the bahamas or the colonies ill go pack sir lewrie told him aware that he was much happier than the last time he had uttered those words were lying off the far side of the dockyard report aboard by the end of the forenoon watch sober and cleareyed if you know whats good for you kenyon said it goodnaturedly they spent some time catching up on old times then kenyon had to leave for his lodgings before taking command in the morning and he wanted to pack lewrie knew that his chest was ready to go except for a few loose ends and laundry his head was as clear as a bell now and he quivered with excitement at the thought of being not only employed once more but having been held in reserve for a choice assignment such as parrot by rear admiral sir onsley matthews there had to be twenty thirty midshipmen who were more senior and deserving just dying for a berth such as parrot he thought of keith ashburn as a new lieutenant pacing back and forth and aching for sea time on the flag and he knew he had the better berth after all this calls for a celebration he told himself there was going to be a lot of work in the days ahead if his new ship was fitting out and no more chance to go ashore with the ease which he enjoyed presently perhaps he did not have to drink himself blind to celebrate but that did not mean he could not strum a doxy one last time chapter parrot was big as schooners go not like the smaller islandbuilt types she was over sixtyfive feet on the range of the deck americanbuilt of pine and fast as the very wind except for a small raised area aft to improve the headroom of the masters cabins she was a flushdeck and carried eight small fourpounder cannon four on each beam and with lighter swivels fore and aft as chase guns she could fly three foresails or jibs two huge gaffed foreandaft sails on her fore and mainmasts and when at any point of sail from a close reach to running before the wind could also add two smaller topsails on crossed yards since she would be running dispatches it was not meant for her to carry the usual four months of food and water required of rated ships so the crew had much more room in which to stretch out but she still had a large crew of fifty men including officers warrants and stewards enough to make sail and enough to fight her if pressed into a comer but her principal defense was to be her greater speedshe could do nearly twelve knots she could also point up much higher to windward than most ships such as brigs which was a final form of salvation against being taken as soon as lewrie saw her he was in heaven since she did not rate a sailing master chaplain schoolmaster no marines and only one masters mate a stocky individual with thinning hair named claghome kenyon was master and commander and was given the deferential title of captain and was responsible for her navigation and safety with only claghome to help him there was a sun and only one mate and though she rated a surgeon she did not have one but only a surgeons mate to serve in lieu of a more experienced man but since they never would be far from some port it was thought that he would suffice until they could drop anchor where there was medical help kenyon had a tidy aftercabin which had a private quartergallery privy and a hanging locker to the other side a day cabin which held his settee by the stem windows a desk a sleeping cabin with a hanging bed box small chart cabin and a dining space and the furnishings the former owners had been deprived of were of good quality mr claghome the masters mate boggs the surgeons mate lewrie and the other midshipman a fifteenyearold named thaddeus purnell berthed in the wardroom forward of kenyons quarters parrot had been meant to be a privateer so she had carried prize officers who had been given small private cabins they werent much canvas and lath screens for partitions stationary bunks and a washhand stand and bookshelf with room for a chest barely and a row of pegs for a locker but it had a door and it was more privacy than he had seen in months even if every noise penetrated the insubstantial walls they also had a goodquaiity dining table and trestle seats down each side instead of using their chests after the cockpit in ariadne it was approaching luxury there were some familiar faces from ariadne in the crew the rest were those volunteers who had hoped to escape a bad officer or a bosun in their previous ship or those men that any captain would offer up first to the needs of the fleet and would gladly get rid of at the first opportunity there were also a great many hands fresharrived in antigua who were barely seamen at all ten of the men and all the boy servants were west indians cheeky runts who spoke a dialect that alan had a great difficulty understanding as the kings english the first item of business was stocking the ship a man was chosen to be a cook another west indian who swore he knew how and supplies began to arrive aboard ferried by lewrie and purnell in their eternal role of water taxi men since there was no purser or assistant the jack in the bread room kenyons clerk and lewrie had to take over the role but since leonard wished to eventually save enough to purchase a place as a purser it was much easier than lewrie thought and parrot was already armed and stocked well with good french powder and small arms though the guns were english as was the shot their task was to bring firewood coal rum livestock flour fruit paint extra slop clothing and naval stores for the bosun mr mooney after two days of stocking kenyon summoned his mates and petty officers to the aftercabin which crowded that space severely kenyon sat behind his desk while mooney claghome and leonard had the settee by the open stem windows also on hand were lewrie purnell docken the gunner bright the gunners mate kenyon had had the cook squeeze some fresh lemons and limes to make a cooling drink for the meeting lewries first duty was to help the captains servant a west indian named george fill everyones mugs lets get down to business shall we kenyon said now normally with only me and mister claghome and only mister mooney and his mate to tend to things we should be watchandwatch in rotation but i propose that we go to three watches and take advantage of our midshipmen mister purnell has a good report from his last captain and has served on prizes with a bosuns mate which is why we got him and i know mister lewries qualities from our last ship ariadne purnell sneaked a look at lewrie to size him up and lewrie gave him equal treatment obviously purnell had money he was very well turned out and obviously someones favorite for him to be here he was a gawky fifteenyearold with red hair and freckles hardly looked harmful yet mooney tells me that bond one of the quartermasters wants to strike for bosuns mate and we shall let him do so and appoint one hand to serve as his replacement mister mooney you might have some name to suggest aye sir mooney rumbled deep in his barrel chest might pick another man for acting quartermaster for the tiller as well so we have a chance to train as many people as possible lieutenant kenyon went on sipping at his lemon water that will do for the men aft at any rate the hands will stay in their familiar starboard and larboard watches i doubt if their conservatism would allow else aye sir claghorne said thinking on the superstitious and habitual nature of their seamen who would balk at anything that smacked of newfangled notions we shall place an experienced bosuns mate with the lads and the acting bosuns mate with either me or mister claghome i expect we could put purnell and lewrie on the middle watch and first or second dog watches where they could not get into much trouble and give us a chance to sleep somewhat peacefully they could nap in the forenoon subject to the requirements of the ship of course lewrie grinned over the edge of his mug it was tantamount to being appointed an acting lieutenant and would look good in his record to be so honored perhaps shortening the time he would have to be a midshipman and there was also the prospect that parrot just might take a prize and he be appointed to command of it i also want to take advantage of mister purnells experience to assist the bosun and his mates in the general condition of the ship and i wish mister lewrie to be seconded to the gunner and his mate as he has a great fondness for artillery sail tending in the forenoon watches exercise the guns during the day we have a stout little vessel in parrot well built and clean of rot we have guns sufficient to protect us against any light vessel that could catch us and enough turn of speed to outrun or outpoint anything heavier we have some people who need training and some that need reminding that they are still in the kings navy so we have hard work ahead of us use your starters as you will for now but try to avoid flogging incidents until we have shaken down into a crew unless totally unavoidable soon after that they were dismissed lewrie went below to the magazine to check up on things and do an inventory bright the gunners mate went with him they counted their linstocks lengths of slow match sand powder horns firing quills and their condition gun tools and the general condition of the fourpounders spankin new they are mister lewrie bright told him unsure how much authority kenyon had given him took off one of ours i guess not a year old by the proof marks an hardly fired how accurate is a fourpounder lewrie asked random shot at a mile good chance of a hit at six cables not as accurate as a ninepounder might wanta get rid a this junk what is it shes fulla frog tricks mister lewrie canistercases a musket balls ta clear a deck or a fightin top thats starshot bright said picking up a round comes apart inta four pieces held tagether like this good for takin down riggin and cripple a prize first no stomach for a close fight i see we have more swivels aye eight more i guess they were gonna mount em on each beam we shall have to get the hands used to them you might make up some cartridges and some canister for the swivels we might get some target practice at kegs or something with them lewrie suggested aye we could bright frowned thinking how much work it was what are these lewrie asked picking up an unusual rod of some kind from an entire case of them it resembled a large iron dart but was wrapped with a tarred cap of cloth and seemed to have small springloaded arms attached neatly folded up behind the head along the shaft easy with that thems fire arrers bright cautioned what do you do with them bright lewrie asked turning to look him square in the eye and establish that he was on at least an equal footing with the gunners mate being rated a watchofficer didnt hurt either theys nasty stuff mister lewrie ya shoots em outa the swivels that sets em afire an when they hits they snap open sos they cant go no farther sticks in the sails and bums em up id feel a lot safer without em theyre touchy as hell sides it aint christian to do that even to an enemy its a damn pirates weapon not fit for a kings ship but they have been found to be most effective sir bright asked not understanding the word and taking the deferential air of an inferior by force of habit do they work real good alan rephrased devilish good sir lets hang on to them then bring in a tub of water and make sure they are closed up and unable to rub and take fire on their own we just might find a use for them aye sir bright said almost touching his forehead in a salute the rest of the inventory went swiftly counting the french model muskets boarding pikes cutlasses tomahawks and pistols and the gun tools and grindstone that went with them since parrot had no masteratarms lewrie would be filling in in that capacity and was happy to have so much to play with the days ahead looked very promising a week later parrot was in all respects ready for sea lewrie was happy with his duties and with his responsibilities he had the guns painted all tackles and breeching ropes snug there were enough cartridges made up for a good battle and still a quarterton of powder below decks in casks the roundshot had been filed and sanded and painted and laid out in shotgarlands while the slightly imperfect hung in net bags ready for practice use all the small arms were oiled and sharpened and he had gotten two watches in which to hold arms drill and change the assignments of who got axes or pikes or muskets finally a gig had flown out to them from the flag and a stuffy lieutenant had handed over to them several weighted bags of mail or orders along with their first sailing orders for the first time the jibs were hoisted and the anchor broken out of the bottom the huge foreandaft sails rose up the masts and the booms swung out as they filled with wind water began to chuckle under parrots forefoot as she tacked her way out of the narrow channel to the outer roads and past the shipping anchored there once past cape shirley they turned eastsoueast for an offing going hard to windward and then with the island a smudge to the norwest they came about to the starboard tack with the wind abeam and began to thrash to the north hoisting topsails as well and winging out the gaff sails to use every ounce of wind by the time they cast the first log they had gotten up to nearly ten knots and it was glorious since parrot could go like a cambridge coach with her larboard side down slightly and cool spray bursting in sheets from her bows and creaming down her flanks spattering the decks and wetting the jibs and foresls high over the beakhead by evening quarters at sundown antigua was out of sight and other islands were silhouetted against the sunset far away to the west as they drove to pass barbuda to their lee side they were bound for road town in the vjigins on the island of tortola thence to nassau in new providence with a final stop at bermuda it was a risky voyage prime hwricane season but for then the sea was kind and the very best of the tropic weather prevailed they reefed down for the night and took in topsls but even in the middle watch with purnell a pale ghost near his side lewrie was taken by how fast they were going and how much glorious fun it was i think i am going to erijoy this immensely he told purnell over the sluicing noise and hiss of their hull cleaving the ocean the freedom purnell shouted back god no line of battle no admirals no postcaptains were free as the wind no sailing master no screaming first officer lewrie added good food every time we anchor somewhere purnell went on making circling motions over his stomach like tonight lewrie had to agree that their dinner had been very good boiled mutton cut fresh from a carcass and seasoned with god knew what by the west indian cook but the old man had created a substantial meal that stuck with you by god and was snappier on the tongue than neat rum or plug tobacco there had been new potatoes and strange red purple onions and a decent french red wine that was a lot more pleasing than black strap could ever hope to be tell you what ill be senior for the first two hours purnell said you be my junior and then at four bells well change round fair enough i suppose you want the windward rail lewrie asked referring to the senior officers right yes if you dont mind lewrie really didnt mind the night was too full of stars of moonlight shimmering on the ocean of the pleasing motion and the cool humidity of the night to be enjoyed by god this is more like it he told himself at the larboard rail as he stared out at the ocean that glittered like a fairyland if the rest of the navy could be like this kenyon had allowed them to forgo heavy broadcloth uniform jackets now alan rolled up the sleeves of his shirt dressed in waistcoat slop trousers and shirt and since it was the middle watch he soon did away with the waistcoat and neckcloth as well opening his shirt to the winds so that it fluttered and billowed out as it filled spray flew over the rail and smacked him now and then and he found he looked forward to it each time leaning far out to intercept it he was in charge of a ship maybe not much of a ship but she was his for a while even if he had to share her with purnell and the bosuns mate when it came his turn he was amazed to see a dark smear to the nor west he left the windward side to cross to the binnacle and look at the chart by the tiller by the feeble glow of the binnacle light he could see that they had already fetched barbuda far inshore there were some faint lights perhaps houses on the atlantic side or fishing boats working offshore they would pass well to seaward of them as long as the wind held steady he closed his eyes and tried to measure the strength of the wind on his cheek had it shifted a point backed on us he decided parrot seemed to slow a bit he could order the quartermaster to adjust his helm but was afraid to upset the settled order of the night no there was something else to do that would allow them to hold the course that kenyon had ordained bosun he called and mr kelly the experienced bosuns mate who was their watcher was there in a moment wmds backed a point summon the hands of the watch to veer out a piece on the braces and headsl sheets lewrie ordered hands behind his back and looking up at the set of the sails like a real watch officer would but he found it hard to match kellys eyes as he dared issue his first real order spect its about time fer that mister lewrie kelly replied touching his hat with his fingers and turning away to call the hands damme that wasnt so bad after all alan told himself after they had eased the sheets to allow the sails to stay full at a proper angle that ought to be enough mister kelly belay all that lewrie made an entry in the log also his first noting what he had done and then they slogged along into the night with the wind now more from abeam but still holding their compass course and parrot giving no sign that she was going to do anything dire after being meddled with by amateurs and when the end of the watch came and mr claghome took over for the morning watch lewrie was almost sorry to have to cede him the deck as he doffed all his clothing and rolled into his bunk he pondered how fast people seemed to get promoted in wartime as people got sick and had to be replaced got killed and had to be replaced or like parrot the fleet grew in size and had to spread her substance thinner six years as a midshipman could be circumvented if he were lucky enough and in the right place at the right time it felt like parrot might be that place and he swore that he would knuckle down once more and shine all during the hurricane season parrot dashed about the islands on her duties putting in when a real stonn threatened but mostly out in full gales and riding it out or running ahead of them with waves crashing into her bows and spraying the full length of her decks in those times when it was clear she flew from one port to another from one command to another with all the drama and panache of an actress making a surprise entrance by the time hurricanes had ended for the winter parrot was a wellworkedup and fairly happy ship the crew had settled down the new men trained well enough and salted by their experiences and the old hands brought up to scratch as they realized that parrot was different from the navy in which they had so recently suffered they had a good cook which went a long way toward making a happy ship and they had fresh food more often than most because they were never more than a week or two at best from a new anchorage kenyon was firm but fair in his punishments when called upon to hand out disciplinary measures and a taut handed captain always seemed to do better than a lax one or one who could not be relied upon to be fair and as often as possible kenyon let the ship out of discipline and allowed the doxies aboard to entertain the hands with the regularity of their stops the men looked forward to seeing their favorite trolls on a steady basis which provided a measure of stability and homelike consistency to their lives lewrie began to enjoy naval service the food was fresh and spicy the wine palatable the hours of work reasonable as were the hours available for a good long rest at the end of them there was also the matter of their duty it was independence dash and speed and everyone reveled in it he knew that every lieutenant that saw them had his teeth set on edge in envy at their freedom from convoys from plodding patrol duty from rocking along in the wake of a flagship in rigid order under the pitiless eye of senior officers other midshipmen he saw envied him as he climbed through the entry port with orders for they knew that he had more responsibility than they more chances to gain experience they could never have on larger ships more opportunity to practice those skills they only could read about the days were so full of work and the nights so full oflearning how to lead to steer to be in charge that he didnt have much time to think about it he just did it and to be honest it was satisfying parrot went to so many interesting places they might run over to nevis and st kitts then run with a landsmans breeze for kingston jamaica they might go down to st lucia or up to road town there were despatches from the senior admirals that had to go to rustic little savannah in the colonies where the recently vanquished civilians gave dirty looks to anyone wearing the kings coat but their women had to make a living regardless they might go into charleston where a tiny tory minority made the most of their recent victory and wondered how long they could hang on and their parties for visiting officers were frantic with tension that translated into eager ladies whose men were away with cornwallis and tarleton they might work their way into st augustine in the british aoridas and wonder why anyone bothered with such a malarial homespun sort of a place more spanish than anything else a wilderness outpost with one foot in the grave already they might dash north from there to tiny wtlmington up the cape fear river and enjoy the pleasures that the place offered as planters gathered at the shore for fear of their inland cousins once they even got to carry messages as far north as new york and finally went ashore in the great city which turned out to be less impressive than portsmouth back home that was a city that could turn anyone crooked lewrie decided you could hear cannon fire at night and the women pulsed to its sound and the monetary speculation that rode the latest omens for good or ill and the general background of graft and cupidity with military and naval stores could turn a saint into a stockjobber or pimp alan lewrie learned that war could be a powetful aphrodisiac and that a wellsetup young man in a uniform was able to take advantage of it and when he had time to think back on his time before the navy in london he no longer found an aching emptiness but merely vague regrets that he hadnt had more time there to enjoy what he was enjoying now sometimes he was shocked to find in the middle of some duty that he had risen gladly to that duty and was satisfied with the crews progress at small arms gun drill sailtending or his own skill at leading them or performing those personal skills such as longsplicing position plotting and shiphandling he knew he was a different person the alan lewrie of december in no way resembled the one almost pressganged in january his skin was bronzed by the sun his hair a lighter shade of brown from constant exposure hands tougher muscles leaner and fuller and able to cany him aloft or wield a sword with ease his uniforms needed alteration to make room for the bulk he had added in those months of hard work hard play and good food he had some money in hand too for those pleasures of their port stays for parrot had been lucky with prizes though taking ships was not their primary purpose but they had come upon a spanish packet brig in the straits of florida after a gale and took her without a shot being fired since she was still repairing damage and could offer no resistance on passage to st lucia they had run into a native lugger that was manned by a crazed pack of creoles spaniards and poor french who were intent on a little practical piracy without a letter of marque they were totally illegal the leaders were later hanged the lugger sold and the blacks sold at auction plus the head and gun money from taking her they were chased once by a big privateer and had the good fortune first of all to outrun her in a long stem chase and the even greater fortune to run across an english frigate off anegada which promptly went to quarters and took the privateer since they were the only other naval vessel in sight they shared in her prize money altogether lewrie had accrued nearly pounds or at least prize court certificates for that amount which he could sell off to a jobber for at least half their true value or hold on to the largest until he returned to london where he could be paid off had someone forced lewrie to delve into the reasons for a certain smug look of satisfaction on his face he could discover that he was well fed had access to a goodly supply of decent drink got enough sleep was being treated like a real person without being shouted at could play with gods own amount of artillery and what amounted to a yacht and never went more than a fortnight without a chance to get beastly with all the willing mutton within reach chapter stand by the anchor party claghorne yelled through a brass speaking trumpet from the afterdeck by the tiller aye aye lewrie replied raising his fist in the air parrot ghosted along in light air inside the harbor barely raising a ripple under her bows since they had passed the forts on the palisades they had handed all but the outer flying jib and mainsail helms alee the tiller was put over and parrot rounded up slowly into the light ocean breeze until her sails shivered and her forward progress came to a halt let go lewrie lowered his arm briskly and the best bower anchor was cast loose and cable rumbled out the hawsehole loose the outer jib halyard and lower away handsomely he ordered parrot coasted on for a piece until reaching the end of the anchor cable she veered out she snubbed then drifted back slantwise for a way before streaming back from the cable with the light wind straight down her decks by the time the sails had been handed and furled the gig had been brought round from being towed astern and purnell and his boat crew had tumbled into it ready to carry lieutenant kenyon ashore with his bags of mail and despatches they had made good time from english harbor to kingston jamaica this passage the weather had been sparkling clear and mildly sunny and they had not seen one other sail the bumboats began to swarm parrot almost before lieutenant kenyon was away from the side the island blacks offering up tropical birds rum fresh fruits cheap shirts and hats and neckerchiefs and women of just about every color mooney and his mates were busy trying to fend them off goodnaturedly and to stop any furtive trading for rum or other liquors not yet mooney shouted down to a piratical black entrepreneur n keep yer cussed rum fer other ships ya hear de bohsohn he wan no rum lord the man grinned back dis be de kings navy oooo sheer off ya shark we might be outa discipline later but not now then i see you later mistah bohsohn the woman in the traders boat promised sliding her dress up to her waist gawd mooney gawped staring at what was offered lewrie was standing at his side and marvelling right along with him mooney licked his lips in anticipation and dug into his slop trousers to see what silver he had to offer the woman if she was let aboard kenyon returned about two hours later after his visit to the flag looking happy and sated from a good lunch and a bottle of wine he was in a very good mood beaming at everyone mister lewrie summon chips he said i shall need him aye aye sir pass the word for mister bee within moments the elderly carpenter was there mister bee we shall be carrying passengers to antiqua a lord and his lady and two servants kenyon informed him arrange me some sleeping accommodations in the dining space we shall shift all the furnishings to the day cabin and i shall need a larger bed box in the cabin as well there will be a maid berthing in the chart room and a servant in the wardroom mister lewrie since your ears have grown long enough to hear perhaps you could give up your cabin for the duration of the voyage aye sir lewrie replied sadly i shall fetch a hammock from the bosun have everything ready by wednesday sundown mister bee aye aye sir mister purnell kenyon shouted take the cutter ashore with mister leonard to collect fresh supplies well get a bullock for the men plus some fresh meat for our passengers mister claghome aye sir as soon as stores are aboard we shall take the ship out of discipline for a day we cannot depart until thursday the hands standing closest by grinned happily and spread the word through the rest of the crew within seconds they had all lately been given paycertificates and even though they would get cheated badly in transactions for perhaps a quarter of their certificates worth they would have money to spend for their pleasure so they turned to with a lusty will the boat fairly flew across the harbor to the stores dock and returned laden in short order a bawling lean steer was slung aboard and slaughtered on the spot a coop full of chickens appeared several tender piglets and lambs a boar for the hands later in the voyage fresh cabin stores for kenyon and the wardroom and several crates of wine hammering sounds could be heard aft as kenyons request was fulfilled george the servant and several of the west indian ships boys busied themselves polishing and scouring the guest quarters so parrot could make a favorable impression on whoever their prestigious passengers might be by the end of the forenoon watch the crews major work was done and at a signal from kenyon the pendant for easy discipline was hoisted which brought the bumboats swarming back mooney and leonard stood by the entry port along with the surgeons mate to witness the exchange of certificates for cash so that the men were not too badly cheated they also made sure that drink did not make its way below decks in major quantities though some smuggling of small bottles was inevitable lastly the surgeons mate performed his duty of checking the boarding polls for the more obvious signs of the pox he rejected several turning away the oldest and most raddled whores the crew did a good job of sorting as well booing down the arrival of some women that boggs could find no fault with wot a monkeyface throw er back somebody shall ave thisn then mooney asked nobody several men sneered loudly on yer way twicklebum yair go fook a marine someone laughed awnings were spread over the deck and canvas chutes for ventilation while hammocks were slung below in the crews mess area and crude blanket partitions were hung for some semblance of privacy for their rutting the women would work hard to earn their few shillings paired off for a day or night to a lustful seaman who would feed her and ply her with drink out of his earnings like a temporary wife her man had duties to attend to still but she would be waiting below for him once he was released once the sun had lost most of its heat the awnings were taken in and stowed and supper was served along with the second rum ration lewrie made a quick tour of the lower deck to see if all was in order then attended to his own meal he lounged at the mess table in the wardroom half his uniform removed for comfort and sipping at a very decent hock just brought from shore their creole cook had come up with roast chicken fresh bread and butter boiled onions carrots and peas there had been some new stilton and a smail apple apiece too had it not been for the occasional squeal of delight or a husky grunt of transport coming from the crews quarters he could have fallen asleep pleasantly stuffed a bumper with ya lad boggs said happily cupshot and his scruffy white bagwig askew on his head give us heel taps on the last of yer hock and have port with me he accepted a full measure after draining his glass and clinked glasses with boggs goddamn me were close to losing british florida leonard told them as he read a newspaper nearly three months old but new to them good riddance claghome said whole lot of colonies south of the chesapeake is nothin but swamp and bugs and sweat but i mean the rebelsll never hold em against the spanish theyll take em right back and then were in a pickle leonard went on waving the paper at them but if the spaniards lost their fleet in that stonn last year tad purnell asked what have we to worry about hark the younker claghome said purnell and lewrie shared a look between them if one were a midshipman every one of your questions was greeted with ridicule and every one of your answers was usually wrong according to the older men samuel johnson as a midshipman would have been caned for even opening his mouth deguichen has a frog fleet back in the windwards leonard said rodney and parker tangled with him all summer but couldnt finish him off they provide the ships the dons prvide the troops we could have trouble somewhere then the closest american port open to us would be charleston and you know theyd try to take that back cornwallis has enough on his plate as it is let the french come out boggs said loudly let them come i say and the kings navy will square their yards for em gentlemen the navy claghorne shouted raising his glass and they all had to knock their wine back and refill claghorne dipped a taper into the lamp hung over the mess table to get a light for a long clay pipe and was soon happy to lean back with a wreath of tobacco fumes about his head leonard crossed in his opinions by the others withdrew from the fray and put aside the paper to peruse his account books making clucking sounds now and then as he either found some expense he deplored or didnt think he could get the admiralty to believe boggs began to rock and sing but the exact tune was hard to make out and the words slurred together until his wig fell off as he bent to retrieve it he slipped to the deck and stayed there in a heap beginning to snore loudly thank god purnell said when most men considered it a gentlemanly accomplishment to be a threebottle man boggs was more like a halfdozen man and that on top of his rum or black strap issue the suspicion was strong that drink had run him to sea and god help the hand who really needed a surgeon if only boggs was available claghome got to his feet and dragged their surgeons mate to bed and alan and tad slipped out on deck for some fresh air there was none to be had the harbor was as smooth as a millpond and not a capful of wind stirred parrot could almost roll on her beamends under bare poles in a stiff breeze but she now lay as calm as a stone bridge damned hot for december purnell said quietly beside him studying the many riding lights in the harbor well have some weather maybe a late storm its unreal for it to be so still and airless alan replied my how salty weve become for one dipped in brine so little time purnell softly jeered him i still say well get a shift of wind out of this alan insisted you mark my words think enough to put up half a crown on it tad pressed done but you should know better pity to take your money so easy your brothers would know purnells family were from bristol shipowners traders importers and his older brothers were already merchant captains their clan was so absolutely stiff with the chink that purnell clanked when he did a turn about the decks but for all his money he was all right as a mate he did not compete with lewrie for favor and each had their own specialty for purnell it was sailhandling and navigationlewrie was capable but more at home with artillery and small arms tad purnell was also a good fellow to know fairly upright and honest in their dealings but still possessed of a sense of humor and a streak of deviltry that his family and now the navy sat upon to keep from running riot claghome emerged from the hatchway his pipe still fuming and a newspaper clutched in his hand for a long contemplative visit to the heads damn still he said to them well get half a gale out of this right soon i swear sorry about your half a crown lewrie whispered delighted to hear his opinion confirmed by an old tarpaulin man and ill bet our livelumber will be casting up their accounts as soon as we get beyond the breakwater tad said happily just who is this lord cantner lewrie asked purnell after hearing lieutenant kenyon drop the name to his clerk leonard earlier that afternoon rum old squintapipes tries to see six directions at once he used to be a very big planter and trader out here before the war started as big a cutthroat as a mohawk i heard hed become one of lord norths creatures come to see if the war is still winnable but mostlike to collect what he can from his old estates thing that amazes me is that hed bring his wife out here to this place alan said its a sickly climate for a woman well i hear shes much younger and her dowry was worth a dukes ransom probably couldnt stand the thought of her being left back home with time on her hands or someone elses hands on her alan leered look lewrie tad began suddenly unsure of himself if we get ashore this time i was wondering you seem to know a bit about the fairer sex and i god help me but i really should become a pimp alan told himself everyone seems to think im so topping good at it and the sound of our crew slaking their lust is driving you mad is that it purnell well i am fifteen now almost sixteen and ive spent the last three years of my life afloat this ship seems my best chance purnell confessed probably cost you one guinea for a good bareback rider alan warned him with a grin and you have to be careful that you dont get a poxy one i dont know how to tell tad said turning red at his own words but if you sort of gave me a fair wind and a course to steer and you dont want to just hop on and hop off i dont know whores can be right nice if they know its your first time alan said kind of like the pressgang if i had to go why not you too best way is to spend some time with her have a stoup or two get rigged properly bear down and board her and not have to ron for the door after take a dog watch to enjoy watching her move god almighty tad breathed heavily that would be marvelous bloody right it is alan heartily agreed getting the itch himself could you do it i promise i shall they went below for more wine the only thing that seemed to cool the night boggs was snoring and leonard had retired to his cabin to do some writing claghorne came back down through the hatch and poured himself a drink preparatory to turning in shit he said pawing the air sir lewrie asked was it an order or a comment bloodsuckers have found us claghome said waving off a mosquito lewrie heard a whine and looked down to see one ready to perch on his wrist he brought his other hand down and smashed it leaving a tiny smear of blood wellfed little bastard ive seen em down on the spanish main thicker n a channel fog and each one hungry as a rolled leech oaghorne said groggily seen em suck a man white aye mister claghorne tad said with an angelic expression that almost made lewrie snort port up his nose as he tried to stifle a laugh shows how much you know claghorne said but im sleepin with a net tonight to keep em off me you should too if ya had any sense but i spect midshipmen could do with a rash of welts an all the itehin so we usee who caulks down quiet an who tosses all night so saying claghome took his mug of port and went off to his cabin to slam the insubstantial door seen em suck a man white down on the spanish main tad said in a soft whisper and a fairly accurate imitation of claghorne eight bells chimed from the belfry and the ships corporal began to make his rounds to make sure that the galley fire was out and all glims extinguished below decks the wardroom could keep their pewter lamps burning for another hour but after more port neither one wanted to stay up and read tad purnell had the deck watch so he dressed properly and left and lewrie turned in making sure his door was shut tight and that no flying pests lived in his space to disturb his rest it was the next morning while the crew were at divisions that a boat came out to parrot bumping against the hull a mulatto man in livery stood waiting patiently until the men had been inspected and released back to their morning duties and their pleasures after all the wine and a night on deck lewrie felt that his eyes were ready to glaze over and wished he had had more time in his bed box mister lewrie lieutenant kenyon called could you join me lewrie crossed to the hatchway to the after cabins where kenyon stood with a piece of paper in his hand that had just been handed to him by the mulatto servant i have just been given an invitation to a dinner party this evening at the home of an old acquaintance of rnine now sir richard slade he requests that i bring some of my officers as well do you think you could be presentable enough to represent parrot properly aye sir alan assured him most eagerly good purnell as well mister claghorne might be a bit too rough for that sort of company so i shall leave him in charge i should be delighted sir i thought you would be see to making the gig presentable we shall go ashore at the end of the first dog this could be quite important our passengers will be there as well as the lieutenantgovernor and other luminaries from these parts i hope that you and purnell are on your absolute best behavior mind we shall endeavor to please sir lewrie said earnestly but thinking that it would be a splendid opportunity to please himself and possibly initiate thaddeus to the pleasures of strumming a bawd an extremely handsome coach had met them at the boat landing and they rode in comfort through the streets of kingston as night fell the coach ascended a hill overlooking the army camp north of the town then spiralled down to a pleasant valley at the foot of the hills that rose to the east into the blue mountains the house they came to on a shell drive was huge islandbuilt imitation palladian but with a veranda all about it light gleamed from the front rooms and over thirty carriages already stood in the shadows of the trees once in the foyer lewrie began to almost purr in delight there was a large salon aglow in candlelight as large as any he had seen in london perhaps the trim work was not as fine but the drapes and the furnishings were top quality and in impeccable taste and the salon was crowded with people civilians in their finery naval officers in blue and white army and marine officers in red planters in velvet and silk and broadcloth and women women of every imaginable type done up in silk lace velvet satin and damask their bellshaped gowns all trimmed with flowers and embroidered panels their bosoms hitched up in tightfitting bodices lace sleeves and fine wigs jewels shone in flattering candlelight and eyes were already flashing the butler introduced them to no special notice from the crowd which was intent on their own conversations or the delights of the groaning buffets or wine tables james how good to see you after all these years their host said upon spotting kenyon richard kenyon replied rather sir richard now pox on that its still dick to you sir richard slade said and who are these two scamps yours he winked my midshipmen dick kenyon said thaddeus purnell not alexander purnells boy aye sir tad said surprised knew your father well used to do a lot of trading through bristol sir richard beamed midshipman alan lewrie kenyon continued your servant sir richard alan said making a leg what a macaroni he thought must be fifty guineas for his duds but hes too old for them by half sir richard slade sported heavy dark blue breeches made of velvet and an extremely flared coat of powder blue satin sprigged with fanciful gilt braids and button trim gilt buttons everywhere tight sleeves and huge pockets his waistcoat was gold silk with elaborate floral embroidery in spite of the heat he wore a huge floured wig his shoes were even highheeled in the french style and his buckles seemed paved with brilliants altogether the image of a man with too much money and not enough clothes sense his handshake was also as limp as a dead halibut lewrie felt an instant revulsion and wondered where kenyon had made friends with such a coxcomb reminds me of gerald and all his molly friends the pleasures of my house are yours gentlemen sir richard told them james come let us catch up on things it has been too long since weve talked enjoy yourselves kenyon told them within reason if you are allowed why do you not all stay over tonight and accept the hospitality of my home sir richard asked ill have cassius arrange some rooms for you aye but let me send a message to my mate kenyon said a servant was there in a moment and another younger boy in livery to steer kenyon to a study where he could pen some orders for claghorne this left lewrie and purnell alone so they wandered off toward the buffets and the wine tables odd sort lewrie said knows your family does he i suppose but there are so many traders out here we deal with ill have to write father about him well lets get some wine aboard and see what the buffet has to offer oh lord look at the catheads on that woman purnell stared openmouthed at a slim woman in her thirties who sported a pair of breasts that looked as large and firm as apples half her globes swelling above her gown and thrust forward proudly they almost could make out a hint of her rosy aureoles my yes tad breathed close to fingering his crotch dont do that theyll all want some lewrie warned him seeing his strangled expression do you think tonight has possibilities definitely lewrie smirked worldlywise i see no young ladies my age tad frowned and damned lucky you are at that last thing you want is a young girl hold hands giggle and thats all db half these ladies are escorted by officers or husbands who could have you flogged to death if you even breathed on em now that leaves about half to choose from older ladies have a great fascination with younger men tad lewrie said piling tasty morsels onto a plate and should one of those take a fancy to you while her husband is off doing something grand for king and country and discover that its your first time i swear you may not survive her kindness oh i didnt consider a married lady alan that would be a sin i thought wed find a young whore i mean doing it with a married lady would be a mortal sin tad fidgeted would it be a sin with a widow lewrie asked nibbling on some shrimp as they grazed their way down the long foodladen table well im not sure tad fidgeted some more there are all kinds of widows purnell this hock is iced by god marvelous you were talking about widows tad said taking a glass of wine without caring what it was well some have lost their mates to the grim reaper naturally lewrie said leading him to a quiet corner where they could munch and drink without being trampled by the crowd but there are some widows who have lost their husbands some become enamored of someone prettier or younger or they have chased after their careers or money or a peerage to the total exclusion of their wives happiness they have committed the greatest sin you can inflict on a woman still ripe and comely tad they have shunned them ignored them denied them well i suppose if the husband was really tired of her consider a woman who enjoys a romp and affection and loving all the folderol being cast aside like an orange that has been sucked dry there is a woman who is as much a widow as the natural kind mourning the loss of everything she staked her life on and some of them are just aching to get their own back somewhere here tonight tad there are women exactly like that just waiting to find a strapping little chub like you lewrie beguiled nigh mystically purnells eyes cut about the room he finished his wine in two sips but what if she doesnt find me attractive or i dont like her or something we shall do our best for you tad now go slow on the wine you need oysters and some of those spicy kickshaws to raise the heat of your blood and we can chat up a few now cause were going to get seated far below the salt at this party their end of the long table was definitely below the salt the rich the highranking and the glittering were near the head of the dining room on either side of sir richard and lord cantner in plum satin and his wife who was a raven beauty with an adventurous look to her eyes no wonder the old monkey brought her lewrie thought were she my wife i wouldnt let her out of the room by herself their closest dinner companions were less impressive socially an older couple from the customs a magistrate and his wife a matron named gordon with her daughter both of whom would serve if one didnt mind countryputs purnell was seated next to a sleepy old gentleman said to be some sort of bankerit didnt matter much because he could barely open an eye to survey his plate but on purnells other side was a lean older woman named mrs hillwood who at one time must have been a great blond beauty during the course of conversation they learned that her lawful blanket was off in the wilds inland doing plantationtype things and had been for some months to alans left was a woman named haymer a short plump and fetching woman in her late thirties lewrie guessed done up nicely in white taffeta with burgundy ribbons and flounces it seemed her husband was also off on business in the americas hmm possibles alan thought halfway through dinner lewrie had to nudge purnell to open his mouth and speak to mrs hillwood instead of feeding like a beast he felt a kick back under the table and looked up to glare at tad but instead met the steady gaze of mrs hillwood that appears such succulent pork before you mister lewrie mrs haymer said to his left do be a dear and carve me a small slice delighted mrs haymer in fact i may assay a bit myself as she offered her plate to him she leaned toward him pressing her posom against his arm were aboard he exulted how clumsy of me she said dropping her napkin ill fetch it allow me he offered bending over and wondering if he should attempt a small squeeze right away but in reaching for it mrs haymers hand brushed his thigh and stayed to linger such a wonderful texture she sighed after chewing a bite of her pork i think it is dreadful that poor young sailors such as you never get any fresh food it is a great trial maam he sighed right back and then there are banyan days when not even a morsel of meat is served no matter how long incask scandalous she replied locking her gaze firmly on his eyes how relieved you must be to dine well when ashore indeed maam he told her softly shifting his gaze to her ample bosom the mere sight of all this bounty has raised quite a passion in me to eat my fill without inhibition that bosom heaved deeply at his words and a fine sheen of sweat broke out on her upper lip she hoisted her glass and drank deep we were happy that our captain received sir richards in vitation lewrie went on poor sailors are dependent on the generosity of others for such a feast lewrie glanced about the table to see if his wooing was making any comment but the sleepy old gentleman had succumbed to wine fumes and sat snoring with a hand clawed about the stem of his empty glass the gordons did appear mildly shocked and were busy looking elsewhere as though mrs haymer was no better than she ought to be and had tried this on before mrs hillwood across the table gave him a barely noticeable shrug then turned her attentions to tad her left hand went below the table and young tad suddenly looked as though he was about to strangle you must rejoin your ship tonight mister lewrie mrs haymer asked in a very soft voice sir richard and my captain are old friends ma am he has offered us the hospitality of his house for the night how generous of our host i am told that he is scandalously rich and has the most blessed luck at getting ships across the ocean without loss i admire generosity in the giving or in the receiving maam both she said dimpling prettily and blushing the gardens here are most beautiful too bad you could not see them in daylight a cool stroll in a fresh garden would be delightful no matter the hour maam lewrie purred with dinner over the ladies retired for first shot at the jakes then coffee and cards while the men shuffled down to the head of the table to talk and drink and smoke waiters produced an ocean of port and opened the sideboards to place chamber pots below the table within range of those gentlemen who felt the call lewrie and purnell stayed long enough for a glass of port then sneaked out being nobodies none of the company would miss them alan was almost reeling with the bounty they had been offeredhe had not seen a dinner like that in a year spicy soup fresh green salads beef chicken pork two kinds of fish rabbit veal geese hot bread native yams local kickshaws and made dishes for removes corn potatoes beans and peas a wine with each course lovely fresh cheese and extrafine biscuits and nuts even limiting himself to a mere sliver of everything following captain osmondes advice he felt uncomfortably tight around the middle thankfully once they joined the ladies there was strong coffee or tea with fresh milk and sugar mrs haymer was happy to join him on the veranda with a cup of coffee as the older couples made their goodbyes and clattered off in their carriages the younger bucks and their girls were also going but many people were staying on for the music and cards and the chance of a cold supper later with more wine you said something about the gardens i believe maam lewrie prodded and mrs haymer allowed him to offer his arm and lead her off the veranda into the fragrant night air it was really much cooler in the gardens once past the glow of the house lights in the darkness of flowering shrubs and bushes and planters i do believe there is a maze hereabouts with some stone benches where we may rest mister lewrie if you would allow me to lead they eventually discovered a culdesac surrounded by flowers and a small grove hidden by the turn in the path in the center of the grove was a large round stone table surrounded by curved stone benches they seated themselves in the companionable darkness lewrie offering his coat to protect her dress from the bench he put an arm behind her on the table and leaned toward her able to smell her their thighs were touching through the vastness of her skirts their shoulders were touching she turned toward him slightly is it not a beautiful night mister lewrie the stars in these climes are so clear and lovely she began their play i see enough stars at sea id much rather gaze on your beauty he smarmily responded mister lewrie i cannot imagine what you can be thinking of she ventured to giddily protest of the glory that is you mrs haymer he said leaning closer which she did not object to i must protest young sir she said but not too loudly i am a married woman and you are such a boy call me alan he whispered all right alan but had i known that you intended to woo me when we set out from the house i would not have allowed you why what must people think of my good name and my husband is a most jealous man he would most likely kill you did he discover you had even gotten me alone i shall risk your husbands temper mrs haymer and we are quite alone and private here what is your name my dear he said putting his ann along her shoulders margaret if you must know but margaret so womanly so lovely soft alan i fear you have misjudged me she said making no move to break away i could not hazard your young life and we must not tempt each other like this my husband would shoot you dead i must taste your lips and hang the danger he said he brushed her mouth with his kissed her eyes cheeks then took possession of her lips and felt her tremble a little she raised her face to him a hand came up to hold the back of his head she began to moan and make cooing sounds he brought up his free hand and caressed a restrained breast god we must not do this she said weakly against his neck as he bent to kiss her shoulders i forbid you and so saying her arms encircled him and she leaned back against the edge of the table as he slid and squinned to press more of her against him a leg came up to caress him as he slid his free hand down to her buttocks im going to snap my spine or hers like this he thought getting to his feet and pulling her with him so they couid fit together for their full length she stood on tiptoe to match him and ground her belly into him as he squeezed down through all the material of her gown trying to find flesh to press on her backside alan i demand that you cease now she shuddered we must not persist in this i i shall resist you with force if necessary his reply was to free her breasts and bend down to press his face into her appledumpling shop noting that her nipples were rockhard and her bosom all warm and soft he seated her on the table and knelt on a bench before her and she parted her thighs for him his fingers were busy with the back of her sack gown while hers opened his waistcoat and their lips ground against each other bringing a salty taste she gasped as he lifted her gown and all her petticoats and stepped closer struggling with the buttons of his straining breeches you will witness that i was forced she said in a soft voice as he slid her forward toward him and found her wet and slick and open for him she gasped and squealed as he entered her deep and clung to him fierce as a new bride as he began slowly pumping away after a while she began to sob and gnaw on his shoulder and lifted her legs about his waist to hold him closer to her oh god my husband shall surely kill you for this oh god yes he shall oh alan and much more in the same vein a moment later she squealed in delicious transport and melted to him as he stood between her thighs until his own release exploded into her she insisted he was a heartless ravisher but helped as they explored the cool surface of the table knelt on a bench before him as he stood behind her ahold of her hips she cried softly for mercy as she drew him down on the grass in only corset and stockings to ride saint george above him her heavy breasts dangling in his palms while she galloped as frenzied as a huntsman riding hellforleather for a distant steeple while he looked up at the stars and her crumpled face between bouts she fought him without strength swore he was sure to be killed for ravishing her that he had tempted her weak and vulnerable nature it was midnight before they felt sated enough to dress and head back to the veranda the dinner and card party was still going strong as people got drunker and louder music played and some danced i must go now she said attempting to adjust her wig and hat dont see me in i would die of shame i must look ravaged use my room to rearrange yourself dear alan said still eager to use her more we can send down for cold wine perhaps a bite of supper you cant go home like this or face the company so mussed you must swear that you shall not abuse me further what you have done is mortal sin enough i must make myself presentable only to save my honor will i go upstairs promise me mrs haymer dithered i promise he looked about for kenyon tad or their host but they were not present the servant cassius approached i shall be retiring shortly cassius lewrie said id admire some cold hock and something from the supper before that light us up this lady tripped and fell while taking the air in the gardens and she would like to freshen up before going home yas sab cassius said with a knowing expression he summoned a tiny linkboy with a candelabra who led them toward the side stairs as margaret went on i thank you for the kind offer of your room so i may rearrange myself mister lewrie i promise i shant delay your retiring any more than i can help the room was small but pleasant titted with a washhand stand and mirror chest armoire and a table and two chairs by the veranda doors the bed was high curtained with thin cloth to keep insects off during the night the linkboy lit two candles and stepped out into the hall lewrie following to complete the sham as margaret began to attend to her makeup and dress the boy went down the stairs with the candelabra leaving lewrie alone in the dark hall listening to the sounds of the house within few minutes the boy was back as cassius ascended the stairs with a tray bearing a chilled bottle of hock glistening and dripping dew a covered server redolent of tongue ham and roast chicken two plates and two glasses cassius knocked on the door and was admitted margaret blushed even further when she saw the tray and its contents and glared at lewrie in the doorway i shall not discommode you further mister lewrie she said take your time madam i am quite happy to wait in the hall until you have completed your toilet he offered to her dignity i wait n light the lady down sah cassius asked i shall do that no bother lewrie told him and the servant gave him a slight nod on his way out lewrie stepped out into the dark hall to protect her reputation at least until the servants had made their way down the stairs once they were out of sight alan started to reenter the room but was taken by the sight of a dark lady at the end of the hall clad in a thin gown making her way surreptitiously from one room to another and from the stealthy way she handled the doorknobs and avoided creaks she was most practiced at countryhouse games in the shadows he was unseen and grinned with delight as he saw that the lady bore a striking resemblance to lady cantner he scratched at his own door and not hearing any answer turned the knob and entered mrs haymer had seated herself in front of a small mirror redoing her makeup and still wore her wig and hat i really am going to go alan she said i am not a guest in this house we must end this charade you have done enough he stepped up behind her and put his hands on her shoulders and began to massage her neck she relaxed and leaned back against him he bent down and kissed her shoulders like hell i have no alan do not tempt me further please he raised his hands and lifted her wig off hat and all she had cut her hair short for the heat of the tropics little longer than his he pulled her to her feet and linked his arms around her from behind massaging her breasts through her corset and gown i mean to have you in a real bed so i can look at all of you so i can get at all of you no there isnt time i must go he hoisted her gown and pressed his aching groin against the pillowsoftness of her buttocks fitting between the mounds take your time spoon em up with kisses and cream and theyll sit on it like it was the crown jewels give em half a choice an you can whistle before theyd let you but tell em and they melt some of em anyway one hand held a breast one hand pressed at the base of her belly twining in the mossy growth still damp with their passion it was a matter of moments to have her out of her gown to shuck his own rags to peel her stockings off unlace her corset and tumble into bed on top of her as though mesmerized she allowed herself to be opened to be molded and kissed and stroked into panting ruin once more and then again and again the candles guttered down in puddles of tallow before he allowed her to insist and win that she must depart by his watch it was nearly three in the morning and the house was dead quiet as he lit her down the stairs with a stub of a candle she pressed a note with her address into his hand told him that her only servant had the day off on thursdays which was soon that he must not even consider ever seeing her again and that there was a garden gate entrance to her lodgings on a quiet side street but that he must desist in his passion before her husband shot him dead she slunk into her coach practically the last one still on the grounds and plodded away at a pace that would not draw undue attention as birds began to twitter in the trees now maybe i can eat that bird lewrie said aloud he found another candle by a cardtable as his own guttered out then trod softly back up the stairs in his stockinged feet once in his room he slid out of his clothes and went to the tray the wine was enough for a full bumper and still cool and the cold meat and crusty bread went down pleasantly he was sitting at the small table stark naked and chewing lustily when he heard a tiny noise in the hall it brought a grin somebody sneaking back to their lawful blanket ill warrant a shadow stopped outside his door a moment later a folded note was pushed with some force under the gap of the door sliding three or four feet into the room across the polished boards shes surely not come back for more he scoffed rising to pick it up and read it he almost spilled his wine when he realized what he held evidently mrs hillwood the faded blond lady had not been pleased by his choice of mrs haymer if she herself had slipped the note under the door then she had stayed as someones guest for the nighthe hoped it was tad purnell but she was inviting him to attend her if the navy did not require him damme i love the navy he thought happily where else can i get into so much mischief so quickly i trust you both eqjoyed sir richards dinner party kenyon said as they rode back through town in the coach it was much too early for alan he had barely gotten to sleep when a servant had arrived with hot coffee and sweetened rolls and practically pushed him into his clothing he had scarcely had time to shave not that that was yet a daily necessity oh aye sir he said worn down to a nubbin he could not have felt much worse if he had emptied the punchbowl down his own gullet and retired a puking corpse purnell on the other hand glowed in silence with a mystified expression all youthful innocence evidently he had had a restful sleep after his introduction to the alpha and omega of pleasure but his beatific pose was betrayed by the lacetrimmed handkerchief that peeked from a waistcoat pocket as soon as they had gotten into the coach purnell had grinned so hugely that lewrie was sure that mrs hillwood had been most generous with her favors now alans main concern was if he wished to avail himself of those same favors and just how he would go about it if he did the somber heat and stillness of the day before had gone with the approach of clouds from the east and a cooling wind blew dead foul for antigua perhaps delaying their sailing it was only wednesday and their distinguished passengers would not board until evening with a dawn departure planned on the land breeze thursday but if the trades did not back to the noreast it would be a hard beat just to clear morant point clawing off a lee shore they would not risk their passengers to that surely i dont think were going to get a fair wind by moming lieutenant kenyon said surveying the harbor and the wind indicators too much easterly for a storm isnt it sir lewrie said and too late in the year for a hurricane id have thought perhaps oh nautical one kenyon laughed i shall send mister purnell to the flag with a message concerning this wind shift i doubt if they wish to hazard our lord and lady we may be delayed dh good alan said without thinking have you some ulterior motive for wishing to stay in kingston mister lewrie well there are my paycertificates sir now i have them i have wanted a sextant like mister ellison had in ariadne they are more accurate than a quadrant and if we have to thread up the bahamas again i would feel more secure in my reckoning i hear they are fifteen guineas but i may find one for less with something to pledge for credit kenyon only stared at him and lewrie dropped back in his seat suddenly intent on the view hoping his lie might suit but their departure was delayed the flag did not wish to send a lord to his death on a lee shore nor did the local admiral desire to have his career end suddenly by losing an important government official the cantners would not board parrot until thursday evening for a friday departure the mail was not a priority nor were any orders they carried of an urgent nature that would allow no delay of transportation lewrie went below to change into fresh clothing after sweating up what he had worn at dinner and sport he also had the wardroom servant haul up a bucket of saltwater so that he could sponge himself somewhat clean in the privacy of his tiny cabin mister lewrie kenyon called from the hatch to his cabins i believe you have some shopping to do aye sir he said halfway into a clean shirt so do i and mister claghorne does not begrudge remaining in charge for a while longer at the end of the day watch i will allow you to go ashore with me well leave mister purnell here to pursue his own endeavors aye aye sir lewrie scribbled a quick note and passed it to a passing bumboat with a shilling for delivery and the return of an answer taking care that no one noticed within two hours a message was returned to him mrs hillwood would be at home for tea and would be delighted to have him join her alan purnell said once they were aft by the taffrail deep in the flag lockers for inventory it was wonderful i thought you did you little rogue how does it feel to be a buck of the first head he congratulated grand she gave me her handkerchief it still has her perfume her tad blushed crimson next time youre back in kingston youll have a place to go alan told him cringing a bit that he was soon to be coupled with the same woman uhm how was she well she was very slim as you might have noticed not bad though i thought she was going to eat me alive for a time there tad answered with a sly adult grin how grand for you alan said smiling at the news that mrs hillwood enjoyed devouring midshipmen he was aching with anticipation by the time he and lieutenant kenyon were dropped off at the boat landing a little after pm as the town began to awaken from the hottest part of the day and cooling shadows lengthened i shall sup at the grapes yonder kenyon said pointing to a modest and homely georgianstyle inn i wish you back here before midnight may i trust you mister lewrie aye sir lewrie said wondering if kenyon thought he was going to take legbail from the navy then leave the ladys address with the doorkeeper at the inn should i need you before then kenyon said making lewrie gape at kenyons powers of observation how did you know it was a lady sir he said flummoxed that is for masters and commanders to know and for rutting midshipmen to discover later in their careers now off with you and if you truly do find a sextant for less than fifteen guineaslet me known if they have another aye sir lewrie was continually amazed by kenyon and his attitude toward him it was much more lenient than he had come to expect from a sea officer toward a lowly midshipman of so little practical experience he thought that kenyon truly liked him and he knew that he had made great progress in gaining nautical skills as a result of it but the exact reasons why it was so nagged at him who else would be a coconspirator in his designs on a lonely grasswidow it was almost beyond credence and there were times that alan felt that there was a debt building up which might someday have to be repaid and being born a leery soul he found mrs hillwoods building a great walled enclosure with a central court and front double iron gate that opened off a quiet side street on the alleys there were discreet servants entrances normally he would be scratching at one of those but this afternoon he was an openly invited guest so he entered the court and was faced with several apartments mrs hillwoods number was on the second floor overlooking the court and its garden and fish pool the door was opened by a black maidservant and he heard the tinny tinkling of a harpsichord and the munnur of several voices at once his expectant erection became a distinct embarrassment as he realized it truly was a tea with other guests and not the sly invitation to strum the damned woman he had thought it was ah our other guest mrs hillwood said rising to greet him this is midshipman alan lewrie from parrot the despatch boat mister lewrie allow me to name to you reverend robinson your servant sir alan said adjusting roles and making a graceful leg to the man a young chubby and obviously poor sort of curate he met the reverends wife a blubberbooby who had difficulty even bowing from a seated position a planter and his wife and an army officer from the local regiment with a young woman of his acquaintance the teas good anyway alan thought sourly sipping from his cup and gathering a small plate of baked trifles to pass the time it was an agonizing hour and a half of small talk of privateers prices in the indies prospects for crushing the rebellion in america facing up to the french and the spanish the state of the church the latest poems and a screed against those damned wesleys and methodism lewrie got to put his oar in about life in the navy and hoped he was amusing about some of his first experiences but he could not hope to match broadsides with the reverend mr robinson or an opinionated young army major who was barely two years older than himself and sure that he was the last word on military affairs only reason hes a major is that he could buy a subalterns commission and then buy his way up as people chucked it lewrie told himself and he wasnt too sure that he really didnt know more about small arms and musketry and most especially artillery than the young man in the red coat with the scarlet sash gorget and epaulet mrs hillwood finally began to break up the tea party as the others began to stir in mutual boredom the major gossip had been delivered their bladders were full and it was getting on for sundown lewrie sighed and looked for his hat while mrs hillwood gushed over the reverend and his chickabiddy wife at the door you hat sah the maidservant said softly lewrie had not had many island women most of them were sure to be poxed if they dwelled anywhere near a harbor but this one was tempting she tapped the brim of his hat forcing him to look down there was a folded note in the inside of the crown aha now were getting somewhere must be from mrs hillwood i doubt if the servant can write furtively he stood to one side adjusting his neckcloth in a mirror with his hat resting on the small table below it and opened it to read without the others seeing he was gratified to see that it was short and to the point return in a quarterhour alan made his goodbyes publicly with the others and set off at a brisk pace to town when he was readmitted to the apartments the second time after a short detour to allay suspicion the maidservant was now dressed in a hat and lace shawl she let him in then slipped out the door herself leaving him alone in the front parlor there was no sign of mrs hiuwood but there was now a serving tray on the tea table that held several bottles alan helped himself to some claret mister lewrie mrs hillwood said sweetly entering the room from the back rooms she had changed her more formal sack dress for a loose morning gown and now sported her own hair instead of a floured wig she walked up to him and gave him a light kiss on the cheek as one would greet an old friend before breezing out of his hungry reach to cross to the array of bottles he was amazed to see her pour herself a healthy measure of blue ruin after the tedium of such guests i have need of gin mister lewrie i am very happy that you would accept my invitation to return i would not have missed it i assure you mrs hillwood come sit with me she said alighting gracefully on a sofa and patting the brocaded fabric next to her he obeyed those people say the same things time after time but it is my duty as a woman of some consequence here on the island to allow them to pay their respects though they cost me my time and my patience at sea we have no choice of our messmates either alan said sipping at his wine they can become predictable and you dislike tedium do you not mister lewrie as i i like adventure he grinned turning in his seat to her a direct young man how delightful mrs hillwood said waving her empty glass at him in silent request for a refill she had the look in her eyes of a predator and alan noticed that her nose was long and hawklike the only mar of her still considerable beauty though she must have been at least in her midtolate forties he took her glass and went to the table to pour her another dose of gin and to top up his claret as well your captain allows you ashore for how long mister lewrie she asked tucking her legs up on the sofa and leaning over one ann if the wind does not shift suddenly i have tij midnight he said carrying her drink back to her how generous he is she said and such a good friend of sir richard slade so he told me maam though i dont know the connection he handed her the glass there was now no place to sit next to her so he stood easy one hand behind his back like a deck officer and the other at highport with the glass she seemed amused so you like adventure she said after a healthy slug of her gin were you adventurous last night a gentleman never tells lewrie said with a tight grin and took a sip of his own drink nonsense gentlemen always tell why else do they linger so long over the port while we poor women have to retire to cards and coffee and talk of tatting lace you sound like someone who enjoys adventure yourself maam he posed dh please be he thought dh i do and i was i confess disappointed that you found that tawdry little dumpling more preferable your friend was amusing even so for all his clumsiness it was his debut maam but i trust that your kindness and generosity treated him well lewrie said feeling somewhat out of his depth he had never run into a woman of her wealth and position that wasnt a little sniveller and simperer always swearing that they had never done anything like that before and that he was the ravisher that broke down their resistance yet here was a woman ready to admit to desires of the flesh as strong as his and from tads description of his night with her she would be as aggressive as a lioness he was smiling peacefully when i left him she said finishing her drink and waving for him to serve once more thats good he said going back to the table for more gin poor tad smiles so seldom and poor mister lewrie she purred enticingly i am always seeking amusements to lighten the soul ma am he told her with mock gravity he stood close with her drink but instead of reaching to take it from him she put out a hand to his crotch and ran light fingers over his evident excitement through the cloth of his breeches never send a boy to do a mans job she said you look so stifled in that uniform of yours take it off and be comfortable as he struggled out of his coat and waistcoat she undid his breeches and as his neckcloth and shirt went flying across the room she bent down and kissed his manhood so strong so upright and you taste of ocean salt oh god he said throwing his head back to look at the ceiling as she clasped his buttocks and drew him into her bring our drinks she ordered breaking off and swaying off to the back rooms while he tried to shed his shoes and breeches and follow mrs betty hillwood was as they said a mankiller she sobbed and she groaned deep in her throat flinging her head back and forth and gasping riding him rantipole with her hands clawed into his shoulders and when she hit the melting moments she sounded like someone being flogged at each warm stroke she was incredibly slim with much smaller breasts than alan preferred but her nipples and aureoles were large and dark her hipbones dug into him harshly but her flesh was incredibly fine and soft over her thin frame the down of her legs was maddening as she stroked his buttocks with her legs and clasped him tight to her and she loved to have his fingers twine in the sopping wet hair of her underarms as she gripped the headboard and thrust back at him stroke for stroke they broke for more drink for a cold supper that they ate in bed still tangled in the linen they stood in a large tub of cool water that had been standing all day and sponged themselves then went to the edge of her high bed and made love seated followed by more to drink frankly betty hillwood could put gin away like a grenadier and it only made her more passionate more animal in her actions and in her desires which already seemed insatiable she complained about her driedup stick of a husband who liked island boys out at the plantations more than her of how hard it was to find suitable satisfaction for her own desires in so proscribed a society as the islands where there were so few true aristocrats who had a freer code of conduct than the squirearchy that made up most of the traders and planters of her own association she then took on another load of blue ruin and proceeded to make up for lost opportunities on alan who was wearing out once he was spent she dandled him and kissed him into performing once more just once more dont flag on me alan dear she pleaded halfdrunk now and her hair hanging slatternloose about her face i need a real man to spit me and split me oh god i need your hard prick deep inside me so hard and strong he lay on his back on the piledup pillows almost hoping that it was time to leave she lay between his outflung legs idly trying to get his interest up once more clutching his member with one hand and her eternal glass of gin in the other she now reminded him of a oneshilling whore eyes red and rheumy with drink face flushed and mottled and the marks of age more prominent he sneaked a look at his watch on the nightstandgod only ninethirty im hungry betty love let me go to the jakes and have some food he said softly as long as shes got hold of my prick damme if i want to get her mad then will you love me she pouted absolutely he said but even cannon have to reload he rolled out of the bed and went to the necessary closet then came back and wrapped a sheet about him he picked through the supper dishes to find some cold beef cheese and bread he fed her dainty bites while he wolfed most of it down she stood up and walked nude to the nearest bottle of gin which was empty oh damn she said flinging it into a comer with a noticeable list she tacked her way out of the bedroom made some alarming clinking noises in the parlor and returned with a fresh bottle i must tell you alan my sweetling that you are the most impressive man i have played balum rancum with in ages she slurred as she crawled up his body to lay her head on his chest and you betty are a tigress he said which seemed to please her also your husband is a fool aye hes that and more she laughed spilling gin on his ribs which felt cool she licked at his side and he squirmed ticklish my chuck felt good he admitted with a husky chuckle then i must do more of it she said tipping her glass and making a small pool of gin in his belly button which she proceeded to lap like a tabby running her tongue allover his stomach and chest yes my husband is a fool and a backgammon player always looking for a new black boy to play with if id known that id have never mamed him and moved to this disgusting island she said between applications were it possible to divorce him i would and go back to london where i belong where the right sort of people dont begrudge a woman her needs therere so many of them you know i know lewrie sighed as she treated his nipples with gin and tender care so many mollys out there she muttered my half brother disgusting little shit but not you sweetling she smiled reaching down to dandle his penis which was showing signs of life you know at first i thought you might be being houseguests of sir richards me keep doing that and i warrant ill show you again that im not alan vowed with heat sir richard tries to be discreet but hes most infamous for it she said sliding down toward his groin and parting the sheet are you sure he asked sitting up i mean i wondered about him such a coxcomb of course im sure and id watch out for my captain too were i you dearest alan shall i tell you a secret yes he replied unsure i spose last night on my way upstllirs with your eager little friend god i felt like a matron leading her youngest son i saw sir richard and your captain she simpered upstllirs entering a room together it was quite late isnt that just delicious she leeringly rejoiced good god woman it cant be hes a real taut hand a real sailor man theres nothing molly about him remember theres an article of war against it she said now let me improve your taste a little betty proceeded to dribble gin over his member which stung after all the exertions he had demanded of it over the last two days then before he could complain she slipped her warm mouth down over it her tongue sliding and flicking without conscious will he became erect deep between her lips as she raised and lowered her head over him making him as rigid as a marlinspike as tumescent as a belaying pin he gripped her head between his hands and lay back on the pillows half his mind on what she had implied about lieutenant kenyon never mind he decided giving himself over to the intense pleasure she was giving him ill think about that some other time even drake had time for a game of bowls didnt he alan let himself out into a dark and nearly empty street at eleven that night betty hillwood had demanded and he had risen to the call of duty until she had cuddled up to him reeking of gin and her sweat and the aroma of their lovemaking he had sponged off gotten dressed properly and had tucked her in for the night he had also left a note in her hand that expressed his joy at their coupling and a promise that next time he was in kingston he would be sure to spend three days sunk deep into every part of her after her conversation of the evening he was sure that she would be aroused and titillated by his choice of language the woman has a billingsgate streak to her he assured himself happily she may play the great lady but shes a damned great cracking tuppenny tart with a mouth like a fishwife he strolled loosehipped down the hill to the grapes feeling peckish once more and in need of sustenance and a pot of coffee if he was to pass kenyons sharp eye most of the stores were closed but he found a small chandlery open at that late hour and their light drew him in they had a used copy of a smohett novel peregrine pickle and he remembered that it was a good long read so he parted with three shillings for it they did not have sextants and if they did they were twentyfive guineastheys a war on sor an everythins short they is so he loafed his way into the grapes and took a table by the window overlooking the boat landing yer servant sir this fine evenin the publican said still got your ordinary all gone sor but if yer partial to pork i can still slice ya some got some nice figgydowdy fer yer sweet tooth too the moonfaced man said wiping his hands on his blue apron that and bread and coffee rightho the man replied smartly fetching a candle from a vacant table so he could see better the grapes was haifempty the crowd made up of naval officers for the most part none too senior to put a damper on things the few civilians seemed there on sufferance alan got his coffee and began to sip at it enjoying it black and rolling the bitterness about his mouth to kill the odor of all the claret he had downed he was about to crack his book in the ample glow of the candle when he heard a coach rattling up outside he glanced out the window with idle curiosity the coach looked familiar as did the mulatto man in ii very who got down from the boot the coach occluded the lamps at the boat landing and threw a deep shadow toward the inn but the torches by the door of the grapes relieved that opaqueness enough for him to see that it was sir richard slades coach and that the coachee and the footman were the same ones who had driven them out to the house party he twisted in his chair the better to see and to lean back against the homey brick wall above the wainscoting so that he himself would not be seen framed in the window there were people in the coach two hats and a flash of some sheened material one hat was trimmed with feathers and white lace the other showed only a gold loop and the flash of a button very like a naval officers cockade very like a lieutenants plain black cocked hat with only a dogs vane of ribbon held in place by the gold loop of braid and a gilt fouledanchor button the hats leaned close together and stayed that way for a long moment then the mulatto opened the coach door and flipped down the steps one passenger prepared to depart but before he did so he leaned back in and alan could clearly see two men pressing their lips together not in the fond farewell kiss that childhood friends might bestow upon each other at parting but in the writhing practiced kiss of two men who were both of the same inclination was it his imagination or had he given betty hiilwood such a fond farewell just minutes before with the same sweetsad spark of remembered passion he felt sick at his stomach pray god its someone else he whispered clenching his fists hard and ignoring the arrival of his cold supper holy shit on a biscuit he said bitterly the man in the coach was the effeminate sir richard slade down to the very suit the man departing the coach was lt james kenyon master and commander of hms parrot if yer not wantin anythin else right away sor thatll be two shillins the publican repeated yes lewrie said fumbling out coins blindly here rightyho then lewrie spun away from the window and propped the book up with fumbling hands in front of him he took a scalding sip of coffee and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand he dug into his cold pork and pease pudding as though he had been at for some time though each bite threatened to gag him on the way down and sat queasy as a lump of coal once in his stomach kenyon entered the inns public rooms a moment later sharing a cheery greeting with the other officers of his rank at the other tables he spotted lewrie by the window and came over to join him and what are you having mister lewrie he asked jovially spot of cold supper sir and a whacking thick book kenyon said picking it up to read the title peregrine pickle is it just the thing for you a roguish adventure and long as a welsh mile mind if i join you not at all sir alan replied taking back the book and marking his place at random as though he had read part of it no sextant i see twentyfive guineas if they had one sir will you be havin anythin sor the publican asked brandy for me kenyon said briskly and a pint of stingo to wash it down other than that did you enjoy your time ashore kenyon asked casually flinging a leg over the arm of his chair a catlapping party with a lady i made acquaintance of at sir richards sir lewrie said forced to smile at the unintended doubleentendre of a tea party and what mrs hillwood had done with her gin and her tongue devilish boring though went au over town looking in the stores then paid down socketmoney for an obliging wench he stared at kenyon directly not as adoring midshipman to older brother or superior officer as if daring him with an account of some manly endeavor no i think smollett has no lessons to teach you mister lewrie but it was a bit more forced than before his grin and you sir lewrie asked getting intent on his meal a gentleman never tells me lad kenyon said as his brandy and strong beer arrived and he took time to wet his tongue frankly theres a willing enough tit i have been seeing just got back from seeing her home parents are chawbacons made it rich out here and shed be a good enough rattle but shes such a countryput and her family is so eager for a good match theyre hotter than a false justice with suggestions of marriage i didnt think marriage and the navy went well together sir lewrie said what with the long separations and all youre right there kenyon said still not tumbling to the fact that lewrie knew more than he should why tie yourself down to a termagant little mort when you can have a wife in every port for half the cost eh or just take it to sea with you lewrie said knowing that many ships allowed women aboard all the time and that there were many captains who traveled with their wives or mistresses now thats something i dont hold with women at sea kenyon said firmly thumping down his pint of stingo to exchange it for the glass of brandy and theres many a captain ive known that will tell you that its bad for morale and discipline ill bet you have lewrie thought here was the man he wished to emulate the only officer who had been in any way kind to him since he had been forced into the navy acting bluff and hearty as the biggest rogering buck and secretly a sodomite was that why he asked for me to join parrot because he thought hed have a go at my backside someday by god if he ever lays a finger on me ill kill him just being around him makes me sick sir richards sly wink lewrie recalled did he think i was already kenyons that did not stop him however from eating every bite of his rich sweet figgydowdy knowing there would be nothing like that once they had sailed friday noon found parrot due south of morant point beating her way offshore for antigua the wind had backed to the sou east and with her jibs and gaff sails laid close to the centerline she clawed for every yard to windward bowling along with her lee rail slanted close to the bright blue sea and leaving a creaming wake bone white behind her their passengers were no trouble lord cantner was a minikin of a man not above five feet tall but obviously much taller when he sat on his purse his wife lady cantner was indeed the raven beauty alan had seen sneaking down the dark hallway at sir richard slades and she recognized him as well and blushed prettily when introduced she was not quite thirty while cantner was a stringy sort pushing sixty and a colts tooth for marrying such a younger woman who had such a roving eye lewrie was irked that the manservant had his berth space and was reduced to swaying in a hammock over the wardroom table again but so far they had been no bother for all the first day parrot labored hard to make her easting without losing ground to leeward but she was putting up a steady eleven knots and sometimes striking twelve and it was such a joy to be on deck in the mild winter sunshine with the wind howling and the rigging humming and crying and spray and foam flying about her like dust from a thundering coach that lewrie could find solace from his disappointment in lieutenant kenyon still he found it hard to be properly civil to him so he reduced himself to duty and did not seek out the sort of friendly chats they had enjoyed before by the second day the wind had veered more east and they turned and tacked so they would not be set upon hispaniola angling more to the sousou east half east which would bring them below antigua but in position for another tack direct for english harbor and the waiting winter convoy for england it was on the second day that the acting quartermaster went down sick complaining of severe headaches and boggs was at a loss as to the cause the man quickly got worse pouring sweat retching and vomiting and running a high fever boggs began to look worried when the man cried that he was blind and raved in the fevers delirium bright the gunners mate was the next man to be struck down he stumbled to the deck in the middle of gun drill almost insensible next was one of the carpenters crew then a ships corporal after him it was an older topman and then the forecastle captain the acting quartermaster had meanwhile turned the color of a quince pudding and began to bring up black bile its the yellow jack boggs told them shakily there was no more horrifying name that could have been uttered in the tropics other than plague yellow jack was the scourge of the west indies and all those scrubby coasts of the spanish main and up into the floridas whole regiments could go down sick in a week and the survivors would not make a corporals guard the most complex objects of the age the huge and powerful st and nd rate lineofbattle ships could be turned to dead piles of timber and iron as their crews died by the boatload what can we do leonard asked plainly scared to death theres bad air aboard boggs told them some feverish vapor trapped below tropic land gives off sickening ethers at night asit cools youve seen the mists ventilate immediately we must pump our bilges flush em clean and scour with vinegar below decks they rigged wind scoops they pumped the sea below through the washdeck pumps until the chain pumps brought nothing from the bilges but bright seawater they scoured every surface with vinegar the acting quartermaster died gunners mate bright died two gunners came down with the fever moaning and shivering one of the little west indian ships boys went sick as did lord cantners manservant we must smoke the ship to drive the bad air out boggs prescribed and they took plug and leaf tobacco and burned it in tubs waving smouldering faggots of the stuff in every compartment and nook and cranny like shamans ministering to an aboriginal sufferer but the old topman the forecastle captain and the ships boy died and had to be interred to the mercy of the ocean and one could feel the jittery tension in the air like a palpable force by evening docken the warrant gunner had fallen ill as had five more hands and the cooks native assistant we must keep all the sick on deck in fiesh air in a patch of shade and give them all the water and small beer they can drink boggs said cut down the grog ration and stop issuing acid fruits that bring on biliousness thin soups and gruels instead of fresh or saltmeat the two gunners died lord cantners manservant died during the night six more hands began to stagger and sweat complaining of raging blinding headaches those already stricken turned shocking yellow and began to throw up a black bile vmito negro the spaniards called it yellow jack boggs and leonard made a project of inspecting the galley and rations on the chance the native cooks dirty habits might be to blame but could find nothing they could fault in cleanliness by dawn lady cantners maid dropped in a swoon and cried in terror as she realized she was afflicted everyone began to walk the decks cuttyeyed wary of being too close to another person and one could smell a miasma of sweaty fear amid the odors of the sickness they threw the island animals overboard on the suspicion that they might have carried the fever aboard along with their coops and pens and the manger was hosed out and scrubbed with vinegar or wine the wind veered dead foul forcing them to face a long board to the suthrd which would take them closer to the french island of martinique regretfully they had to tack and stand nor east as close to the wind as possible for anguilla the nearest british settlement boggs was by now halfdrunk most of the time in sheer panic at the thought of dying and his inability to do any good for anyone he made up bags of assafoetida for everyone to wear and the crew eagerly seized their bags of devil s dung like a talismens docken died the acting bosun died along with three more men two of the youngest victims seemed to recover though they were weak as kittens and all their hair had fallen out so there was some hope we are seven days from anguilla kenyon told them aft on the tiny poop by the taffrail lewrie we must have the starboard guns run out and the larboard guns hauled back to the centerline to ease her heel it will make her faster through the water aye aye sir mister claghorne we must drive this ship like jehu for the nearest port nevis or st kitts if anguilla will not serve it is our only hope that we reach a friendly port with medical facilities greater than our own kenyon seemed foursquare and dependable amid all the suppressed hysteria but lewrie could see the tension around his eyes the desperate glance as he realized just how powerless any man was in the face of the unknownyellow jack on the third day in late afternoon they spied a merchant ship they hoisted their colors and recognition signal when she was close enough to hail they discovered she was a packet brig the black friars bound for kingston have you a doctor on board kenyon yelled across the surging water that separated them yes have you no surgeon the master called back we have many sick aboard what is it the man asked warily we have fever kenyon had to admit i cannot help you the master said as black friars sped out of reach on an opposite course goddamn you kenyon shouted bring to or i will fire into you lewrie sprang to one of the after swivels and hastily loaded it he placed a pound ball right in her transom but black friars did not stop for them but began to loose t gallants for more speed lieutenant kenyon looked ready to weep as he watched a possible salvation tearing down to leeward but he could do nothing no one would turn a hand for them for fear of the yellow jack leonard went down sick boggs decocted a foultasting brew of quinine bark and forced the hands to drink it but no one had faith in his cures the maidservant died at sundown it made no sense kenyon mooney claghorne and lewrie and purnell discussed it aft avoiding boggs who by then could not raise a cup to his own lips much less offer help to the sick men had sickened who had not gone ashore into the tropical miasma they should have been safe men who had spent the night ashore did not get sick but members of the gigs crew who had only been to the boat landing in broad daylight had sickened and died all ate the same rations drank the same grog and black strap and small beer breathed the same air ashore on deck at anchor or below decks had it been the whores mooney wondered something you could get from native women yet hardly any of the west indians in the crew had gotten it and only one of them had died of it they were on the mend or immune somehow when questioned most admitted to having the vomito negro when they were very young and surviving the salt rations lewrie said wondering out loud sir we were ashore and we ate fresh food and drank clean drink we have not been stricken with it but the crew on salt rations and biscuit for the most part have then how do you explain the maid or the manservant kenyon asked he was much older and the womans constitution is not a mans sir lewrie said making rationalizations for his own funk i dont have to die he told himself grimly aware of the sour reek of fear on his body and in his clothes some of the hands are getting better the younger ones mostly its the old and the weak that are dying oh god why not in battle but not like this i swear to you ill offer you anything you want but dont let me die purnells breathing made him turn his head tad was all covered in sweat his neckcloth and shirt already soaked with it and his hands on the tabletop trembled like a freshkilled cock i am all right purnell rasped really i am oh god take mister purnell to the surgeon kenyon ordered around midnight leonard the captains clerk died when they held his burial at dawn after quarters one could hear the hands weeping and snuffling but it was not any affection for the departed acting purser it was pity for themselves in the face of the yellow jack lewrie was on deck in full uniform to enforce orders also armed with a pair of pistols and his dirk the crew was trembling on the edge of panic and if the officers lost control the men would run wild get to the rum and spirits and destroy any chance they might have had to work their way into a friendly port lord and lady canmer stood nearby holding their small bags of devils dung to their noses to allay the stench lewrie went to them this wind is holding milord six more days should see us fair into anguilla he said doffing his hat pray god it does lady cantner said you can still work the ship the lord asked working his sour little mouth as though eating a lime your captain does nothing to assure me and that mate is so inarticulate he seems halfwitted pagh i hate the smell of this perhaps one of miladys scented sachets would serve as well milord the assafoetida seems to have had little effect gladly lord cantner said throwing the foulsmelling bag over the side theres not much to choose between that stuff and the odors from the sick men up forward stap me what a foul stench it is id rather sniff a corpses arse you can take your pick of arseholes up forward lewrie thought your surgeon is a fool only a surgeons mate milord an apothecary mostly but i doubt if a surgeons skill at cutting would avail us no one will tell us anything and who the hell are you your name escapes me midshipman alan lewrie milord you look like you might know something how long you been wearing the kings coat one year milord gods teeth and lord cantner turned away in misery it is not his fault my dear lady cantner said is there anything i could do to help mister lewrie perhaps help tend to the sick or read to them delia lord cantner was shocked at her suggestion tending the sick was for the worst sort those already so degraded that the odors and sights of sick and injured people could have no further influence it was a job for abbatoir workers not titled ladies i doubt if anyone could appreciate a good book just now milady alan said gently sharing an astounded glance with lord cantner that his lady would even consider such a thing the loblolly men shall suffice for the hands though i wonder yes the other midshipman mister purnell was taken ill last night and he is your friend she said full of pity aye milady he is the thought of tad lying helpless and puking scared him silly and tad purnell lying sick could have been him so easily still might be i shall go to him at once lady cantner said if you would approve my dear a gentleman is he aye milord of a good trading family from bristol i suppose lord cantner relented sourly mister lewrie claghome called from farther forward excuse me milord milady claghome stood by the quartermaster at the tiller head his hands behind his back and his feet planted firmly on the tilting deck and glooming bleak as poverty mister lewrie the captains took sick as hell he said in a low mutter ill be dependin on you an mister mooney ta see us through oh christ lewrie said turning cold allover with another shock to his already shattered nerves has boggs seen to him boggs stands more chance dyin barrelfever than yeller jack drunk as an emperor down below keep that quiet we dont want the people gettin scared theyre not already sir alan shivered aye true enough claghome said knew i could count on ya to buck up an stay solid must be the only person not scared out a yer boots by this you misjudge me badly mister claghome then keep it up cause so everyone else misjudges ya too may i suggest sir that you inform lord cantner of lieutenant kenyon and his distress i cant talk his breakteeth kinda words claghome said you do it ive a ship ta run and he can go hang before i let him shit on me again stuck up squintyeyed little hopo mythumb fool aye sir but he is very influential a word from him in the right place and the officer who brought him safe into harbor could gain a commission overnight im a scaly old fish lewrie not one yer bowin an arsekissin buggers id be a tarpaulin mate forever before id piss down his back nor anyone elses ferfavor lewrie shrugged knowing that claghome was out of his element in the face of a peer and was throwing away a sterling opportunity to gain influence because he lacked the wit and took such a perverse pride in being a tarry selfmade man of his hands beholden to no one i must be healthy lewrie assured himself wryly i can still toady with the best right in the middle of shrieking hysteria the wind held steady for hours as they drove nor east they were still five days from harbor if the wind held thankfully no one else had gone down ill in the last few hours perhaps something they had done had worked against the fever for all the fear and grief it had so far been a remarkably fast passage to windward god give us just a little luck alan felt weights slough from his shoulders each time they cast the log he could get ashore away from whatever was causing the yellow jack tad could get a doctor and he would get credit for standing as an acting officer sail ho the lookout cried from the mainmast gaff throat four points off the weather bow aloft with you mister lewrie an spy her out claghome ordered alan seized a glass and scrambled up into the rigging to hug the mainmast alongside the lookout brig alan said studying the sail through the telescope aye zur said the lookout an a frenchy i thinks zur french why lewrie asked afraid he was right jus looks french ta me zur cant rightly say keep us informed alan said heading down to report to claghome a brig sir coming north with a soldiers wind the lookout thinks shes french goddarnn what would a frog brig be doing so close to anguilla or nevis looking for morsels such as us mister claghome lewrie offered drawing a withering glare from the masters mate an goddamn you too sir claghome shouted aye aye sir alan shied backing away an hour passed by then the strange sail was hulldown over the horizon both ships doomed to intersect at a point off to the east with no way to avoid meeting parrot was going as fast as possible but could not get to windward neither in their pitiful condition could they run they had already been seen and any course of evasion would only take them that much farther away from safety and help for their sick after getting so tantalizingly near and neither reduced in manpower could they fight well if the brig was indeed french goddamn me shes french all right claghome said after returning from the lookout perch himself privateer outa martinique mostlike maybe not heavygunned but loaded with men for prize crews so theyll try to board us sir lewrie said wondering if their luck could possibly get any worse they might not if they see we have yeller jack aboard them popish breastbeaters is superstitious as hell we hoist the quarantine flag let em see our sick an they might let us go fer safer pickins and if they dont claghome did not answer him but walked away to the windward rail and began to pace as close as they were to death from yellow jack it was preferable to being taken a prize and led off to some prison hulk or dungeon on martinique with kenyon down sick the burden of running fighting or striking their colors devolved on him as if he didnt already have enough to worry about mister lewrie lady cantner called from the hatch to the wardroom i think you should come tad was slung in a hammock below the skylight where there was a chance for some breeze below decks and lewrie thought he looked as dead as anyone could that still breathed he was yellow the skin stretched taut over his skull while his eyes were sunk deep in currantcolored circles of exhaustion tad how do you keep alan asked softly god alan i am so sick when im gone do write my parents and say i fell in action will you do that youll be fine you silly hobbledehoy but tads hand was dry as sunbaked timber and hot as a gun barrel and leaning close to him alan could smell the corruption of the blood in the bile purnell had been bringing up i can taste it tad was saying i can tastedeathaian im going to die nonsense alan said realizing he was probably right thanks for that night tad managed so softly that alan had to lean ever closer and it was like bending down over a hot oven it was wonderful not so hard after all just like riding a cockhorse alan said trying to plaster a smile on his face tad tried to smile back but began coughing and retching and choking fighting for breath alan tried to lift him but he was drowning in his own vomit tad gripped his hand with all his strength going rigid eyes wide open after a final gasping try for a breath he went limp eyes blank and staring at lewrie goddarnn it alan cursed tears burning his eyes just goddarnn sweet fuck all lady cantner came to him and held out her arms tears on her face and he sank into her arms gladly darnme he was such a decent little chub oh goddamn this he was your friend she said stroking his hair but his sorrow and pain are ended god harvests the flowers early and leaves weeds such as us to suffer and try to understand thats a hellish sort of comfort he thought miserably half a dozen worse people could have died except him god what a terrible thing this is tad half the crew sick or dead lieutenant kenyon like to be on his own deathbed maybe a french privateer ready to take us what next for christs sake god im so scared there there lady cantner continued to comfort god stap me but she has a great set of poonts alan thought inanely appreciating the tender and yielding surfaces against which his face was now pressed as she gentled him you must have faith mister lewrie lord cantner said from the door to the aft cabin just a second before alan decided that dying would not be so bad if he could grab hold of lady cantners bouncers for a second im sure the other officers shall see us through aye milord alan replied stepping back and wiping his eyes lady cantner offered a handkerchief and lewrie applied it to his face it was mrs hillwoods still redolent of lovemaking alan found it hard to keep a straight face or stifle an urge to begin howling with laughter he finally managed to say almost strangling we shall do what we can me and mister claghorne right now we are the officers milord lord cantners look of annoyance at finding a snivelling midshipman on his wifes tits changed to a stricken rictus at that news was it his mothers lady cantner asked of the handkerchief er not exactly milady lewrie said pulling himself together he had to escape them before he burst out in manic laughter and they ended up clapping him in irons i thank you for your comfort when i had given way to despair milady i have to go on deck now mister claghome will be needing me excuse me fine bastards gullion you are he scathed himself your best friend just died all hell riding down on us scared so bad i wouldnt trust mine arse with a fart and youre ready to laugh like a deranged loon and feel up the blanket of our livelumber he took a glass from the binnacle rack and crossed to join claghorne who stood by the windward rail and gripped the narrow bulwark as he stared at their approaching stranger with a forlomexpression about three miles off now claghorne sighed heavily shell be up ta us an alongside in an hour holdin the wind gaugedammit french sir lewrie asked hoping against hope yes god rot em claghome said see the length of the yards cut shortern ours no guts fer a stiff wind blackpainted masts an the way they cut their jibs different from ours then what shall we do mister claghome might still fox em show em a body tell em we have fever aooard they dont want that was it young purnell he just died sir lewrie said getting ready to dive back down into a real session of the blue devils damn hard luck watch yer luff by god the wind had backed a full point to the eastsou east and had fallen in its intensity to stay on the wind for maximum speed they would have to steer more easterly which was now a perfect course for antigua their original destination i do believe that god has a shitten sense of humor claghome said trying manfully to keep from raging and tearing his hair at his misfortune sir if we have to fight mister lewrie shut yer trap claghome said and stepped away from him to begin pacing the deck again as parrot seemed to slow and ride a little heavier on the sea lewrie eyed the french brig again now hullup and aiming for that point of intersection of their courses there had to be something they could do besides beat up to the brig and surrender he thought if claghome could convince them that parrot had fever aboard they just might be shocked enough for parrot to surprise them lewrie began to inventory what they had below in the magazines that might serve goddamn you you poltroon lord cantner was shouting from aft at claghome there must be some idea in your head the wind is dying milord claghome said close to giving in to despair he has a longer hull an with this wind i cannot outrun him he has more guns an most likely ninepounders that can shoot clean through our hull if they board us theyll not leave a manjack alive an what theyd do ta yer good lady i shudder ta think about well i shudder to think about what happens to the indies if i am captured by those frogeating sonsabitches lord cantner raved i can give you a weighted bag ta drop yer secret stuff overboard milord but i cant guarantee yer freedom an hour from now if i could suggest something mister claghome lewrie said after clearing his throat for attention lady cantner had been attracted to the deck at the sound of the argument and stood by waiting to hear what would happen to her i command this ship now mister lewrie claghome said and ill thank you ta remember yer place no lets hear him out lord cantner said clutching at even the feeblest of straws they want to come closeaboard and demand surrender let them put them off their guard with the quarantine flag and the sight of our sick and dead then give them a broadside of doubleshot and grape with starshot and langridge and fire arrows to take their rigging down and set fires aloft theyll be so busy at saving their own ship we may have a chance to escape and make it a stem chase we shall be going toward our own bases after dark would they pursue that far could we lose them after sundown one sign resistance an theyll shoot us t pieces claghorne said wearily then youll be responsible fer milords and miladys deaths then what would you do lord cantner demanded and both of the cantners and alan realized that claghome had no plan he was riding the back of the tiger with no idea how to get off or how to even change the course of events perhaps he could have responded to a lesser set of circumstances like a dismasting a hull leak fighting parrot through a hunicane even storming another ships bulwarks with sword in hand if ordered by someone else but this on top of the fever and all the deaths and losing kenyons sure hand to guide him was too much for him to handle and he would be damned if he was going to admit it even if it meant losing parrot striking the colors what little pride he had left would probably force him to consider striking the best possible decision he could have made until the end of his life may i call the hands to quarters mister claghome you wish ta make yer gesture mister lewrie then go ahead claghome said thinking it a small point with no real purpose but youll not fire a shot unless i directly tell you to hear me ayeaye sir claghome turned away and lord cantner restrained lewrie with a hand on his arm lets pray it works mister lewrie i cannot abide the idea of striking to a pack of frogs without at least trying it may cost us our lives milord lewrie told him but at least we shall retain some of our honor if i may suggest gathering your papers in a weighted bag just in case and in placing your good lady below decks once free lewrie went to his men amidships shes french boys and were going to sink her or burn her he said trying to look confident we shall fetch up all the spare swivels and charges ill want some men to go below to the magazine and break out the canister and starshot and gun cartridges lay out boarding pikes and cutlasses out of sight by the bulwarks mister kelly aye the bosuns mate said wary of lewries intentions hands to quarters handsomely so the frogs wont notice load with reduced charges for doubleshot starshot canister and langridge as well well give them a surprise a big one handsomely kelly grimly nodded aye aye the french brig ran up her colors and there was a groan from several hands at the sight of the pure white banner with the gold fteur de lis of bourbon france well show em who theyre dealin with claghorne said run up the colors and their own red ensign soared up the leach of their mainsl to the peak of the gaff yard which brought a thready cheer from a few diehards on deck swivels in every socket lewrie ordered numberone gun load with double starshot quoin out and aim for the rigging and give those french bastards some of their own medicine numbertwo doubleshot and canister quoin halfin and aim for their gangway got it he went from gun to gun giving them their load and aiming point sent a hand to fetch up the case of fire arrows from the magazine and had them loaded in the swivels swivel men aim for the sails and rigging get it set fire to the bastards and give them something to gripe on stead oftaking us once we open fire youve got to load and fire fast as you can without orders its that or die in chains got it darnme crouch quit mooning what did i say crouch was the slowest hulk he had hairy and beetlebrowed and incapable of concentrating on anything for long ah aims fer is sails an keeps at it til e burns ta hell sir good enough now this is most important we shall be standing by the windward rail but not crouched down by the guns nobody lays a hand on a swivel until j say keep your matches out of sight they think were going to be easy keep your small anns out of sight too dont let the gun ports swing open or were dead before we get a chance to hurt them they think theyre going to take us without a fight and throw us into their hulks on martinique so you think on it and look gloomy for christs sake considering the victim was french the men fell into their roles well enough indeed lewrie had to threaten flogging for overacting to keep a couple of them from wailing and wringing their hands a little too histrionically the brig was up within seven or eight cables by then turning to open her broadside to point at parrot there was a sharp bang and the sound of iron moaning through the air a ball struck short ahead of them raising a pillar of water ninepounders lewrie said out loud he stepped aft to see claghome theyll stand off an shoot right through us with ninepound shot he said we havent a chance how close do you think theyll come to demand our surrender lewrie asked gauging the distance between them to be six cables and closing slowly he saw the brig let fly her topsls so they would not pass ahead of parrot adjusting their closing rate so that they would end up rounded into the wind parallel to them about a cable mostlike claghome sighed maybe closer it would be best if we had them at pistolshot sir lewrie said knowing that claghorne had ceded him the initiative as sure as that panicstricken gunners mate had done in ariadne no no theyd blow us apart at that range if they fired ill not have it mister lewrie youll obey my orders an not do anythin rash you hear me sir another bang from the privateer this time the ball droned over the deck low enough to part peoples hair all the enemys gun ports were open and a line of ten guns was visible the brigs crew crowded the bulwarks and gangway seemingly hundreds of them that provided the crews to man enough prizes to send them back to their island lair rich men enough to overpower a frigate did they get lucky three cables off now a third gun fired from the brig and this ball struck parrot thudding into the wale of the hull below the gun ports damme the games blocked at both ends claghome said collapsing against the railing i am goin ta strike mister lewrie i order you to stand yer gun crews down we cant just surrendel sir alan pleaded damn you get forward mister mooney i want you ta strike the colors mister claghome the husky bosun objected shocked to his bones i said strike the colors aye sir but ill tell ya this mister claghome sir yer a shiverin coward sir im a realist damn yer eyes lewrie went back forward to his gun crews boys were going to strike thatll get the frog in closer so we can hit him dont anybody be alarmed how much worse can it be he thought wearily his eyes aching from his earlier jerking tears and the glare of the sea a band of pain circled his head from staring so intently across the water and the tension if were prisoners nobodys going to hang me for disobeying orders the french may shoot me but theres still the yellow jack to consider first if we fail i can die right here on my own deck in my own way and go hard and game and to hell with father all of em the red ensign sank to the deck and was gathered up in a limp bundle which brought cheers from the privateer brig claghome ordered the fore course lowered and the jibs backed so that parrot cocked up into the wind and fetched to the brig began taking in sail and sidled down alongside no longer making headway as they let fly but being brought down to parrot to her lee by the dying wind do you strike a leatherlunged voice called to them aye claghome shouted back we have fever aboard the yellow quarantine flag was hoisted and the french laughed their gun ports were still open and lewrie could see men standing by them with burning slowmatch but the majority of the much less disciplined privateer crew was standing in the rigging or on the bulwarks with muskets or swords jeering happily at a foe that would strike without even a shot tired for honors sake claghome hoisted a dead man up onto the rail a man yellow as a custard the stains of his bloocjy dark bile still streaking his bare chest we have yeller jack comprende vomito negro the brig was close now a musketshot away less than fifty yards lewrie could see the men crossing themselves gesticulating in their lingo eager to be away from the fever and the pest ship that carned it their officers aft were standing in a knot arguing and waving their arms in broad gestures hands were going aloft to lower yard and staytackles or clew jiggers for boat tackles to hoist out a launch so they could stand off and investigate the privateers did not want to give up a prize so easily gotten but neither did they want any fever in their own crew stand ready lads lewrie told the uneasy hands easy now get ready for it dont blow the gaff on me now the brig was now twentyfive yards off a very long pistol shot and men were laying down their weapons to bear a hand on the boat tackles while others were lifting out long sweeps to fend parrot off from the hull so they would not become infected now alan ordered fire as you bear damn you lewrie claghorne bowled as though stabbed in his guts our word of honor we struck the rest of his ranting was lost in the din as the gun ports were flung open and the guns were run out the last few feet the swivels were already banging away fire arrows sizzled into life and flew in short arcs for the brigs yards and sails the first fourpounder fired flinging a double load of starshot at the brigs masts bringing down braces sheets and blocks shattering her fortopsl yard the packed mass of jeering boarders the teams of men ready to walk away with the staytackles or snub the yard tackles the men aloft taking in sail and the men in the rigging for a better view they were all seemingly scythed away as the fourpounders spewed their wicked loads oflangridge and canister rough bags of scrap iron bits nails broken plates and ironmongery or light tin cases that contained hundreds of small musketcaliber balls kill them lewrie raved kill them now the swivels were barking again even crouch was loading ramming and aiming as rapidly and accurately as he could fire arrows darted out flaming dots trailing greasy black smoke they jammed pointfirst into masts bulwarks and the hoisted boat the springloaded bars snapped open as they struck sails jamming into them so their flames could feed hungrily we gave our word of honor claghome ranted from aft but no one paid him much attention in their fighting frenzy after days of terror of the invisible their fear came out in an orgy of hatred and destruction against a real foe they could fight maybe even conquer larboard men foresl halyard mooney cried like a bull off headsl sheets n run em ta larboard smartly now laddies sails made of flax tanned and dried by tropic sun shivered and thrashed until powdery with broken fiber particles masts and spars brushed with linseed oil to keep out rot tarred standing rigging holding the masts erect running rigging coated with slush beef and pork fat and rancid butter the skimming of the galley boiling pots that the cook didnt sell to the hands on the sly so that the lines stayed supple and didnt swell in the rain and would run true through all the blocks aloft that controlled the jears halyards lifts clew lines buntlines braces jiggers and tackles and ships are made of wood painted tarred oiled woodbaked as tinder dry as galley pine shavingsgiven a chance all of it would bum now the french crew saw the small points of fire aloft that quickly were fanned into large fires her sails flashed into sheets of flame that flagged in the wind lighting the rigging carrying flame to her spars and her topmasts the lower masts began to work and groan sheet home claghome cried as he saw what was happening the fire could blow down on parrot if she did not get away quickly helm up you farmer mainsl haul now belay on headsl sheets now belay on the foresheet thus he ordered indicating a course parrot began to move creeping away to the east from the burning french privateer brig whose masts were now well alight as parrot got a way on her the brig suffered a shower of flaming debris raining down on her decks her foretopmast came down like a blazing log they continued to fire at the french ship until their gun would no longer bear they passed her bows out of danger of burning or of being fired upon except with bow chasers gaining speed and headway the brig had an inner forestaysl still standing that pulled her head downwind to the north and turning her broadside to the wind so the fire could rage her fulllength unchecked thick coils of dark smoke plumed from her up forward where her foremast had collapsed on the deck her boattier was also well ablaze shooting flames as high as her main course yard now bare of canvas there were some dull explosions lost in the rush and roar of flames as guns cooked off from the heat or scattered powder bags burst like grenades on her decks cease fire cease fire lewrie shouted to his jubilant men having to knock gun tools from their hands crouch leave off drop it dead un crouch he shouted using the terms of the rat pit aye sir crouch breathed his dumb face flowing with pleasure but jus looka the fuckers bum sir god almighty he was leaping up and down in thickwitted victory ya done em proper sir someone shouted to him as he made his way aft through them telling them to secure from quarters they were cheering themselves slapping each other on the back in glory at what they had done claghorne was waiting for him on the quarterdeck face red and sword drawn damn yer black soul ta the hottest fires a hell lewrie you disobeyed me you motherless bastard you fired after we had struck like a lowdown lying barbary pirate ill see you face a court for it i swear ill see you hang alan had not considered their chances of success so great as to have reckoned fully on the consequences of victory the reality of claghornes threat hit him like a bucket of cold water they had won hadnt they he realized that he had disobeyed a direct order even if it was wrong had violated a major article of gentlemanly conduct at sea but werent they free what claghorne was really mad about was that he had been shamed before the men and that was what could get lewrie scragged dammit mister claghorne were alive and free and theyll not be telling anybody about it alan said ill know you little bastard ive a mind ta strike you down right now fer what you did you shall do no such thing lord canmer said coming on deck with his wife god stap me just look at that delia you look on it mister claghorne its salvation and victory honor be damned he was transfixed by the burning brig and a hush fell over the deck as the men turned to see the end silencing claghorne as he too turned to stare it was a terrifying and heartbreaking sight for sailors to see a ship burn even an enemy the brig had been especially pretty long and lean and fast golden oak hull with a jaunty red stripe black wale and bold figurehead picked out with gold leaf on her rails and entry port and transom carvings now she was a smutty lampbowl of a hull that served as the vessel of a raging conflagration men could be seen tossing over kegs and hammocks coops and hatch gratings anything that would float their boats had burned crewmen were splashing into the sea and calling out as the heat became unbearable and a hot glow could be seen through her open gun ports over the loud whooshing roar of the fire they could hear thin screams as men were roasted to death or pleaded for mercy on their souls as they hung on for just a moment more of life before going into the seafew sailors of any nation could really swim and parrot could not approach that raging furnace to save them without risking her own safety the fight drained out of lewrie sucked dry now by all the terror and the tension and claghomes heartstopping prediction of a courtmartial he had been wild with passion leaping and screaming obscenities at the french raving with all his strength in a berserk release his headache was back with a vengeance after all the waiting and hoping that the french would come close enough to be hurt staring hard over the glittering ocean and hurting his eyes trying to see everything at once his limbs seemed to have turned to water just like after that fight in ariadne he reminded himself so tired he could barely stay erect is it always going to be like this well done my boy lord cantner said his voice cracking with emotion as he pumped lewries hand goddamn wonderful job thank you milord thank you god bless you mister lewrie lady cantner added looking at him with open adoration that roving look back in her dark eyes her chest heaved magnificently once they were ashore on anguilla and her lord asleep some night before they sailed her eyes told him it could be arranged but at the moment it didnt seem to matter much to him he also knew or felt or hoped that lord cantners influence would stop any courtmartial after all he was alive and still free to sail for england the less said about claghomes lack of wit at finding a way to avoid or defeat the privateer the better a court martial would be as much a condemnation of his striking the colors as alans disobedience and striking before doing your utmost to fight was also a hanging offense had he not learned even in his short career in the navy that victory had a hundred parents but failure none a rich and influential peer could have things done his own way as they usually ended up doing if claghome was possessed of any wit at all he would write his report taking credit for the idea excusing the breach of honor as necessary to save the lord and his lady and all the secrets in his head giving lewrie grudging allowance for being a brave little fellow who followed orders well mister lewrie lord cantner asked in a faraway whisper alan could not hear him through the ringing in his ears too much noise of the guns he thought but he seemed so far away and it was hard to focus on the lords phiz it also seemed to be getting dark awfully early he realized he was seated on the deck shivering allover why are they looking at me like that he wondered havent the bastards ever seen a hero but there was no answer chapter there were many strange and awful dreams that bothered him as he swam in the delirium of a raging fever he and mrs hillwood romped in the maintop while marines threw buckets of seawater on them by the numbers and captain osmonde called the pace with a fuglemans cane tad toasted cheese on burning sails for him and asked if he wanted his shoes blacked keith ashburn and shirke bought him a halfdozen bottles of claret but he couldnt drink with them for their heads were skulls with dacking jaws and the wine ran down their chests like black ink lieutenant harm and mr pilchard and margaret haymer danced together comparing wounds his sister belinda was a figurehead on a ship ofthe line and the sailors fondled her bare breasts as they sat on the beakhead rails to relieve themselves chapman hopped onelegged down the strand with a beautiful young girl in a blue gown in search of a booksellers and he could not catch them no matter how hard he ran sir hugo and sir richard slade chased him down an endless work gangway waving their pricks at him he found himself flying low across sparkling wavetops with a crowd of pelicans who knew how to do spherical trigonometry in their heads and he jeered with them at the seagulls who had to use slates captain bales was served at dinner by a nude lady cantner with an apple in her mouth alan was made post but his ship was a hundred fathoms down off nevis and the wind kept shifting all about the compass kenyon and some admiral stood together in full uniform but no breeches and told him what a brute he wa to harm the french who were only two inches tall and crawled allover him he was in a cart on his way to tyburn to be hanged and with his jeering friends telling him to die game there was an elfin face framed in honey gold ringlets staring up at him and telling him to keep his wig on straight while a fiddler did a bad rendition of portsmouth lass and claghorne and seaman crouch shoved on the capstan bars and some very ugly old woman sold poking sticks to the gentry who wished to have at him he dreamed he had yellow jack and had turned the color of a quarantine flag all his hair falling out in his eyes and a beautiful young girl tenderly bathed his face softly saying you sonofabitching bastard over and over and he had an erection because her eyes were the color of the ocean in a shallow island harbor and cassius rang a tiny silver bell so everyone could come and marvel then there was a dream of a cool room dim and quiet and still with some kind of bars slanting one wall and that one lasted for a while the walls looked like plaster instead of the lathed partitions of a ship and there might have been pictures on the walls but they were hard to make out because there seemed to be some kind of fog about him im in a house he told himself dreamily after pondering it a long time im in bed in a house so what happens after that slow sort of dream compared to the others he could not move but he could blink and shift his vision to discover what seemed to be two sets of louvered doors on one wall at the foot of the bed he occupied the light from outside was what was making the bar patterns on the wall they are not prison bars he decided shifting his eyes to a closer vantage of his body he could see his arms on the sheets so boggs had not cut anything off he tried to raise his arm but it would not move and he sighed as he realized he had little control over this dream he tried to shift a leg and felt cool linen pressing down lightly allover him i am in bed in a house nude and lwt in jail lots of possibilities to this hmm it was such a pleasant prospect that he dreamed he went right back to sleep to mull things over when he dreamed that he awoke it was much lighter then he saw that the fog about him was an insect net of very fine gauze around his bed that the louvered doors led to some sort of veranda or patio this time he could move a hand and reach down to feel his groin yep still got my wedding tackle nice room nice furnishings too good for a debtors prison and its too quiet for a hospital it was cool and a hint of breeze came through those louvered doors bringing the sound of surging waves on a beach and he didnt think it was brighton there was a decided saltandiodine tang to that breeze and it was so bright beyond the louvers that he thought he might be somewhere in the tropics maybe the west indies his mouth fell open and a foetid odor rushed out he tried to make words but all that came out was gracck but he thought with ajoy that was almost sexual my god im alive he looked at his hands and his arms against the cool white linen sheet and saw that he was a lot more yellow than he remembered i survived yellow jack he crowed silently almost weeping in happiness im as yellow as a quince but im alive he listened to his heart beat took deep breaths and rejoiced to the sound of air rushing in and out the taste in his mouth was positively vile but be thought it nice to be able to taste anything there was a sound to his right a door was being opened a swish of clothing could be heard he caught a flash of white cloth and thought it might be some sort of mopsqueezer but he saw that elfin face that was so incredibly young and lovely those bright blue eyes and the honey gold hair set in ringlets and he was afraid that he had seen her somewhere before being hanged or something if she were here was he really alive was she some tantalizing angel or devil did he have his wig on straight she crossed to the double doors and threw the first set open a flood of painfully brilliant sunlight exploded into the room the second set opened and he blinked in pain until he could make out a bar of cerulean blue framed by intensely green bushes bright green grass and the hint of dunegrass and sandy soil beyond the green was that a ship out there a threemasted indiaman the girl took a moment to stand in the second door arms still holding the doors apart like a figure on a crucifix in some romish church once his eyes had adjusted and been blinked clean of tears he could surmise that it was early morning for there was a hint of sun just at the top of the door and the girl was silhouetted against the bright light she must have been wearing a morning gown instead of a more formal sackgown and without stays or corset because he could see how slim her back was through the fabric how tiny her waist how slim her hips almost like a boys but for the gentle continuation to the curve of her behind with the doors open the breeze hit him with a gentle rush and it was cool and clean heavy with tropical flowers the astringent tang of deep ocean that came to him as lustily as the steam from a smoking joint of meat he could hear birds singing birds he did not recognize the girl still stood against the light and he could see that her shoulders were not too broad she had long legs slim thighs that left a gap between them at her cleft shapely calves and trim ankles she turned and did something in the shadows on tiptoe and he could see how full and high her young breasts were above a flat belly how snug and trim her buttocks were then she stepped out of the light into the shadows and a bird was singing quite loudly there was another rustle of cloth in the room and he shifted his eyes to that direction he saw an incredibly ugly woman in a mobcap and morning gown she bore something with her where had he seen her before selling something at tyburn or bedlam she brought something forward long thin made of wood and poking stick im dead hanggankk he said eyes wide in fright and the woman gave out a harpys shriek and disappeared in a twinkling mister lewrie the woman said reappearing with a glass of something in her hand you spoke lucy he spoke i heard him yes thank god oh thank god a young voice cried agghk he went on his heart pounding hard enough to shake the bed the womans shriek and the sight of that broom handle he had thought was a poking stick had nearly frightened him out of what few wits he still possessed and he had not made much inventory yet as to that hands were there to lift him up in bed and pile pillows behind him until he was almost sitting up a black maid appeared to help out a glass was thrust under his nose and he opened his sticky lips to accept whatever was offered it was water not stale ships water but fresh and sparkling clear water and he gulped it down greedily hoping to sluice away the vile taste in his mouth he wasnt much for water if one could get beer or ale or wine but at the moment he thought the water a marvelous discovery thank you thank you he rasped licking his dry lips we feared the fever had curdled your brains mister lewrie thought i was dead dreaming where antigua the soft young voice said and he looked into that elfin face at those high cheekbones that narrow chin and high forehead and still felt like he was dreaming you are on the atlantic side mister lewrie the old woman told him we brought you here when the surgeons had despaired of your recovery in hospital in english harbor after the brave thing you did it was the least we could do for you god bless you maam he breathed in her direction here did she say id done something brave that sounds promising this is the shore residence of admiral sir onsley matthews i am lady maude and this is the admirals niece miss lucy beauman from jamaica god bless he said gazing at the girl she was there lucy lady maude snorted where tyburn the strand i saw her i think i did just dreams mister lewrie lady maude said fevers do that to you followed her he insisted weakly couldnt catch up auntie hes still so weak the girl whispered concerned aye and will be for some time longer mister lewrie could you take a portion of a nourishing broth he nodded slowly andromeda go tell cook to prepare a thin meat broth and be quick about it lady maude told the mopsqueezer and put some red wine in it for stoutness yassum parrot lewrie asked wondering what he had done that was so brave and wonderful and concerned about his ship is she safe indeed she is mister lewrie lady maude beamed down at him lord and lady cantner have sailed to tortola to meet the winter convoy and parrot still swims proudly and you can be proud of doing such a brave duty for the crown young man very resourceful indeed the privateer brig lewrie said as the memory of what he had done came back in a rush and a dread too as sir onsley said burnt to the waterline and frogs legs in a flambe lady maude tittered serve em right lewrie muttered ready to fall asleep once more still thirsty mister lewrie lucy asked yes he replied realizing that he was lucy fetch a bottle of brandy from the wine cabinet lady maude instructed a pinch of that in his water will put color in his cheeks any color but quince he said with a happy sigh and they began to laugh heartily a giddy sound of relief and lewrie drifted off to the sound of it when he was adjudged strong enough to hear the news rear admiral sir onsley matthews stopped by to visit him lewrie had been sitting up in bed bemoaning the loss of his hair and eyebrows to the fever when the man entered sir onsley was corpulent big allover balding and looking strangled in his neckcloth sir onsley he nodded in lieu of a bow you look like deaths head on amopstick but i hear youre going to recover lad sir onsley began sitting down on the edge of the table by the bed which fortunately was square and heavy enough to support his body better damn close thing you and the yellow jack not many survive but if you do you stand a good chance of being acclimated to it and wont come down with it again sir onsley crossed his arms on his chest have some news for you aye sir your captain recovered as well and about a third of your sick i am gratified to hear that sir onsley lewrie said automatically but thinking that he wasnt so sure after discovering that lieutenant kenyon preferred the windward passage parrot is under another officer and has departed for nassau we needed her badly had to appoint two new midshipmen to her so im afraid youre without a berth for a while oh lewrie said feeling a sadness that he would not have expected six months before at such news what would become of him what sort of berth would he get once he recovered fit to stand duties would he have to go back to the sullen abuse of the regular fleet once more i understand sir onsley i understand too lad the admiral said clearing his throat happened to me once my first time in the indies for the same reason now look here youre not to wony about anything but getting well for now you shall be my wife and lucys project until youre well enough to get around and ill find something for you to do you are too kind to me sir onsley until then you have the hospitality of my house i am most grateful to you sir onsley but i am probably well enough to go back to hospital to recover lewrie offered hoping that it was pro jonna for him to say that and be denied he liked it there and the girl was gorgeous nonsense healthier over here on the windward side anyway if a ship could tack out of what passes for a harbor here id move the entire dockyard thats your chest over there by the way and i have some of your things paycertificates and such therere some letters for you when you feel up to reading them and a present or two presents lewrie perked up finding it hard to believe andromeda sir onsley bellowed in his best quarterdeck voice fetch those packages for mister lewrie the girl entered the room with them and placed them on the bed there was a small ivory box the sort used in gambling houses like whites or the cocoa tree to hold guineas in set amounts lewrie opened it and beheld a double row of glittering guineas he dug one out and discovered that it was real a hundred guineas at the very least thats from lord and lady cantner reward for your bravery and your nacky ruse to sink or cripple that privateer mind you not my idea of a truly honorable ruse de guerre but to save the life of a high government official and his lady it was the only thing you could do to fight a stronger ship and get away with a whole skin sir onsley told him if there are no frogs to complain about it then ill not old co itstooth puts a high price on his skin it seems aye sir indeed lewrie said unable to feature it there was a second small package from lady cantner it was a gold locket that when opened sported a miniature of her countenance on one side and under a wafer of glass on the other a lock of her dark hair lewrie snapped it shut and met the admirals raised eyebrows lord cantner asked me to review the report your mate claghorne wrote on the action to see that you got proper credit at whitehall the admiral went on and i submitted my own as well your family will be proud to read about you in the london papers wont do your career any harm either to be an eightday wonder though if the lord north government is turned out cantner will no longer be much help to you this is heady stuff all the same sir onsley lewrie said with a shyness he did not exactly feel i am quite overcome this is from your lieutenant kenyon sir onsley said handing him a clothwrapped bundle lewrie unfolded it to reveal a sword a hunting sword or hanger it was bright steel chased minimally with nautical detailing on the blade slightly curved flat on top but razorsharp from narrow tip to within an inch of the hilt and the hilt was a double seashell pattern with a tapering handguard that ran back to a lionshead pommel all gleaming silver the grip was silver wire wound over blue sharkskin for a finn dry grip the scabbard was a dark blue leather with a silver drag and upper fitting and the belt hook was a smaller replica of the seashells of the hilt not only was it utterly lovely but it was a gills reputed to be the strongest blades in all of europe harder to break than a bilboa or toledo or solingen blade even when struck with great force on the flat of the blade it was a handsome gift nearly a hundred guineas in its own right and he actually felt guilty to feel such animosity toward lieutenant kenyon for being a miserable molly after he had given him such a magnificent present god its beautiful he believes that you earned it saving his ship for him even if he lost her due to his illness sir onsley said rising to pace the room he glared at the chirping bird in the cage by the louvered doors a black and brightly banded local bird called a bananaquitthat doted on jams and fruit damn silly creature you can let dogs in but never birds trouble has a way of following you about like one of those hounds of hades or something know that mister lewrie aye sir onsley alan said scarcely able to tear his eyes from the beautiful bright sword first ariadne now parrot and you have the devils own luck not only to survive but come out covered in credit i dont know what to say sir onsley he said with a shrug of nonunderstanding was he being criticized resourceful sir ousley mused aloud courageous crafty not much of a tarpaulin man yet but thatll come thatll come lewrie studied him intently waiting for the bad shoe to drop im off for supper and bed you rest up and recover and well see what comes open after that delighted to have met you at last my boy and i you sir onsley trying to bow from a sitting position as the admiral stomped from the room damn am i famous for what i did he asked himself after the admiral had left the room one thing is for certain im rich a pair of ponies for saving lord canmer and its gold not certificates if hes that grateful maybe i should make a career out of saving lords and id be rolling in chink he stood the sword and its scabbard by the bed and opened his mail there was a letter from lord canmer full of fulsome praises and charming compliments expressing his gratitude for his life and freedom and a promise to keep an eye on his career once he was back in london alan vowed to write him as soon as he was able to keep in touch with someone who could turn out to be a benefactor knowing that the navy admired nautical skills but the officer who succeeded was often the recipient of exactly such favor and unofficial maneuverings at whitehall if the first letter had pleased him the second had him ready to tear at his hair had he any remaining it was from kenyon while he had given him the sword it was in the nature of a parting gift and they could not consider themselves as associates in future kenyon was shocked and saddened that alan had disobeyed claghome even more outraged that he would have violated the timehonored usage of striking the colors as a subterfuge against an honorable foe even a ship full of privateers scum or not they were blessed with a letter of marque giving them quasi status as a naval vessel kenyon went on to inform him that claghome had been promoted to lieutenant and given parrot not as a due reward for his skills and knowledge but more as a peace offering to keep him quiet kenyon and claghome were deeply saddened that a man who should have found joy in an earned promotion found only shame due to the reprehensible behavior of someone theyd once thought full of promise oh soholy bastard lewrie muttered angrily crumpling up the letter raving on about honor when hed bare his own backside to any of his kind whod ride him gifting me with a swordwhat does he think i should do fallon it like a roman senator be prepared for when your lack of honor is called to question so youll have something to duel with as you cannot escape that fate if you continue as you are he quoted to himself from the letter well the admiral didnt think what i did was evil or reprehensible sneaky perhaps but he didnt want to hang me for it deep down under all his manly talk and bluster kenyons an old woman should have been a vicar so he could preach about honor and all that instead of a sailor he doesnt like the navy any more than i maybe less so whats he so exercised about once he had composed himself and hidden that accusatory epistle safely away from prying eyes he helped himself to lady maudes special decoction cold tea with the rob of lemons and a pinch of sugar and opened the third letter now this is more like it it was from keith ashburn still sixth lieutenant to sir onsley on glatton it was chatty and newsy about previous messmates and an open invitation to spend some time roving english harbor s pleasurable pursuits once he had gotten stronger it was also full of a teasing but basically envious accounting of how his heroism had been received in the flagship and in port which was most gratifying to peruse without knowing all the intimate details of the fight with that privateer it was assumed by one and all that some hard and plucky bottom was shown by claghorne and lewrie as the only two officers still well enough to not only face up to a betterarmed brig but to burn her to the waterline and win the day all honor and glory to claghorne now a commission officer with an independent command the recognizable mark of favor usually shown a first lieutenant after a spectacular victory and all honor and glory to a plucky courageous midshipman named lewrie that any captain would be damned glad to have in his gun room aye give even a cur like me a good name and itll be harder to get rid of than cowshit on riding boots alan agreed to himself secretly and totally delighted kenyon can stick his nose up at the smell but ill bet most of em would still think i was heroic even if they knew the whole truth his jubilation was disturbed as the maidservant entered with a supper tray followed by lucy beauman eyes glowing with the admiration she clearly felt for him we must not allow news from the wide world to upset you mister lewrie she said your main concern is recovery now heres your supper a nourishing soup she said brightly indicating various dishes on the tray lifting the lid of his supper old isaac caught this lobster this afternoon and theres drawn butter carrots and peas and auntie lady maude believes a small amount of hock will strengthen your blood do you need another pillow may i fluff up that one there you are more comfortable you are too kind to me miss beauman she tucked a large white napkin into the top of his bed gown and spread it over his chest andromeda placed the tray across his lap and began to pour him some white wine theres enough for two glasses tonight lucy informed him taking a seat in a chair by the bed that left her seated below him from where she looked up at him like a prepubescent elder sister would regard the anival of a new offspring i know how you navy men enjoy your wine and if youre very good and gain your strength lady maude shall allow you more i shall try alan promised her taking a welcome sip is this your sword lucy asked touching it but not attempting to pick it up how marvelous did your captain give it you yes he did sir onsley just presented it to me so he should reward someone who saved his command as he lay iii lucy nodded firmly shifting her adoring gaze back to him that will be all for now andromeda youah suppah be ready soon missy the black girl said on the way out you really look much better mister lewrie lucy said as he cracked a claw open spurting hot juices across the napkin may i assist you i believe i may manage but thankee just the same miss beauman he cut a portion and dunked the meat in the hot butter brought it to his mouth and chewed thinking how regal a good fresh lobster could be and how messy but the girl was there with another napkin to help daub at him is there anything else you would require mister lewrie she asked eager to fetch for him perhaps a nice heel of bread this shall be sufficient he told her spooning up some of the soup it was hot and spicy loaded with chunks of some local fish and various pot vegetables i fear i am making a mess then allow me to assist really i dont mind at all she assured him give me your spoon and rest easy how much longer shall i be confined to bed miss beauman i believe a naval surgeon visits tomorrow he would know better mister lewrie delicately she brought the spoon to his lips i love island soups and stews dont you i feel so useless lying here he said and i must get back aboard a ship not until you are perfectly recovered i pray she said quickly then blushed at her sentiment i mean well if i am to recover fully i can think of no better place in which to do it and no better company miss beauman which brought another stronger flush to her cheeks and shoulders my christian name is alan alan she repeated tasting the strength of it i am lucy may i call you that i am sure that lady maude would not mind nor would i wonderful he smiled then i shall with all respect and all gratitude i did nothing she said shyly it was all lady maudes idea but i must say you have richly earned her hospitality and concern words cannot express my thanks lucy he said softly glad the tray covered a hopeful stirring at the sight of how fresh and adoring she was and how beautiful your return to duty in full health shall be our reward alan she said right back showing a tremulous boldness for a second if had died heaven could not have been half this grand he told himself as she cut him another bite of lobster a week later he still lingered at lady maudes house able to rise from bed and get about without assistance with lucy as his companion and old isaac as a chaperone he was encouraged to take exercise to rebuild his shattered strength mostly they walked the beaches going down the gentlest inclines to the sea alan was painfully thin after his ordeal a trace of quince still remained in his complexion but he was content to puff and blow as he climbed up or down the slopes to the sandy beaches where he could stroll for hours with many a rest stop under the trees and flowering bushes that fringed the strand to protect his bald pate from the sun he wore a floppy sennit hat that was much cooler than using a tightly curled white wig to disguise his bare scalp there was a down coming back in now a sign that he would recover and within a week more would have a head of hair no shorter than most people had it cut generally under their own fashionable wigs for coolness and the easy detection of pests once out of sight of the house he would peel off his stockings and shoes and undo the knee bucldes and buttons of his oldest tarriest breeches he would open his shirt and roll up the sleeves then revel in the warm winds that blew steadily off the atlantic would wade in the surf sometimes up to his waist in the crystalclear inrush from the ocean when he got too hot and sweaty he would plunge into the shallows or squat and duck himself to come up snorting and refreshed there were plenty of crabs to watch and chase after at a slow walk there were shells to discover and wash clean in the shallows there were seabirds to admire the little sandpipers that dug in the wet sand as the waves hissed to nothing and the hiding places of small morsels plopped and bubbled before the waves rolled back in arid the sandpipers ran away from a soaking on a blur of spindly legs there were seagulls that hung motionless against the steady breeze and cried for bits of bread and when they wished to rest there was always a bottle of ale or beer in old isaacs bottomless leather sack a stone jug of lady maudes cold tea fruit to peel and eat a rusk or a slice of something sweet and special that lucy had packed as a tiny gift to him which he always insisted they share old isaac kept a wary eye on him he was after all a slave that lucys father had sent along with her from jamaica when the latest slave revolt had broken out an old family retainer with specific instructions to protect her from just such a potential danger as lewrie alan speculated on how big was the knife old isaac might have in the bottom of that sack of his should he make a move on his lovely young charge old isaac swore he was part caribe the ancient indians of the west indies but he looked as blueblack as any import from dahomeyeven his gums were blue but he did know a lot about the shells they found the birds the fish the sea urchins to avoid what trees were unsafe to take shade under such as the manchineel which continually misted a sap like acid he had been a fisherman for the beauman family for years at their plantation on portland bight on jamaica until too old to work so hard at the oars and deep nets lucy said that old isaac was making him a juju bag that would keep him safe from the dangers of the sea but he was never to inspect the inside of the bag and wear it forever it would save him from drowning old isaac assured him lewrie told him of the belief that a tatoo of a certain cross would do the same but old isaac had only laughed at how gullible white people could be he could not say anything such as that but from the way he had tittered openmouthed and walked off muttering to himself and laughing he said volumes two weeks later one bright and sunny and pleasantly cool morning on the beach basking barechested under a mild sun lewrie began to realize that his idyll might come to an end he looked up the beach at lucy walking barefoot in the surf a fashionable sunshade in one hand to retain her paleness the other holding up the skirt of her gown she wore no stays and no petticoats like a poor country wench and the gown was old and shabby enough to allow her to wade if she wished the bottom two feet of hem was soaking wet and clinging to her bare legs and he felt his groin stir pleasantly at the sight if he felt well enough to think about bedding a wench and lucy was the only dell in sight then he was well enough to go back to the harbor and resume his duties in a way it would be a relief for she was openly fond of him but she was only sixteen years old coltish and lovely but not his sort of pigeon and being the recipient of so much open adoration without being able to take advantage of it was driving him to distraction im just a toy to her anyway he thought young girls like to play with dolls to feed and nurse and all i am to her is a doll that can talk back and if i did get into her mutton admiral matthews would have me flogged round the fleet he stood up and walked into the gentle surf at low tide wading out until he was waistdeep then ducked under and splashed up and down several times to take his mind off how virginal she was and how much hed enjoy ending that condition damme shes built for sport though sah he heard old isaac yell as though in command lewrie took time to see three pelicans rise from the water and a boil of fingerling fish break the surface perhaps a musket shot away farther out and began to wade back ashore immediately he had seen sharks on this beach rolling openmouthed and hungry in the face of a wave black eyes seemingly aiming at him perhaps it was nothing but it was better to be safe than sorry and supposedly old isaac thought so as well you must be careful alan lucy told him as he gained the dry sand it might have been a shark out there thank you isaac he said as the old man settled back to rest except for the sharks this would be ideal lucy said angling her parasol against the morning sun old isaac had resumed his reclining position at the top of the beach in the shade most likely you listen from the top of the stairs with your nurse she dropped the parasol to her side and stepped up to him she flung her anns around him and kissed him most expertly raising the sunshade to screen their activities from old isaac up the beach damme they train em right in the indies alan told himself taking her into a close embrace that brushed his groin against the front of her thin gown there were no underpinnings or petticoats to soften the impact of a trembling young body against his and his newly restored power to be excited made him positively ache with sudden want did mrs hillwood kiss you like that she whispered stepping back from him her bright blue eyes were twinkling often he said honestly rattled badly she flung herself on him again for another long and passionate kiss arms twined about his neck possessively did she kiss you like that once more she broke away as he dropped a hand to a firm buttock no not exactly he said feeling weak and no one else ever shall she squeezed his hand and began to stride back up the beach toward old isaac leaving him standing as though he had just been struck with a quarterstaff holy christ he whispered watching her walk away so fully pleased with herself with a groan he turned to the surf and flung himself into it once more his clothes barely dry from his last immersion he bobbed and ducked until he could walk erect without getting the old man suspicious then made his way down the beach old isaac had a cloth spread in the shade his shirt was there and a towel that he used to dry himself and remove some of the sand that had stuck to his feet and legs isaac reached into his leather bag and pulled out an orange which he bit like a horse with strong yellow teeth he spat out the plug and began to suck lewrie helped himself to a pewter mug of cold tea watching lucy prowl the sand farther up the beach in search of shells you gettin bettah sab old isaac said softly whats that to you maybe bout time you go back to sea sah old isaac said turning to look at him and that is what you shall tell sir onsley and lady maude ah doan tell nobody nothin sah but it be time hes right lewrie nodded in silent agreement if i lay a hand on her there goes all that good influence and my good name hereabouts only way i could have her is to marry her god what a thought if i stay any longer i hurt her right not for me tab say sah i hope it will not please you too much if i agree with you you ugly old fart lewrie smiled as he said it old isaac gave him a toothy grin nodded and went back to eating his fruit admiral matthews dined with them that evening free for once of his flagship and her responsibilities though alan wondered what he did that was so important that would not require glatton to be at sea once the cloth had been removed and the ladies had withdrawn sir onsley waved lewrie down to join him by the port bottle as i remarked earlier you have recovered well mister lewrie thank you sir onsley i feel very able to join a ship and i cannot with good conscience prevail on lady maudes hospitality any longer lewrie declared yes sir onsley said eyeing him one can only stand to be mothered and fussed over so long before one begins to feel like a lapdog the surgeon suggests light duties for a spell how would you like to serve ashore for a while while i would dearly love a sea berth sir onsley i would of course be happy to serve in any capacity and be grateful to be alive to do so alan toadiedright well he thought hmm yes i expect you would be i could take you into glatton but i see that you do not wish to idle in a harbor when you could be more use at sea perhaps i amgood with small arms and artillery sir onsley that is very true sir onsley said reaching for the port he poured himself a full bumper and topped alans glass as well i shall be going back to english harbor before dawn have your chest packed and ready and well find you something to keep you busy thank you sir onsley i am pleased you would find me useful you can handle a boat ride know something about stores aye sir excellent sir onsley said with a firm nod well heel taps and then im for bed i shall leave word for you to be wakened aye aye sir for the next month alan was busy up at dawn and out on the roads on a strong little mare carrying messages and orders from the flag to the dockyard to the batteries and the other military encampments on the island and when not in the saddle he was given charge of a finely trimmed and manned rowing boat his launch visited each ship in harbor as it anived went aboard just before departure with lastminute orders plied between flag and the dock he was seconded to the dockyard superintendent as well and got ink stains on his hands from inventories from supervising working parties from visiting warships due supplies to see that they got what was authorized and no more frankly he looked on it as loathsome quillpushing but he did what he was told since it gave him a certain freedom he berthed on old ariadne once more now full of aniving or transient officers and men and since he knew the island better than the anivais he turned into an evening guide to the better entertainments confirming once more his belief that he would make a topping pimp it continually amazed him how little warrant and commission officers much older than he did not know about women and how to get them there was also a certain delight to be taken in being the voice of authority he was one of admiral matthews bearers of bad tidings and glad tidings even if it was proxy power it was power lordly post captains tensed up when he was piped through the entry port especially if they had been remiss in their duties lieutenants tried to milk him for information almost from the moment he headed aft and he enjoyed dropping the most obtuse hints for them to ponder while withholding the true import of the messages he carried in enigmatic silence going about his duties in a splendid new uniform with the supercilious air of a flag lieutenant but after about a month it all began to pale there was no chance for him to make any profits from the lucrative trade in naval stores such as the dockyard people reaped in bribes and graft he could not visit the deck of some seedily maintained and poorly run warship with her roundshot rusty and her rigging hanging in untidy bights without wishing to jump in and start kicking a bosuns mates arse or giving the quartergunners hell for neglecting their guns he could not go aboard a smartly run ship just in with prizes full of tales of derringdo without envying the shabby but competent demeanor of her midshipmen who looked upon him as a toy grenadier painted up like a tart there was no future ashore for an ambitious somewhat competent and resourceful fellow such as he and he was being rubbed up against the fact like a puppy in his piddle he went for long rides until the little mare would breathe as hard as one of those steam machines he had heard about and his legs ached and grumbled he continued to practice swordsmanship every time he had free until an old naval cutlass could be swung about like a toy sword and his new hanger did indeed feel light as a feather he taught the intricacies of gambling at cards to other midshipmen with a steady income from home increased his purse he found himself a doxy in town and paid for her room and his frequent visits warning her that if he got the pox from her he would have her nose off before the disease did and was about threequarters sure that she did not entertain others when he was gone which was about as good as could be expected from a bawd he was not exactly bored but he was not exactly happy either the crowning humiliation of being a shore sailor no greater than a whip jack was when lady maude decided to sponsor a ball and dinner alan was loaned by sir onsley to be her clerk and had to suffer the twittering idiocy of lady maude and the other naval wives as he did up their shopping lists their dinner plans their music choices and then issue the invitations copying the same words over and over again in his best round hand no midshipmen could be spared from the flagship or the dockyard for that dutyit was all his since he was no loss to the demands of the navy lucy was there in the background ignoring him for departing like a thief in the night without so much as a farewell note which made it much more pleasant to get away once the invitations were finished and go galloping or rowing to deliver them the only sop to his feelings was that he was at least invited to attend he was tricked out perfectly in his best new blue coat snow white shirt and waistcoat and breeches that had never known tar or slush fine silk stockings and new goldplated buckles on his wellblacked shoes he might be a low addition to the ball but he thought he glittered properly very few other midshipmen had been invited except for those that could sport the honourable before their names in the mob of lieutenants commanders captains and a commodore or two civilians took him for some sort of staff person which was good for his ego or a servant which was not admiralty house atop the hill was a sea of candlelight a rich amber aura most flattering to all especially the women the men in their floured wigs looked bronzed as golden oak from the sun even if half of them spent their lives in countinghouses alan strolled about sipping at a cold hock there was still plenty of greenland ice down in the stormcellars packed in chaff and straw to last the summer his hosts had even been so profligate with it as to float large blocks in the punchbowls he could see lucy the center of attention from a host of young admirers and some not so young there was even a popeyed commander with the face of a frog off a sloop of war courting her lewrie had to admit that she looked luscious instead of her own hair she wore a highpiled white wig a reddish gold satin gown faced with a pale yellow filigreed and embroidered silk undergown making her seem older devilishfine looking young thing keith ashburn said at his side lewrie turned to him hallo alan how do you keep main well considering yes yes she is must have been a trial to be around her knowing you even if you did have the yellow jack thats why they ran me off thought i was looking a tad too robust to be near such a sweet young tit ever try to get into her mutton sony no i didnt alan glowered irked that he of all people would speak of her so casually my apologies but you wouldnt mind if i danced with her not at all alan shrugged as though it made no difference to him but was suddenly queasy with jealousy at the thought of someone else paying court to her or discussing her like cheap merchandise he knew there was no future in it for his career and knew that her sort of affection would involve marriage whats more he knew she was being ravishing to her circle of courtiers to get back at him just as she had snubbed him earlier and that his best course of action was to ignoie her and spark someone else for the evening so he would not appear to her to be a foolish cully over a chit of a girl but he found himself drifting nearer as though drawn into a maelstrom i throw myself on your mercy miss beauman ashburn was pleading in mock seriousness allow me just the one dance this evening for such gallantry mister ashburn i shall make it two she laughed lightly have you met lieutenant warner of the dido frigate commander ozzard of vzxen lieutenant wyndham of the th foot lieutenant ashburn of glatton and midshipman lewrie of my uncles staff she concluded dismissively he was drawn into the conversational circle against his will having stood close enough to keith to look as if he was with him and had to suffer the looks of the commission officers at his affrontery to poach on their private preserve but when she needed a fresh cup of punch it was alan that she drew to her and linked arms with to escort her to the buffets leaving the others fuming is it not a beautiful evening for a party alan she asked as he fetched a fresh cup for her its so exciting indeed everything is lovely he agreed with a smile and does my new gown please you i believe that you are the most beautiful young lady present the gown is magnificent as you are why thank you indeed alan she said seeming really pleased i should not expect such a pretty compliment from someone who would toss me aside so easily your uncle and the service required me to leave but without a word not a note not even a hint as i said you can dissemble so well alan she told him sweetly was i not desirable enough to tempt you to stay how tempting you were was the prime reason i had to leave do you think sir onsley and lady maude old isaac or those other servants who came from jamaica with you would allow me to pay court to you without your familys approval i have more respect for you than to do anything to harm your good name he most courtly lied while mrs hillwood and that gorgeous lady cantner have no good name to lose the coy minx posed what do you think i should have done sneak into your room to bid you goodbye he asked half in jest not at all but he had half an idea that she might have entertained just such a fantasy you could however have considered my feelings at your lack of manners i sbail in future i should also wish to ask for a dance or two if you are not too promised already ah alan she said with a wistful adoring smile you are so of course i shall dance with you in fact i would be most cross with you if we did not i migbt remind you that i shall soon be seventeen not such a little girl to you believe me i have noticed your maturing i shail not always be a gawky girl and you shall not always be interested in trivial she turned away from him to avoid him seeing her distress i am very fond of you as well lucy you shall be a postcaptain she said proudly perhaps even knighted for some act of great bravery she turned to him and smoothed a lapel for him but perhaps when you become a lieutenant and the war is over he added almost pissproud at what he was hearing from her pray god it is soon she agreed hotly he took her gloved hand and brushed her fingers with his lips my god she loves me he thought wildly now theres a new thing thereve been tnills enough glad to see my shillings but heres an admirals niece as good as saying she wants to marry me not that he was that anxious to marry but she had the best prospects he had seen since leaving london nor was he anxious for the war to end for how else could he earn prize money make more of a name for himself gain that commission that would assure his future and there were a hundred obstacles in the way she was a girl therefore fickle in her affections her father could go barking mad at the thought and most likely had a bettersuited young man of her own set in mind already and it was never up to the girl to choose oh fond daddys might indulge the whims of a favorite daughter but if a better match was in the offing in land entitlements opportunity for mutual profit or fond parents hope of hopes a link to the peerage then a salty young swain could go sing for his supper im being led by my prick he realized but also noted that love had to start somewhere and she did seem genuinely fond of him she was sweet and gentle wellspokenso much more so than most of the squirearchy chawbacons in the indiesand would make a good wife for him dowry or no i really am fond of her too but pray god i get a ship soon she can wait as i shall have to they browsed the buffets nibbling at the rich and spicy titbits proferred he could not monopolize her and did not try she was young and delighted with all the attention she was receiving from even the oldest male guests she was seated about midway down the long table at dinner with the middleranking folk while alan was once more down far below he shared table with a silly blond chickenbreasted noddy whose sole social skill seemed to be stuttering how fascinating whenever anyone else paused for comment there was a dark girl named aemilia daughter of a pair of country harrys who peered about the available men with the eyes of hungry ferrets for a suitable match had she been by herself and was he not almostbutnotquite pledged to lucy alan would have been fascinated by her for aemilia was a sleepy young brunette with a chest like a pouter pigeon that put him in mind of a younger edition of lady delia cantner she was a bit crude for his taste though a hearty midlands girl with a mumbletonian accent he tried to let an infantry ensign take the lead but he was more interested in the blond noddy whose parents owned a whacking chunk of hampshire it seemed so while trying to maintain a silent dinner conversation with lucy uptable by eye and shrug and smile he also found himself down for three dances with aemilia countryget without knowing just how he had managed it her buttockbrokering parents looked nwst pleased lewrie always enjoyed dancing his french hopmaster had convinced him that women dearly loved a man who could dance well and carry himself gracefully and would eventually show their gratitude most naval officers having been prenticed at age ten or twelve could not dance a courtly step and only rumble about like a loose cannon in the country dances so he had a leg up on most of them he and lucy always came back together after she had been amused by lieutenant wyndham by ashburn by warner and ozzard and a platoon of panting admirers her hand lingered on his arm longer their fingers held their touch longer their smiles were shyer and more pleasing but it was her night and the most ardent finally got her to go to the card room to wager pennies at loo or hazard and lucy gave him a backward glance of mock despair and he was left alone as he fortified himself with a cup of claret punch ashburn came across the room to join him i see we have been both outranked and outmarched by those bastards from the army keith said mopping his sweaty brow theres an ocean of mutton here tonight keith why complain do you and miss beauman have some sort of an agreement keith asked finishing off one cold cup of punch and dipping another the sighing and peeking have been making commanderozzards teeth grind most wondrous hard we have established that we are fond of each other alan admitted and there is hope for after the war perhaps but in this life you may bank on little god stap me but you have the best shitten luck keith said prize money some fame and now miss beauman i was envious of you when you gained your commission want to trade keith said sourly we shall never stir up the anchors unless the french sail past cape shirley please god they do sir onsleys a friend to you youve already moved up to fifth officer from sixth alan reminded him but were not at sea keith groused aye i could use a berth myself oh god aemilia chawbacon alan muttered spying the dark girl approaching him from the other side of the salon like to meet a very obliging girl keith oh nice poonts keith said alan tried to introduce keith but it was no go not the fact that he was a commission officer not the fact that his family was rich as the crown nor that he was related to just about everyone who mattered she had alan down to dance with her at the country dances and that was that she was civil but never took her gaze off lewrie he had to take her out onto the floor as the band struck up more lively airs though he would have much preferred going to the card room to see how lucy fared after half an hour he pushed another claret punch into her and set out to deposit her in the paws of her family but they could not be spotted oh they retired aemilia said matteroffactly there was a nice old captain was to see me home but hes had too much to drink pemaps you could well perhaps where do your folks live on the other side of the island she beamed i would admire that miss aemilia but i am on the admirals staff and have strict orders to stay close should he need me alan lied quickly listening to the happy cries from he card room as lucy won a small pot unfortunately aemilia had laid her plans too well sir onsley was nearby and saw no reason why mister lewrie could not safely escort a young lady home once aemilia had wiggled against him pleasantly one look at her straining bosom and it was a close thing as to whether he would have traded his flagship for a chance to fondle her bouncers if i could presume upon you to pay my respects to your niece sir onsley alan said almost strangling in his neckcloth at the thought of having to leave and to your good lady for a most enjoyable evening sir onsley assured him that he would and there was nothing for it but to escort aemiiia out onto the veranda the family coach was already gone but a hired coach was whistled up aemilia insisting on a closed one to avoid the cool night air on her daringly bared shoulders damn the navy damn damn damn he thought miserably as he handed the girl in and took a seat on the front bench facing her the coachee whipped up but was obviously a cautious man on the steep hill road with his team and once at the bottom he would not force the horses faster than a brisk walk it would be two hours to get the girl home and most likely the same returning come sit by me so we may talk aemilia ordered patting the upholstery by her side the coach will sway on these roads so well be safer wedged in together he slid over to lump beside her as the coach left the cobbled town streets for a country lane with an uneven surface there was only a hint of the moon and the interior of the coach was dark as a boot i know about you midshipmen oh he archly queried wont do nothing to hurt their chances urn i suppose so he had to allow my parentsre pushing for a good match i believe i had noticed that at diimer he sighed so if i wanted me a good match id be having a young captain see me home wouldnt i have she said turning to press against him mostlike he said in the dark trying to slide away nobody wants a midshipman with no prospects i hardly rate myself as one with no prospects he fumed in a pet that he had to be there in the first place and for being told he was a nobody in the second by a colonial nobody being a good little girl is such a bore ever do it in a carriage she whispered leaning close and laying a kiss on his cheek all but bouncing with excitement now look here thats all fine for you but if you turn up with a jackinthebox where am i damned if i havent had my fill of these island women leading you into promises or pushing you into the bunk like you have no say about things well dont you know that the blacks know how to stop babies she said stroking his cheeks theres half a dozen men with better prospects i could blame it on anyway well if thats so the whole evening wont be a waste he told himself ill have to marry one of em sooner or later but for now why cant we have some fun she said into his ear she took hold of one of his hands and forced him to seize a breast it promised to be as full and heavy and round as he had imagined i like doing it in a coach ever so nice so dark and cozy and the coachee not knowing whats going on or if he does he cant do a thing about it can he and the people by the side of the road who cant see in while were having our fun lord you will remember i was ordered he sighed he tossed his hat on the opposite seat and turned to her within a minute he had his waistcoat and coat off and his breeches down he unbuttoned her gown and played with her truly magnificent breasts as she hauled up her gown and petticoats she spread herself open for him and propped her feet on the opposite seat while he halfknelt before her his knees precariously perched on the seat between her legs and gripped her buttocks oh god yes she whispered happily as he slid into her deeply his knees slipped off the upholstery but his feet were firmly planted against the front of the opposite bench giving him purchase so he could thrust into her once engaged he became excited and drove hard partly for the enjoyment partly to take his anger out on her for pressganging him into leaving lucy at the ball aemilia didnt care if he was performing with a knife at his throat lost in her own joy and delighting in crying out just loud enough to tantalize their black coachman on top of the box that also excited him and he forced her to turn and present to him after her first pleasuring still ironhard and eager to gain revenge he exploded into her hoping that she was impregnated and forced into an unhappy marriage with one of her better prospects wants servicing does she ill give the bitch service she was nimble and eager for more after some cooing and sighing and he bulled her allover the coach for the rest of the trip slamming into her hard and ending with her head down into his groin as he sat on the seat and watched the suggestion of a planters house loom up from the darkness he ordered the coachee to stop for a while as he filled her once more even though she was beginning to protest by then she was shaken by the time he handed her down and scurried into her home without looking at him he shut the coach door and climbed up by the coachee snapping the whip to speed their passage back to english harbor the things one is forced to do for ones admiral alan said as he entered a dockside inn and found ashburn still up dozing over a pipe and a glass of wine with that little countryput keith asked jealously just got back damn troll like to have had the skin off my back alan said motioning for the waiter he was dehydrated by his exertions and badly in need of ale how was the rest of the ball wonderful keith said ozzard got stinking drunk and had to be carried home lucy stayed til about one and then went home with her aunt far as i know sir onsley is still tippling port with the dockyard captain and that ugly old general the door slammed open and a roistering party of army officers staggered in hooting loudly calling for drink service and spare women lieutenant wyndham was with them as well as the little ensign ames who had been attable with lewrie at dinner plus two more lieutenants and a captain of some years named oboyle we want your best not common swill oboyle said as he swayed over a table not the usual stuff you trot out for sailors an whores and well only pay for what we like wyndham added to the cheers of his mates here i dont like this glass it went into the fireplace raising another cheer several naval officers began to look for their hats sufferin jesus ashburn said there goes a fairly nice public house behold our army the drury lane fencibles wonder what got them out of hyde park alan speculated gambling debts that was good enough for admiral rodney this will do barely the ensign told the publican though its piss compared to the cases we brought with us i dont need no trouble with the watch now sirs the publican told them grovelling and trying to watch all of them at the same time maybe ya might be findin yer own better ta drink at this late hour theres a codshead i know wyndham shouted pointing at keith and alan ashburn and little capn queernabs lewrie or something aint it your servant sirs keith said raising his glass to them come have a drink on the th foot wyndham said which set the officers off on a regimental ditty that made no sense at all set to a nonsensical tune that resembled the world turned upside down they look like they can pay keith said want to free wine never refuse a treat it seemed that they were all from london or close thereabouts so they spent a lively half hour reviewing plays raree shows gossip and comparing mutton they had bulled the th foot had given up a halfbattalion a grenadier company and two line companies which were to transship to st kitts to upgrade the defenses the rest were still enjoying the pleasures of london and this batch was mortally offended that they had been thought dispensable the captain was irish which meant that he felt disposed of by the more fashionable officers and was morose as a paddy could be after having been sent to fight a war while his english compatriots still rogered and swaggered through the towns back home more wine was called for and the empties went smash into the fireplace gradually the noise drove most of the other naval sort of customers away into the night lewrie lieutenant wyndham said suddenly now i remember you you were at the ball this evening aye i was with that tasty little dish lucy beauman gentlemen you remember the blond tit i taught cards to wyndham asked and received their drunken and heartfelt assent a lovely piece was she not admiral sir onsley matthews niece yes alan said looking at keith who was beginning to sense trouble as well im told youve been dashing lewrie wyndham said particularly dashing i believe was the ladys term for it burned a privateer all up with your own little hands saved a ship of the line too alan has been busy since coming to the indies keith interposed quickly i was in ariadne with him both midshipmen at the time let me tell you in fact that was all i heard from that bitch wyndham broke in and i dont want to hear any more of it here now alan said evenly i shall make it a point to taste her pleasures even if she is a lowbred island trull gentlemen charge your glasses lets drink to my next mutton warren the irish captain warned his mates had gone silent at the provocation no i want us all to drink to lucy beauman wyndham insisted swaying to his feet ill play the upright man and break that little dell though she wouldnt be fit company at home without half a crown for socketmoney unless mister lewrie here has already strummed with her then i wont go over a shilling alan tipped his wineglass and spilled it on the table keith did the same and they both rose together i shall speak for both of us sir keith said almost grinding his teeth such billingsgate about a fine young lady we would never drink to even if she were unknown to us that you slander a lady of our acquaintance is a shameful example of your lack of wit and manners i trust your regiment is not known for it keith kept a firm hand on lewries wrist as he spoke after seeing the flush of anger on his face good night sirs keith finished almost dragging lewrie off for the door come on damn you i am ordering you lieutenant to midshipman not as your friend you little idiot he whispered i should have known the navy would go all pious on us wyndham sneered flinging his wineglass at them tawdry lot of bartholomew babies aye drag his cowardly cooler out of this place before he might have to blaze with me what he says he did and what he really did are two different things just like the navy wyndham guffawed warren i am ordering you to sit down and shut up the captain said grabbing wyndhams arm while the other lieutenants and ensigns looked on are you calling me a coward sir alan turned abruptly and shook off ashburns hand talk of the wine table is no reason for meeting the little ensign said i am sure warren does not really mean dont tell me anything ames wyndham snarled being illreceived by the young lady in question is no reason to provoke a duel either ashburn said perhaps his pride is pinching him lets allow him to sleep it off shall we fuck you you codshead wyndham said yes i think that mister lewrie is a coward a coward and a liar and a manfucking molly just like everybody else in the navy is a bugger in disguise warren from the ensign named ames and i think his precious lucy beauman is a poxy whore we need to meet sir alan replied icily in the shocked silence that followed wyndhams accusations the onlookers gave a groan whether of pain or delight it was hard to tell alan ashburn barked in his best quarterdeck voice no keith theres been enough alan said stepping back up to the table i sir consider you a pissproud cully youre a butchers dog with no nutmegs for a real fighting regiment youre a bastardly gujlion with a cambridge fortune and a great dammeboy with your fellow bucks but youre the pigignorant git of a threepenny upright alan had always been able to wound with the choice word and he must have stung something in wyndhams background the young man blazed up and without thinking slapped him hard across the face excellent lewrie said a slur on my character a slur on the innocence of a young lady and striking a gentleman the sooner the better as far as i am concerned sirs you will witness that he scoured me beyond all temperance lieutenant wyndham declared captain oboyle i request that you arrange this for me i must talk to the major warren boyle muttered but ill tell you youre a godcursed fool for doing this lieutenant ashburn would you negotiate for me alan said aye and what weapons would you prefer mister lewrie naval cutlasses lewrie decided after a long moment thats no weapon for a gentleman to use why dont we blaze wyndham sneered a man who would strike another can have no objections can he ashburn said captain oboyle your party has issued a mortal and grievous series of slanders sir the choice of weapons and the place is ours is it not aye even by the irish code oboyle admitted i shall communicate with you further sir after my principal and i have informed our commanding officers ashburn promised i shall await you sir oboyle said with a bow there are beaches on antigua one for every day of the year for a sybarite intent on enjoying the gifts of sun and wind and water lewries coach rolled up to the low overlook at one of them on the north end of the island two days later just at low tide when the sand would be firm underfoot he had with him keith ashburn a naval surgeon and captain osmonde of the marines formerly of ariadne and now captain of marines in the eightygun telemachus osmonde had drilled lewrie hard for those two days to get him in shape wyndham and his party were already waiting boyle his second a regimental surgeon and his friend ames there was also an army officer from the garrison a major overstreet who would referee there was a small fire burning and the regimental surgeons tools and instruments were already boiling to lessen the shock of cold steel to the flesh of the loser admiral matthews gave me a message mister lewrie osmonde said as he flicked some invisible dirt from his uniform after they had stepped down aye alan asked icecold and already very thirsty while he deplores the idea of dueling he deplores the insult to his niece even more i doubt if your feelings matter to him but he told me to tell you that his hopes are with you that was kind of him sir alan said disappointed for a while i thought he would not allow us to meet i think their commander tipped the scales smug little bastard thought miss beauman was a common dell no matter who her uncle was osmonde laughed without humor the lads built like a young bull he indicated the enemy below on the beachlieutenant wyndham was a thick and stocky fellow bluff and hardlooking somewhat of a duellist fought two with pistols killed his man both times only once with a blade won it but no fatality you do little to reassure me sir alan said a servant offered him a mug of small beer which he drank at greedily keep nothing on your stomach osmonde advised it will sour on you soon enough and turn heavy as lead aye sir wet your lips and tongue but dont swallow much i know that thirst boy but you can have all you want to drink once this is over osmonde cautioned hopefully aye sir nodding hoping and praying that was so one thing in your favor i have learned osmonde said as they descended the overlook to the beach your foe is very fond of the bottle puts it down like small beer and hes spent the last five weeks aboard ship doing nothing but getting cupshot and lying about hes been ashore less than a week and the heat is affecting him now youre recovered from the yellow jack youve been riding hard fencing hard kept yourself fitter than him id wear him down fend him off ti he begins to drag were you fencing with the usual choice of weapon he might still have the stronger and quicker wrist but a navy cutlass will wear him down fast enough yes alan intoned barely hearing osmonde for the rush of blood in his head and the sound of his breath rushing in and out so full of life why did i want to defend the silly mort he thought queasily ive no honor and everybody seems to know it i trust that you have become a dangerous man mister lewrie captain osmonde said pumping his hand and my best wishes to you lewrie shed his uniform and undid his neckcloth tossing it aside he took a deep breath and enjoyed the sight of the gulls wheeling over their covesheltered beach the play of sun on the bright green water he shook himself all over to loosen his tenseness this is what comes of getting involved with a chickabiddy young girl i should stick to whores gentlemen major overstreet called them together that a blow was struck and grievous insults exchanged notwithstanding they were brought about by strong drink and can be excusable i charge both of you now is there no way to settle this quarrel without recourse to steel only if lieutenant wyndham publicly recants his slurs on the lady in question his slurs on me and apologizes for striking me sir alan stated as calmly as he could feeling trapped and knowing in his heart that it was not going to be that way he could see the swaggering superior way wyndham glared at him i stand by my statements sir wyndham replied overstreet sighed then it is my sad duty to allow you to proceed the weapons chosen by the aggrieved party are naval cutlasses you shall both draw a weapon which your second shall offer you you shall separate to the red pegs which are five paces apart you shall salute each other at my command then take what guard you will and advance to touch blades on my count you shall begin i shall say one and two and three begin the duel shall continue until such time as one party has received his third cut at that time i shall call you to cea e should honor be deemed satisfied the duel will end should you not feel that your cause has been redeemed your seconds shall inform me and the duel shall continue until such time as one or both of you has fallen a disarm shall be considered a touch should either of you advance threateningly before my count or fail to halt after the third cut at my call or if one of you attempt to strike the other after disarming the other the second of the offended party and i shall shoot him down do you wlderstand they both nodded grim and pale then take your weapons please lewrie went to his peg where ashburn stood he offered him a cutlass hiltfirst pray god for you alan keith whispered now why dont you cut the swaggering duckfucker up lewrie nodded to him and touched him on the shoulder wjth his free hand then turned to face lieutenant wyndham who was getting the feel of the heavy cutlass as though he had never handled one before it was a plain weapon heavy as sin a simple chopping weapon with a wide blade and only one edge and a point of sorts at the end of the upward curve like a caricature of an infantrymans hanger the handguard was of flat steel with a ring guard and a wooden handle which had been rubbed with dust to stanch the expected sweat salute overstreet called raising a long doublebarreled pistol at halfcock wyndham took up a graceful balanced pose with one hand over his shoulder perfect as a french sword instructor his blade in quarte lewrie brought his own blade to octave and he had to smile at the incongruous sight of someone posing with a cutlass as though it was a foil i shall begin the count overstreet intoned one and two and three begin they advanced with small steps blades trembling with anticipation first beat rang hesitantly as they explored the army man opened with a thrust which lewrie beat aside and then wyndham responded with a cut over it was obvious that the lieutenant was a point man they fenced in school style fora while lewrie trying wyndhams disengage and parry style eyes on wyndhams own his point and the set of his feet wyndham exploded with a sudden lunge lewrie parried it off high to his left stepping aside the thrust in quartata then swung at the unbalanced man and came a toucher of disemboweling wyndham who leaped back like a cat eyes wide with surprise lewrie went to the attack with a feint thrust beating aside the parry and lunged himself wyndham gave a grunt of alarm and stumbled backward to fallon the firm sand beach while lewrie spun past him and took up guard waiting for him to regain his feet lewrie understood what osmonde had meant what little small beer he had drunk was sloshing around in his belly like a sack of mercury and his thirst was hellish the exertion felt debilitating and they had barely begun but he found time to whirl his cutlass in mock salute and raise one eyebrow in a cocky grin as lieutenant wyndham got to his feet and began to advance once more wyndham began thrusting low with feint thrusts stamping to distract lewries attention or throw off his timing forcing him back as their blades rang in engagement and light parries lewrie gave ground halfstep for halfstep to maintain distance before shifting to a low guard and pointparrying wyndham wider and wider the soldier wanted to step back and regain his advantage so he ended with his blade at high first and whirled it suddenly in a killing swing that lewrie met with a crossover to fourth the two blades met with a great clang and the shock stunned his arm and hand but lewrie cut across his own blade ringing off wyndhams hilt guard which lowered the army mans weapon below his waist lewrie feinted a cut to the head backhanded which made him duck back offbalance lewrie drew his elbows back and disengaged then whirled his cutlass under and around to spin wyndhams guard over his head he then struck down the blade to lay the heavy cutlass on wyndhams scalp with a firm tap that cut through hair and skin and thudded off the bone the infantryman tried to bind but lewrie shoved forward with his hilt and pushed hard jumping back at the same time from the irate killing swing that followed there were murmurs of alarm or pleasure from the witnesses as they saw the blood on wyndhams head and face running down into his eyes humiliated wyndham was on the attack at once taking the hint of their brief practice and using the point less wielding the cutlass more like one would a hanger to attack edge to edge lewrie gave ground seeing the energy wyndham was putting into his efforts and knowing that sooner or later the man would go back to the pointwork he was used to once he began to flag wyndham began to execute flying cutovers fairly well which alan was parrying off but he suddenly went back to the point and faked alan out badly the straightarmed lunge grazed his left cheek with steel and he felt a sudden pain in his face but he responded with a counterthrust under that made wyndham hop to save his nutmegs then an upward parry and a rapid double which forced wyndham to leap back once more lewrie took a long pace forward to attack changing tactics to the full naval cutlass drillstamp slash balance and return slashright and left up and down whirling the heavy blade in a whistling arc that brought grunts of effort from wyndham each time he parried the blades smashing together with the hefty clang of a farrier making a new horseshoe lewrie added flying cutovers to break the pace going from high to low before making a swing with his wrist that almost put his point into the army mans chest wyndhams parry was weak and he almost dragged himself backward to escape his chest heaving lewrie thought it a trick but was not sure he himself was tired god he was aching his wrist and his arms heavy as lead and his legs juddering props that threatened to go slack at any second and drop him to the ground but wyndham did look finished his body was streaming sweat thinning the blood that ran down his face and coating it with claret and his eyes that had been so mocking and so sure were now squinted with concern and doubt he was tempted to leap forward and finish it but remembered captain osmondes advice to go slow and wear him down they met again blades still ringing but softer now wyndham thrust low using the point to come up with a ripping slash at lewries stomach but he beat it aside at the last instant driving wyndhams guard low met the next blow wib a twohanded swing that forced wyndhams blade wide to the left and almost into the sand lewrie stepped forward into his guard sideways and swung back to the right twohanded again with all his flagging might he felt a thud like sinking an axe into a chopping block and leaped back centering his guard against a reply but it was over wyndham stood before him with his feet together his face as white as his snowy breeches they both looked down at the sand to see lieutenant wyndhams right arm lying there still clutching the cutlass and the nerveless fingers curling and drumming an irregular tatoo on the hilt wyndham looked back to him in surprise before his eyes rolled back into his head and he pitched forward to the sand a fountain of blood gushing from what remained of his shoulder with each beat of his heart lewrie stumbled backward unable to feature it the tip of his blade dragging a furrow through the sand ashburn came up to him and he dropped his cutlass and turned away from him wyndhams party came forward and both surgeons worked on the infantry officer cauterizing a great cut in wyndhams side and hands slipped in gore as they tried to seize the spurting arteries and sear them shut while the seabirds cried and wheeled at the smell of blood steaming on the beach lewrie sat down on the step of his coach watching the drama below the naval coachee gave him a large glass of brandy to drink gawd almighty sir indeed alan nodded in shock another please this brandy he sipped more slowly becoming aware of how sore he was allover after being so tensed up for god knew how long how his arms arched and throbbed and the pain pulsed in his ravaged cheek his thigh muscles were jumping and his calves and ankles hurt as though he had strolled twenty miles across country captain osmonde climbed up the sand slope from the beach to him i believe you shall make a dangerous man after all mister lewrie i meant but to cut him lewrie dazedly protested i believe you should consider that intent most successful the marine officer said most dryly will he live lieutenant warren wyndham is now late of his majestys th regiment of foot osmonde said totally exsanguined of his lifes blood and dead on the field of honor was it worth it at the moment aye sir lewrie said studying his shoes i dont know about tomoltow an honest answer at any rate osmonde said kneeling down in front of him dont develop a taste for this boy war is gloriously obscene enough without turning into a mankiller i want no more of it alan confessed best have the surgeon sew that up osmonde said toucbing his cheek to examine his wound wont spoil your looks for the ladies i doubt hungry yes alan realized ashburn had the good faith in you to reserve rooms for us for a late breakfast at an inn on the way back i for one am famished theres one good that will come out of this lewrie said as he got to his feet at the approach of the surgeon with his bag there is no way theyll keep me as a messenger and eltand boy ashore after this if im not at sea within a week theres a dozen of good claret for you and ashburn on it chapter you were fortunate mister lewrie commander the honorable tobias treghues said seated behind his glossy mahogany desk in the day cabins of the gun frigate desperate i am told the officers of the th foot detachment have talked of a syndicate to challenge you one at a time until you are bested they were not enamored of your choice of weapons or how you won aye aye sir lewrie said studying his new lord and master treghues was in his late twenties slim and brownhaired with grey eyes his uniform was impeccable as were his cabin furnishings he showed no signs of poverty though it had been rumored he was the eldest son of a lord gone to sea to improve the family fortunes with prizes fortunate also that i had a suitable berth after losing one young gentleman drowned and another to the bottle treghues went on aye aye sir when a midshipman had no better answer that usually struck the right obedient note without committing to anything you are for your own safety to remain aboard until we have sailed you are not even to place foot in a rowing boat by the time we return itom a cruising patrol the th will have gone to st kitts and the problem will have been resolved aye aye sir lewrie said trying to find a new way to do it i do not hold with dueling treghues warned or hotheaded bucks who cannot resist taking offense at the slightest reproach like some swaggering frog duke mister lewrie usually bad officers too i do not wish to give that impression sir but i had treghues waved off the rest of his answer spare me your innocent and honorable motives sir onsley informed me as to the circumstance he also gives you a glowing report so i am aware of your services to the crown oflate you may be useful to this ship but all i want to see from you is duty done in a cheerful and efficient manner spare us your bloodlust for the foe aye aye sir lewrie parroted himself admiral sir george rodney has taken over from admiral byron thanks be to god so we should see some action sood hood and rodney together and well see an end to these french and spanish combinations so you see what is needed get below and into your working rig i allow you to forgo the waistcoat in these climes but i expect a midshipman to like a proper officer at all times no matter how junior you may be that means a regulation dirk instead of that pretty hanger of yours and i prefer a cocked hat to the round one i took you on sufferancedont give me reason to regret it lewrie nodded and left the cabins emerging on the upper deck desperate had no poop but a long quarterdeck over the captains cabin her first and only lieutenant had quarters below the captain with the surgeon purser marine lieutenant and suchlike worthies the wheel stood over the captains cabins on the long quarterdeck unprotected by binnacle bulwarks the lower deck was not a gun deck at all the artillery being sited on the upper deck where the captain lived in solitary splendor hands berthed forward on the lower deck then petty officers marines warrants and midshipmen and then the offi cers gun room right aft the orlop and hold were too crammed with supplies to let anyone berth there what a crosspatch he is lewrie sighed from the way treghues regarded rodney he must be one of hisnot a good sign rodney was famed for incredibly bad judgement in appointments but the cobbing he had received could not dampen his joy to be aboard any sort of ship once more and desperate was magnificent she was feet on the range of the lower deck a bit over in beam of tons burthen piercing her upper deck bulwarks were eighteen sixpounder cannon with two of the new eighteenpounder carronades on her focsl short guns mounted on swivelling slides that fired bursting shot to no great rangesmashershe was dying to try them out desperate carried treghues a first lieutenant named railsford mr monk the sailing master and two mates one bosun and mate one warrant gunner one gunners mate and a yeoman of the powder room a surgeon named dome and a mate five quartergunners one carpenter and mate one armorer one masteratarms two quartermasters and mates a yeoman of the sheets one coxswain four carpenters crew one ships corporal a sailmaker and one sailmakers assistant one captains clerk the young purser named cheatham and his steward four midshipmen four young boy fifers and drummers eighteen boyservants and fiftysix men rated as either ordinary or able seamen or landsmen she also carried marines a lieutenant named peck one sergeant one corporal and thirty private soldiers she was a th rate the smallest type of shiprigged frigate in the fleet and with lewrie joining her was fortunate to be only six hands short of full complement desperate was too light for the line of battle with her fourinch oak scantlings and beams on twentyinch centers she was too fast to be tied to a squadron but also too well armed to waste on despatches like parrot desperate was what was coming to be known as a croizer she was a huntress on her own in the most likely places to seek out take or burn enemy merchantmen privateers and light naval units lewrie entered the midshipmens berth to find his new mess mates lounging about the small compartment sandwiched in without air by storerooms and the mates dog boxes the total space was about twelvebyten with barely five feet of headroom between the beams there was a polished table down the center for dining chests for seats and pegs for storage of handy items hullo im alan lewrie he said to them reliving that scene long ago when he had reported below in ariadne but there was a difference he had nearly fifteen months in the navy and knew what sort of drudgery and folderol to expect now he was introduced to the others there was peter carey a gingerhaired boy of thirteen with the usual modest squirearchy background there was a gotchgutted sixteenyearold pig named francis forrester he was quick to point out that it was the honorable francis forrester and his elegant manners and bis drawling superior voice made it abundantly clear that he looked on lewries arrival as another mark of the reduction in tone of their mess lewries other companion was also sixteen a dark and merry cornish boy that lewrie had known slightly long before when posted to the ariadne after it had become a receiving ship he and david avery had gone roaming english harbor together and had enjoyed each others company before avery had joined an armed transport alan carefully removed and folded up his fine new uniform he packed the waistcoat away for sunday divisions slipped out of his snowy breeches and dug out a ragged pair of slop trousers he exchanged his silk stockings for cotton wrapped his best shoes and donned a cracked pair his worst faded and stained coat he hung up on a peg sadly he packed the hanger away in his open chest and fetched out his dirk now showing signs of wear around that best goldplate pommel pretty hanger forrester pouted like a sow picking it up and studying it but your parents should have known better it was a recent gift alan said meaning to get off to a fair start if allowed for saving my last captain his ship yess forrester drawled avery has been regaling us with the heroism of your derringdo he sheathed the hanger and tossed it into lewries chest like a poor discard at a secondhand shop did you really kill a man in a duel carey asked wideeyed yes dead as cold boiled mutton he insulted a young lady of my acquaintance alan boasted eventoned carey we must remember to tremble before the anger of our new manslaughtering hector forrester said even if he is by length of service junior to you how long at sea lewrie a year fifteen months total then i am still senior forrester said pleased to hear it june of were not lieutenants forrester avery replied i actually predate you by a whole month if the truth be known were all equal here ah the rebellious adamses and thomas paines have been after you again forrester said in a way that lewrie could only think of as greasy remember that i have the signals and you dont so that makes me senior and i trust that any new errant newlies shall remember that we had a man who said much the same thing in ariadne lewrie said taking a pew on his closed chest he died would be having the gall to threaten me forresters piggy eyes were squinted now why should i do a thing like that im but stating a fact you remember me mentioning him dont you avery oh you mean mister the honorable what was his name fotheringfop lewrie said ferdinand fotheringfop choked on his beef bones didnt he avery said no that was mister the honorable d arcy debloat and what pray did he die of avery was playing along to the great delight of young carey who was already stifling a grin fotheringfop was so elevated an individual with such an airy opinion of himself that his head swelled one morning at dawn quarters we tried to save him and got a gantline to him but he pulled the maint gallantfhast right out of her last seen drifting for panama crew did a little hornpipe of despair at his passing sad it was lewrie pretended to grieve forrester snorted at the foolishness and left the midshipmens berth for the upper deck while carey dared to laugh out loud and avery pronounced lewrie a fellow that would do what a fubsy crusty thing it is lewrie observed of their mess mate what does he expect us to do carry his scepter for him or just be his fags just a puffedup dilbelt avery shrugged probably afraid we know more than him and show him up before his lord and master fat pig carey said softly carey what were the other midshipmen like lewrie asked dodds was twenty or so but ive never seen anyone drink so much all the time the captain finally threw him out said hed never make an officer or live long enough to take the exam good relations to the captain lewrie probed i think he was a catercousin carey frowned the other montgomery he was real smart and nice he was a year older than me but he knew everything he got washed overboard in a gale last month north of st lucia he was my friend carey sniffled lewrie shared a look with avery they could imagine wht the mess had been like for carey with one raging sponge in his cups all the time the brutish forrester lording it over all tli others and only montgomery to shield the younger boy carey gave no sign that he was a mental giant or in any way assertive just a scared and homesick child mediocre at be when it came to duty and too small and weak to perform like a real sailor well theres a new order here by god avery told hin with a rap on the shoulder just let the cowarse try to push hi weight around of which he has considerable lewrie added aye and well fix him avery said right lewrie amen to that lewrie intoned with mock piety you cant go too far though carey said i mean treghues and forrester theyre not related but youd think forrester was his brother plays the favorite does your captain i shouldnt say it but hc a wonderful berth avery sighed and i thought that rotten armed transport was bad hell with it lewrie said i hear shes made her people a pot of prize money and she goes her own way looking for fame and fortune were in the right place now all we have to do is to convince our captain that were the right midshipmen for him that shouldnt be too hard avery said here lewrie you wouldnt have a neckcloth that would pass divisions have you just before departure mail came aboard and lewrie was surprised to have two packets sir hugo was actually living up to his end of the bargain and had sent him a rouleau of one hundred guineas well actually the solicitor mr pilchard had sent it there was no letter attached and that was no disappointment but the money was most welcome the next was from lucy beauman he had been isolated aboard ariadne following the duel then rapidly transferred to desperate and had not been allowed to see her though he had sent her a letter that he was not sure her aunt and uncle would allow her to see there was belated fear for his life wonderment at his courage a recital of prayers said for him a brief screed against wyndham who had not struck her as a trustworthy gentleman a denial that she had encouraged him in the slightest manner which lewrie doubted she was a girl wasnt she profound relief at his victory and survival deep despair at being denied his presence grief and tears at their cruel separation but more prayers for success at his new endeavors in desperate and fond hopes of a quick reunion she enclosed an embroidered handkerchief for him scented and splashed with her tears binding up a generous lock of her honey gold hair there was also old isaacs completed juju bag which he wa to hang about his neck immediately and never remove lewrie was leery as to that instruction the bag had a redolence of badly cured goat skin tidal effluvia and perhaps the slight admixture of chicken guts she wrote i shall wate with constant longing for your safe retem that we may avale ourselves once more of that mutuol pleasure in our companyunship and may agane strole without cares on that particular strand i have cumm to regard as a most blesed and speshul place awl my fondness goe with you lucy someone should teach the little mort to spell he thought but was touched by her sentiments and by her evident love for him he took time to pen her a proper but passionate reply the sort that would turn a young girls head for a while as a fillip he enclosed a lock of his own hair still fairly short then it was time to sail admiral rodney had plugged one hole in the dyke against fill the supplies from europe that reached the rebellious colorues by taking the island of st eustatius a major smuggling and transshipment port for naval and military stores and a convenient outlet for american produce and manufactured goods with which they partly paid for all the french spanish and dutch largesse by keeping the expected flags flying and with secret recognition signals rodney kept the island open luring in ships tlllit had no chance to be apprised of the change of ownership it was resulting in scores of captures desperate was sent north with a roving commission to huilt down ships hoping to use st eustatius barely ten days after coming aboard lewrie emerged do deck one fine brisk morning sated with a good breakfast of thinsliced fried pork boiled egg and crumbled biscuit in treacle he was still smacking his lips and regretting not being able tb enjoy a second cup of coffee when the lookout gave a loud hail to the deck below ending any thoughts of sail drill for thb forenoon watch sail ho he bellowed three points off the larboard bow lieutenant railsford chose avery to dash aloft to confirnl the sighting and avery handed lewrie his hat brushed bact his black hair and ran for the mainmast crosstrees treghues came on deck in breeches and waistcoat and went to the wheel waiting for a report peck the gangly young blond marine officer came up eager for action two sail sir avery said schooner and brig headed due north under all plain sail mister monk treghues called alter course to chase and we shall crack on all sail she can stand stunsls too bosun their stocky dark sailing master relayed all hands aloft and make sail trice up and layout for stunsls the single night reef in the courses and topsls was shaken out and lewrie went aloft to the t gallant mast as the yards were raised up by the jears below him on the main course yard hands were extending the stunsl booms bending on canvas to spread every stitch their ship could fly desperate leaned her shoulder firmly to the sea and began to soar across the modemte seas smashing into the odd wave but slicing clean through the regular set of rollers her wake boiling by ten in the forenoon she had run the schooner hullup before her and the brig beyond showed all her sail plan clearly they were overtaking handily which suggested ships too heavily loaded to run desperate was already towing one boat and put another down to be ready with boarding parties lewrie hoped that he would be entrusted with one of those parties just after cleardeckandupspirits at seven bells of the forenoon they beat to quarters and manned their guns lunch would be delayed but with the prospect of prizes ahead no one minded treghues had gone below to catch up on paperwork with his clerk interview the purser and pretend that there was nothing to get excited about while lewrie fretted and stewed in impatience and when their captain did emerge he was cioseshaved dressed in a good coat and cocked hat his small sword hung justso from his belt frog when they had the schooner within range of a sixpounder just about six cables off she took one look and raised her rebel colors to satisfy honor then quickly hauled them down and rounded to into the wind mr feather a burly masters mate and midshipman forrester went over in the first cutter to take charge of her with ten hands good man forrester treghues commented to railsford by the quarterdeck nettings hell keep our prize safe aye sir railsford agreed dutifully but without much enthusiasm lewrie stood close by and heard this exchange and weighed it for what he thought it was worth in his short time aboard he had found that young forrester had a reputation much like rolston in ariadne when it carne to discipline and tautness then they were off again in pursuit of the brig treghues ordered standeasy for the gun crews but unlike old bales he had had the ship properly cleared for action though their chase might be a mere smuggler and not a privateer or warship he was taking no chances and lewrie approved their captured schooner fell in lineastern far back so loaded she was barely able to stay in sight water and cheese and biscuit was brought up to the gun crews as they stood easy for a cold dinner with the galleyfire extinguished lewrie stood in the waist of the ship by the main mast idling on the jear bitts and chewing his dry dinner the cheese was a navyissue suffolk more like crumbling rock than cheese giving up on making a meal on it he brushed his hands and stood on the jear bitts for a better view the brig was now well hullup perhaps a league off and still being overhauled lewrie imagined that she was badly laden besides being heavily loaded her bow seemed to slough and make a large wave even with her forecourse spread taut for its lifting effect had her bow ridden higher lessening her resistance she might have made a knot more and as low in the water as she looked her shallower draft would be of no avail in the maze of islands ahead to the nornor west where she could normally expect to lose the frigate with her deeper draft got a good view mister lewrie treghues asked hands behind his back and staring up at him as he paced the gun deck to inspect his hands aye sir lewrie climbed down to doff his hat learning anything aye sir she draws a foot deeper forrard lewrie said hell have to shift a pair of guns or some cargo or hes ours before two hours pass indeed treghues said shocked to hear such talk from a midshipman but he can always get a favorable slant of wind get into those islands aye he could sir lewrie persisted but the trades hereabouts drop off around the first dog sir and hes too deep to risk shoal water were balanced more sail aloft and have a longer waterline alan vowed preening a bit so you are confident treghues smiled using the moment to put life into his crew that i am sir well have him lads our new midshipman believes so so we must eh a little more gold in your pockets would not go amiss treghues passed on to trade joshes with the quartergunners mostly of the squiretotenant how do your sheep keep old un variety with the expected reply of bright smiles and much tugging of forelocks leaving lewrie abashed he had tried to make a good impression on the captain concerning his skill and nautical knowledge so that he would think of him as competent and equal to forrester but now he was the silent butt of the crews humor goddamn him lewrie fumed busying himself with looking at train tackles i didnt deserve that before another hour had passed the brig wore to larboard slightly and opened fire at extreme long range with a sixpounder gun the ball dropping far short but good evidence of her intent to fight id get the stunsls in lewrie thought peering aloft if i were the chase id wear hard onto the wind lay her fullandby to the nor east and beat up toward st barts maybe gain a league before we got ourselves sorted out a molly or not he had to give lieutenant kenyon credit for a superb education in shiphandling and how to draw out a stern chase as they had once off anegada pursued by that privateer bosun hands aloft and take in stunsls treghues called mr gwynn stand by to try your eye with the number one gun desperate turned off the wind as master gunner gwynn fussed over his foremost starboard cannon once the quoin was out and he was satisfied he put up his fist and stood clear looking aft treghues must have waved to him because the linstock came down to the firing quill in the vent and the gun lurched inboard with a flat bang the ball splashed short but directlylin line with the brigs bowsprit the brig responded with a full broadside of six guns aimed high lewrie could hear the smt as it moaned overhead through the rigging a sail twitched a d a block and halyard snaked down to thud onto the larboard gangway stand by the starboard battery alan looked aloft again the stuns i booms were still rigged out though the sails were mostly furled now would be time to wear he thought grimly and this broadside will be wasted its nearly five cables range anyway this is just wht they want of us as you bear fire treghues shouted the guns began to belch and roll back to the extent of the breeching ropes and the welldrilled crews leaped on them tq sponge out to clear the vents and begin ramming down fresh powder and shot thought so lewrie told himself the smuggler brig had hardened up her braces and sheets and was wheeling to present her stem to them wearing through at least ninety degrees to the nor east goddamn and blast the bugger monk called out as though he had just had his purse cut loose and treghues chafed him for blaspheming hands to train and sidetackles lewrie shouted snug em down tight and prepare to come about a second later that same command was shouted to them from railsford on the quarterdeck waisters ran to the braces to cast them off the delaying pins while the forecastle captain prepared to heave on his headsl sheets but they had to wait until the men aloft had laid in from the yards after securing the stuns is and the brig dewey lmnbdm was gaining time to windward no matter how the officers aft shouted for the topmen to speed their work hands wear ship came finally put yer helm down haul you people haul the bosun roared vast hauling and belay desperate turned up into the wind as steady as a needle on a pin and settled on her new course the chase was still on her starboard side now settled just over their windward cathead and had regained at least half a league of distance on them it would take the frigate at least two more hours to beat up to windward against that more weatherly brig at which point it would be near the start of the first dog watch gun crews stand easy lewrie climbed onto the jear bitts once more to look to the suthrd for their first prize if forrester had two brain cells to rub together he would wear onto the wind now as soon as he saw what was happening a schooner even a loaded one could go to windward much better than either the brig or desperate could cut the comer off and with even one gun manned could threaten their chase into heading north once more there was no sign that forrester had the requisite number of brain cells for she plodded along for long minutes on her original course a signal went up desperates mizzen which went unseen blind fucker lewrie muttered just loud enough for the nearest hands to hear hell not stand a chance now by the time the schooner came about she was not just downwind of the chase but downwind of desperate as well desperate stood on for three hours before coming within range once more the captain of the brig must have been a nacky man himself because he hauled his wind to head due north and as soon as desperate began to parallel her course and open fire once again he tacked this time crossing the eye of the wind he ducked out of the way of the broadside and headed off into the gloom of late afternoon to the sousou east back the way he had come forrester stood no chance even to get close and the brig was not as unhandy on the wind as lewrie had thought for she pulled up half a point higher than the frigate and was actually very slowly drawing away the hands were stood down from quarters and the galley fire was lit lewrie looked at his watch it would be dusk in fortyfive minutes they would stand to evening quarters then without a prize this evening lewrie was in what was left of the second dog watch so he left the gun deck and went up to the quarterdeck to stand by the wheel where monk and treghues and railsford were confening still so confident mister lewrie treghues said irritably he was mighty crafty sir lewrie replied searching for something safe to say to a captain who was livid inside most likely a jonathan captain what makes you think that the french and the dons dont handle ships that well sir he may have been dutch but i doubt it americanbuilt brig with a rebel captain she was smartly handled sir next thing you know mister lewrie shall be giving us lessons in shiphandjing treghues said jesus lord i would not presume sir dont take that tone with me young sir or ill have you bent over a gun before you can say jack ketch aye aye sir get off my quarterdeck im in the watch sir alan quailed then get down to loord and out of my face aye aye sir welcome back to the real navy lewrie thought gazing off to the north as it got darker there was a spectacular sunset astern all reds and golds and layers of clouds painted pink and amber and blue grey and the seas were bright as glittering rubies at least he could appreciate that without harm lewrie idled his time until evening quarters thinking about that brig she would most likely run to windward until after full dark then come about north once more probably wear on a reciprocal course because she did not want to get tangled up with the inshore patrols near st barts and st maartin she could go due north outside the island chain she could not set westthat would take her back into the anns of desperate and the prize schooner and on the map engraved in his head lewrie saw the saba bank no she would turn norwest and run the gap for the other smugglers holes in the danish virgins st croix as the best bet spanish puerto rico if she was set to westerly lewrie was not sure what commander tobias treghues had planned but he knew where he would have waited to find her again but then nobody was asking him about it were they if he could not dazzle his new ship with his brilliance he could at least succeed at appearing competent and that was what he did in the weeks of cruising that followed he requested that railsford let him assist in small arms he let it be known at lunch to the captains clerk that he had assisted an acting purser and had worked in the english harbor stores warehouses he chatted with mr gwynn and dropped a hint that he loved artillery and the great guns at navigation practice with his new sextant thanks to lord cantners reward he displayed to the sailing master his skills naturally and mister monk let it be known that he was a dabhand at navigating in the course of his endeavor he casually revealed that lieutenant kenyon had let him stand middle watch with a bosuns mate and that he had filled in as an acting masters mate in parrot during her time with fever to each of these worthies he also showed a false front that of a young man lately run to death by duties and happy to be once more a junior petty officer with no major responsibilities having been in the navy long enough to know how hatefully any senior warrant or commission officer regarded idle hands and knowing that when a midshipman was working some officer was well pleased and cannily understanding the perverse nature of his fellow man alan soon found himself exactly where he wanted to be he assisted the masteratanns and marine lieutenant at small anns he assisted mr cheatham with the ships books and expense ledgers he and the gunners mate and yeoman of the powder room became coequal authorities on the upkeep of the great guns and all their ancillary gear avery found his niches as well and they drilled young carey in terminology and lore until he could spout technical lingo with the ease of a bosun twenty years at sea carey also learned how to curse most wondrouswell it must be said as the weeks went by treghues and railsford learned that there was indeed a new order aboardmidshipmen who were useful instead of the usual snotnosed younkersintraining they had grown accustomed to there was less snarling from treghues in fact there was a grudging acceptance then a secret delight in having thoroughly salted and tarred midshipmen who could be trusted to carry out an order smartly forrester however began to pout more to purse his lips and squint his porcine eyes and curse them roundly he was being threatened and he knew it dh he still had captain treghues favor since he had long been the mans star pupil and their families were obviously catercousins he was one of the original crew when desperate was commissioned and it would take an act of incredible stupidity or craven cowardice to break that bond but when it came to something prestigious to do his name was no longer the first on treghues lips nor could he hold his superior social position in their mess because if he struck out at carey he had avery and lewrie to contend with and he could not push his weight around with either of them he did try but avery was a most inventive fellow when it came to filling the young mans shoes with molasses during the night nailing his chest shut when he was on deck starting small rips in his hammock with a shaving razor that would tear open and leave his wide arse hanging out in the air by the start of the morning watch substituting smaller sizes of slop trousers so that forrester had to appear on deck with a distinctly pinched look about the middle with all of them on deck during the day at exercises and drills forrester found it hard to respond with his own brand of trickery since they all watched him close in a cabal sworn and dedicated to drive him to distraction lewrie was a little more direct when forrester was caught trying to sabotage averys chest one morning lewrie simply told him that if he caught him at it again he would kick him in the balls and when he caught him trying to open his own chest the next day alan made good on his threat which made forrester crouch for a week after the loss of the smuggler brig desperate made up for it there were still dozens of islands engaged in illicit trade and hundreds of ships crossing the atlantic on the trades not a fortnight went by that they did not send a prize crew into port with the red ensign flying over the striped colors of the rebels the flag of spain or the golden lilies of france their prizes were smallbrigs and snows brigantines and schooners luggers and cutters but the value of the cargoes and bottoms lost to the american rebellion mounted steadily powder shot carriage guns stands of arms crates of swords and uniforms blankets and camp gear for washingtons armyrice pitch spars indigo molasses and rum logwood and bales of cottonit all piled up in admiralty prize courts warehouses in british hands to lewrie it was as much like a legal form of piracy as any he had ever read about with not the slightest idea that he would ever be involved piracy with the right to have a bank account and while article eight of the articles of war specifically stated that all contents of a seized ship were property of the admiralty desperate could continually feed herself on casks of saltmeat condemned as unfit firewood water coffee and cabin stores from the officers messes split flour sacks ratinfested bread bags crates of wine that no one thought to list in the prize manifests livestock that had died spare cordage and sailcloth and yards and spars everything they needed to continue cruising they ate well they drank well and they maintained their ship in prime condition at their enemies expense and the prize money piled up for eventual payout after two months desperate was becoming seriously undermanned for fighting much less for working the ship one at a time she had been forced to part with quartermasters and mates bosuns mates both masters mates half a dozen hands into this prize ten into that one until all the midshipmen including carey had been called to stand a deck watch with no supervision the turnover in an active frigate that spent so much time on the prowl and had had such good luck with prizes was nearly fifty percent a year but it made grand chances for able men able seamen constantly rose to more demanding acting positions and they could always hope that the man they replaced was not languishing ashore waiting to be recalled but had been appointed into another ship leaving them the possession of their new berth and extra pay the man sent off could not expect to return to his own ship and stood a good chance of rising in the service in a new vessel but perversely they usually preferred to return desperate and her ways were a known quality with a firm but fair captain and for the most part decent officers who knew what the next ship would be like finally desperate was forced to put about and head for antigua as miserly manned as the seediest merchantman with a skinflint for a master there was more bustle in english harbor when desperate arrived admiral hood and his flagship barjleur along with his fleet of larger ships of the line filled the outer roads and the port worked alive with rowing boats and supply ships treghues was rowed over to glatton to report to admiral matthews and then was taken to barjleur to dine forrester accompanied him to everyones disgust while lewrie and avery were handed the cutter and the pinnace and told to start heading for the inner harbor it was promising to see that all their prizes had arrived safe anchored in a huddle of shipping far out of the way that meant that there should be a share out of prize money soon maybe not the whole sum due each man but enough pounds and shillings to make his life a little interesting buy him a woman some liquid refreshment new slop clothing tobacco shares in some fresh meat or imported delicacies or payoff his outstanding account with the purser who could loan money against future pay for slop purchases lewrie was also happy to note that at least half of desperates missing people were still ashore waiting her arrival happy that her most capable mates and inferior petty officers and able seamen were available once more the ship would not be deprived of their experience any longer it was something of an embarrassing shock to see how happy their sojourners were to see him he had thought they would be glad to be back aboard among their own mates but here they were making much of the sight of him they sounded genuinely pleased to say hello to him and asked him joshing questions about those who had remained behind how things stood with their acting replacements was a certain ships boy bearing up and behaving had a piece of gear been overhauled in their absence had the goat foaled yet asking him bow be kept and had he and mister avery been looking after carey abusing forrester and bragging about what they bad done in tbeir free time ashore i dont know these people that well lewrie thought at a loss to explain the seeming affection from people in his subdivision his watch i know names and faces who works and who hangs back maybe ive gotten some of them a rating and they think im due i havent tried to be popular dont tell me they have any real love for me he tried to be cynical about it but it was touching au the same running another delusion about the navy squarely on the rocks he had to admit that for the most part they were good men able and well trained but not the sort hed have in for a joint and a bottle and a yam if he were back home in london pressed or volunteer one could no longer tell but then he wasnt back home was he lewrie soon gave up wondering about it as desperate restocked while the dockyard supplied most of the labor steady men were picked to help out for extra pay in ferrying out fresh food and replacements for their depleted stores of bread spirits and consumables lewrie took dr dome and mr cbeatham ashore to select several bullocks for fresh meat while desperate was in port along with fresh flour raisins sugar and fixings for plenty of figgydowdys or duffs dome was also to make sure that cheatham purchased cases of fresh hardskinned acid fruit commander treghues was of the opinion that the rob of lemons limes and oranges had been the best antiscorbutic the late captain cook had found against scurvy on his worldwide voyages dr dome clung to the theory that bad air from the bilges caused scurvy had the rate of the disease dropped once hales patent ventilators had been installed to air the spaces below the waterline yes it had but dome was not about to question a commanders decision dr dome was an untidy man though fussy about his appearance and was one of the few men lewrie had seen who wore a wig in the tropics as a matter of course perhaps because he was vain about going bald he was never seen without his horsehair appliance but he was considered a good surgeon able to take off a limb in seconds never causing unnecessary pain in the process though hed had little call for his skills so far he could lance a boil tend to rope burns fit a truss provide ointment for saltwater rashes and swore his fifteenshilling mercury cure for the pox was devilish fine he was also an easy touch for a latenight drink or a good book to read cheatham the purser was a real puzzle first of all why should someone leave the kentish fruit trade for the uncertain life of the sea where the profit margins were so low on issued stores where any cheating beyond the victualing boards fourteen ounces to the pound would be noticed by the men and complained about right smartly even slops at twelve percent profit could not sustain him and lewrie had yet to find him listing discharged men as big users of tobacco or sundry other items yet cheatham always smiled had no more complaints than most and his books balanced nicely he had a lay somewhere that was paying handsomely or he had a wish to die poor only time would tell the truth lewrie came back aboard littered with chicken feathers after ferrying the last major items on the gun rooms shopping lists and was told to wash up and muster aft in the captains cabins at the beginning of the first dog watch he was welcomed in by the officers and senior warrants commander treghues servant was circulating with claret and pouring liberally gentlemen i have summoned you aft to announce some good fortune that has come our way treghues began glass in hand good fortune for every hand every manjack railsford sat nearby already in on the secret and smiling at his ease for once now that the ship was anchored and nothing could go wrong to upset a first lieutenants peacefor a while at least admiral sir onsley matthews has informed me that the admiralty prize court has made a determination on some of our recent prizes in their infinite wisdom they have found time for our tawdry little affairs instead of dealing exclusively with admiral rodney and st eustatius bloody hell quit being coy and get on with it lewrie had noticed that treghues loved the sound of his own voice and wit since april we have taken two brigs a brigantine two schooners and two local sloops in these waters that does oot count our latest two prizes treghues went on to enumerate all the various war supplies denied the rebels all the outwardbound products until lewrie was ready to scream my agent informs me treghues said with the slightest glance to his right which lewrie spotted it was cheatham he was the prize agent there was five percent total in it for him no wonder he smiled all the time we have amassed a total of ј shillings pence and we shall receive a partial payout tomorrow in gold the tumult which resulted would have raised the hair of mohawk indians and lewrie was sure that the full news was already circulating on the lower deck barely before the words had drawled out oftreghues mouth sir onsley would get an eighth twoeighths would go to treghues the officersrailsford lieutenant peck mr monk dr dome and cheathamsplit an eighth the senior warrants masters mates and admiral matthews secretary split an eighth the midshipmen petty officers quartermasters and their mates the bosuns mate and a few others took an eighth and the rest of the crew received the final twoeighths lewrie did some rapid calculations he would get a little over seventytwo pounds more than a lieutenant made in a st rate ship of the line for a years work naturally he would not see ten pounds of it in real money but it was welcome now theres going to be about three pounds per man paid out in coin and the rest in certificates i want you all to warn your men in your watches and divisions to watch out for the sharks wholl try to buy them out for twenty percent in ready money treghues warned i believe therell be some few who have allotment papers on the books wholl want it forwarded all or in part to their parents or families were anchored far enough out to prevent someone going out a gun port and antigua is an island after all each of you pick out the men most likely to run and let the rest go ashore for a twoday leave mister lewrie you have a good copperplate hand see my clerk and begin writing out blank leavetickets mind you any man who runs or overstays his leave ruins it for the rest of his subdivision or watch and ill have him run the gauntlet when hes fetched back aboard i want to see liberty lists tomorrow in the forenoon another idea foundered lewrie thought amazed at what he learned from treghues for all his coyness and preachifying no one had talked to him of leave he assumed the men stayed aboard from the beginning of the commission tit the ship paid off without a chance to go ashore except in a supervised working party but if the man was owed back pay and prize money it made sense to let him have his fun ashore especially on an island how could he walk away from two years wages and enough in prizecertificates to set him up for life and the crew had been together for a long while they were used to each other less eager to change their situation for something new how much had poor harrison sacrificed back there in portsmouth when he took legbail and ran inland with his skinny little wife admiral matthews also informs me that whatever we lack in manpower shall be made good at his personal selection treghues told them after they had calmed down from the momentous news this is quite an honor for us to receive possibly the last people personally spoken for by our squadron admiral before he hauls down his flag what lewrie thought almost choking on treghues excellent claret hauling down his flag how soon god there goes my one source of interest in the west indies now what the hells going to happen to me he had been in the fleet long enough to know that petticoat influence in london did not count for that muchcivilians could not get into naval affairs petticoat influence was only good when the petticoats controjied naval influence officers normally gathered to them in their ships and in their squadrons and fleets and staffs men they could count on from able seamen to postcaptains and were judged by how wisely they chose proteges to sponsor and promote and aid throughout their careers they also expected others of their close acquaintance to aid their followers and were prepared to aid followers of others in a fair swap of interest there was only one requirement that never variedyou could not advance a total fool for the abiding needs of the navy came first last and always and it took a certain political skill to play the game right admiral rodney did not had recommended poor choices and promoted unprepared people when in command of foreign stations beyond the immediate reach of whitehall abusing the system angering friends do you need some water mister lewrie tregbues asked no thankee sir i was already spending my share on a very tasty meal lewrie coughed got carried away eh remember to swallow first thats always the way a midshipmans stomach controls his brains and then theres all hell to pay treghues chuckled lewrie did not in the least feel like smiling but it was a social occasion and he had to show a civil face so he grinned sheepishly which was what midshipmen were good at was what treghues expected from his young gentlemen do you know how soon sir ansley will be going home sir alan had to enquire his replacement sir george sinclair is purported to be on his way already sir ansley and lady maude have been most kind to me sir i shall miss him came as a shock alan sighed treghues nodded remembering that lewrie himself was one of sir ansleys followers then you shall be relieved to know that sir ansley shall be appointed to the admiralty board upon his return to london treghues said handing him the tacit reassurance that the admiral could still look out for him even thousands of miles away there is also a scheme that admiral rodney wished to put into action regarding these socalled neutral islands treghues informed his gathering i cannot reveal any details as of yet but you can be sure that desperate shall playa part in it and it may promise to be a most rewarding part for the public good and our private gain once desperate began to let her people ashore in manageable batches for shore leave mr monk and the bosun discovered a healthy crop of underwater growth on her bottom she should have put to sea immediately once her people were back inboard but it was thought a good opportunity to bream her this involved everyone in nearly a week of heavy labor hoisting out all her guns powder and shot beef and pork barrels striking her masts down to maintops and gantlines and warping her into the inner harbor where she was careened at low tide on a sand bank so the dock workers could bum and scour her bottom clean then coat her with a mix of sulfur tallow and pitch to retard future marine growth while she was empty the carpenter and his crew inspected her for rot in her bilges and belowwater beams and keel members she was pronounced healthy for at least another year in the tropics where any proud ship could be eaten down to hollow kindling once the teredo worms got to her with nearly a knot and a half restored to her best speed they floated her upright and began to reload her they had just begun to hoist topmasts once she was back at her moorings when the days work was interrupted by the sound of a salute being fired lewrie went up the shrouds with a glass eager for a chance to take a breather and watched a handsome thirtytwogun frigate ghosting into harbor firing a salute to hood and the forts at her mizzen truck she flew a broad pendant the sign of a commodore or rear admiral so thats our new commodore lewrie said half to himself we wont sail right away not if matthews will be hauling down his flag we shall all want to get to know the new man it was a farewell ball for sir ansley and lady maude and the introductory social event for commodore sir george sinclair tbe harbor gleamed in another of those splendid west indies sunsets that alan had come to enjoy so much though there was not a breath of wind and the summer evening was close hot and humid by the time their party from desperate had climbed the hill road on foot to admiralty house their shirts and waistcoats were glued to them by sweat fortunately there was like a topsl breeze a cooling breath of the trades once atop the hill and servants offered towels so they could mop themselves down admiral hood was present standing tall and slim and beaky over the normalsized guests surrounded by a set of admirers sir ansley and lady maude were off in a comer with less of a coterie he was now only a halfpay rear admiral of the red and sycophants no longer had to be quite so attentive the crowd had transferred their attention to the newest officer by the buffets eager to get a first look at their new commodore that was where the dockyard superintendent the master attendant and the prize court agents lurked and simpered admiral rodney had gone home with his fabulous prize fieet so treghues had to settle for lesser lights and led them first to sir ansley their former admiral looked even fatter than ever everstrangling in a neckcloth too tight for him and lady maude had chosen a bilious purpleandgrey satin sackgown a poor comparison to her complexion if it werent for sir sleys uniform they would have looked like servants sir oosley lady maude your servant sir oh alan lewrie lady maude said my they feed you well in desperate you must have grown another inch since we saw you last we have been living quite well for a cruiser lady maude mister lewrie sir ansley said offering his hand you are looking bristol fashion i must say thank you sir onsley i i was most distressed to hear you and lady maude would be going back to england lewrie began trying to make his prepared speech sound natural may i say that i shall always be grateful for your and lady maudes many kindnesses and considerations i hope your voyage is tranquil and your next post rewarding thankee mister lewrie most kind sir onsley said ill miss the islands damme if wont but you have to make way for younger men i am certain the islands shall miss you too sir onsley im sure i speak for many who served under you he smiled yes theyll miss the sight of glarton sitting out there like the pharos lewrie thought be odd not to have a sea command after all these years sir onsley maundered on now well into his wine cups sir george sinclair would have to be a most impressive officer to replace you sir or match our record of success in reducing the number of privateers and all lewrie said wondering if he really knew when to stop toadying before even sir onsley noticed we have stuck a dry bone in brother jonathans throat have we not sir onsley chuckled deadlazy or not sir onsley was going home rich as croesus from prize money reaped by his squadron only thing i regret is im going to miss the last act out here sir onsley said here walk with me and well have some wine boy do you know anything about degrasse something to eat lewrie thought no sir damn crafty frog admiral left brest back in the spring and he got down to martinique with a huge convoy and a fleet of lineofbattle ships sam hoods crossed swords with him once so far pretty much of a draw but hes here for a purpose and it wont be good when it comes met sam hood yet no sir then come with me and before lewrie knew it he was bowing to that worthy who looked down that long nose at him sir onsley bubbled on about lewries record and what ship he was in at present yes mister lewrie hood said with a meager smile believe i read something about ariadne knew bales long ago you know and it was parrot i believe before desperate aye sir lewrie said almost quivering with excitement the admiral had indeed actually heard something of him damn glad to meet you mister lewrie you keep up that sort of work hood told him before shifting his eyes away i shall sir lewrie promised allowing himself to be led off by sir onsley put in a word for you never hurts for him to remember what you look like sir onsley said now firmly playing naval politics he must have a thousand midshipmen but hell know you and youll be on the board at the admiralty giving advice and support to hood so hes amenable to a good relationship with you but at what price lewrie speculated sipping his wine noticing for the first time that it was champagne and as cold as mortal sin ah i see treghues has already found our new commodore sir onsley noted jutting his chin across the room to point at alans captain and a thin reedy stick of a man in a coat a bit too faded to be fashionable at a ball still it was laced as a captains coat but for the buttons set in threes sir george sinclair wore a tight periwig with close side curls emphasizing the skin as dark as any foredeck hand making those sharp eyes and downturned hook of a nose appear even more daunting a real taut hand is sinclair sir onsley continued put up his first broad pendant when the french came in in and was a real terror off bordeaux im told got knighted at quiberon bay in the last war and earned it three times over we are not close but i did have a chance to mention a few people by way of recommendation i do not think you would mind if sir george knew of my regard for you not at all sir your thoughtfulness at a time like this is i cannot find the words sir onsley it was heady stuff to be endorsed as able by a man who now had distant control over the officers he would be answering to in future lewrie had not thought to wonder how well regarded sir onsley was when it came to choosing followers but he had yet to hear that he was as inept as admiral rodney so it might be alright for his career dewey lambdin he felt success falling like a laurel wreath in some fever dream slow and catchable right into his outstretched hands he had won over captain bales had convinced kenyon of his abilityeven if kenyon was a molly alan stili respected his skills he had caught sir onsleys eye as a comer was well recommended to admiral hood another comer and now was most likely going to cap the evening by winning the same notice from his new admiral of the squadron why had he not joined the navy years ago so that he then could have been entered on ships books for six years there was a commission in the offing and he knew from asking questions of other midshipmen passed for lieutenant that he could make a fair showing at the exam sir hugo may have done me the greatest favor of my life by making me go to sea he realized but standing slightly behind and to one side of sir george sinclair was his flag captain someone lewrie had known under less auspicious circumstances and the laurel wreath of success was snatched out of his fingers he almost snapped the stem of his wineglass not now not him lewrie shivered good christ it was captain bevan the very officer who had dragged him from his fathers house captain bevan who knew enough of his background and the alleged reason for his banishment to ruin him forever captain bevan the man who had been his jailer in that damned postchaise to portsmouth and had shoved him into ariadne that would not be captain bevan with him sir onsley alan said ready to run or throw up or both aye his flag captain know him sir onsley asked weve met lewrie mumbled sinking in a bleak despair lewrie could not escape being led across the salon to commodore sinclairs circle up close the man had that predatory look that mrs hiiiwood possessed but lewrie felt he was not going to get the same sort of gentle treatment sir george sir onsley it was the sound of talons rustling heres another of your band off desperate midshipman alan lewrie sir ansley said proudly commodore sir george sinclair mr lewrie your servant sir george alan said summoning up what was left of his nerves and trying to look plucky and direct ah yes lewrie sir george smiled thinly which smile was as quickly gone ive heard of you another one of my promising lads sir george like your nephew treghues said when he puts his mind to it of course ha ha january of last year was it not mister lewrie sir george asked with a sniff the navy the rape the gordon riots what lewrie fumbled at such a surprising question aye sir january of is that your recollection bevan sir george asked his aide i remember it most distinctly sir george captain bevan said bestowing upon his chief a benign look then turning to face lewrie yes sir george intoned dryly poor old bales sir ansley and cmdr treghues were mystified by this exchange and lewrie rushed to sort things out for them captain bevan was the officer who obtained me my first berth in ariadne he was also kind enough to see me safely to portsmouth and helped me stock my kit i wish to extend to you my hearty thanks for doing so captain bevan i have learned so much in the navy first under captain bales in poor ariadne from sir onsley and now commander treghues i feel so grateful for your assistance in discovering my new career having had a bit of success and gaining so much knowledge has been an an inspiring experience not to mention uplifting they know im raving he told himself theyll get the leg irons first and then the poking sticks lewrie you can lie like a butchers dog oh you arsekissing vile wretch please god they eat this shit up like plum duff really sir george drawled drawing the word out like a rapier he is keen and a fast learner treghues said offhandedly not wanting to praise lewrie publicly now that sir george was reacting to him much as he would regard a drunken hand at the gratings well i shall keep my eye on him then sir george said with just the hint of a thaw but it wasnt the sort of smile that would give a man much cheer it reminded alan of a judge finding a new way to pronounce transportation for life after a full docket the interview died after that as lewrie stumbled off trying to find a graceful way to say goodbye to such an equivocal dismissal he chased down a servant and loaded up on wine fast the first went down in a rush and he began on the second merciful god in heaven he most miserably croaked i am so well and truly fucked ere you watch yer mouth around a lady ya dirty little navy guttersnipe a gentleman standing close enough to hear said as he shook his fist at him his wife stood by face pruned in pious outrage i am so sorry for disturbing your good lady sir lewrie said in surprise but thinking fast i have just had the most shocking news from home do forgive me but i was beyond all temperance oh sorry then funny way of showing grief the woman said griefs the fucking word for it he told himself he began to wander the salon nodding to everyone whether he knew them or not asking himself what he had done to bring down such a fate on himself he had studied hard he had worked hard he had almostbutnotquite come to tolerate the navy he was not even a threebottle man and hadnt had any mutton for months and could not understand why god could bring him so close to the edge of triumph and then dash him into the mud saving yourself for dinner lewrie treghues asked him on his third aimless circuit of the salon im sorry sir this isnt a drum treghues told him theres a sitdown meal coming are you halfseas over he scowled oh no sir im fine really slow down on the wine and go have a bite from the buffet or i shall send you back aboard ship and blast your supper and your dancing treghues told him not understanding what sir george had against lewrie but determined to find out aye aye sir i i shall join avery and forrester at the buffet sir they look to be having a fine time at the moment the buffet was groaning under a load of wonderfullooking and smelling food for snacking avery and forrester were tucking it in like famished dogs standing side by side and amiable for once in their greed slowly grazing down the tables if his nerves had not already suffered such a shock as to be terminal to his appetite the sight of forrester at trough would have done it anyway feeling that treghues was still watching him he joined them and took a plate and utensils spooning up the first thing handy with no regard for what it was do try some of this alan avery said some local kickshaw with honey and nuts on it could be rabbit forrester swears its partridge urn yes alan said after chewing a bite maybe duck what a palate forrester sneered saltpork is more to your style spreading yourself a bit broader than usual tonight francis he shot back youll be needing new breeches if you keep on loading cargo like that you are so unbelievably common lewrie david did you ever notice right after eating you cant understand a word he says keeping his cheeks full for later avery surmised sucks it right up like a washdeck pump alan said studying forrester closely but whatever does he do with the little bones not sure but it explains those low crunching noises in the middle of the night have your little laughs forrester said and then i shall have mine youll be allamort whatever did he mean by that lewrie wondered as forrester moved away from them i suppose he thinks hell be going into the flagship could we be so lucky lewrie asked feeling a ray of sunshine penetrating his gloom treghues and sinclair are as thick as thieves are they his uncle will take care of him avery hinted no lewrie said with a sudden chill forrester and sinclair avery was relentless i damn near cried sweet suffering god this is hellish lewrie whispered i am ruined you avery scoffed think he has any more love for me i was the one played so many pranks on him but he stands a good chance of being out of our lives heii be passed for lieutenant a lot quicker than us but then hes gone thank the good lord lewrie set his plate down and rubbed his forehead lost in a viselike agony trying to puzzle things out so they made sense desperate could be the post of honor he told david he might stay with us until a suitable big prize needed a master and he would go into her immediate promotion bought in at least a lieutenants command below the rates that makes me ill to contemplate or forrester could stay in desperate and i go to the flag where sir george hounds me to ruin because of forresters lies and what happened in london he thought gloomily but plenty of men go to sea under a cloud and as long as youre good at your job no one gives a groat what youve done before alright so sir george doesnt like methats no reason he would harm me what would it profit him oh god what else can go wrong alan he turned to see lucy beauman dressed in a new gown of pale pink satin with an undergown of white lace lots of ruched material on sleeves and bodice her own hair in ringlets instead of a wig all done up with flowers and maroon ribbons lucy how truly magnificent and beautiful you look oh alan she said taking his hands david coughed to break the spell excuse my manners david avery miss lucy beauman admiral sir onsley matthews niece lucy this is my shipmate midshipman david avery your servant maam david said making a graceful leg and dribbling food from his unattended plate behind him thank god for one good thing that has happened to me this evening alan thought happily flushing with pleasure at seeing her once more and aching with sudden longing as well every time he was reunited with her he found her more womanly more desirable more lovely if such a thing was possible alan mister avery i should like you to meet my father right thankee god alan almost said aloud your servant mister beauman sir phe beauman was squat as a toad crammed into a bright green velvet coat a longerskirted oldstyle waistcoat awash in silver brocade buff breeches and hose with calves as thick as tillerheads and the highroached elaborately curled bag wig he wore fairly screamed country of the worst huntin shootin ridin drinkin tenanttramplin doglovin view halloo variety this lovely girl is daughter to that alan couldnt accept it youre lewrie hey said mister beauman once they had both been bowed to heard a lot about you he has much in common with sir george alan thought unhappily he has heard of me i cannot imagine a more ghastly evening like a lad with gumption chopped that fella hey with good reason course i could not in good conscience let his remarks pass sir lewrie told him happy to hear that lucys father sounded approving of his duel nothing like defending a daughter to placate a daddy the less said about his scurrilous remarks the better though with the ladies present onsley sez yer a comer that so i am very grateful for sir onsleys and lady maudes good opinion mister beauman they are wonderful people aye thats so thats so mr beauman agreed snaking himself a glass of wine from the buffet and you come on business to antigua sir hell the matthewses are sailing for home lad the slave revolts been put down and portland bights healthier than antigua in the summer ive come to fetch lucy home i had not thought that far ahead about the consequences sir he said sharing a heartbreaking look of confirmation from lucy i am sure youre pleased to be able to receive her back into your family in safety and peace aye true beauman nodded heavily changing glasses for a full one bubbly frog trash got your juju bag yes sir i do sambo nonsense beauman sr chuckled still any lucks better than none hey does this man ever speak in complete sentences alan wondered they were interrupted by the dinner gong and the most important people began to pair off to file into the long dining rooms mister beauman if you are to fetch lucy home and i shall be sailing north in a few days this ball may be our last chance to converse for some time with your permission of course i should like to dance with your daughter me too avery said in a barely audible mutter behind him aye if shes willin beauman agreed there were farewell speeches about sir ansley welcoming speeches about sir george a word or two from admiral hood many toasts and much food with her father beside her lucy could not indulge in one of those longdistance romances of eyes and shrugs so lewrie had to content himself with his table companions and a damned dull lot they were the food he could barely taste and did little more than mangle what little he allowed on his plate his appetite was quite gone am i going to be ruined and if i am then what am i to do for a living i could stay in the navy but if this war ends ill have no chance of being retained and they dont give halfpay to midshipmen hell without sir ansleys help theres no way i can make my lieutenancy even as a commission sea officer id be turned out on the beach and halfpay is more like quarterpay its a joke but if i married lucy beauman id be a ledcaptain a poor relation but thats worth more than halfpay even worth more than a postcaptains command either way bless her shes the key to prosperity after the war after the ladies had retired but before the port got going he left the dining rooms to hunt up lucy he also badly needed coffee or tea he had eaten little and had taken on a bit too much drink he got his coffee dark and sweet the way he enjoyed it drank one cup scanning the salon for lucy then got another cup and went out on the veranda there she was taking the air with some other younger girls she left them quickly and came to him they went around the comer for privacy and once alone she buried her face in his shoulder and embraced him hungrily oh alan ive been so miserable and foolish i never thought id have to go back to jamaica and not see you again ive missed you too lucy and when i was told the admiral was hauling down his flag i wrote you so many letters did you get them we spoke no friendly ships the last two months alan explained did you get mine oh yes there was always some sailor showing up with a letter saying he had just come in with news from you i dont know how you managed it lucy beamed they were our crew that came in with a prize he explained finding it hard to believe that she had thought he could arrange his mail to be delivered whenever he wanted it maybe theres a good reason she cant spell maybe shes feebler than most women and now i shall never see you again she pouted i may sail to kingston again lucy we can still write each other and i intend to ask your father if i may have his leave to call upon you when we put into port oh alan she looked at him as if he had just invented gravity do you love me alan do you truly love me that much aye i do hold on here do i yes i must but maybe i dont how do you tell ive only been in lust shes such a beauty and what i know of her body is enough to make anyone mad with passion so she may not be bright as a man who expects her to be i love you alan she said squeezing him tight i have been in love with you since i first saw you all weak and ill when they brought you into aunties house oh i think i shall die with happiness tonight were not going that far just yet he thought your father has to allow me to call upon you oh father cannot deny us no one could be that cruel alan why must we wait i had thought we would wait until the war was over until you had become an officer but if we feel so strongly why do we not marry now her father will never go for that damn shell blow the gaff on me with her impatience and then goodbye security i cannot lucy theres my duty to the navy my oath to the crown and i doubt if your father will agree after just meeting me perhaps we should let him get used to the idea but alan many people marry in time of war but they dont look kindly on midshipmen doing it lieutenants perhaps right now the navy is the only life i have lucy and a right dirty one it is too he added to himself you shall have a life with me she said pouting in the darkness of the venmda somehow alan knew she was pouting once the war is over you owe the navy nothing if you wish a seafaring life my father owns many ships their captains take their wives on trading voyages to so many exciting places or we could have a fine plantation of our own thousands of acres to ourselves i have discovered the keys to heaven itself alan rejoiced as he held her close to him god to be a planter a trader with ships of my own and regiments of slaves and dear lucy to rattle every night of the week we could go back to london in triumph and then to hell with the navy with my family and anyone else i shall speak to your father but i beg you lucy dont be hasty let him consider me he has no reason to dislike me as of yet and sir onsley and lady maude can speak for me and at home you can bring him round how could he refuse his lovely daughter anything she desires once he has gotten used to the idea of me as a soninlaw alan cooed you are such a slyboots alan she said kissing him i am so proud of you so smart and clever i love you so much and i love you lucy he echoed did he mean it a little kissing her back now we must go back in before someone comments on us being alone together i would not give anyone the slightest reason to doubt your honor yes she said giving him one last hug i shall join auntie and try to compose myself and you will speak to father tonight i promise they kissed once more a lingering kiss full of promised passion to come before parting and making tiny adjusnnents to their dress he offered her his arm and they reentered the salon just as the men began to leave the dining rooms to join the ladies for coffee mr beauman spotted her right off and came across the room to join them a frown on his face lucy evidently knew that look from many years experience of his temper and chattered with him briefly before hurrying to her aunt missed you over the port lad mr beauman said wanted to get you alone for a while and have a chat veranda good for you aye sir the older man led him back out to the veranda alan retrieved his halfempty cup of coffee and sipped at it been gettin letters from lucy from her aunt bout you turned the lasss head good n proper i have become fond of your daughter mister beauman at first i was grateful for all her concern and care when i was ill but once i was well enough to get around and hold a real conversation with her well an you want to talk about somethin more than dandn with the lass beauman said i would be most honored if i could come calling on her sir in the event that i get to kingston the shit you say beauman barked aye sir lewrie winced shes barely turned seventeen i am aware of that sir what are you eighteen boy with a cambridge fortune just a midshipman an thosere twoapenny your brotherinlaw sir onsley must have told you i have prospects mister beauman its true im only a midshipman now but that is now not what i hope to accomplish got lands back home rents yer own beauman carried on you in line to inherit parents substantial people no sir onsley sez theres gossip ya had to join the navy to make somethin of yerself that true good god i really am fucked he nodded yes to that question not trusting himself to speak dont rightly hold that against ya lad beauman smiled had to come out to the indies to make a man of meself make my own way woulda gone to hell on my own back home but see this my way yer a pretty fella pretty enough to turn the girls poor head but yer not the solid type match id trust to keep her proper theres nothin goin to come of this sorry lad nothin personal i may not be ideal now sir but im not asking permission to marry tomorrow i mean to gain my commission first and there is the war still to be fought allow me to write her and to call if she finds someone more pleasing in the meantime then that is providence i would not press any sort of suit until i felt i could meet your standards as a suitor or doom her to a shabby life to suit my pleasure he lied desperately glib how often you think you might get to jamaica perhaps once a year sir at best hmm tell ya what you make somethin of yerself ill allow you to write and if you get to jamaica you can come callin but youll not be doin anythin to disturb the peace my family till say im satisfied with yer prospects give you my solemn word on that sir i know what hes thinking lewrie thought creampot love i or lucy will grow out of out of sight out of mind while he throws his sort of bachelor up to her he may not know it but were as good as engaged right now good enough beauman told him old onsleys right youve got bottom boy my advice to ya aye sir whoever ya end up married to never have daughters in take that to heart mister beauman alan smiled in relief may i go tell lucy the news aye run along lucy was glowing with delight at his report and lady maude was cooing and fanning herself in joy sir onsley frowned a lot said a bit how married officers were lost to the navy which got him a withering glare from lady maude which he had to splutter his way free of by reminding her that he was a postcaptain when theyd wed the rest of the evening was a glimpse of paradise itself for lucy told all her girl acquaintances they told all the young men at the ball and everyone assumed it was a much more formal arrangement than it really was older couples beamed at them foolishly and remarked on what a splendid couple they would be on his part alan completely forgot about his fears conceming captain bevan and sir george sinclair with lucy at his side they were no more than fleabites from a travelers bed nothing to get exercised about his future was assured once the war was over and the navy was little more than a slight aggravation to be borne until then once her father and lucy left alan had no more reason to stay at the ball so he visited the kitchens for a bundle of food to sate his nowroaring appetite the cooks and stewards remembered him from his previous stint of duty so he left with a substantial basket of goodies and two bottles of champagne this he and young carey who had stayed behind aboard devoured happily in the quiet darkness of their mess once in bed he was so busy thinking on his prospects that he was still awake two hours later when avery and forrester staggered to their hammocks tipsy and trying to shush each other like a pair of lamebrained housebreakers trying to smash through a wall without waking the houses owner they dropped their shoes dropped their chest lids clanked their dirks trying to find spare pegs giggled belched farted thumped into each other and apologized profusely hummed their favorite tunes slung their hammocks and tumbled out at least once with loud crashes and began to curse everything roundly carey found it so entertaining that he ended up shrieking with laughter at their bungling and once the mess area was filled by nothing but drunken snores alan still lay awake closer to contentment than he had been in two full years listening to the ship breathe around him and the watch bell up forward chiming the halfhour until he too drowsed off quite pleased with himself chapter passing the word for mister lewrie a marine sentry bawled alan was aloft with toliver one of the bosuns mates checking over the foret gallant mast after it had been hoisted into place to see if the standing rigging was set up properly he scrambled down to the gangway and jogged aft to answer the summons passing forrester on the way forrester grinned evilly at him as he passed and gave him a sniff that alan had come to know as a sign of complete satisfaction damme what does that baconfed thatchgallows know that i dont he wondered he looked too happy for my liking oh god is this when he starts getting his own back he instantly had visions of being transferred to the flagship and being triced up to a grating for daring to enter the navy or for offending sir george or forrester calling for me lewrie asked the sentry capn wants ta see yer sir aye thank you there was little he could do to make himself more presentable in a stained workingrig uniform he straightened his neckcloth tucked in his shirt so a large tar stain would not show and went below and aft to the passage to treghues cabins you wished to see me sir treghues was seated in his coach the dining space to starboard of his bed cabin he was having his breakfast neatly dressed freshly shaved and surrounded by goodquality furniture and plate his cabin servant bustled to pour him a second cup of coffee you may go judkin aye aye sir oh shit im in the quag now alan thought as the servant left closing the fragile door behind him i had a most distressing conversation with captain bevan and sir george about you last night lewrie treghues told him frowning over his beef and eggs is it true that you did not join the navy willingly aye sir alan said after a long moment i had heard talk of a young lady so i naturally thought it was a starcrossed affair but now i am told that you were banished before a magistrate could have you up on a charge of raping your own sister the prim treghues hissed thats thats not strictly true sir either it is or it isnt theres no such thing as halfrape boy any more than anyone can be halfpregnant is it true if you would let me try to explain sir its not a thing that is yes or alan equivocated i can only believe that some money changed hands for bevan to have allowed you to wear the kings coat treghues said i put that down to bevans cupidity too long in the impress service could ruin anyone and no doubt he must have lied to your first captain if not offered him money to take you on on your familys behalf captain bales was aware that i had been banished sir in my first interview he had a letter from our family solicitor mister pilchard and he didnt who are your people anyway sir hugo willoughby sir the one in st jamess treghues appeared to be shocked aye sir damme is father that infamous and youre his git no wonder youre such a black rogue thats sweet so they gave you a false name and foisted you off onto the first poor captain that was fitting out thats a wicked sort of business treghues scowled it was no false name sir sir hugo never married my mother elizabeth lewrie he adopted me but never really made me one of his he and lord sandwich and dashwood are all of a set hellfire club balum rancum bucks without the fear of god sacreligious bastards and they push you on me sir i must explain how dare you stand there fouling the uniform with your evil stink treghues ranted with prim outraged passion trailing your false colors and hoping to avoid the gibbet by joining the navy its all a lying packet sir alan said raising his voice dont you dare sass back to me ill have you flogged for it ive a good mind to do that anyway and send you in chains to the flag how else am i to get to say my side of it sir what side could you possibly present after forcing your foul self on a gentle virginal girl your own flesh and blood belinda willoughby has the shortest heels in london sir alan said loudly she spent two weeks luring me into her bed and then up turns sir hugo my half brother gerald whos known for being a windwardpassage fellow our solicitor the vicar from our parish and a catchfart with a pistol very damned convenient if you ask me and no justice was ever called no constable of the watch no one except for a navy captain dont you dare shout at me damn you treghues said rising you have heard what i have said sir alan asked numb to the possibility that he was about to be lashed and disrated does it not sound suspicious to you sir what motive could they possibly have had treghues said showing that at least some of it had sunk in but still on a tear at the affront to him personally as though the inventor of original sin had just pissed liquid fire in his coffee i was forced to sign a paper that pledged me to disavow any hope of inheritance from my mothers estate sir though they told me she had none and had died a prostitute in a parish poorhouse there was never any talk of my mother or her family so i have no way of knowing if her people were still alive or if they had property then why should they go to such lengths why did sir hugo not just disown you and throw you out into the street i have no idea sir i have been thinking on it for nigh on a year and a half and still can find no reason for such a deception but you were caught not just in her room im told but bare as you were born in the middle of evidently treghues could not bring himself to say the word had you ever met her sir you would be tempted yourself but your own sister the last of your line no sir my half sister belinda willoughby not lewrie treghues sat down flung himself into his chair and sipped at his coffee brow creased while alan stood at attention breathing hard and you have been totally disowned no allowance or any support mister pilchard sends me an hundred guineas a year sir and they gave captain bevan money to buy my kit i am to never go back to london does he that does not sound like a man so illdisposed to his son no mister lewrie youve spun a pretty tale but i fear youd make a better novelist than fielding thank god the world is changing and all the avarice and lust of the last forty years is being swept away by a new morality there are now godfearing people unwilling to put up with or condone the openly sinful doings that characterized our society in past years my god is treghues some kind of leaping methodist alan wondered listening to his captain rant i cannot help who my father was or in what environment i was raised sir but since joining the navy i have put all that behind me am i not a better than average midshipman sir ive a good mind to write sir onsley matthews and inform him just what a total wastrel and godless rake you really are treghues went on as though he had not heard a word had i leave to do so i would turn you out of this ship at once at once do you hear mister lewrie on what grounds sir alan asked mild as possible dont play the sea lawyer with me boy i do not want you in my command any more than the navy should have wanted you and at the first opportunity i shall make it my godfearing duty to make sure that both desperate and the sea service shall be a much cleaner place without your foul presence until that time i shall want to see only the most obedient and circumspect behavior from you or i shall make you sorry that you were ever born now get out of my sight aye aye sir i was your pride and joy you priggish bastard as long as you thought you were making sir onsley happy alan thought miserably but now you have a new master youll cut your cloth to suit sir george alan stumbled out the entryway and up to the quarterdeck to the taffrail as far away from everyone as possible there was a fair wind that morning and english harbor sparkled the breeze that came to him was full of good smells of green and luscious growing things from shore the tang of salt and iodine and tidal odors from the strand raw wood from the dockyard and the scent of pitch and hot pinetar as some ship was repaired to windward it should have been a delightful day in which to be alive but it was most definitely not that was one of the drawbacks of a manofwar the lack of privacy when you had to let go and drop to the deck and weep not only weep but thrash curse scream and pound your fists on something at the unfairness oflife until you were spent but no one was going to walk around you until you were through and then ask if you felt better for doing it so alan stared at the shore and gripped the intricately carved taffrail until his hands were white there was nothing he could say or do in the face of treghues moralizing that would make a difference he was going to become a leper treghues had made it clear that he wanted him gone as soon as the navy could let him and would also hound him from the fleet a captain set the tone for his ship how long would it be alan wondered before treghues open dislike spread to mister monk railsford peck dome cheatham and the rest perhaps even david and little carey would start walking wide to avoid him well he had not planned to make the navy a career anyway he had hoped to make lucy beauman and her fathers money a career but even being so close to that was no balm for his shattered spirits much as he at times hated the navy he did not relish being thrown out of it if he were to leave the navy it would be at his own time and with his pride and his prize money intact not as a rejected midshipman but at least as a halfpay lieutenant which would allow him to hold up his head in public and there was his perverse streak to considerloathe the life of a sailor as much as he wanted to curse the demands of the navy and the deprivations one had to suffer it was the only thing that he was good at he could roister and romp with the ladies play buck of the first head in a company of fellowcocks dance drink wench run wild in the streets and spend money with the best of them but that was not a career without a peers purse he could navigate as well as anyeven with a sextant one hundred miles out of your reckoning was considered fairly accuratehe could stand a deck watch could hand reef and steer handle a small boat could handle all the paperwork much as he despised it had learned enough to make a good sailor and a fair midshipman and he was very good with weapons where else was he going to be able to do all that after the navy clerking for some firm would be damned dull no one in his right mind would go for a soldier and he couldnt afford to buy someones commission there was nothing suitable for a gentleman that he could do or hope to undertake at eighteen years old with no civilian connections he would have to accomplish something soon something that he could point to that even treghues could not demean that would gain him so much favorable comment that he would be safe in the navy god almighty listen to what im saying im beginning to sound like i want to stay in and be made post even if that was his goal and he seriously doubted his own sanity if it was he still had four and a half years as a young gentleman in training before he could stand for a lieutenancy the rules called for six years on ships books two of those years as a midshipman or a masters mate and proof of age no less than twenty in another ship he might be chosen as a masters mate which had a salary to it and would lead quicker to a commission but would not treghues opinion of him follow him in his records he had seen other midshipmen of twenty thirty had heard of men in their forties still midshipmentoo good seamen to be cast out but unable to pass the exam or having passed had no luck or interest working for them to obtain a berth as an officer damme but this is a hard life he thought miserably but why should i expect it to be fair im not stupid would it be better for me to fight back by being cruel and unfair myself more than i am now at any rate is that the way to succeed desperate was at sea reaching north with a soldiers wind on her starboard beam for once she had company as she followed the thirtytwogun frigate amphion and was in turn trailed by two sloops of war commander ozzards vixen and another sloop of war named roebuck they had sailed north from english harbor after making their offing destined for anegada a low sandandcoral island at the eastern end of the british virgins once there they had to be careful to avoid the horseshoe reefs where hundreds of ships had come to grief over the years commander treghues had sealed orders which he had not shared with anyone as of yet but the presence of four cruisingtype warships in company bespoke a major effort of some kind and rumors were rife in every compartment rumors were also flying about what treghues had said to lewrie in his cabins the captains clerk and steward were silent about the matter mercifully and treghues was also tightlipped but it did not stop the wildest speculations people were indeed curious and expanded on the slightest hints treghues behaved as if lewrie were not there he paid not the slightest attention to him during the course of his duties had absolutely no comment about his navigation work when he inspected the midshipmens slates at noon sights indeed barely glanced at lewries and as amphion led them around horseshoe reefs into the lee of anegada at dawn of their third day at sea it was carey who had charge of the leadsmen in the foremast chains forrester who had charge of the cutter that probed ahead of them and avery by the wheel leaving alan to bide his time restlessly aft by the taffrail with a signalman once safely in deeper waters all four ships hove to cocked up to windward and gently making leeway on the tide to the west while all captains were summoned to the temporary flag frigate the conference lasted two hours at which time treghues came back aboard and went below with mr monk leaving railsford to get the ship underway again during the course of the day the squadron reached north and south behind anegada not straying too far north nor coming too far south so that they could be seen from virgin gorda it was dusk before a conference was held aft a conference in a hot and stuffy cabin with the transom windows covered in a ship that burned no lights except for the binnacle lanterns treghues had included the midshipmen masters mates master marine officer and railsford lewrie sat far back from the glossy desk where a chart was spread out treghues gave him a single darting glance of malice before opening the meeting tomorrow we raid the danish vtrgins treghues said but theys neutral sir monk said in the buzz of excitement that followed treghues pronouncement aye they are mister monk neutral but culpable treghues said wryly admiral rodney was most clever to seize st eustatius and keep the dutch flag flying he took over one hundred fifty ships intent on running our blockade but now the word is out and that traffic has shifted to other harbors at first the danes winked at privateers using their islands and the local governors had little military force to control the traffic we complained diplomatically and they ordered belligerents and smugglers to move their operations to puerto rico or cuba but they never seem to put any teeth in those orders as long as the privateers are subtle about their doings now our job is to stage a lightning raid as though we are part of the ships based on tortola and put the fear of god and the royal navy into these people scour them until they concentrate somewhere else and force the danes to play fair most clever forrester said loud enough for treghues to hear him which brought a smile from their captain by first light roebuck and amphion with local pilots shall be far enough down the drakes passage to look into coral bay on st john and then run down to the west and snap up everything that moves off the port of charlotte amalie treghues went on using a pair of brass dividers to sketch a course tapping at the great hurricane hole and bay on the southeast coast of st john which island had been made desolate by a slave rebellion years before and pretty much left to go to ruin we shall enter the open waters south of the island of st thomas and head for the island of st croix everyone leaned a little closer to look at the western end of the drake passage which was littered with rocks possible shoals and the mark of a wreck or two mister monk advises the flanagan passage for us south of the island of the same name treghues continued vixen shall lead our little flotilla and shall be inshore of us off christiansted going no closer than two leagues to avoid entering danish waters we shall be farther offshore snapping up one prize after another coming from the east as we shall be with the sun behind us with the trade winds behind us and with the westerlysetting tide flow we can catch anything at sea all ships and prizes shall concentrate here later in the day off the island of vieques in the passage group to the east of puerto rico thisll be a bitch sir monk said scratching at his scruffy chin drake passage is as lumpy as a country road now theres twentyfour to twentyfive fathoms safe as houses down drakes passage its here off norman island it gets tricky the chart dont show it but somewhere off the point here nornorwest pelican theres a shoal with a deep channel between that an another shoal theres deep water between flanagan an the indians an ringdove rock bout fourteenfathom at high tide an ya cant go too far inshore peter island to avoid the shoals id feel my way down with the foresls spanker an forecourse an keep the topsls at three reefs until were in the clear we shall be following commander ozzard treghues said disliking the advice so i think we should not have too much difficulty but if he sets on one them shoals sir we shall depend on your skill to guide us mister monk treghues said moving on to other matters prize crews first will be forrester and a bosuns mate weems i think and ten hands if shes big next avery and mister feather well be in deep water so the third crew will be mister monk young carey and some men depending on her size lieutenant peck if you should be so good as to provide four private marines to each prize in full kit to cow any resistance i would be much obliged delighted sir peck said it was rare that his marines had a chance to wear their scarlet uniforms at sea usually they were dressed in slop clothing much like the hands to save wear and tear should we be so incredibly fortunate as to take a fourth ship as a prize i shall send the first lieutenant and mr toliver which will still leave me a masters mate aboard bosun see that each crew has a quartermasters mate or senior hand able to steer and lets get all our boats down for towing tonight aye aye sir there were a few looks in lewries direction he was rated as able to stand as an acting masters mate had done so already in fact and yet had been pointedly left out of their captains reckoning if a chase is too small burn it we can also ignore the many local fishing boats unless they seem to be heavily loaded or act suspiciously or show too many white faces what about putting captives overboard sir railsford asked any ship engaged in illicit trade you may spare the blacks danes and neutrals but any belligerent nationals and especially any american rebels or rogue englishmen be sure to retain so they may be taken to court for their activities the french spanish and dutch deserve to be placed in chains as do any rebels and any englishman partaking in this business deserves to hang for treason dewey lambdin by first light lewrie was on the gun deck below the gangways swaying uncomfortably as the squadron seemed to fly down the sir francis drake passage the trades were steady and blowing quite fresh with the wind nearly dead aft it never felt like they were making much gain over the ground since they had no noticeable breeze the only way to judge was to stand on a gun breech or the jear bitts and watch the many isles and rocks slide past there was a heavy chop in the passage sixfoot waves seemingly about six feet apart and the frigates four hundred fifty tons thumped and pounded through them flinging spray halfway up the jibs the crew had gone through the motions of dawn quarters the daily scrubbing of decks like automatons but now there was a tingle of excitement in the air as they stood easy to their guns they were piped below to their breakfasts but didnt stay below long and came back up still chewing to stow their hammocks and resume their waiting among the artillery mister railsford ill have chain slings rigged aloft on the yards treghues ordered finding work for them to do in the meantime bosun layout the boarding nettings and prepare for hoisting lewrie had been on the quarterdeck earlier and had gotten a good look at mr monks chart much marked and doodled on from his years of experience in these waters he could recognize norman island off their larboard bow could spot the hump that was pelican island the locations of those two shoals of which monk was so leery were shadowy guesses in dark pencil markings and alan tried to triangulate a possible way to avoid them about five cables ahead of them half a mile fuen tiptoed her way a little closer inshore and desperate leaned slightly as she wore to follow her around the leadsmen were alternating tossing the lead from either foremast chain platform calling out their soundings which had remained stable at twentyfour or twentyfive fathoms desperate drew nearly three so she was still safe if the charts were right though that was a big if farther ahead and off to starboard a little amphion and roebuck were threading the gap between flanagan island and privateer point and would soon be able to look into the deep bay which might shelter enemy merchantmen or a privateer ship or two god almighty hes found a shoal monk shouted and alan took a peek over the bows vixen was wearing almost due south coming about hard and beginning to heel to the stiff breeze there was collective relief as vixen continued on her new course and a signal flag went up to her mizzen truck a numeral safe by god monk said loudly leaning over his chart and pencilling in another bit of arcana for the admiralty to peruse some day in future when he handed in all his charts upon paying off vixen hoisted another numeral group she had found their deepwater passage to the south of flanagan island and from what alan could remember would encounter nothing shallower than twelve or thirteen fathoms from then on desperate wore early cutting the corner slightly on vixens course until they wore due south right in her wake hands aloft the bosun sang out hands aloft an make sail layout anlet go topsls they threaded the flanagan passagethe indian rocks to their east pelican island off their larboard quarter waves breaking over ringdove rock and shoal water shading off from dark blue to turquoise and aqua and pale green that they did it at nearly seven knots and gaining added a certain piquancy to it all even though they had found deep water by the time the preventer backstays and jiggers had been freed and triced up and the topsls hauled down and puffed full of wind they were on their best point of sail with the trades on their larboard quarter making over nine knots heading sousouwest halfwest the leadsmen steadily calling out twenty fathoms or better it was a bumpy ride as monk had predicted but most pleasant all the same sail ho the lookout called almost immediately two points off the larboard bow she was vlxens pigeon and obviously a belligerent from the way she hauled her wind and turned to run but there was no escaping the fleeter sloop of war and before half an hour had passed they could see puffs of smoke as vlxen opened fire treghues had his little band strike up a tune the young drummers and fifers countermarched back and forth by the quarterdeck nettings over the waist and a couple of landsmanfiddlers joined them to entertain the crew the seas between s thomas and st croix were working alive with shipping that fine sparkling moming and the crew danced their hornpipes exuberantly at the thought of action to come they were bearing down on the nearest chase a fullrigged ship painted like an indiaman and showing two rows of gun ports she hoisted danish colors but continued to flee which made her most suspicious for a neutral desperate cut inshore of her as she fled to the west gybed to the opposite tack and began to close her rapidly she was deeply laden so the lower row of gunports was most likely false still railsford bellowed through his speaking trumpet stopping the people capering and dancing gun crews stand to to starboard once within two cables mr gwynn was sent forward to the carronade on the forecastle and lewrie drifted up in that direction to take his stance halfway up the ladder to spot the fall of shot they had not used the carronades much since the smashers would have made kindling of most of their earlier prizes but here was a suitable target for the heavy and destructive ball they fired in went a powder cartridge four and a half pounds of powder then a thirtytwopound shot hollowcast and filled with powder and a mixture of grapeshot and musketshot gwynn fiddled with the lay of the gun and the hands tugged on the swivel platform to adjust it gwynn hummed along with the musicians as he slid the quoin out slightly a carronade had little range due to the light powder charge ready he called stepping clear and raising his fist fire as you bear the gun captain touched the vent hole the quill took light and sparked down into the charge the gun barked and recoiled on its wooden slide the ball struck their chase squarely the massive ball hit the foe just at the break of the larboard gangway and the quarterdeck a little ahead of the mizzen chains and burst with a terrific energy and a satisfying puff of smoke shrapnel dust and splintered wood the chains shivered and the heavy shrouds parted her mizzen t gallant and topmast snapped and heeled over to starboard yards crashing to the deck and smothering her wheel the masquerade of being danish ended french colors appeared for a moment then fluttered down to the deck as people waved tablecloths in surrender both ships hauled their wind and rounded up forrester clumped his way down into a cutter and was off to take his prize even as the rowing boat was cast off desperate was paying off the wind and gathering way once more to pursue a second ship closer inshore that the vixen could not reach this vessel they did not even have to fire into her crew abandoned her quickly and began to pull hard for shore hoping the current did not set them so far west they missed st croix altogether their chances in the nasty coral reefs on the north shore were iffy enough before desperate could think of taking her a heat wave shimmered over her and smoke began to flag downwind id drop thisn sir monk warned they want off her awful bad might be loaded to the deckheads with powder still they wont have her lads treghues shouted with false cheer at being cheated of a prize lets go get another it was fortunate they did for once they were about a mile downwind of the abandoned ship and she had become a raging inferno she suddenly blew up tossing timbers hundreds of feet into the air the next prize came within an hour but she was only a lugger run by a mulatto and crewed by blacks she was local but carried barrels of saltmeat with french markings being too small to bother with she was burned to the distress of her owner an hour later they came within range of a brigantine and after two broadsides she lowered her spanish colors and surrendered this time avery and feather had success and took eight hands and four marines over to her happily like most merchant ships she had a crew barely sufficient to work her so avery would have no trouble from them they left her far behind as they chased after still another prize as four vessels came north from fredericksted and tried to run by lunch they were up to the first a racylooking brig with raked masts obviously americanbuilt she hoisted rebel colors and wore to open her gun battery about four cables off on their starboard side the other three vessels continued to flee and this american acted as if he would trade his ship for their safety or attempt to delay the british frigate as long as possible the brig opened fire first damned accurate fire desperate drummed to the shock of iron hitting her hull from the brigs six side guns mr gwynn fire as you bear treghues ordered desperates sixpounders began to speak with a sternwind taking the sound and powder cloud away it sounded like the slamming of heavy iron doors one at a time the guns rolled back inboard to snub against the breeching ropes and the crews sprang to serve them while shot began to moan overhead or strike their ship once more the brig was not built to take such heavy punishment when she was struck by roundshot her scantlings were punched clear through and clouds of splinters erupted from her hands to the braces bosun close her treghues ordered the frigate swung until the wind was dead astern went a point farther and swung her yards about to gybe gently the brig wore at the same time so that their courses were aimed for a convergence at three cables the rebel brig fired again and this time she fired high desperates foret gallant mast came crashing down ripping down her outer flying jib tangling her running and standing rigging in the foremast topsl and course yards desperate replied with a full broadside fired on the uproll all nine starboard side guns and the starboard carronade together the brig staggered as she was struck between wind and water and the carronade shot blew her forecastle to pieces of lumber yet there were still men over there to serve her guns and she struck back ripping chunks out of desperates bulwarks and hammock nettings lewrie was almost downed by a marine that was flung off the starboard gangway to drop like a beef carcass between the guns three gunners screamed and clawed at their flesh as long thick wood splinters were driven into them loblolly boys lewrie called out here you take this mans place as rammer man oh god sor don lemme be took ta the cockpit sor a gunner said as he was picked up one splinter stood quivering in his upper right arm and another in his lower chest driven sideways under skin but lewrie motioned for him to be hauled away and kicking and fighting he was dragged to the midships batch the marines body was stuffed under the fore jear bitts shot your guns lewrie ordered as mr gwynn busied himself at the carronade run out number four overhaul that sidetackle now the carronade slammed aloud once more as lewrie supervised the battery gwynn gave a cheer as his latest shot went home somewhere in the brig prime your guns lewrie commanded we shall fire together on the uproll carey was there at his side fthe captain wants you on the quarterdeck lewrie aye point your guns the range was now about two cables and even a linstocktired gun with no sights of any kind could be devastingly accurate that tlose on the uproll fire lewrie shouted feeling the scend of the sea through his feet the first gun bellowed now hot and leaping straight back from the sill he ran aft with the broadside since some gunners did not get a clean ignition on the first uproll and had to wait for the second each gun captain now doing his own aiming you wanted me sir lewrie said after gaining the quarterdeck mister lewrie mr gwynn or the gunners mate are in charge on the gun deck and ill thank you to remember that treghues told him mr gwynn is dealing with the carronade sir and the gunners mate is below in the magazine sir you shall return forward and remind mr gwynn of his duties as master gunner and you shall summon the gunners mate from the magazine for the forecastle gun i shall not have any of my midshipmen circumventing the proper chain of command aye aye sir and lewrie doffed his hat treghues turned his back on him and lewrie was left staring at railsford and monk as they shook their heads he put his hat on shrugged to them with a smile that seemed to say youfigureitout and ran back forward gwynn really would much rather have played with his carronade but he sighed and went down the ladder to the gun deck lewrie took time to see that the brig was taking a real beating half her larboard side pitted with shot holes and her sailhandling gangway tom away lewrie ran below down the midships hatch and rapped on the hatchway to the hanging magazine on the orlop deck the gunners mate stuck his head out through the slitted felt curtain the captain wants you to help mr gwynn supervise the guns lewrie panted robinson spat he and the yeoman of the powder room were busy enough passing cartridges to the ships boys to run up to the guns and no one ever allowed many cartridges to be made up so he was busy filling silk bags and tying them off to service the hungry artillery whats happenin up top were shooting hell out of a rebel brig then whadduz e want me for robinson asked he doesnt want me running the guns mister robinson lewrie said with another eloquent shrug as robinson squeezed through tht felt curtain and followed him toward midships no pleasin officers robinson said nor figurin what they want neither once on deck there was really nothing for robinson to do since they had closed to within half a cable of the brig and the remaining marines were having a field day shooting by volley from the hammock nettings ramming and spitting ball down the barrel cocking and stepping up to the nettings aiming and firing two rounds a minute at their hottest pace the brig was still fighting back gamely her colors now flew from her maintop the gaff of the spanker having been shot away it looked as though the flag had been nailed to the topmast damned tough they is a quartergunner shouted to robinson capn called on em ta strike an their master tol treghues ta go fuck isself theyre englishmen by god robinson said may be rebel englishmen but theyre our sort game as guinea cocks there was another volley from the brigs guns three distinct barks from all her surviving guns and three hard knocks that rocked desperate as though she had been kicked by a giant prime yer guns robinson shouted point on the uproll there was a flurry of gunfire from the rebel ship swivels and musket fire that struck quills of wood from bulwarks and decks theyve men in the foretop lewrie yelled to lieutenant peck but could not make himself heard christ robinson grunted he had been struck by a ball in the knee mister gwynn lewrie yelled its mister robinson on the uproll fire gwynn commanded finishing the sequence that robinson had started theyll take me fuckin leg i knows it robinson groaned as he rocked and shivered with agony i had ta leave the magazine fer this there was another volley of musket fire and two marines went limp falling back over the starboard gangway lewrie remembered what he had tried to tell peck and jumped for the gangway levering himself up in clear shot to speak to the marine officer sharpshooters in the foretop sir rifles by god peck called out spotting where the fire was coming from the men aloft on the enemy ship were dressed in some kind of uniform riflegreen tunics with white facings and buff breeches and round hats pinned up on one side this was no expensively outfitted privateer or a merchant vessel feeling overly aggressivethis was a rebel warship of the socalled continental navy by volley at the foretop peck ordered pointing at the target with his smallsword mister lewrie gwynn roared lay the carronade on them it was an order he was glad to obey he had not yet been allowed to play with the carronades and it relieved him from standing about like a supernumerary quoin out gun captain lewrie yelled in the mans ear after failing to get his attention any other way lay on her foretop too close sir wont bear that high the larboard gun aye might reach even if you hit the mast thatll bring em down lewrie said running to larboard the carronade mount could be swiveled about in a wide arc so it was easy to lay it in the general direction but their activity attracted the sharpshooters and a powder boy screamed as his elevenyearold life was snuffed out with a largercaliber rifle ball through his spine lewrie dove for the powder cartridge and shoved it into the muzzle standing aside as the rammer man thrust away they got a ball down the muzzle but then the rammer man gave a shriek and spun about a bullet through his brains jesus christ save us the gun captain said picking up the rammer and giving the ball a few taps quoin out there lewrie told the man behind the gun he felt a breath of air on his face heard a hum like a summer bee and saw the larboard rail toss off a burst of tiny wood chips as a rifle ball nearly divided his skull hot work sir the tackle man nearest him said with a gaptoothed smile at least youre getting paid lewrie said lost in a fighting fever stand clear the gun captain said lowering his linstock up close the explosion of the powder charge was like having ones head down the muzzle and lewries ears rang and ached but he saw the foretop shattered by the explosion of the carronade shot and the cluster of sharpshooters was tom away in pieces as the topmast came down in chunks as well and her rigging draped her like a netting the foremast gave a groan and then the thick column of the lower mast began to split like a sawn tree that had been felled badly pivoted forward with the pressure of the wind on a loose forecourse yard and came down with a crash across the enemys forecastle crushing the bowchaser gun crews that must have been firing at them at that pointblank range but had gone unnoticed in the general tumult and chaos the brig was now almost alongside her gangways slightly below desperates taller railings and the marines were having a great time shooting down into the enemy ships waist boarders railsford yelled drawing his sword repel boarders holy shit on a biscuit the carronade gun captain shouted i dont believe these people lewrie seized a cutlass from a weapons tub and went to the starboard forecastle rail the brig was bumping into desperate and such of her crew as had survived were tossing grapnels to hold their ship against the frigate even as the marines volleys cut swathes out of their closely packed ranks a gawky thatchhaired young man leaped up in front of lewrie with a cutlass and lewrie engaged with him as more poured over the man was strong but clumsy lewrie beat his guard aside and cut back across slashing the mans throat the man fell back into the sea blood shooting out like a claret fountain the next man up took a boarding pike through his stomach and also fell into the sea the third lewrie had time to skewer with the point of his cutlass and he too raised a splash alongside the enemy had gained the midships gangway but were being cut up by boarding pikes and marine bayonets and the enemys stem was pivoting away from desperate lewrie waved his cutlass attracting more angry bees that rushed by him fend em off the forecastle with rarnmers with handspikes crows and boarding pikes about a dozen hands were there with him some slashing the air with cutlass steel others fighting like wild indians with tomahawks the rebels who had gained the forecastle began to fall back leaping for their own decks a marine corporal came forward with ten privates and began to volley into them do we board her the corporal asked wont trap me over there a gunner said i think shes sinking lewrie said look how low in the water she is the brig was indeed very low in the water now the sea almost up to her gun ports her wale and chainplates were already under lewrie could see the tangle of bodies on her forecastle and forward gun deck piled up like slaughtered rabbits after a successful hunt how two guns were shot free of any restraints and rolled back and forth on the bloody deck but they were still firing swivels and light fourpounders on her quarterdeck where the only resistance still stood an occasional musket or rifted gun and pistols still popped cut her free lewrie ordered the tomahawk men well not be able to save her and if we roll over shell have the sticks out of us the threeinch lines grappled to desperate were already ironhard and taut groaning and crying with tension and each time the brig slunk into a wave there was a pull downward on the frigate once cut with an axe the lines twanged like bowstrings and almost snapped a mans right arm off as they parted the brigs forecastle was level with the sea and her beakhead and jib boom was under sinking quickly now by the bows she would not last long ominous rumbles came from her as the surging waves explored her innards strike treghues yelled in the name of humanity strike hell no you british duckfucker their young captain yelled back cupping his hands and standing foursquare on his shattered deck you tell the world we were the brig war liberty continental by god navy then with a foamy surge the ocean broke over her bows and she tilted up by the stem gear and shattered timbers and loose guns and internal stores screaming in pain and bulkheads battered into ruin she slipped beneath the sea leaving a few survivors swimming in the light flotsam her mainmast was the last to go under still bearing the striped rebel colors with the starry blue canton nailed to the mast she had lost her fight but it didnt feel so they fetched up and went over with a boat to pick up survivors but there werent a dozen men left and the young captain was not one of them treghues offered them dry clothes and rum and put them below lewrie wished that the day was over but it was not to be once they had swayed up a new t gallant mast roved a fresh outer jib stay taken down the damaged topsl yard fished it with a stunsl boom rehoisted it and bent on a new sail they were off once more in search of prizes that lay tantalizingly to leeward after their labor a late meal was brought up from the galley cold meat and cheese and biscuit the rum ration was doled out along with as much small beer as they could drink their dead were hustled below out of sight by the loblolly boys and the decks washed clean of blood and offal to keep up their fighting spirit they came across another brig beating up to windward for fredericksted from the west unaware that anything was happening and did not notice that desperate was british until it was too late she turned out to be french come for a load of stores to smuggle and was crammed to the deckheads with iliil molasses and naval stores there was no resistance and mr monk went away with carey in charge of her leaving alan as the last midshipman still aboard let it be over he thought in weariness and the awful let down he had come to know as his normal reaction after each hard fight all he wanted to do was find a patch of shade and go to sleep as some of the hands could never mind slinging a hammock below they had finally stood down from quarters every sail still in sight was hulldown over the horiwn running for their lives by late afternoon even treghues had to admit that they had run out of hope of future prizes that they had seemingly swept the ocean clean on their way norwest toward culebra and vieques islands they could see sails jogging along behind them and in trail of the other warships perhaps ten captures in all in which all the frigates and sloops would share actually in material terms they had not made a real dent in the volume of imports to the rebellious colonies but perhaps the audacity of the raid would give the smugglers pause or make them choose new areas in which to operate lewrie stood by the taffrail reveling in the quarter breeze now that the strength had gone out of the sun the wind held his coat open and he spread his shirt wide below the neckcloth to allow the cooling wind to play on his chest and sweaty ribs getting indecent with the mermaids mister lewrie lieutenant railsford asked coming aft to join him that would be a novel experience sir lewrie said taking off his hat to cool his scalp that was good work you did up forrard today lewrie railsford told him letting his own coat spread open thank you mister railsford i am grateful that someone appreciated it i do not mean to pry mister lewrie but railsford now spoke in a softer tone since treghues cabin skylight was slightly forward of them and was open for a breeze i get the feeling our lord and master no longer approves of you no need to worry sir ill bear up take a round turn and two halfhitches railsford grinned and as mister monk says sir the more you cry the less youll piss lewrie bantered his eyes overbright and his mood a bit too chipper to pass unnoticed the captain has his moods railsford said treading on soft ground there had been officers who had been courtmartialed for a habit of criticism a captain could demand obedience from his officers and also a united front of one mind once he had determined what opinion should be held if it is any comfort mister lewrie those moods can be swift to change in most instances that was as far as railsford would go in criticism of the captain any gossip passed on would undermine both railsfords and treghues authority aye sir remember every captain has something to teach you for good or ill life in the reet can be a series of disasters to be borne sometimes i shall bear up mister railsford thank you for that desperate took in her t gallants and brailed them up lowered the yards to the caps took a reef in their tops is and got the speed off her for evening sailing at the rendezvous as well as to allow her prize vessels to catch up with her then it was cleardecksandupspirits supper evening quarters and hammocks below for the night at dusk the masthead lookouts came down and hands took up upperdeck viewing posts amphion ordered all prize vessels gathered in an impromptu convoy with the sloops off to windward to guard the flank amphion brought up the rear and desperate worked out ahead and to leeward of the convoy as they set off sou east for the nearest british ports lewrie had had his supper alone both masters mates and all the other midshipmen were away in prizes the steward brought him some boiled saltpork a couple of new potatoes biscuit and black strap cut with water aft the officers were celebrating loudly those still on board their steward came through several times with bottles which had been cooling on the orlop while alan ate and drank in isolation which condition he was sure was to be permanent he had the evening watch and mr gwynn stood in for a deck officer with him the sky was clear littered with bright stars and though there was no moon the sea shone at each wavetop now and then breaking into a white chop lewrie made a tour of the lower deck with the ships corporal and masteratarrns to inspect the galley and lanterns to make sure all fires were out then went back to the quarterdeck and loafed by the forward nettings the trades sang sweetly through the rigging and the hull held at a slight angle of heel to starboard hissing and groaning as she made her way toward home gwynn was near him looking up at the stars and the sails there was a gurgling noise as gwynn pulled on a pocket flask of rum and the sweet odor wafted by like a womans perfume summat ta keep yer eyes open mister lewrie gwynn offered that would have me snoring on the deck mister gwynn but i thankee lewrie replied god i am so tired allus like that after a hard fight gwynn said god they fought grand cant remember the continental navy showin that much bottom privateers get the best men rebelsre too independent ta take ta navystyle discipline if theyd had ninepounders or carronades theyd have done for us i think mister gwynn lewrie said nodding in agreement right enough treghues emerged on deck from aft and the pair of them went down to leeward to give him the entire windward side of the quarterdeck for his pacing treghues was in breeches and open shirt quite informal for a change a spooky apparition in the faint starlight pacing back and forth quite regularly not as though he were in deep thought but as if it was a duty to walk for a while before retiring to escape lewrie went forward to tour the lookouts on the forecastle and gangways and make certain they were more awake than he was he had to shake a couple of men into full wariness by the time he had returned to the quarterdeck treghues had gone below and only a dim glow could be seen from his skylight and then as alan watched that was snuffed out everbody chipper up forrard gwynn asked aye mister gwynn sleepy but trying here whats got the capn onta ya not you too alan thought i do not know what you mean sir he replied evenly he come over an asked me what ya was doin runnin the guns as ya were today like ta give ma a cobbin about it i told him ya was as good as any gunners mate but he didnt wanta hear it gwynn related the captain has his moods alan said uneasily moods shit gwynn stuffed a quid of tobacco into his cheek and tore off a large bite fickle as me old lady cept fer mr forrester an railsford takes a great hankerin fer somebody an then turns on em an nobody knows why been in desperate near two an a half years an its been like that ever since we commissioned lets just say he doesnt like my choice of fathers lewrie said after gwynns indiscretion and it seems im too big a sinner to wear a navy uniform aye thats one reason we dont have a chaplain aboard gwynn laughed softly with him aft we dont need one lewrie gave a grunt that might have been a mirthless laugh or a sign of agreement and gwynn walked off to find the spitkid by the binnacle six bells chimed softly from the belfry up forward and alan checked his watch against itll pm and only an hour to go before he could go below and sleep four uninterrupted hours until the morning routine of a manofwar claimed him once again sail ho one of the forward lookouts called lewrie shook himself into action trotting forward to join him where away two points off the larboard bow mister lewrie the lookout said quietly almost afraid to raise his voice hes on the opposite tack an comin north hell run right into the convoy lewrie hefted the heavy night glass which showed images upside down and backward he found their stranger what seemed to be a fullrigged ship ghosting along under reefed topsls inner jibs and spanker run aft and wake the captain lewrie said tell mr gwynn weve a fullrigged ship coming right for us quick man lewrie studied the stranger for a while longer then shouted for the bosuns mate of the watch toliver all hands on deck mister toliver no pipes or well lose the chase no pipes the runty little man repeated before running off to shout down the midships hatchway to the offduty watch it was noisy enough as the hands rolled out of their hammocks and thudded to the deck to thunder up topside on bare feet lewrie hurried back to the wheel and stood by gwynn who was using the other night glass to search for the strange ship have i your permission to close her sir lewrie asked him yes lets see what hes doin runnin dark out here duty watch to the braces quartermaster put your helm down and lay her two points closer to the wind alan shouted whats this about a strange sail mister gwynn treghues demanded emerging on the quarterdeck here sir take a squint shiprigged an runnin without a light sir thus quartermaster vast heavin belay every inch that mister toliver harden up on the headsl sheets lewrie called to the focsle captain now belay mister gwynn i have the deck treghues said still dressed in a nightshirt lewrie stop that caterwauling like you know what youre doing judkin fetch me up my breeches and sword aye sir shall we clear for action sir gwynn asked as railsford and peck joined them aye load and run out the larboard battery treghues told him ill need mister lewrie forrard sir gwynn said robinsons lost his leg ya remember sir oh very well treghues sighed after a long pause mister lewrie do take charge the forecastle an the carronades ifya please gwynn was smiling in the darkness aye mister gwynn all hands to quarters treghues shouted it was hard to see how the men could even see what they were doing as they unlashed the guns and rolled them back to the centerline overhauled the side tackles and freed the train tackles brought gun tools up from below and began to light fuses in the slowmatch tubs damn fool lewrie said hearing treghues musicians get going at heart of oak afternoon waddn enough fer ya mister lewrie the larboard carronade captain joshed with him as they removed the tompion of their gun and freed the lashings of the swivel platform wanted to see what they looked like going off in the dark alan shot back here can we manhandle the other gun over here take some doin mister lewrie but i kin lash the breech ropes ta the cathead iffen ya want it load yer guns gwynn called from aft on the main gun deck a squad of marines under their sergeant carne trooping forward along the gangway to take station from the forecastle aft the strange ship came awake the wind brought them the faint sound of bosuns pipes playing unfamiliar calls and the sound of men running to stations the wind also brought a brassy aroma mixed with the smell of a barnyard lord what a stink lewrie said whats he carrying moight be a slaver sor the starboard gun captain said hes putting about lewrie broke in almost able to see a faint shadow that was darker than the night going on the wind on the starboard tack stations for stays railsford ordered stand by to come about helm alee rise tacks an sheets toliver yelled clew garnets mainsl hau desperate carne up to the eye of the wind sails shivering and yards creaking as the hands leaned almost parallel to the deck to fetch her around without missing stays the focsle captain shifted his headsl sheets to larboard and the backed fore yards provided enough wind resistance to force her bows off the wind as the other yards drove her forward she tacked smoothly losing little speed in the dark and hardened up on the same tack as the other ship laid within six points of the winds and beginning to beat hard to weather waisters harden up the topsl braces now belay railsford called wanting to put a slight spiral set to the yards the topsls more acutely angled to the wind than the courses for the most efficiency the stranger was now off their starboard bows perhaps a mile off lewrie could barely make out ghostly specks of light like tiny candles along her leeward side slowmatch alan said theyll make a fight of it hope they aint like that last batch someone said gun captain prepare the starboard carronade shift the larboard gun up abaft the roundhouse breech rope to the hawse buckler and the cathead alan ordered wanting to put both his smashers to work he looked aft now to see an amber light burning on the taffrail a fusee that smoked and flared like a holiday rocket the night signal for danger it would also warn the other prizes in convoy of where they were so as to avoid collision in the dark hurriedly the rest of the ships began to light their taffrail lanterns thats roebuck or vixen out there sir a hand shouted waving a hand at a distant light to windward bet hell tack agin belay shifting that carronade within moments the dark shape of their quarry shortened and put her masts in line tacking across the wind once more but desperate performed her own tack at the same time and had the chase missed stays on that maneuver they suddenly seemed much closer to her give me a point free treghues ordered stand by the larboard battery lewries men secured the starboard gun and shifted once more lashing the larboard carronade back into position can you reach him yet lewrie asked bout another cable sir the gunner said squinting at their spectral foe number one larboard gun fire gwynn called and the sixpounder closest to them below the larboard gangway fired it was a spectacular sight at night to witness the tongue of flame that stabbed out through a nimbus of gunsmoke and the sound seemed much louder than during the daytime lewrie was almost blinded by the flash when he looked for their target it had disappeared for him though the experienced gunners still peered at it intently the enemy ship returned fire a single gun from her sternchaser and the ball moaned into the night without hitting anything by then desperate was rapidly closing on the other vessel the main guns began to bark regularly though it was hard to tell if they were achieving any better results on their target than the enemy had i kin hit him now sir i think the gun captain said blaze away stand clear the carronade lurched inboard on its slide seconds later the sure sign of a solid hit on the hull flashed into life and the night was full of the thin sound of screaming jaysus a hand said mules sir or horses no wonder he stinks god help the poor beasts lewrie said and the men around him echoed his sentiments for the enemy they would have no mercy yet could weep real tears over their birds and dogs and manger animals desperate was now within a cable and one could discern the foe clearly in the starlight well enough to aim true they put another ball from the carronade onto the poop of the enemy and this time the screams were men not dumb beasts there was a hail of musket and swivel fire from the quarterdeck and the ships guns sounding like ninepounders began to fire irregularly but their aim was incredibly poor and did little more than raise great splashes close aboard close enough to see people lewrie could make out a mass of men in white uniforms on the quarterdeck almost a full company of troops that were firing by volley with their muskets a ball from the carronade took a third of them down like a reaper desperates guns were speaking as regular as a tolling bell from bow to stem about ten seconds apart each shot painting the water between the two dueling ships blood red and amber and lighting up their sides the carronade fired again providing enough of a light as the ball exploded to see the men with muskets writhing in agony as another third were scythed down and the remainder were faltering in their musket drill falling back from the rails as desperates own marines began to volley into them once more that day musket balls began to buzz about lewries ears and strike the decks and rails with solid thuds there were more men across the way in white uniforms now on the gangways and forecastle loading and firing their muskets regular as clockwork their own marines were taking a toll of those people with musket and swivels that bunch gun captain lewrie ordered the carronade spoke once more and the range was so close that the bursting of the shot was almost instantaneous flicking whining bits of shrapnel around their own ears but the welldrilled platoon of men on the gangways disappeared in the flash and the bang there was a narrowing tiderace of channel between the two ships and desperates guns were spitting blazing wads at the enemy ship in addition to the solid shot firing pointblank across the foamed breadth of water as their bow waves merged reload larboard gun quickly theres some men on her forecastle take em down lewrie said grapnels prepare to board railsford called out from aft there was little return fire from the enemy ship now her gun ports silent and not a muzzle showing though the resistance from her musketeers was still hot there was a dense knot of them on the forecastle first rank kneeling and second and third ranks alternated lowering their muskets for a volley fire as you bear lewrie ordered his testicles shrinking up inside him at the sight of glittering bayonets and musket bores the carronade belched fire and smoke and when the residue blew back over them downwind there was nothing left of the forecastle but a pile of bodies in white uniforms painted red with gore bow chaser sir a gunner warned there was a light cannon on the forecastle and the sailors in slop clothing were running to man it while more men in uniform ran forward with them to where the two ships would bump together lewrie tried to attract the marine sergeants attention to them but he was busy directing musket volleys farther aft alan saw the other crew removing the tompion of the bow chaser load goddamnit kill those people a musket barked and the larboard carronade rammer screamed and fell to the deck the rest of the crew shrinking away load damn you load lewrie plucked a heavy sea pattern pistol from a weapons tub checked to see it was primed and drew back the heavy cocking lever there was a volley of musket fire that spanged off the carronade driving men into hiding behind the bulwarks and taking down two more men lewrie turned to face the enemy he could see a man passing up a powder charge leveled his pistol and took aim he fired and the ball hit the barrel of the bow chaser spanging off with a flash of sparks and took a sidetackle man in the stomach the rammer man was now tamping down his charge lewrie took up another pistol and aimed for the man who cradled a bag of musket shot not only did he miss him he punched a scarlet bloom dead in the chest of a man with a handspike on the other side of the gun shitten goddarnn pistols i he threw the thing across the gap which by then could not have been fifty feet if that bow chaser went off they were all dead he was amazed to see the heavy longbarreled and wildly inaccurate sea pattern pistol knock the teeth out of the gun captain with the slowmatch ignition fuse and drop him out of sight stand clear the carronade gun captain finally barked out the men on the opposing forecastle began to shrink away about bloody time lewrie said in profound relief as his life was spared once more but his relief was lost in the explosion of the powder charge and the bursting of the shot as the two forecastles nudged together and grapnels flew across to lash the two ships together it wa nearly as silent as the grave boarders railsford ordered by lewries side waving his bright sword away boarders lewrie scrabbled for a cutlass from the weapons tub and then was borne forward like a pinnace surged onto a beach by a powerful burst of surf as the men who had gathered forward went over to the enemy ship in a howling mob he had no choice but to leap across the narrow gapeither that or fall and be ground to sausage meat between the hullswhere he was immediately tripped by a bight of shredded headsl sheets and fen to the deck to be almost trampled by his own people as they screamed and whooped and fell on the enemy havent i done enough dammit he thought to himself feeling the pain in his knees and shins there was a strong ann lifting him up a flash of smile in a dark face from one of the west indian hands and then he was stuck into it whether he cared to participate or not he headed aft for the larboard forecastle ladder and began to descend but a pike head came jabbing out of nowhere bringing a scream to his lips he thrust out in the general direction of the pikes wielder and his sword met meaty resistance the pike was withdrawing for a second thrust and he grabbed the shaft behind the wickedly gleaming point and was pulled into the enemy his cutlass sinking deeper into whoever it was suddenly there was a shrill yell almost in his ear a hot and garlicky breath on his face and he slammed into the man there was enough light to see that he had his cutlass sunk hiltdeep into an enemy sailor and it could not be withdrawn lewrie let go the pike shaft and twisted and pulled bringing another shriek of agony the sword came free as did the mans entrails slithering out like some image from a nightmare the entire waist of the enemy ship was a heaving mass of men who were clashing blades like a tribe of welsh tinkers steel flickered and struck knives flashed bayonets and pikes dipped and thrust and came away slimed with blood underfoot there were already bodies enough sailors and soldiers ripped to pieces by carronade shot the decks gleaming wet and sticky pistols spat muskets barked giving little flashes of light on the scene alan left the waist going back to the silent forecastle and made his way aft along the larboard gangway picking his way across tangled rope piles and torn nettings and bodies there was hardly any fighting there he would have liked to have assisted but wasnt sure who was friendly and who was an enemy he advanced slowly his cutlass ready salaud someone snarled leaping for him alan clashed blades with him using both hands to go into the murderous cutlass drill and also trying to remember his poor french had the man just called him a dirty beast the man stumbled backward from a hard blow and alan brought the blade flashing down once more catching him on the side of the neck slicing down through the collarbone this time the cutlass could not be dislodged so he bent down and took the mans rapier and a pistol from his waistband pulled the gun back to halfcock and went on aft by the main chains he got into another melee three men in slop clothing were falling back from about half a dozen men in white infantry uniforms mostly armed with short hangers at em desperates lewrie yelled partly to let them know that he was not a foe to be chopped into chutney sauce and partly to encourage them he found himself at the head of the pack slashing away with abandon one of his men struck forward with a cutlass and ripped the groin out of a foeman which brought such a shriek that the others turned to run alan chopped a second man down across the spine as he faced away but could not escape past his friends a musket thrust for him its bayonet sharp and hungry he put up the pistol to bind with it slashing backward with his rapier and opening up the mans chest as the man stumbled and went down alan struck again across the neck then vaulted the body as it sank to the deck now he was on the quarterdeck as british marines and sailors swarmed up the ladders from the waist in a rush and lewries people took the crumbling opposition in the flank doing great damage before they were spotted lewrie faced off with a boy perhaps a midshipman like him and almost without thought beat the young mans guard aside and ran him through with the razorsharp rapier next there was a real swordsman an officer by his clothes and breeches and good stockings and shoes with a rapier and what looked like a poignard to me alan screamed but hed been cut off by the swirling fight almost backed up against the larboard bulwarks and nettings the man was fast and strong his wrist like an iron bar as their blades met alan retreated slowly parrying the sword with his rapier and trying to keep the poignard away from his belly with the long barrel of the pistol the french officer stamped and lunged and alan beat him aside in quartata but the frenchman was there with the poignard going for his throat and they binded thrusting forward at each other the poignard snapped the gun back to full cock and alan took aim in the general direction and pulled the trigger the powder in the pan flashed but the gun hung fire the muzzle not three inches from the mans head the frenchman actually smiled as he leaped back devilishly quick on his feet before driving forward again lewrie held him off with the rapier going onto the attack to keep the poignard away he still held the gun pointed at the man hoping it would make up its mind to fire then they were almost chest to chest again and lewrie had to lower the pistol to deflect the poignard the gun went off the french officer grunted and fell backward all his strength gone the pistol had finally discharged in the mans groin quarter someone yelled in english give em quarter i say it was not that easy to turn aside the mens blood lust three marines ran past lewrie muskets held rightforward stabbing slaughtering broken men like rabbits alan leaned on the railing and became aware of a pain in his gun hand the frenchmans poignard had cut deep into his fingers on the butt as he had tried to fend off sure death from that dagger goddamn it give em quarter railsford was shouting stop that slowly the fight drained out of the men as they realized they had slaughtered and butchered from the forecastle to the after quarterdeck and that there were very few enemy left standing the ship was alive with cries of agony and terror and the screaming of those horses or mules continued from the first moment they had opened fire mister lewrie is that you railsford demanded coming toward his side of the quarterdeck aye mister railsford he shouted back through a cracked and dry throat take a party below and roust out the survivors lewrie found half a dozen marines and sailors and went from one compartment to another down into the orlop and the holds in search of those who had hidden from death they ran about ten men topsides whats below railsford asked him gun caissons limbers gun carriages looks like sixor ninepounder artillery sir lewrie said his hand throbbing now theres draft horses sir shot up and screaming toliver railsford called aye aye sir take a party below and put those horses out of their misery aye aye sir hollo whats happened to your hand cut it sir french officer over there with a dagger you go see dome then report right back to me hear aye sir the two ships were now lashed firmly together heading south on a soldiers wind on the beam as they tried to sort things out there was a hatch grating lashed to the bulwarks over which lewrie scrambled to his own ship still gripping the strange rapier he went below to the orlop and found surgeon dome busily cutting and sewing his leather apron awash in blood with gore up to the elbows there were few of the desperate present but plenty of unfamiliar faces on the deck were twisted in pain bide a moment mister lewrie dome said his head bare for once in the dancing light of the lanterns over the operating table made of chests he was removing the arm from a french soldier which had been shattered by grapeshot no cant help this one anymore lewrie come here anything wrong the soldier had died and was being lugged out by the loblolly boys to be tipped over the side without ceremony ah flex your fingers for me dome said peering at the cuts everything still works drink this there was a mug of rum barely cut by an equal mixture of water which alan drank down greedily dome sponged his hand with seawater got out his sewing kit and began to stitch the worst ragged tears while alan set his face in a mask life was full of pain anyone could tell you that and it had to be borne as best as one could without a show of fear men had been operated on for the stone had their limbs severed and never uttered a peep they knew that pain could be stood and once stood was over once you are through with that sir i have a pair of breeches need mending alan said tight y looking off into the middle distance at frenchmen in much more pain than he at least he hoped they were give it a week and youll be sewing yourself dome said there soak daily in saltwater which is an excellent prevention of suppuration the stitches will weep for a while but no lasting damage has been done hogan wrap this in clean cloth will you and you come see me if you have any discoloring or odorous discharge aye mister dome lewrie said happy to escape that place as another man was slung onto the table with both legs slashed open once hogan had bound his worstcut finger and wrapped a bandage around his whole hand alan went back on deck reeling from the drink he reported to railsford and was soon in charge of a working party hoisting out the dead horses the cook was slaughtering them and carving them into chunks of roughly four pounds apiece for fresh meat for each mess other teams were identifying desperates dead and wounded carrying them aboard for burial or surgery tipping dead or badly injured frenchmen over the side and shoving over offal from shattered bodies whole company of french infantry railsford said as dawn began to tint the eastern horizon and a battery of artillery going to the virginia colony not a corporals guard of them left virginia sir alan asked reeling once more this time with exhaustion as they labored to set the ship to rights for the prize crew to handle aye i thought we had that safe but things must be happening up north railsford told him theres a french officer left not for long that man over there in the green coat and red breeches war commissary corps to rocharnbeau and lafayette he makes it sound like the whole bunch of southern colonies has been stripped bare for some myor fight in the virginias an older french officer had been wounded in the belly and was propped up as comfortably as possible near the double wheel by his orderly who was sponging his brow he wont last lewrie said i know but hes full of information and cares little for keeping it to himself you understand french lewrie just barely sir theres a lot would go right past me well ill keep at it then railsford said god i wish we had our people here during the night the convoy of prize ships had plodded past the ship and desperate once amphon had assured herself that they had things in good order the larger frigate had given up half a dozen hands and a masters mate into desperate to help work her but this prize would require thinning out the crew further anything more you want me to do sir alan asked check the cargo manifests toss any drink over the side that the prize crew might be able to get to we shall have to get underway lewrie went aft under the poop to the masters cabins there had been some minor looting done and furniture was overturned but the glossy desk was still in good order lewrie opened drawerslntil he carne across the ships log manifests and daily books their ptjze was a merchantman owned by mulraix et fils bordeaux narned the ephegenie chartered by the royal war commissary on martinique and admiral degrasse to carry a full battery of artillery to rocharnbeau twentyfour stout european draft horses now mostly dead and soon to be dinner worth their weight in gold in the colonies compared to smaller nativeborn horses a line company of replacements for the regiment soissonois which explained the soldiers in white uniforms with rose facings a full artillery company of men in dark blue and buff both sorts also mostly dead there were stands of muskets for washington crates of swords bales of uniforms new boots and gaiters field tents horseshoe blanks and farriers equipage for lauzuns legion of dragoons over kegs of wine tons of biscuit and saltmeat a field bakery and wagon disassembled over two tons of sixpounder artillery cartridges and half a million rounds of musket shot premade into paper cartouches when the wine kegs were broached the hands groaned to see good red wine go cascading over the side cheatham took several kegs into desperate for issue at six toone dilution but the rest had to go no officer could keep order in a prize crew with such a temptation the sun was well up before the prize was rerigged well enough to sail for antigua or another british port alan made one last tour of the cabin to see if he had missed anything he probed into the transom settee lockers and found personal wine stocks there was also a wooden box with holes in the side holes in the lid which fit down inside the box like a winepress though alan didnt think the french master would squeeze his own grapes he fetched it out and found canvasbound packets wrapped up in ribbons like naval orders weighted down with grapeshot sewn into the canvas binders he read the first degrasse to rochambeau what sounded like a reply to a request of some kind full of all the flowery gilt and beshit compliments frenchmen were capable of agreement with plans fleet being assembled there was a second letter to washington also in french but of much the same tone lewrie hurried on deck to find railsford and quickly showed them to him railsford read closely his lips moving with the effort of translating a foreign language to himself have we found something important sir alan asked eager to have done something clever something arsesaving indeed we iulve railsford said almost clicking his heels as he bounced about the deck this degrasse bugger is going to sail north with a fleet to meet rochambeau and washington somewhere in virginia or delaware either delaware bay or the chesapeake and the rebels wont know it lewrie crowed oh theres probably half a dozen sets of these that have already gone north so one of them would make it through the patrols the lieutenant said but weve intercepted one and if we can get word to hood he might just be able to square degrasses yards before he gets anywhere with his plans get over to desperate and show these to the captain at jnce lewrie had not seen treghues for some time so he assumed that he was aft in his quarters he raced up to the marine sentry and was admitted with the usual ceremony of stamping slamming and shouting damn you dome hissed at the marine sentry lewrie whats the call for all this noise papers from the frenchman that the captain must see sir right then but make it quick dome pointed to the small cabin to the port side where treghues had a hanging bed box chest and dressing area shared with a sixpound gun lewrie stuck his head in and there was treghues in bed his chest bare and his head wrapped up in a bulky bandage his steward judkin was holding up a mug of watered wine for him to sip and lewrie caught the scent of fruit juices mixed into it treghues face was puffy and marred with a massive bruise on one side from scalp to jaw what is it treghues snapped not exactly cheered to see lewrie and obviously in some pain from a heavy blow to the head lewrie blurted out his news but treghues was off in his own little world from the injury or some medicine that dome had given him he could only rave and quote scripture about fornicators and absaloms rape of tamara and all through it cob lewrie for a miserable sinner of the worst stripe just thought youd like to know sir lewrie said and left the cabins knowing he was not going to get any sense through to the captain in his state he acts out of his wits lewrie said to dome in the passageway to the gun deck some french gunner laid him out with a rammer dome said i have given him laudanum to let him sleep best treatment for now i have good hopes he shall recover his senses in a few days let us pray he does lewrie said with a solemn expression that was expected but secretly was delighted him whom the lord loves he chastiseth he quoted to himself wryly pious bastard he reported back to railsford still holding on to the letters we must get word to antigua quickly railsford said after a long moment and if commander treghues needs further medical treatment he must have it soon desperate must go direct to english harbor the prize can catch up the convoy for safety and pass word to amphion regarding our discovery aye sir lewrie said handing railsford the packets i recall you have stood deck watches and run a schooner before mister lewrie aye sir alan replied beginning to quiver with joy i shall give you mister toliver an acting quartermasters mate and a dozen hands transfer the physically able prisoners to desperate where i can guard them the better the prize is yours thank you mister railsford might take your sea chest railsford suggested no dont think i want to get rid of you but you may be separated from the ship for some time and will need your things mind you id be proud to have you aboard after what youve accomplished but our captain may not see his way to being reconciled to your presence thank you mister railsford appreciate your good opinion of me alan told him and meant it appreciating such kindness from a man he had not overly cultivated on your way then an hour later ephegenie cast free of desperate and the frigate began to surge past her spreading her topsls and the hands tailing on the jears to raise her t gallants to the accompaniment of a fiddlers hauling chanty alan watched her go stout oak hull gleaming brown her wale a black curve at the waterline her gunwale streaked bright and jaunty green her taffrail carvings and gold leaf gleaming in the sun she was home for all her frustrations and she was leaving he got a lump in his throat at the sight of her i never realized that ships could be so beautiful he thought hard work and ruptures bad food and no sleep so complex and nothing goes a day without needing fixing but they can be so goddamned lovely well be back aboard again dont you fret sir toliver told him working on a quid of tobacco get the ship underway bosun lewrie ordered quartermaster lay her head sousou west halfsouth hands ta the braces toliver bellowed they braced her yards around first shorthanded as they were then went aloft and shook out reefs in her courses and topsls the convoy was ahead of them but not sailing fast with all plain sail they could catch them up by nightfall lewrie looked at his pocket watch eleventhirty in the morning time to think about feeding the men some of that fresh horsemeat before it spoiled he found a man that claimed he could cook a former waiter at an inn who had been caught poaching on his squires lands boiled horse an ammunition loaf of that fresh bread per man an onion watered wine and an apple to polish it off lewrie directed same for me ill take my dinner aft rum issue sir the cook asked mister toliver aye sir supervise the spirits issue if you please a pint of wine if theres no rum no rum sir toliver said i checked im sure you did lewrie smiled slightly carry on and dont give out more than a pint and make sure the dinner wine is mixed sixtoone i dont want to have to flog anyone for drunkenness aye sir the bosuns call piped and toliver shouted clear decks an up spirits and toliver lewrie said standing by the wheel with his hands in the small of his back watching the luff of the main course like a real watchofficer aye sir use the kid dont spit tobacco on my decks chapter ephegenie jogged along in convoy bound for antigua last in column behind the earlier prizes lights out had been piped and the offduty halfdozen had turned in with room to swing a hammock for once in the echoing lower deck toliver had the watch as the stars came out in a sultry tropical night it was getting on for hurricane season once more but for now the sea was calm enough and the wind was steady alan lounged in the masters cabin aft under the poop on the transom settee by the stern windows hinged open for a cooling breeze and relishing command he had fetched the convoy just at the beginning of the second dog watch had gone close aboard amphion and had shouted his news to captain merriam explained that desperate was dashing ahead to carry the news to hood and that he was to join the convoy alan burped gently appreciating the supper he had eaten boiled horse more fresh bread a good and filling pease pudding and a raisin duff their temporary cook had created he had opened a bottle of the french captains own wine and was slowly sipping at the last of it a most pleasant red from a st emilion vintner they were reefed down for the night with the main course taken in and the forecourse at two reefs two reefs in the topsls as well and fair weather at least until morning coinsilver lamps swayed over the desk at which he had dined making the spacious cabin seem like a palace there was a good carpet on the deck spread over painted canvas the paneling was glossy white with much gold leaf and the furnishings were exquisitely carved and detailed after a hammock it was going to be like sleeping in the palace at versailles even if he was going to doss down on the settee which was as wide and soft as any bed he had ever experienced this is what i should have to be rich enough to have fine things around me a whole house in london this nice a place in the country with a good stable of horses and if i do have to be aboard ship to have all this room and finery which of course wasnt going to happen he realized treghues would come out of his rantings and remember that he hated alan worse than cold boiled mutton and he would be casting about for another ship this time without sir onsleys immediate influence and there was always the possibility that he would be turned out of the navy and sent home or left to make his own way in the indies ways could be found reasons invented to ruin him if treghues really disliked him so much perhaps the best thing would be to go into another ship where he could start fresh with no prejudice against him alan sat up and finished his wine then walked out through the cabins for the quarterdeck restless and worried evenin mister lewrie toliver said knuckling his forehead evening mister toliver everyone dossed down aye sir watchandwatch ta antigua s gonna be a bitch sir but well cope right enough seems calm enough for now call me just before midnight for me to relieve you im going to turn in aye sir alan went back aft he blew out every lamp but one shucked his clothes and found a clean linen sheet for a cover to make his bed he also discovered the need to visit the quarter gallery privacy for his bowels was another luxury to which he was unaccustomed having to share the beak head roundhouse with the other inferior petty officers or the open rail seats if he was caught short but here the french master had a cabinet much like a regular jakes back home in a round quartergallery right aft under the larboard taffraillantems a spacious closet with a door he could shut windows above the shoulder to provide a view of the sea a small chest that held soft scrappaper for cleanliness a bucket of seawater for a steward to sluice down the seat and pipe which conveyed wastes overboard even a small lamp if the former captain felt like reading lewrie leaned his head back wearily watching the starlight play on the sea felt the ship ride beneath him with a steady reassuring motion he bumped his head gently on the deal panel behind him to the rock of the sea it sounded hollow he squirmed about and rapped on the walls to either side solid but right behind the necessary it sounded hollow once finished with his needs he fetched his dirk and began to thump with the pommel at the partition behind the seat there was more quartergallery below him for the officers mess set more forward than his but in the same turreted tower built into the side of the hull his disposal chute would pass aft of their seats partitioned off from view which meant that there was a room perhaps the size of the closet behind that hollow partition above the wardroom necessary he switched ends probing between the deal planks with the point of his dirk but with no success he went back to the day cabin and lit another lamp to improve his vision to the inboard side of the closet there was a tiny nick in the deal next to the day cabin bulkhead a fault in the wood and in the paint alan inserted his blade there pressed down on it there was a faint click that could have been the lamp swinging but when he pried with his blade the deal gave a little he pried more and it looked as if it might hinge outboard but he could not get it to move finally he leaned against it and felt something give like a latch letting go the entire panel behind the jakes swung outboard a square of perhaps three feet by three feet its edges masked by the wainscoting inside was a stout lining of oak perhaps six inches thick and in the space remaining there was an ironbound chest with a lock as large as a turnip hung on a hinged hasp lewrie took hold of the handles and pulled it forward it was fascinatingly heavy and gave off a faint metallic rustle lewrie staggered out of the quartergallery with the chest until he could drop the burden on the transom settee he rifled the desk and tried every key he found before discovering the one that fit the lock there was a welloiled clanking of the tumblers as the huge lock sprang open it was nearly as delicious an emotion to raise that lid as it was to lift a womans skirt once inside there was a wooden box on top that contained a fine set of dueling pistols which he set aside there were some letters mostly personal from the late captains family some orders from the firm of mulraix et fils but nothing of any import that he could discover with his poor command of french there was however a folded bit of canvas and thenthere was gold bags of it rolls of it little wooden boxes full of it with the amount and the denominations and nations of origin inked onto slips of paper tacked down to each parcel with wax or tied as labels to the bags there were spanish pistoles spanish dollars french livres and louis d or dutch guilders and danish kroner and there were sovereigns golden guineas twoguineas brightshining yellowboys in rolls and boxes and bags it was too much to be the late captains working capital for the voyage it was enough to purchase a dozen indiamen merciful god in heaven lewrie whispered in awe letting some loose coins trickle through his fingers he was not sure of the value of the foreign coins in comparison to the guineas but it seemed like an awful lot a most temptingly awful lot but sadly it was a devilishly heavy and unconcealable lot he left the gold and went forward to the doors to the quarterdeck listening to see if anyone had discovered him in the midst of his temptation the sight of all that gold made him open the masters wine cabinet and pullout a bottle of brandy he poured himself a large measure with shaky hands and went back to the chest there was a paper inventory stuck at the back of the chest altogether it seemed as if there might be over ј there if the foreign coin had the same value as the guineas he let the heavy coins trickle through his hands again and thought about it damned hard itd have lain there undiscovered except for me he reasoned not on the manifest not listed when we turned the ship over to the prize court some surveyor or shipyard worker would have found it if theyd have found it at all and none of this squadron would ever see a penny of it and some silverbuttoned whip jack or lardarsed landsman would go home richer than a chickennabob that settled in his mind he counted up the number of inferior petty officers in desperate and in the squadron that might share in this unbelievable bounty and came up with roughly eighty men to share јј apiece fair wages he decided but not the financial security he was looking for there was absolutely no way he could get that chest off the prize and ashore three men couldnt heft his seachest if he stored it in there it would be years perhaps before he returned to england to payoff and no way he could keep that much gold safely hidden for that long no prize agent ashore could be trusted not to peek and then questions would be raised as to where he had gotten so much foreign coin not to mention so many english guineas once a week for the last year and a half first captain bales then lieutenant kenyon and now commander treghues had read the articles out at divisions and by now alan could almost quote article eight verbatim no person in or belonging to the fleet shall take out of any prize or ship seized for prize any money plate or goods unless it shall be necessary for the better securing thereof or for the necessary use and service of any of his majestys ships or vessels of war before the same be adjudged lawful prize in some admiralty court but the full and entire account of the whole without embezzlement shall be brought in and judgment passed entirely upon the whole without fraud upon pain that every person offending herein shall forfeit or lose his share of the capture and suffer such further punishment as shall be imposed by a courtmartial or such court of admiralty according to the nature and degree of the offence that was pretty clear if they catch me id be flogged around the fleet rodney would have me hung up in tar and chains until my bones fall apart but he got to his feet and went to peer up at the poop deck skylight it was closed he listened intently for any sound from above scared someone like toliver might have been peeking on him he decided that all anyone could see from the best angle with the skylight shut was the forward edge of the desk not as far back as the transom settee and that dirty great chest he went back aft and sat beside the chest hefting several of the bags of gold coins he took up a rouleau of coins in his fist and pondered on the possible repercussions money is the root of all evil he recited remembering his nursery school days the catechism of good behavior that had been lashed into him at harrow and other schools one hundred twentyfive pounds is nothing to turn your nose up at but then neither is this little rouleau of oneguinea pieces that was ј he held in his fist equal his yearly allowance from pilchard and who knew how long that bequest would last and this small box that held two hundred twoguinea coins was worth ј he pawed through the contents setting aside rouleaus and boxes of mostly twoguinea coins quickly making up a sum of over call it a finders fee he told himself claiming a final roll of oneguinea coins he rose and went to his seachest which had been stored along the after bulkhead near the coach using his dirty shirt as a screen he opened the chest pawed down through his belongings to a secure depth and stashed his find emerging with a clean shirt that he made a great production of shaking out and inspecting for serviceability for the morning he closed his chest and went aft laying the shirt out on the desk this has to go he whispered staring at the inventory list he shredded it as he stepped out onto the stem gallery into the wind fed the tiny pieces into the wake hoping that they were too small to be legible if blown onto the poop deck or officers gallery below once back in the cabin he restowed the contents of the chest still a mindnumbing mass of yellow metal he checked carefully that there was no other accounting of the chests contents he read all the business and personal letters found no mention of the gold in any of them only then did he relock the chest and stagger back into the necessary closet with it sliding it back into its niche and closing the secret panel on it with a wooden click of hidden latches he slid the keys back into the desk then had to search it all for any paper that might explain the presence of the gold god was it mentioned in those papers railsford has he suddenly asked himself if it was money for rochambeau or lafayette de grasse would have mentioned it might have given an accounting alan had planned to accidentally discover the chest in the morning and take it over to amphion but now he was not sure if he pretended to find it and some of it turned up missing he would be blamed for any shortage in that case i should take more of the guineas he told himself what if no one ever finds it then nearly ј goes to waste until this ship is scrapped or lost no it was too much of a risk to take more especially foreign or largedenomination coins he could never explain and he could not discover it god how awful he thought what a hellish dilemma ive put myself in i should put those guineas back and hope for the best part of my legal share but he didnt of course stand by the anchor party lewrie shouted as ephegenie rounded up into the wind shorthanded as they were they barely sailed farther into english harbor than under the guns on the point a single jib standing and courses already brailed up and only one topsl set to draw wind she was sluggish to turn barely under steerageway but they were homefree back your topsl lewrie ordered keep her on the eye of the wind quartermaster no helm sir the man said idling the spokes of the wheel back and forth let go the bower cable roared out the hawse and the anchor splashed into the harbor let go braces and veer out a full cable done fine sir toliver said quietly in encouragement and alan felt a relief so great that it was almost like a sexual release for a week he had been nervous as a cat unable to sleep with the secret knowledge of the gold unable to relax with the prize so poorly manned afraid of making a mistake in managing the ship or losing her to a sudden squall they had run into rising winds for two days which had kept him wide awake and mostly on deck they had run through rain and the threat of foul weather until the skies had cleared and the trades had settled down to balmy behavior once more now ephegenie lay as still as a stone bridge in the lee of the capes her anchor firm on the bottom and a boatfull of dockyard men pulling strongly for them to take charge of her i never knew running a ship would be so hard alan confessed to toliver shorthanded as we were it was sir toliver said but with an assuring tone with a full crew its all claret an prize money we were fortunate alan flinched did he know average sort passage but i reckon wed have done just as good in a full gale sir busy damned place aint it what railsford carried to hood must have stirred up the fleet the harbor was working alive with rowing boats servicing the needs of the many warships anchored in the outer roads there were several ships of the line that alan knew had been based on st lucia to the south there were three rd rates in a row warping themselves out of the inner harbor up the row of pilings getting ready for sea an entire fleet of fourteen sailoftheline preparing for something and here was a midshipman with twenty dockyard hands from the admiralty court were they there to arrest him for theft the midshipman was elegantly turned out his breeches and waistcoat and shirt as white as a harnmockman could bleach them his mien serious and superior and alan recognized himself from times before with a grin who is in charge of the prize may i ask the midshipman asked with a lofty accent i am alan said firmly almost swaggering in his stained and faded uniform i expect you want the manifests and ships papers i have them aft very well the other man said he was a full man over twenty and possibly passed for lieutenant already or an aristocratic coxcomb too stupid to pass it much bother not after we took her lewrie shrugged hard fight alan led him to the masters cabins made generous with the claret while the other midshipman went through the papers has the desperate frigate come in alan asked casually is she still here i should like to rejoin my ship if possible yes shes here farther up the roads the midshipman said as he mumbled his way through the french manifests if you would sign this i shall take possession of the prize for the court of admiralty and you may leave her you may use my boat and crew to remove your people gladly much of a fight the other asked trying not to sound too curious but itching to know in spite of how much it might irk a company of line infantry from a french regiment soissonois a full battery of artillerymen plus her crew of course hot work for a while our captain wounded and already nearly forty hands short from other prizes alan said with ease as though it were an everyday occurrence therere big doings up in the americas might be a big land battle soon and hood seems to be getting ready to face degrasse too the other midshipman by then was looking crushed to be a shore stallion resentful of being denied the chance to live such a grand life is that all you need from me alan asked with a wave yes quite then i shall take my leave of you id like a brace of hands to help with my chest if you dont mind certainly the other said through pursed lips it was a delight to climb through the entry port and doff his hat to lieutenant railsford to see all the familiar faces back aboard to see his chest safely swayed up with a staytackle and thump to the deck without spilling gold or jingling welcome back aboard mister lewrie railsford said pleasantly how was your first real command hectic sir i dont believe i slept a wink he confessed good training for you were going north as eyes for the fleet hood himself received me already knew from admiral graves that something was up and was getting ready to sail for new york but our news was welcome nonetheless did we get all our people back sir alan asked as they went aft yes fortunately we shall need them and commander treghues recovering once he was lucid i explained what good service you had rendered but railsford shrugged at least he allowed me to rejoin alan said quietly after hood learned it was you discovered those secret papers he had little choice i wrote the report before dome would allow him to deal with ships business god bless you mister railsford alan said with feeling and wanting to watch the progress of his valuables below but forced to stay on deck now what about the gold what lewrie almost jumped out of his skin that french war commissary officer remember railsford said before he died he revealed that the prizes master had thousands in gold hidden in his cabins somewhere for rochambeau and lafayette in the cabins alan was about to faint in terror but i slept there i mean it was well hidden even the late colonel knew not where railsford went on bribe money to certain wellplaced rebel political leaders he said to give france influence enough to ask for one of the southern coastal colonies should the rebels succeed in their aims reward for all their help my word what a dirty business alan declared finding his wits at last i can see them taking british rorida but and you slept soundly and did not suspect a thing it might have been right underneath your head or other bodily parts alan thought how much did the man say before he passed over he did not have an accurate count but he believed it to be greater than fifty thousand pounds and ill lay you any odds you want that the admiralty court will have her tom down to a pile of timbers until they find it just think what our share will be even diluted by the other ships in sight when we took the prize god that is wonderful news mister railsford alan laughed in intense relief wiping his sweaty face i cannot tell you how good are you well mister lewrie touch of yellow jack again oh no sir just about done in with exhaustion though i tried to do too much i think couldnt bear to leave your first quarterdeck eh railsford smiled kindly should have let toliver handle her hes a good mate cant do it all yourself and you have to trust your people or youll wear and wonk yourself sick aye sir ive learned a good lesson from it best get below and have a bite while you can then were to sail in the forenoon all the way to new york to join admiral graves fleet and god knows where after that i shall do that sir and i thank you god bless blind shitten luck providence and all the saints including the welsh ones he rejoiced with a glee and sense of relief as intense as any he had ever experienced im safe safe and rich god help me ill never do such a thing again i swear on what little honor i might have left anchors hove short sir up an down alan stood by the larboard gangway ready to swarm aloft with his topmen and make sail all the fleet was hove short waiting for the signal to hoist anchors and be off all eyes on barfleur for word from the flag treghues the bosun and mr monk were pacing about the ship making a lastminute inspection to see that all was in order treghues glared at him briefly our bad penny has turned up again i see the captain said but a most lucky penny sir monk said with a grin all that gold he brought safe to us umm perhaps treghues softened slightly after all his eighth of a reputed ј would restore any familys fortune of itself he did not fully relent however lewrie was too large a sinner in his cold grey eyes for that and alan knew he would still get rid of him at the first opportunity to preserve the purity of his ships officers and his navy monk gave him a friendly tap on the arm as he went past once the captain could not see and the taciturn bosun actually smiled at him and alan knew that he had friends aboard still and he told himself they were off on a great adventure on the gun deck the marines and strongest men stood ready by the capstan bars the ships boys waited with their nippers to pass the lighter messenger from the capstan to the bower cable below hands were ready to handle the cable as it came in into the cable tier to dry and stink up the ship landsmen and waisters waited in their subdivisions by the jears to raise the topsl and royal yards by the halyards for the headsls by the sheets to draw down the leaches of the sails as they were freed there was a single bark in the outer roads from barjleur the signal gun to get underway and a signal pendant went up her mast heave on the capstan treghues ordered hands aloft and make sail drive em bosun the flags watching hands aloft trice up and layout music came from the boy band and the fiddlers not just in desperate but from every ship in the fleet the men breasted on the capstan bars and the pawls clanked as the bower cable came in anchors free the pawls began to rattle like a drum roll and the men ran the cable up and the nipperboys were a blur of activity to keep up as the smelly thighthick line came in loose topsls topsls jibs an spanker the entire bay thundered with the sound of canvas being whipped by the wind desperate began to payoff the breeze the halyards and the jears sighing through the blocks aloft while the sails were hauled down all about her little sloops of war frigates of the th rate cruisers and lineofbattle ships began to move and stir gathering way and avoiding each other with easy skill all aiming for cape shirley and beginning to take up cruising dispositions thousands of men hundreds of guns all bound in search of desperate battle hands to the weather braces haul away handsomely thus desperate leaned to the wind and began to drive along under full control once past the cape she hoisted tgallants and the men laid out on the yards to cast off the brails so she could take her position ahead of the fleet as one of the first eyes that would see the enemy she went hard to weather for her offing leading other frigates leading the liners of the rd and nd rate lay in from the yards another pull on the fore weather braces now belay every inch of that lewrie idled on the main topmast cap as the rest of his hands laid in and began to slide down the stays for the deck he looked aft to the west as the fleet rounded the cape in columns and beat to windward in the frigates wake in a moment he would descend to face once more commander treghues pious disapproval forresters enmity and the minddulling routine of a ship of war but for this brief pause he could watch all those proud ships form columns columns of the mightiest most intricate and demanding creations that mankind had ever had the wit to build he did not know what this fleet would face on its way north to the american colonies but he could not picture anything other than victory there was a possibility that he would not survive but he had faced risks enough before to know that life was full of chance he felt certain that he would see action more action than he could ever have imagined when reading about naval battles as a child and he was more curious than fearful as to what it might be like to see two gigantic flotillas trading broadsides he knew that he was on his way to a sight that if he survived it he would remember all the days of his life a chance for fame honor and glory amid all the horrors of a sea fight do i really hate this so much anymore he wondered dull as it can be some people think im good at the navy if all my other plans go for naught i could make a career of it i think no anything ive ever really liked or wanted ive lost i cant admit to any want of this or its gone too but i know my place here and theres some whove told me i do have a place maybe just until the wars ended and then i can concentrate on something more rewarding something not as depriving but ill go with fame and honor and not when they tell me darn me if i wont starboard watch below all hands prepare for divisions lewrie swung out and grabbed a stay for his descent he reclaimed his discarded hat from the larboard gangway from one of his topmen and stood by the rail drinking in the view of the island so green and the many bright azure colors of the ocean is this life really so bad he wondered shaking his head at his own rise of sentiment but would i have seen anything like this in london would i ever have learned anything back home half as fascinating as this well i may not be a real tarpaulin man yet but damme if they aint made some kind of sailor out of me he felt a surge of pride in himself he felt a tweak of pride in his service and he realized that for the moment he felt content and happy with himself and his station in life but then being alan lewrie he wasnt so sure that life would let him hold any such sentiment for very long
